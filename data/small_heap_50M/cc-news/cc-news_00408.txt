Former “ The Voice ” star Melanie Martinez is speaking out for a second time to deny allegations of rape from her former friend .
Martinez took to Twitter on Saturday to address the ongoing situation with fellow aspiring singer , Timothy Heller . Heller previously came forward on social media to allege that Martinez had performed sexual acts on her after two nights of her definitively saying “ no ” to her advances . Martinez doubled down on her denial of those allegations , and this time thanked fans for believing her side of the story .
“ I understand how hard it could be to see my side of the story , considering no one with a heart would want to invalidate anyone speaking up about this topic , ” she wrote on Twitter . “ I want to thank my fans who took the time to research the timeline , analyze past Instagram photos , and question the story being told , which reveal her false statements . I trust so many people in my life who took advantage of that trust for their own personal gain . Please know that my intentions with everything that I do in my life are always pure and I would never be intimate with someone without their absolute consent . ”
As previously reported , Heller came out with her story saying that she was inspired by the recent climate in showbusiness sparked by the ousting of Harvey Weinstein and the popular “ # MeToo ” movement on social media . Since she told her story , public opinion has been split on the matter . A little more than one hour after Martinez posted her second statement of denial , Heller responded .
“ This is why victims do n't speak up , ” she wrote . “ I would n't wish this upon anyone . ”
Hours later , she followed up on that Tweet after some concern and support from fans .
“ Last night was rough but id like to say , I do NOT regret speaking up , and it doesnt mean that you shouldnt . Just because this is hard , doesnt mean it wasnt the right thing to do . No one should be silenced , and I know that talking about this was an important thing to do . Ily guys . ”
New Delhi : The Committee of Administrators ( CoA ) chairman Vinod Rai on Tuesday welcomed the BCCI 's decision to host strife-torn Afghanistan for their first ever Test match , saying the game will be enriched by the participation of more teams .
`` I am delighted that the BCCI has agreed to extend a helping hand to Afghanistan and will formally welcome them into the Test arena by playing their first-ever Test , '' Rai said in a statement .
`` The game of cricket can be further enriched when more and more countries take part , '' he added .
The BCCI , in its latest Future Tours Programme ( FTP ) finalised at a Special General Meeting on Monday , announced that Afghanistan , a team that has made rapid strides despite the constant troubles back home , will play its first ever Test against India .
BCCI CEO Rahul Johri said he was looking forward to the historic clash , which will take place in the 2018-19 season , and further details of the match would be announced soon .
`` We have been working closely with the officials of Afghanistan Cricket Board and look forward to seeing history being made .
`` We are aware that fans from both the nations are eagerly waiting for the historic clash . The BCCI will work with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and announce the details shortly , '' he said .
The war-ravaged country had earned the Test status , alongside Ireland , this June , realising their five-day cricket dream after impressive performances in ODIs and T20 Internationals .
Besides welcoming them into five-day cricket , the BCCI has also extended a helping hand to Afghanistan on a number of occasions .
Afghanistan has hosted its home games in India , most recently the series against Ireland in Greater Noida .
Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi became the first set of Afghanistan cricketers to be bought at the IPL auction earlier this year and left a strong impression with impressive performances .

Well , I 'll be doggone , the Motown Mansion has finally sold .
The former home of Motown founder Berry Gordy , which has been for sale off and on since 2010 , was sold today to a Detroit native moving back to the city from San Francisco . The buyer 's identity was n't revealed .
The price was a cool $ 1.65 million , said real estate agent Deborah Smith .
Smith said the home fetched more than its asking price ( $ 1.59 million ) because homeowner Cynthia Reaves worked to restore much of the original architecture and structure .
“ Ms . Reaves found the right buyer to protect the legacy of this iconic home , ” said Smith .
The transaction represents the second biggest home sale in Detroit this year , said Smith . The largest was a penthouse in the Book Cadillac that sold for $ 1.79 million , she said .
The 10,500-square-foot residence is adjoined by a 4,400-square-foot pool house . A carriage house has its own apartment . They all sit on a 2.2 acre corner lot .
The home has 10 bedrooms , seven bathrooms and a five-car garage , said Smith . It features stain-glass windows , multiple fireplaces , black walnut paneling and a hand-crafted fountain .
The home was built for a lumber baron in 1917 . It was owned by Gordy in the late 1960s and Reaves bought it in 2002 .

EXPAND Fiona Apple 's `` Criminal '' Courtesy Vevo
I once walked into a sex shop lodged between a Goodwill drop-off and a Taco Bell and squeezed a pinch of pheromone-enhanced lotion into my palms . I nonchalantly took a whiff , and the exotic scent instantly unlocked a memory — or , I should say , a song : Fiona Apple 's `` Criminal . '' The scent was that of a stripper who came dangerously close to my nostrils one night in Hollywood , but what I remembered was the song she danced to , by the classically trained pianist who seduced all of America in 1997 when she sang `` I 've been a bad , bad , girl . ''
Twenty years later , `` Criminal '' is still a staple for the modernist stripper , or for the sex-positive feminist who refuses to be described as anything other than a dancer . In the process of creating this list , I spoke to several dancers , sex workers , feminists , gay men , married men and old college buddies . I was n't looking to repeat a list of Southern rap club bangers , cliched cock rock or country ; I wanted to be curiously taken aback by tunes that did n't reinforce stereotypes or pander to the penises in the front row .
7 . Bikini Kill : `` Rebel Girl ''
“ Rebel Girl ” dices sis male tropes into bitesized pieces . While most men at a strip do n't listen to the lyrics or hold degrees from Evergreen , they can probably appreciate this song . `` Rebel Girl '' inspires body movements that force men and women to stare , mouth agape , but never touch or judge . In a recent interview with the Guardian , singer Kathleen Hanna described herself as a `` punk rock stripper with sexual abuse counsellor training , '' which is fitting here .
6 . David Bowie : `` Young Americans ''
It 's likely that after Bowie died , an increasing number of dancers across the country were grooving snake-like around faux-gold flagpoles to the saxophone in `` Young Americans . '' I know of one woman , a regular at Jumbo 's Clown Room , who did this as a way of seducing the despairing and horny hipsters in her midst . The sexually charged sax and Bowie 's androgynous magnetism are ideal for expressing gender-neutral sexual experiences .
5 . Bruce Springsteen : `` I 'm on Fire ''
Springsteen advertised his masculinity with blinding clichés , particularly that aw-shucks small-town mechanic he aped so believably . And every older sister I knew insisted that Springsteen had a nice ass . So when he wrote a song about his desire to sleep with a married woman , it made us all sweat in our skintight Calvins — and long for the day that we might hear “ I 'm on Fire ” at a strip club .
4 . Huey Lewis and the News : `` It 's Alright ''
It 's been said , often , that Huey Lewis has a humongous penis . In other news , his a cappella Curtis Mayfield cover captures perfectly the white-boy-channeling-black-soul thing — without coming off as imposter . He counterbalances that with finger-snapping and doo-wop harmonies that seem directly ripped off from Bobby McFerrin 's `` Do n't Worry Be Happy , '' which is too kitschy for a dancer to tease you with . Lewis ' version , on the other hand , conjures a one-night stand . Someone told me they heard `` It 's Alright '' at Chippendales , which means it can be adapted to stupidly muscular construction workers , too .
3 . Fiona Apple : `` Criminal ''
There 's a noirish , old-Hollywood bent to Fiona Apple 's reimagining of the vixen as a `` bad , bad , girl '' who crushes the male ego . When she says `` I 'm feeling like a criminal '' in her deep voice , insisting that she needs to punished for cheating on her boyfriend , and that she ca n't stop , well , she reminds us just how deliciously lustful infidelity can be . Over the years , the naughtiness of the rumbling piano and Apple 's bluesy vocals have made it the ideal hipster stripper 's good-girl-gone-bad song .
2 . George Michael : `` Freedom ! 90 ''
A gay anthem that exemplifies the entirely American concept behind a nudie bar : to be free and leave any puritanical guilt at the door . George Michael sings `` But when you shake your ass , they notice fast , '' which in some contexts can be taken as a declaration to be sex-positive ( in other contexts , of course , it 's a cynical read on fame 's reliance on sex and beauty ) . The video made a darkly humorous statement about the music industry 's obsession with that particular brand of sex and beauty — in an era when America was allergic to such statements in music videos — which makes it the ideal strip club anthem .
1 . Michael Jackson : `` Give in to Me ( feat . Slash ) ''
Michael Jackson 's sexual orientation was up for debate the moment he started to look more feminine in the mid '80s . That did n't take away from his ability to write ultra-masculine pop songs with heavy metal riffs that , with the inclusion of Slash , turned MJ 's domination anthem into a meaner , BDSM pop classic saturated with earth-shaking power . I 've only seen male strippers dance to this , perhaps because it 's so overtly masculine and has , over the years , become a gay hard-rock anthem . And make no mistake : THIS IS HARD ROCK . It 's MJ 's most forcefully sexual song , which is at once disturbing and romantic .
He started his music career on Youtube and went on to give fans the party anthem of 2015 with Baaki Baatein Peene Baad . From then on Arjun Kanungo has been displaying his versatility as a singer and performer with songs like Fursat , Ek Dafaa and Gallan Tipsiyaan . The singer most recently collaborated with Coke Studio Pakistan sensation Momina Mustehsan for the song Aaya Na Tu . As of now , the song has crossed over 20 million views on Youtube and counting . Talking about the huge response received by the song Arjun told News18.com , `` It 's amazing that within a week of its release the song crossed over 15 million views . I 'm excited about the response . It 's unbelievable , I did believe in the song but never thought it will reach this huge number in such a short span . `` On being asked how he came up with the idea of collaborating with Momina for the song , he says , `` I came up with the song and Momina 's suggestion came from the Universal Music . They suggested that I should do a collaboration with her and after listening to her work , I thought her voice fit in the composition . Then I met her and everything worked out for good . `` The song has been getting love from fans in India as well as listeners in Pakistan . Elaborating more on his idea of contributing with the Pakistani singer , he says , `` I am very proud Indian but I did n't compose the song looking into this angle . I feel that music is something that should unite people . It should be about love and unity . Art , in general , has to be above politics . The song is not about India-Pakistan relation , it 's just two people from different countries doing a collaboration . `` `` She was just the best fit for the song . In a way it 's nice that people from both the countries are liking and appreciating the song , '' he further adds.Arjun feels music has the power to mend bridges and gives a creative space to the music creator as well as to the listener . `` Music is a culture in itself . We go to it when we want peace and express our creativity . For me , it 's my purpose . Music has given me a really good reason to live . I also think it also lets me express myself to people in a way which I ca n't do with words , '' he says.In a digital age , when everybody has the chance of posting any content online , Arjun stands by the right of free speech and expression . He does n't think there 's a need for a filter on who can create content and who can not . `` Freedom of expression trumps everything . I understand some people misuse the platform but the internet has its own regularisation for such people , '' he says.Sharing his thoughts on the 'meme culture ' and 'viral content ' on Internet , he says , `` I do n't think it 's that easy to go viral . People try very hard to make a mark in the minds of so many people . It 's not easily repeatable . Though , people with no talent going viral have an unstable business model . With no talent involved , people tend to forget about you soon enough . In the end , even controversial content needs talent in any form to survive . `` The singer is currently busy with his debut film , the details of which are yet to be revealed . He 's also planning to release more singles in the coming months .

Will Netflix suffer a significant subscriber exodus once Disney movies roll off the service in 2019 ? According to one Wall Street firm 's analysis : probably not .
Disney announced last week that it would not renew the movie-output deal with Netflix for first-run Disney and Pixar titles in the U.S. — and instead would launch its own Disney-branded streaming service starting with 2019 releases . That sent Netflix shares tumbling , as investors feared the move represented a growing sentiment by Hollywood studios to not play ball with the disruptive internet player .
But while the Disney deal appears to be a high-profile loss , it should have minimal effect on total subscriber churn , according to Piper Jaffray & Co. analysts Michael Olson and Yung Kim . They conducted a survey of 538 Netflix U.S. customers last week , and found that only one-fifth spend more than 10 % of the total Netflix viewing time watching Disney content .
“ We believe essentially none of the other 80 % of subs , who spend 10 % or less of their time on Netflix watching Disney , will be compelled to cancel due to loss of Disney content , ” the analysts wrote . The only subgroup that may be at risk of bailing on Netflix over the absence of Disney movies are those who said at least 40 % of their Netflix time is allocated to Mouse House titles — which are less than 5 % of all streaming customers .
“ We recognize the strength of [ the Disney ] content , particularly for younger children , ” the analysts wrote in a research note Monday . “ However , we believe Netflix can license similar genre content from other sources and/or use the cost savings for original programming . ”
Netflix pays about $ 200 million per year to Disney . That sounds like a lot , but it 's only around 3 % of Netflix 's total projected content budget of $ 7 billion in 2017 .
Meanwhile , Netflix may reach a deal with Disney about for Lucasfilm 's “ Star Wars ” and Marvel Entertainment titles post-2019 : Chief content officer Ted Sarandos , in an interview with Reuters , said the company is in active discussions for those rights .
And even as Netflix has either lost or abandoned licensing deals ( as when it dropped Epix movies in 2015 ) , it 's spending more and more on original productions . That includes the bombshell deal with Shonda Rhimes — ending her 15-year partnership with Disney-owned ABC Studios — that Netflix just announced , and its acquisition of Millarworld , the comic-book publisher behind “ Kick-Ass ” and “ Kingsman. ” The company is targeting 50 % of its spending to go toward originals in the next few years , versus around 20 % in 2016 .
“ Netflix is likely already in the process of determining how to effectively reallocate funds previously earmarked for Disney on new and unique programming , ” the Piper Jaffray analysts wrote , noting that it has almost 18 months to plan for the change .

Salem officials refused Wednesday to fully explain why they waited four days to tell residents they had discovered toxins in the city 's drinking water over the holiday weekend .
Cyanotoxins in Salem 's water were confirmed by an out-of-state lab Saturday , but city officials did n't tell the public , or issue a do-not-drink advisory , until Tuesday afternoon
.Advisory : Salem drinking water contaminated , children should n't drink tap water
The toxins stem from an algae bloom at Detroit Lake , where Salem and other nearby communities have gotten their water for decades . Cyanotoxins can cause allergic reactions , respiratory issues and severe illnesses such as liver and kidney damage .
Since the alert went out warning that toxin levels were high enough to harm young children and medically fragile adults , residents have expressed outrage over the delay , both at public meetings and on social media .
Among them is Allyson Wise , almost 8-months-pregnant , who worried her baby 's health may have been placed in jeopardy .
`` It frustrates me that city officials appeared to know about the elevated toxin levels for a number of days , but only chose to alert people on the evening of the 29th , '' she told the Statesman Journal .
Q & A : 11 questions answered on Salem 's water warning
Behind the delay was advice the city received from the Oregon Health Authority .
Casey Lyon , technical services unit manager for OHA drinking water services , pointed to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines allowing for a 10-day buffer period that lets the city make treatment adjustments to fix the water . After 10 days , the build up of toxins becomes more serious .
Lyon said he understood the city was poised to post a health advisory , but he recommended against it because it might spark unnecessary panic . He told them about the 10-day buffer period .
In a press conference Wednesday , Greg Walsh , the city 's emergency preparedness manager , said , `` So they advised us , they said , 'Hey , we have a couple days , Let 's not jump the gun . Let 's make sure we have all the results that we need to make an informed and appropriate decision on this . ' ''
Watch : City of Salem holds press conference on Salem water alert
But Walsh acknowledged officials did not receive additional results between Sunday and Tuesday . `` No , sir , we did not , '' he said .
And officials did n't address the issue of residents being exposed to the toxins for four days after they exceeded safe levels for children younger than 6 years old and vulnerable adults , including those with impaired immune systems or kidney and liver disease .
The situation actually goes back to May 23 when city officials issued a press release assuring residents the city 's tap water was still safe to drink even though the Oregon Health Authority had sent out an advisory for Detroit Lake because of the algae bloom .
`` While there is a health concern at Detroit Reservoir , there is no concern with the city 's water treatment facility , the quality of our source water , or our community 's drinking water , '' city officials said in the release .
In defense of the statements , city spokesman Kenny Larson said Wednesday , `` That press release was sent out to avoid alarm at the time . We did n't believe that the water was an issue . ''
Tuesday 's drinking water alert has spurred a massive run on bottled water throughout Salem .
Walsh said the city has been working with private and public partners to assemble a water distribution network .
`` If we get results ( Thursday ) and the advisory continues , then we will instantly activate points of distribution for water , '' he said .
Possible distribution sites have not been announced .

The Latest on an Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history ( all times local ) :
3:45 p.m .
An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history has been charged with manufacturing armor-piercing bullets .
A complaint says unfired armor-piercing bullets found inside the Las Vegas hotel room where the attack was launched on Oct. 1 contained the fingerprints of ammunition dealer Douglas Haig of Arizona .
The complaint filed Friday in federal court in Phoenix says Haig did n't have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition .
He was charged shortly before holding a news conference Friday . He said he noticed nothing suspicious when he sold 720 rounds of ammunition to Stephen Paddock in the weeks before the attack that killed 58 people .
Haig is a 55-year-old aerospace engineer who sold ammunition as a hobby for about 25 years .

11:50 a.m .
An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history says his one-time customer did n't raise suspicions that he planned to commit any crimes .
Douglas Haig said at a news conference Friday that he met Stephen Paddock at a Phoenix gun show in the weeks before the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people .
The sale was later completed at Haig 's home in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa .
Haig was named as a `` person of interest '' in the investigation .
But a law enforcement official has since told The Associated Press that he is n't believed to have committed a federal crime or to have had any knowledge of the attack .
The official was n't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity .

An Arizona man plans to speak out about his experience in selling ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history .
Douglas Haig is scheduled to hold a news conference Friday in Chandler to discuss his sale to Stephen Paddock .
This week , Haig said he could n't detect anything wrong with Paddock .
Haig was named as a `` person of interest '' in the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people .
But a law enforcement official has since told The Associated Press that Haig is n't believed to have committed a federal crime or to have had any knowledge of the attack .
The official was n't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity .
It 's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack .
REUTERS : A car ploughed into the outdoor terrace of a pizzeria in the small town of Sept-Sorts east of Paris on Monday , killing a 12-year-old girl and injuring several other people , a French Interior Ministry spokesman said .
He said the driver had been arrested and the early indications were that this was not an act of terrorism .
`` I can not tell you that terrorism has been discounted , but it is not the leading line of inquiry at this point . The first indications do n't point towards terrorism , '' spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told BFM TV .
He described the man as a `` depressive '' and said he was about 30 years old .
Officers from the national gendarmerie put up a security cordon around the scene and urged the public not to hinder their operation .
A photograph published on social media showed a grey BMW car surrounded by upturned tables in the outdoor seating area of a restaurant . Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the image .

Earlier , BFM TV gave the dead girl 's age as eight .
The incident occurred less than a week after an Algerian national was arrested on suspicion of deliberately ramming a hire car into a group of soldiers on a patrol in the Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret , injuring six of them .
The soldiers were part of Operation Sentinel , launched in the wake of Islamist attacks in Paris in early 2015 . The Levallois-Perret attack was the 15th on troops and police in the last two-and-a-half years , many of them Islamic State-inspired .

The firearm and ammunition industry is doing quite well across the country although Connecticut 's gun business is not part of that growth , a new study shows .
The National Shooting Sports Foundation 's annual report on the economic impact of the firearm and ammunition industry shows Connecticut 's industry slowing and losing jobs while the rest of the nation is growing .
Among the findings are that , nationwide : the overall contribution to the economy increased from $ 49.3 billion to $ 51.3 billion in 2016 ; the industry generated $ 6.8 billion in business and excise taxes last year ; and manufacturers , distributors and vendors of guns and ammunition employ over 141,000 people , with close to 160,000 additional jobs in supplier and ancillary industries .
More generally , the economic impact of the industry between 2008 and 2016 increased from $ 19.1 billion to $ 51.3 billion , a 168 percent hike .
“ It really is unprecedented nationwide growth , ” Jake McGuigan , senior director of state affairs for the NSSF , said Monday .
The number of firearm background checks initiated through the FBI 's National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) has soared from under 9 million in 2005 to over 27 million by 2016 .
Although these figures do n't correspond exactly with the number of firearms sold ( NICS checks are done for other reasons besides sales ) but , because these checks are required before a firearm may be acquired legally from a licensed firearm dealer , they are a fairly reliable indicator of sales , McGuigan said .
At the same time , the number of National Firearms Act ( NFA ) firearms processed in applications by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) has increased steadily each year , from 147,484 in 2005 to 1,426,211 in 2015 , a close to 10-fold increase .
Another indicator of the strength of the Second Amendment community , the annual growth in the number of persons with concealed carry permits continues to set records , with 1.73 million new concealed handguns permits issued in 2015 .
According to the Crime Prevention Research Center , this represents an increase of 215 percent since 2007 – even with an increasing number of states moving towards permitless carry laws .
However , the trends for the gun industry nationally have n't carried over to Connecticut .
Connecticut had 2,126 people working directly for a firearm or ammunition manufacturer and 1,100 suppliers working in some aspect of the gun industry in 2016 , according to the NSSF report . There are another 1,690 indirect jobs as a result of the industry . Collectively , the 4,916 employees tied to the industry generate about $ 1.245 billion in economic activity in Connecticut , according to the report .
But those numbers are significantly lower than before Dec. 14 , 2012 , when a 20-year-old gunman fatally shot 20 first graders , as well as six educators in Newtown .
In 2013 , the NSSF said the gun industry in Connecticut was a $ 1.9 billion business , with more than 8,000 direct and indirect workers .
After the Sandy Hook massacre Connecticut lawmakers , at the urging of Gov . Dannel P. Malloy , passed several gun control measures , including requiring background checks for private guns sales and an assault weapons ban that includes more than 100 firearm models . It also banned large capacity magazines .
“ States that are friendlier to the industry and the 2nd Amendment , such as Texas , Florida and North Carolina have successfully lured gun business away from Connecticut , ” McGuigan said .
McGuigan said the NSSF believes law-abiding gun owners unfairly became targets in Connecticut after the Sandy Hook shooting .
The industry lost about $ 700 million in economic output over last five years , according to NSSF 's numbers .
In-state wages are down 36 percent and the amount of state taxes paid is also down 37 percent , according to the NSSF .
A separate document provided by NSSF with the statistics about Connecticut 's gun industry is titled “ The Malloy Economy : CT Closed for Business . ”
Asked if Malloy 's recent announcement that he will not seek another term will revitalize gun business growth in the state , McGuigan said he doubted it .
“ I just do n't think there is an appetite for gun friendly business growth in Connecticut ” McGuigan said , stating the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings is , unfortunately , an issue that will continually dog law-abiding gun owners long after Malloy is out of office .
McGuigan added that gun owners continue to be a target in Connecticut , noting that one of the items in Malloy 's proposed budget is an increase in the state portion of the pistol permit fee from $ 70 to $ 300 and the initial 5-year pistol permit fee from $ 140 to $ 370 .
“ Quadrupling the permit fee . Outrageous , ” McGuigan said .
There is some silver lining for the gun industry in the state , however .
West Hartford gunmaker Colt 's Manufacturing is getting $ 23 million in state support to expand operations at its West Hartford manufacturing facility .
Malloy and Colt CEO Dennis Veilleux announced on March 24 that Colt is buying its West Hartford armory on New Park Avenue and expanding operations . Colt currently employs about 600 .

Officials said the state assistance will help fund Colt 's $ 13 million purchase of its manufacturing facility and land at 545-547 New Park Ave. , adjacent to ALDI Market and BJ 's Wholesale .
The state will also be giving Colt a $ 10 million loan to add 100 jobs over the next five years .
“ This means hundreds of good paying manufacturing jobs for the people of our state , ” Malloy said in a press release . “ Colt is an industry leader whose brand is recognized worldwide . The company was founded nearly two centuries ago here in Connecticut , and this planned expansion will ensure that they remain headquartered here . ”

Protesters oppose immigration act 287 ( g ) in Collier County
Protesters say the time to speak up is now over the increase of hate crimes in our nation .
“ I believe it 's wrong and I 'm here to let the sheriff know that we will not stand for 287 ( g ) , we demand an end to 287 ( g ) , ” said Angela Cisneros whis is just one of a dozen chanting for change an end to the 287 ( g ) program in Collier County , “ In the anti-immigrant climate that we 're in , that should not be happening ”
The program allows law enforcement to check the immigration status of those they arrest .
The Collier County Sheriff 's Office says the goal of the program started in 2007 is to keep you safe .
Over the last decade law enforcement has had about 6,000 immigrant cases and 38,000 crime violations .
Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk said , “ A significant number of those 38,000 kinds of crimes include from violent felony crimes such as murder , rape , human smuggling , drug trafficking , sex crimes involving children , victims and many more . ”
But still , many people oppose it saying it causes many immigrants to live in fear , that the program incriminates immigrants and is using too many tax dollars , and is affecting our next generation .
Araceli Gomez is a social worker who meets with undocumented immigrants , everyday , “ We 're creating adults who are going to have issues with anxiety , with pressure , with separation anxiety , with under performance with how mental health is impacted today . ”
And with all the concerns , the sheriff 's office addressed people today , saying the program is n't racially biased and is intended to catch real criminals .
The program has withstood legal challenges to date . It 's a jail based program that determines lawful presence .

Boxing 's bad boy , Mike Tyson , will swap the ring for the stage when he launches the reinvention of his one-man show in Las Vegas .
“ Mike Tyson : Undisputed Truth - Round 2 ” will debut Sept. 7 for a limited engagement at the MGM Grand . The show has its roots in a 2012 Broadway run but with an updated , stand-up vibe . “ It 's all about entertainment : Look at how I used to be and how I am now , ” Tyson said in an interview .
When the former heavyweight boxing champ takes the stage in Brad Garrett 's Comedy Club , he wo n't necessarily have the crowd in fits of laughter . Tyson will share painful and funny stories about his controversial past , including the three years he served in prison after being convicted of rape in Indiana in 1992 .
Mike Tyson returns to the Vegas stage with an update on his `` Undisputed '' one-man show . ( Jerry Metellus )
“ That 's what this is all about , to think that I was that guy , ” he said . “ That 's , wow , because in my 30s , I was worried about myself . I ca n't believe I was that kind of guy . ”
Tyson also share times in his life that many may not know about . For example , after his retirement from boxing in 2005 a photojournalist named Dale Hausner came to interview him .
“ All of a sudden , a whole bunch of FBI guys surround my gym and ask me ‘ do I know this guy , ' ” Tyson recalled . A federal agent then told him that Hausner was wanted for a series of murders in the Phoenix area . ( Hauser later killed himself while on death row in Arizona . )
Tyson said he now laughs about the encounter with a serial killer , but quickly added , “ It was n't funny to me when he [ the FBI agent ] said it . ”
Tyson , at age 20 , was the youngest heavyweight boxing champ in the world when he beat Trevor Berbick in 1986 . He simultaneously held heavyweight titles in three boxing organizations . In 1992 , he was convicted of rape and went to prison .
Tickets start at $ 54.95 plus taxes and fees . A VIP Knockout Package for $ 250 includes a meet-and-greet and a souvenir photo .

Vin Diesel ‘ s latest role : “ The Slow and the Studious . ”
Nearly 30 years after leaving Hunter College without a degree , the brawny actor was awarded an honorary Ph.D. as he gave the school 's commencement speech at Radio City Music Hall on Wednesday .
The “ Fast & Furious ” franchise star was born Mark Sinclair in California , but grew up in the Big Apple — living first in Washington Heights , and then later in Brooklyn . He attended Hunter for three years in the 1980s before leaving early to pursue his acting career in Hollywood .
“ While I was in Hollywood I always had this pride of Hunter College , ” the star told a crowd of about 1,800 students , pacing the stage in Hunter-purple academic regalia .
“ I would tell everybody that I learned and took so much away from my experience at Hunter College : I was young , I was a bouncer , when I was n't bouncing I was in these classrooms with the most diverse student body on the planet . ”
Diesel , who identifies as biracial , said that pride kept him going as he was turned down for parts due to his skin tone .
“ Nobody was hiring a multicultural kid . You can imagine a movie like ‘ Glory , ' ” he said , referring to the 1989 Civil War drama . “ Who are they going to hire you to play ? Denzel 's part or Matthew Broderick 's part . The world was n't ready yet . ”
He described how he “ had to come back to the bouncing job in New York City with my tail between my legs ” because he could n't book any parts in Hollywood .
“ And all the bouncers were saying , ‘ Oh , I thought you were going to be a big movie star . ' And I had to sleep on couches . And I had to come up with another way , ” he said .
Using the creative-writing chops he gained at Hunter , the one-time English major penned his own screenplays , including 1995 's “ Multi-Facial , ” which deals with the biases multiracial actors face during auditions .
He got his big break when Steven Spielberg saw the short and wrote the part of Private Caparzo in 1998 's “ Saving Private Ryan ” specifically for Diesel .
“ We 're strivers , ” he said of Hunter grads . “ We can overcome anything . You learn that here and you take into the world . And then you can look at Hollywood and change the face of Hollywood . You can literally change the face of Hollywood because of that dignity and pride and willingness to fight . ”
School president Jennifer Raab congratulated the actor as he received a Doctor of Humane Letters in English .
“ You have proved that a smart , determined kid from the streets of New York can make his way to the top , ” she said .
Since Saturday morning , 69-year-old Judy Williams has wrestled with questions about her grandson , Zackary Yashkus .
She does n't know how her grandson could have taken the life of his ex-girlfriend , Sharae Thompson and their son , Xander , in a double murder-suicide that has shocked the region .
“ I swear on my mother 's grave he loved his child more than life , ” she said . “ I do n't have answers ... I really think in his mind that was the only way that the three of them would be together . ”
Yashkus , 23 , shot and killed Thompson , 21 , outside the home at 347 McLean St. in Wilkes-Barre where Thompson lived with their son , police said in a news release .
Yashkus drove off with the boy on Interstate 81 north , pulled off the interstate onto the median in Pittston Township and shot the child , police said . Yashkus then shot and killed himself , according to police .
Williams had a close relationship with Yashkus and even closer one with her great-grandson , Xander , 3 , taking care of him at her Wilkes-Barre home for most of his life .
“ I loved Xander more than life itself , ” she said . “ I taught him everything . ”
Williams and Xander planted tomatoes in the summertime , and the boy looked forward to picking them . Despite his age , he wanted to help around the house — Williams said she even had to buy him a little scoop because he insisted on helping her clean up the yard when she took her dog for a walk .
“ He always wanted to learn and figure out what you were doing , ” she said . “ He was such an inquisitive kid . ”
Xander 's inquisitive mind , Williams said , likely came from his father . She said Xander “ lit up ” at any mention of his father , talked about him constantly and looked forward to seeing him .
Williams said Yashkus lived with her while he was a student at GAR High School .
“ He was the brightest kid , high honors , ” she said . “ He wanted to make something of himself . He was always on the computer , doing homework . He wanted to do something with his life . ”
After high school , Williams said Yashkus moved to Kingston with his mother .
“ He ended up losing focus , ” she said . “ It was about that time that he met Sharae ( Thompson ) . ”
Williams watched the relationship between Thompson and Yashkus from the outside .
“ Things were good in the beginning , ” she said . “ Then , I do n't know , Zackary just started changing . ”
Williams said Yashkus loved Sharae , and when she had Xander , wanted the three of them to be a family .
Yashkus had a history of violence , at least some of it directed at Thompson , according to court records and news archives .
Yashkus was charged with felony aggravated assault in February 2012 , when he was 18 .
In that case , police alleged that Yashkus slashed the throat of his then-girlfriend , who was 17 , leaving a 5-inch scar .
The charges were dismissed after the victim , later identified as Thompson , refused to testify at Yashkus 's preliminary hearing .
Williams said she spoke with Yashkus at length after that incident . She said he threatened suicide then , devastated by how much he had hurt Thompson .
Yashkus became especially distant in the week before the fatal shooting , Williams said .
“ He was posting , not things that you would know something was happening , but out of his norm , ” she said . “ Mothers just know . You know when something 's wrong . ”
She was drinking coffee in her kitchen when another relative , who lives next door , came over to deliver the news of what had happened .
“ He had this look on his face , ” she said . “ Like this panic ... he just shook his head . ”
She stared out at the faces of her family and three men in shirts and ties and ran upstairs , calling for Xander , hoping he was asleep in his bed at her house .
He was n't .
“ When he told me , he knelt down in front of me and he said ‘ there 's been an accident , it was Sharae and Zackary , ' ” she said . “ I said ‘ No , not Xander , ' ”
Now Williams said she is searching for answers . She wishes Yashkus had talked to someone .
Later that day , Williams said police asked to see a safe box Yashkus had kept under a bunk bed at her house without her knowledge . Inside , authorities and the family found a will Yashkus wrote in 2015 .
“ Nobody knew anything , ” Williams said . “ None of this fits in . ”
Williams has had family and friends at her house and her phone “ ringing off the wall ” since Saturday morning . Her voice cracks when she thinks of baby Xander .
“ I do n't know how I 'm going to do this , ” she said . “ I want him ( Xander ) , I want to give him a bath and put his sticky letters up on the tub . He just learned how to do his sleeve when he put his coat on and he was so proud of himself . ”
Williams said she has felt conflicted and heartbroken in the past few days .
“ I would see stories on TV and my heart would break and now it 's me , ” she said . “ I miss Zackary popping into my house all the time ... I just wish he would have talked to somebody . He bottled it up inside ... he was not a bad person , he was not . ”
Attempts to reach friends and relatives of Thompson were unsuccessful Monday night .

Of course people should n't park their cars on the city 's parkways , the often grassy strip of land between the sidewalk and the street curb . Planting cars on the parkways is ugly , destructive to public infrastructure and , because the cars drive over or block the sidewalks as well , dangerous for pedestrians using the public walkways .
Yet for five years , L.A. leaders have allowed the practice to flourish , essentially turning much-needed green space into parking lots and forcing walkers to share the sidewalk with vehicles . It 's time to start ticketing rogue parkers again and return the sidewalks to the public .
This being Los Angeles , the reason for the parkway parking debacle is a combination of competing priorities , lawsuits and bureaucratic delays .
In 2011 , the city was facing several lawsuits accusing Los Angeles of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to maintain the sidewalks in a safe condition and by allowing people to park in driveway aprons — the sloped space between the sidewalk and street — potentially impeding disabled people trying to use the walkway . In response , the city began ticketing cars parked in the aprons . Residents were furious that their longstanding practice was suddenly unlawful .
The City Council sided with the residents and directed the Department of Transportation to stop issuing tickets . But the order went further , applying to cars parked on the parkways , which the city defined as both the apron and the strip of land between the sidewalk and curb .
It was supposed to be a temporary halt in enforcement while the city drafted separate rules for parkways and driveway aprons . But five years later , parkways that once were grassy have been flattened and rutted by tires . Some building owners have even installed pylons and posts to block cars from driving up onto sidewalks and parkways in search of parking space . And city leaders still have n't adopted new guidelines .
There 's no excuse for a delay this long . Los Angeles is supposed to be in the midst of a transformation into a more livable and walkable city . Mayor Eric Garcetti and the City Council are spending $ 30 million a year to repair broken sidewalks ( thanks to those ADA lawsuit settlements ) and millions more to turn moribund corridors into revitalized “ Great Streets. ” They 've committed to ending traffic fatalities , which often means pedestrians getting hit by cars . Yet the city is still letting cars drive on the sidewalks and park on the parkways .
Yes , parking is difficult in some neighborhoods , particularly those built before car ownership became the norm and parking spots were required in new developments . Some communities have far more cars than legitimate parking spots , making the search for a space time-consuming and anxiety-producing . But that 's no reason to turn precious green space and walkways into parking lots .

JAKARTA : Health authorities in Jakarta kicked off a special immunisation programme on Monday to rein in an `` extraordinary '' outbreak of diphtheria that has sparked concerns about the Indonesian capital 's readiness to host the Asian Games next June .
Diphtheria cases have spiked 42 percent since last year , health officials say , with at least 32 deaths and more than 590 cases recorded across the archipelago , the bulk of them in densely populated Jakarta and neighbouring provinces .
`` If we have an extraordinary event like this , it might mean the Asian Games would not be a success and that could become a burden for us in the health department , '' Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan told reporters at the programme launch .
Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that spreads through close physical contact or through the air and can be fatal . Symptoms include fever and a sore throat , and the airway can sometimes become blocked .
On Monday , dozens of mothers lined up for their toddlers to receive free jabs at a clinic in west Jakarta . The program will be rolled out to other provinces in coming weeks .
Experts said the vaccination programme was necessary and well-timed because of the risk of the disease spreading out of control at an event like the Asian Games , which is expected to draw hundreds of athletes from dozens of countries .

`` Events like that have mass gatherings that make it easy for the disease to spread , so it is important now to provide as much ( immunisation ) coverage as possible , '' said Dr. Vinod Bura , the acting representative of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) in Jakarta .
Worrying signs that the disease might spread included rejection of vaccinations by some people and a lack of access to healthcare , health officials and experts said . `` There are those who say ( vaccination ) is not good , but we must emphasize that this is beneficial , '' Health Minister Nila Moeloek said at the launch . `` If the benefits outweigh the disadvantages , this is a necessity . ''
Rates of diphtheria in Indonesia are among the world 's highest , along with India and sub-Saharan African countries , even though vaccinations have helped reduce global cases over the past 30 years .
The WHO recorded about 7,000 cases around the world last year , down from 100,000 in 1980 .

Controversial plans which could see newspapers landed with opponents ' legal costs even if they win in court are an attempt to `` blackmail '' the press into signing up to a `` state-sponsored '' regulator , Sun editor-in-chief Tony Gallagher said .
Ministers are consulting on whether to implement the measure , which Mr Gallagher said was `` insane '' and went against the principles of natural justice .
But phone hacking victim and former Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames said the public wanted the press to be independently regulated and it would be a betrayal if the full package of reforms introduced after the Leveson Inquiry was not brought into effect .
Ms Hames has launched a legal challenge to the Government 's consultation , which will look at whether to press ahead with implementing Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 .
This measure would see newspapers which are not signed up to an officially-recognised regulator pay their own and the plaintiff 's legal costs , even if they were successful in court .
The consultation , which ends on January 10 , is also examining whether to go ahead with the second part of the Leveson Inquiry , which would look at wrongdoing in the police and press .
Mr Gallagher said part two of Leveson would be `` essentially a sideshow '' because the media landscape had changed so much since the original inquiry .
He said : `` The Government is perfectly at liberty to decide to have it , but I think it would be a waste of time and money and effort . ''
On Section 40 , Mr Gallagher said : `` Essentially it is an attempt to blackmail newspapers into joining the government 's regulator , a state-sponsored regulator , and no self-respecting newspaper worth its salt wants to be part of a state-sponsored regulator because you are then on the road to giving MPs power and the whip hand over the press . ''
Warning of the impact if the costs provision was implemented , he said : `` A newspaper could report the conduct of a terrible MP , that MP could then bring a case for libel against a newspaper . He or she could lose that libel case and yet , because we are not members of the state-sponsored regulator , we would then be liable for the MP 's costs .
`` That offends all principles of natural justice . It 's insane . ''
Regulator Impress has received formal approval from the Press Recognition Panel , which was set up in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry .
It is funded partly by Max Mosley , the former motor racing boss , who was a victim of a newspaper sting .
But most newspapers have signed up to rival regulator the Independent Press Standards Organisation ( Ipso ) , the press-funded body which did not seek official recognition - and would therefore be faced with paying plaintiffs ' costs under the Section 40 provisions .
Ms Hames told Today that the second part of the Leveson Inquiry was necessary because the original probe could not examine criminal cases which were yet to come before the courts .
`` There were any number of questions which are still waiting to be asked , '' the Hacked Off campaigner said .
She insisted that the Section 40 measures were one part of an overall package of reforms which came out of the Leveson Inquiry and insisted that any officially-recognised regulator would remain independent of government .
Dismissing the concerns of the press , she said : `` They do not want to be independently regulated - and independently is the key word . ''
Independent regulation was what the public and victims of press abuse wanted to see , she added .
If Section 40 was not implemented she said she would be `` absolutely appalled '' and she would feel `` betrayed '' if it did not go ahead .
New Delhi : Controversial meat exporter Moin Qureshi was on Tuesday granted bail by a Delhi court in a money laundering case .
Special judge Arun Bharadwaj , who had reserved the order on Qureshi 's application on 4 December , gave him the relief on a personal bond of Rs two lakh and a surety of a like amount .
The Enforcement Directorate ( ED ) had earlier this month opposed the bail plea of Qureshi , saying he could hamper the ongoing investigation , after which the court had reserved its verdict .
ED special counsel NK Matta had alleged that Qureshi , arrested on 25 August , should not be granted the relief as the allegations levelled against him were grave and there were chances that he may flee from justice if enlarged on bail .
In his bail application , the accused had told the court that no purpose would be served by keeping him in further custody.He had said that the probe in the case was over and he was not required further by the ED .
The ED had earlier claimed in the court that `` the witnesses have confirmed in their statements that they have delivered crores of rupees for Qureshi and his associates through his employees ... ''
The agency had also alleged that Qureshi was involved in hawala transactions through Delhi-based hawala operators Parvez Ali of Turkman Gate and M/s South Delhi Money Changer ( DAMINI ) in Greater Kailash-1 .
According to the agency , Qureshi was arrested under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) as he was `` not cooperating in the probe '' .
WILKES-BARRE , Pa. ( AP )  The owner of a vegan food truck says she regrets a Facebook post in which she appeared to dismiss the deaths of `` meat eaters '' in the Las Vegas massacre .
Delinda Jensen , 60 , of Wilkes-Barre , said she 's received death threats and had to shut down her business after her post Monday night started going viral , sparking intense backlash both online and off .
Jensen wrote : `` Yes I am jaded . Fifty nine meat eaters dead . How many animals will live because of this ? '' In a second comment , she used an expletive to say she did n't care about `` carnists . ''
A gunman killed 58 people at a country music concert Sunday night , then killed himself as police closed in .

Jensen , a former adjunct history professor , called her post `` a moment of stupidity '' and apologized for it in an interview with the Times Leader newspaper in Wilkes-Barre .
`` Was it poorly written ? Absolutely . Do I regret it ? Yes . I am so sorry I wrote that , '' she said Thursday . `` Meat eaters or not , no one deserves to die like that . I was n't celebrating the death of those people . ''
Jensen said she became a vegan two years ago and started the Mother Nature Vegan Cuisine food truck with her son . She said she was trying to make the point that she believes animals are tortured and killed unnecessarily for their meat .
Jensen has since deactivated her Facebook account , hidden her food truck and canceled her bookings , and installed a security camera at her home . Her son said people have driven by their home , shouting threats and obscenities , and they have called police several times out of fear for their safety .
Warriors coach Steve Kerr would sign FGCU 3-point shooters
Tara VanDerveer offered up the perfect game-plan to stymie Florida Gulf Coast 's fabulous 3-point shooters : Send them to the ailing , undermanned Golden State Warriors on Monday so Stanford 's defense might get a break .
“ We 'll take 'em ! ” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Sunday by text message .
“ He ca n't have them , ” Florida Gulf Coast quickly posted on Twitter in response .
Thing is , the defending NBA champions have an off day — so VanDerveer will have to prepare her fourth-seeded Cardinal to face the nation 's best deep threat in the second round of the NCAA tournament .
Stanford ( 23-10 ) won its 19th straight first-round game and will try to advance to its 11th straight Sweet Sixteen facing a 12th-seeded Eagles team ( 31-4 ) on quite a roll . FGCU , without a single 6-footer on the roster , has won 11 straight games and 21 of 22 after its 80-70 upset of No . 5 seed Missouri in Saturday 's first game at Maples Pavilion .
“ We 're not going to try and be taller than them , ” FGCU coach Karl Smesko said .
The Eagles shot just 7 for 17 on 3s in their first-round victory , but found their reliable rhythm of scoring on layups or driving and kicking out to the perimeter threats .
“ Their three-point shooting is exceptional , ” VanDerveer said . “ It 's going to be a very tough challenge for us . ”
VanDerveer and her team defeated FGCU as the Hall of Fame coach won her milestone 900th career game at Puerto Vallarta , Mexico , in November 2013 . She has long since gone over 1,000 .
“ We are playing one of the most storied programs in women 's college basketball history tomorrow with an opportunity to make the Sweet 16 , ” Smesko said , noting the Eagles must move forward from the thrill of their first-round upset .
Cardinal freshman Kiana Williams dazzled in her NCAA debut Saturday , scoring 21 points with five 3-pointers while pushing the tempo on offense as the Cardinal earned a lopsided first-round win against Gonzaga . Florida Gulf Coast senior China Dow , who helped lead the way on both ends in the first round , understands the daunting task ahead for the Eagles to extend their special March run .
Stanford boasts an incredible 35-4 record in NCAA games at home . Florida Gulf Coast is in the NCAA tournament for the fifth time in seven years with Division I postseason eligibility and won an NCAA game for the first time since beating Oklahoma State in 2015 .
“ The environment is going to be tough to play in . At the same time , we have fans down here who can be loud , too , whenever we score , ” Dow said . “ I think it 's the hype against playing against those fans . I have never been in an environment like Stanford , so if it works out , it will be fun . ”

Bend firefighters put out a fire yesterday at a duplex on Savannah Avenue in Bend . The family living in the home came back to find the house in flames .

The cause of the fire is under investigation . The home did n't have any working smoke alarms .
DUBAI , Aug 13 ( Reuters ) - The government of Jordan has asked banks to submit proposals to arrange a U.S. dollar conventional or Islamic bond issue , sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday .
The bond would be of benchmark size , said one of the sources , declining to be named because the information is private . Benchmark-sized bonds are generally upwards of $ 500 million .
Jordan issued its first domestic sukuk last year , but should it opt for an Islamic bond , the planned debt sale would be the first international sukuk ever issued by the country .
Jordan 's ministry of finance did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Jordan raised $ 500 million in April through a tap of its existing $ 500 million bond issued in November 2015 and maturing in 2026 . Under a bond tap , an existing transaction is reopened for subscription , using the same documentation as before .
It also issued last October a $ 1 billion bond maturing in January 2027 , with Citi and JPMorgan leading the transaction .
Jordan 's economy has been severely hit by the flow of refugees arriving from Syria since 2011 . `` Providing for the needs of the Syrian refugees in Jordan has materially impacted Jordan 's public finances and will continue to do so , '' said Jordan 's latest bond prospectus , dated April 2017 .
`` If the Kingdom does not receive additional and sufficient assistance from the international community ( ... ) the presence of large numbers of Syrian refugees in Jordan will continue to materially strain the general resources of the Government and negatively affect the Kingdom 's economy . ''
Jordan , rated B1 by Moody 's and BB-minus by Standard & Poor 's , is receiving support from the International Monetary Fund through a three-year , $ 723 million extended fund facility , which was approved in August last year .
It also relies on funds from the World Bank and other international organisations . Before the issue of $ 500 million in bonds in November 2015 as a standalone credit , Jordan issued bonds fully guaranteed by the U.S. government through the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) .

Using the political atmosphere formed by the U.S. and its embassy move to Jerusalem , which resulted in the recognition of Israeli sovereignty on the holy city , Israeli authorities have increased pressure on Gaza .
During the protests against the U.S. and the anniversary of Nakba , more than 100 Palestinians were killed on the Gaza border . Tensions have recently escalated again as Israel wants to increase the restrictions , imposed on the densely populated city . Although Hamas and some other Palestinian factions stated they were ready for a ceasefire or an agreement , Israel has been refusing to come to any understanding until Egypt has mediated . Yet , it is uncertain how long this quietness will last . A quick look at the certain developments in Gaza demonstrates Israel 's unwillingness for peace .
As of March 30 , which was marked as `` The Great March of Return , '' thousands of Palestinians , including women and children , gathered on the Gaza border . Israeli forces attempted to disperse the groups , facing resistance and as a result nearly 20 people were killed . In the first two weeks of April , Palestinians continued to get together near security points and Israelis did not shy away from killing even more of them .
In the meantime , the Israeli army made an interesting statement , claiming Palestinians had employed a new type of weapon – burning kites . May 14 was a day of bloodbath . While Americans and Israelis were celebrating the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem , at the same exact time , Palestinians were being massacred . Officially , more than 60 people were killed that day .
Israel 's brutal stance toward Gaza residents increases the anger among the world public and gives the impression that there is no way to reach a peace deal with Israel . The main motivation of Gazans seems to be the will to better their living conditions .
Due to the lack of electricity , people predominantly rely on gasoline-fueled generators and solar panels to keep their refrigerators running and to have access to hot water . Considering that oil prices are sky high due to the blockade , Gazans are in a dire situation .
Therefore , hundreds of people are engaged in a protest against Israel and the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) because international rights groups warn that there might be a total collapse of basic services .
With only three hours of electricity available per day , the U.N. warned that half of Gaza 's population is in need of humanitarian aid . Israel said it would reduce electricity after the PA limited its payments for power .
Palestinians are angry also due to the fact that their political efforts have remained futile . For instance Israel had been accusing Gazans of handing over power to Hamas .
First , Hamas distinguished itself from its former umbrella group , the Muslim Brotherhood . Then , it published a new manifesto , disavowing itself from the Muslim Brotherhood , distancing itself from any aims of destroying Israel and accepting the 1967 borders of the Palestinian state without referring to Israel 's legitimate statehood .
Hamas also signaled its acceptance for a two-state solution through an alliance with its main rival the Fatah Party . Hamas kept its promises and even handed the power over to the Fatah Party in the hope that the conditions for Gaza residents would be bettered .
However , all of these efforts made by the Palestinian side remain fruitless . This has caused anger among the population . In return Israel has intensified its efforts to increase the blockade and embargo as well as to build new tunnels around Gaza .
World number two Simona Halep reached the China Open semi-finals for the first time in her career after beating Russian Daria Kasatkina 6-2 6-1 on Friday .
REUTERS : World number two Simona Halep reached the China Open semi-finals for the first time in her career after beating Russian Daria Kasatkina 6-2 6-1 on Friday .
Halep , who lost to Kasatkina in the second round of last month 's Wuhan Open , was never at risk of suffering a second consecutive defeat by the 20-year-old , sending down 19 winners to wrap up the win in just over an hour .
`` I think I played much better than Wuhan , '' the Romanian said after the match . `` I changed tactics and worked pretty well . I just played my game and my style , and I was very consistent and solid as well . ''
The tournament in Beijing has already seen Halep register a first career victory over Russian Maria Sharapova , and the second seed now has an opportunity to level her head-to-head with Jelena Ostapenko , who beat her in this year 's French Open final .
The mercurial Latvian bested Sorana Cirstea 6-4 6-4 in an error-strewn quarter-final that saw both players struggling to hold serve .
Ostapenko made a typically high 33 unforced errors , but her powerful forehand kept her out of trouble against Romanian Cirstea , who is also her doubles partner .

Twice-Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova fought off fatigue to dominate Czech compatriot Barbora Strycova 6-3 6-4 and reach her third Beijing semi-final .
Kvitova , who produced 33 winners offset by 43 unforced errors , said she was tired but very happy with the victory , and will meet Caroline Garcia in the last four .
`` I could n't just imagine this coming to Asia , '' Kvitova said . `` I 'm already happy . I love these big matches anyway , so I will do my best tomorrow .
`` I felt a little bit tired today maybe . On the court I felt pretty slow . Maybe I was n't , but that was my feeling . Sometimes it 's pretty confusing . ''
Garcia came through a gruelling contest that stretched for three hours and 21 minutes against world number three Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the day 's final match .
Playing with her right thigh heavily strapped , the Frenchwoman lost the first set , but clung on as the clock at the National Tennis Stadium ticked past midnight to prevail 6-7 ( 5 ) 7-5 7-6 ( 6 ) .

WASHINGTON — The White House has not yet commented on ABC 's cancellation of “ Roseanne ” following star Roseanne Barr 's racist tweet .
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say what the president thought about the series ' cancellation . “ That 's not what he 's spending his time on , ” she said . “ And I think that we have a lot bigger things going on in the country right now , certainly that the President is spending his time when it comes to policy . ”
But when the series launched and became an unexpected success in March , President Donald Trump called her , congratulating her on the show 's success .
At a rally in Ohio , he even embraced her success as attributable to his campaign . He told the crowd that Mark Burnett , the executive producer of “ The Apprentice , ” called him to tell him that the “ Roseanne ” reboot was a hit .
Burnett , Trump said , told him , “ Did you see ‘ Roseanne 's ' ratings ? ' They were over 18 million people , and it was about us . ”
Barr tweeted early Tuesday about Valerie Jarrett , former senior adviser to President Barack Obama , and wrote that “ Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes had a baby = vj. ” She later deleted the post and apologized . ABC decided to cancel the show , its breakout hit of the 2017-18 season , just hours later .

Jarrett is already booked to appear on an MSNBC special on everyday racism on Tuesday night .
“ We have to turn it into a teaching moment , ” she said in a clip released by the network . “ I 'm fine . I 'm worried about all the people out there who do n't have a circle of friends and who come right to their defense . ”
“ There was only one thing to do here , and that was the right thing , ” said Bob Iger , the chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Co .
There was some consternation among conservatives that Barr 's tweets will provide fuel to arguments that Trump and his followers share her views .
Erick Erickson argued on Twitter that Barr “ was never a center-right figure . And she 's been a pretty openly insane person for a while . ABC tried to use her to connect with and program to Trump voters . I suspect this cancellation will hurt that cause . ”
He added , “ I was n't a fan of the relaunch or how it was marketed . The wild embrace of Roseanne by people on the right just makes it easier now to bash them via Roseanne . And I think it just will cause networks to ignore real social conservatives now even more than they did . ”
Ben Shapiro wrote , “ Interesting to see the crossover between people who thought the NFL banning kneeling for the anthem was a First Amendment debacle , but think ABC did n't raise any First Amendment issues by firing Roseanne . For me , they 're both private corporations that get to decide how certain speech impacts their product . So while I think the NFL handled things poorly , I 'm not supremely troubled by their decision , and I think ABC was right to dump Roseanne . ”
Eric Bolling tweeted back at Barr that “ no apology necessary at all , ” and added , “ please do n't leave. ” He later deleted the tweet .
From many on the right , the show 's success was seen as an example of what happens when Hollywood stops ignoring middle America — or the type of traditional Democratic working class voters that Trump peeled off in 2016 to win the presidency . Although ABC had signaled that the show would tone down its politics in the second season , much of the publicity beforehand was all about Barr 's real-life support of Trump in an industry that leans left .
But she has a history of political provocation , stretching all the way back to 1990 , when she gave an off-key rendition of the National Anthem at a San Diego Padres game followed by a gesture in which she grabbed her crotch . President George Bush called it “ disgraceful. ” She later apologized , but told The Washington Post in 2015 that it took her years to deal with the fallout . Did she regret it ? Nope .

PARIS - Violent crime dropped in Brant County in 2017 , but crimes against property rose as officers responded to an increase in calls .
According to a statistical report presented by Brant OPP Acting Insp . Jim Millson to the county 's police services board , officers investigated 932 violent and property crime last year .
That 's up from 819 in 2016 .
The report says the number of violent crime cases dropped by 7.9 per cent to 150 last year from 163 in 2016 .
Here 's how the violent crime caseload stacked up in 2017 ( with 2016 in brackets ) :
Murder - 1 ( 0 ) ;
Sexual assault - 21 ( 17 ) ;
Assault - 80 ( 81 ) ;
Abduction - 2 ( 1 ) ;
Robbery - 3 ( 3 ) ;
Other crimes against a person - 43 ( 61 ) .
The number of drug occurrences also declined . Last year , there were 41 cases of possession , down from 89 in 2016 . There were 10 trafficking cases last year , up from five in 2016 . And there were six cases of importation and product in 2017 , up from three the year before .
Millson said the detachment has had success in dealing with property crimes , particularly thefts over and under $ 5,000 .
`` Many areas do n't see much of a change , year over year , but we 've been able to make a big difference in those two . ''
Millson noted that , in the latter part of 2017 , the Brant and Oxford detachments set up a community street crime unit with six officers overseen by a detective sergeant to target thefts .
`` They are already delivering impressive results . ''
His report shows police investigated 115 theft-over cases in 2017 , up from 78 in 2016 . And police also investigated 273 theft-under cases , up from 195 in 2016 .
Buoyed by the success , the detachment has added another officer to the unit , Millson said .
`` In his first shift , the unit was successful in making several arrests and recovering property . That 's in just 24 hours , '' he said .
`` It has assisted us greatly by having another officer assigned . ''
Here are numbers for property crimes last year ( with 2016 in brackets ) :
Arson - 4 ( 3 )
Break and enter - 132 ( 122 ) ;
Have stolen goods - 11 ( 14 ) ;

A new WCS paper published in the journal BioScience finds that the enormous trends toward population stabilization , poverty alleviation , and urbanization are rewriting the future of biodiversity conservation in the 21st century , offering new hope for the world 's wildlife and wild places .
The paper , written by Eric Sanderson , WCS Senior Conservation Ecologist ; Joe Walston , WCS Vice President for Field Conservation ; and John Robinson , WCS Executive Vice President for Global Conservation , says that for the first time in the Anthropocene , the global demographic and economic trends that have resulted in unprecedented destruction of the environment are now creating the necessary conditions for a possible renaissance of nature .
Most people think that the population of people on Earth will always rise , but these authors point out that the demographic transition is already well underway . The rate of growth in global population has been dropping since the 1960s . They cite new demographic research that suggests the world population in 2100 could be as high as 12 billion or as low as 7 billion , fewer people than are alive today . The difference depends on actions we take today .
Good urbanization is key . Cities lead people to choose to have smaller families , and the increased income urbanites derive from working in town mean that people can choose to conserve nature , not destroy it , through choices about what they buy and how they live .
These considerations lead the authors to suggest that within our generation , or the generation to follow , if society makes the right moves now , there could be possibilities for rewilding unimaginable to previous generations of conservationists .
They call their thinking “ From Bottleneck to Breakthrough. ” Recognition of the massive demographic , economic and urbanization trends suggest that conservation will best succeed if we protect the world 's threatened wildlife and wild places through the bottleneck ; create safe , attractive , sustainable cities ; encourage better consumer choices by costing in the environmental benefits or harms of different resources and pollutants ; and by inspiring all people and all institutions of the world to care for , rather than destroy , the natural bases of life on Earth .
Said lead author Eric Sanderson : “ A light is appearing at the end of the tunnel , but for that light to be sunshine and not a train , it is critical that the world 's nations act now . ”
The late , late Leaf show is a hit in Herning , Denmark .
Frederik Andersen knows his father Ernst , a former goaltender will be watching him in Game 7 live , despite the six hour-time difference .
“ He 's used to it , ” Andersen assured as the Leafs packed for Boston . “ He loves staying up late . ”
When the younger Andersen communicates with Ernst , he says his dad makes sure to leave the motivation to Mike Babcock .
“ He 's just happy for me , he 's not trying to be a coach too much , just trying to be a supportive parent . ”
Andersen is getting lots of love from elsewhere in the homeland .
“ It 's fun waking up to a lot of messages the next day when we 've won a big game . ”
Andersen lost a couple of Game 7s in his days with Anaheim , while several Leafs have had mixed success on this stage . Winger James van Riemsdyk was on the Toronto team that lost in Boston in 2013 , but on an earlier Philadelphia club , the Flyers won at TD Garden and also a deciding game against Buffalo .
“ Hopefully we can expand upon that , ” van Riemsdyk said of his record . “ ( Boston ) is a fun building to play in , we know it will be a good challenge , we 'll be ready for it . ”
Asked if he 's going to be restless Tuesday night , JVR quipped “ I 'm watching a little bit of Ray Donovan right now . There 's a little bit of Boston tie-in with that show . That 's nice . ”
On a serious note , he said the Leafs should just be the Leafs once singer Rene Rancourt finishes fist-pumping his way through the national anthem on Wednesday .
“ Just focus on your job , do n't do anything too crazy or something that 's not the type of player you are . That 's what we 've been harping on , no matter what the situation in this series , keep sticking with it . It comes from the way we 've played during the year , the confidence we have in our team and the different ways we 've been able to respond to adversity .
“ There are no more bullets left in the chamber , the last shot to move on or go home . ”

THE BIG MATCH-UP
G Frederik Andersen v G Tuukka Rask
Andersen emerged the steadiest in Games 5 and 6 , but Rask seems to have the Leafs ' number when it counts . Andersen 's pair of Game 7 experiences were n't great , losses to Chicago and Nashville while with the Anaheim Ducks , but he 's grown in confidence . How well the unpredictable Leaf defence plays in front of him will be key .
SEVEN KEYS TO GAME 7
1 . First things first
On Monday , the Leafs became the first team in the series to give up the first goal in the series and win , but that 's not a path to victory they 'd want to repeat . Teams scoring first hold an edge of 126-43 in 169 all-time Game 7s , home teams own 99-70 .
2 . Hitch Mitch
Toronto 's regular season and playoff points leader Mitch Marner now has a point in seven career home games against Boston . In this road encounter , he 's a priority for Boston 's coverage , overworked as it is as the series is extended .
3 . Special teams , special times
Each club 's ability to kill penalties in close games has been highlighted , notably Toronto in the third period of Game 5 and in the final frame of Game 6 . Boston has killed eight of 10 at home .
4 . Stripe story
Both teams have grumped about series ' officiating , but within bounds . Mike Babcock pointed out the Leafs are among teams who ‘ pre-scout ' the zebras with a photo of the game night referees in the room summarizing what types of minors they tend to call or let slide .
5 . Hibernating bears
From 20 points in the first two games , Patrice Bergeron , Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak have been blanked with a combined minus-16 in the three losses . They are due for an uprising , but Leafs need to limit the damage .
6 . Leo will not roar
Leo Komarov , a survivor of the 2013 Game 7 , would love to get back and bump someone , but Babcock is wary of his conditioning after a Game 2 injury and will likely keep Andreas Johnsson in .
7 . Centres of attention
After being coy with his lineup in Game 6 , Babcock was once more secretive about employing centres Nazem Kadri or Tomas Plekanec without having last line change . The Leafs also have to be wary of being clobbered in the dot match-ups again . In Game 6 , Bergeron was a remarkable 23 of 29 .

SINGAPORE : SPRING Singapore is seeking public feedback on proposed changes to product safety regulations , it said in a media release on Monday ( Aug 14 ) .
These amendments to the Consumer Protection ( Safety Requirements ) Regulations ( CPSR ) and the Standards , Productivity and Innovation Board ( Conformity Assessment ) Regulations ( SPIBR ) are meant to ensure that these regulations take into account new products and technologies in the market , SPRING said .
Under the CPSR , certain categories of household goods and appliances have to meet specific safety standards and get a safety mark from SPRING before they can be sold in Singapore .
Proposed changes to the CPSR include broadening the scope of product categories and removing outdated products from categories .
For example , the existing hairdryer category will be reclassified as hair care appliances to cover products such as hair straighteners , stylers and curlers .
Outdated products such as videocassette recorders ( VCRs ) and immersion water heaters will be removed as product categories , while others such as LaserDisc sets and television or video display units will be reclassified as audio and video products .

The third key change to the CPSR will be to adopt a new `` tiered-risk '' framework to determine the conformity assessment for each product category based on its risk level - remote , low , medium or high .
According to SPRING , the proposed change will let suppliers issue a declaration of conformity for `` low-risk '' controlled goods . At the moment , a Certificate of Conformity must be issued by third-party bodies before the goods can be registered with SPRING .
`` This will result in reduced time to market and savings in certification costs for goods in the low-risk category , '' said SPRING .
In addition , certificates issued by a SPRING-designated third-party conformity assessment body in the EU will also be accepted , under a proposed change to the SPIBR .
This will apply to third-party bodies located in countries that are parties to the European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement .
Members of the public can share their views on these proposed changes from Monday until Sep 13 by emailing SPRING at safety @ spring.gov.sg .

* Anti-nuclear campaign group ICAN is Nobel Peace laureate
* Graphic of Nobel laureates : tmsnrt.rs/2y6ATVW
By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO , Dec 10 ( Reuters ) - The leader of the group that won this year 's Nobel Peace Prize on Sunday urged nuclear nations to adopt a United Nations treaty banning atomic weapons in order to prevent “ the end of us ” .
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons ( ICAN ) was awarded this year 's Nobel Peace Prize by a Nobel committee that cited the spread of nuclear weapons and the growing risk of an atomic war .
ICAN is a coalition of 468 grassroots non-governmental groups that campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons , adopted by 122 nations in July .
The treaty is not signed by - and would not apply to - any of the states that already have nuclear arms . Beatrice Fihn , ICAN 's Executive Director , urged them to sign the agreement .
“ It provides a choice . A choice between the two endings : the end of nuclear weapons or the end of us , ” she said in her speech at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo .
“ The United States , choose freedom over fear . Russia , choose disarmament over destruction . Britain , choose the rule of law over oppression , ” she added , before urging France , China , India , Pakistan , North Korea and Israel to do the same .
Israel is widely assumed to have nuclear weapons , although it neither confirms nor denies it .
“ A moment of panic or carelessness , a misconstrued comment or bruised ego , could easily lead us unavoidably to the destruction of entire cities , ” she added .
“ A calculated military escalation could lead to the indiscriminate mass murder of civilians . ”
Fihn delivered the Nobel lecture together with Setsuko Thurlow , an 85-year-old survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and now an ICAN campaigner .
Thurlow recalled on stage on Sunday some of her memories of the attack on Aug. 6 , 1945 .
She was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building about 1.8 kilometres ( 1.1 mile ) from Ground Zero , she said . Most of her classmates , who were in the same room , were burned alive .
“ Processions of ghostly figures shuffled by . Grotesquely wounded people , they were bleeding , burnt , blackened and swollen , ” she said .
“ Parts of their bodies were missing . Flesh and skin hung from their bones . Some with their eyeballs hanging in their hands . Some with their bellies burst open , their intestines hanging out . The foul stench of burnt human flesh filled the air . ”
The United States , Britain and France sent second-rank diplomats to the Nobel ceremony , which Fihn earlier told Reuters was “ some kind of protest ” .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain said on Sunday that it wants talks with the EU to move on to the next phase , as it set out details of the future relationship it wants with the bloc and senior ministers presented a united approach to negotiations .
Britain is keen to start talking about its post-Brexit relationship with Europe , wary of the need to reassure anxious businesses , citizens and investors . But Brussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first .
`` We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU , '' Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement .
Britain 's call to move forward with Brexit talks came as finance minister Philip Hammond and trade minister Liam Fox presented a united front that there should be a time-limited transition period - signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May 's cabinet .
Davis 's Brexit department said it was preparing to publish several papers , including plans for a new customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland .
`` We 've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked , '' a source in Britain 's Brexit department said .
`` These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations . ''
Talks so far have focused on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU , what rights British and EU citizens will have , and how to manage a land border to the bloc in Ireland . The two sides will be looking for a solution to those issues at the next round of talks due at the end of this month .
The decision to announce the publication of papers on its plans indicates Britain 's desire to counter criticism from Brussels about its approach to the talks .
In July , EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands , but because it had no position at all on many issues . EU negotiators have warned that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of a scheduled March 2019 exit .
IRISH SCHENGEN AREA ?
A British paper focused on `` issues unique to Northern Ireland and Ireland '' is expected ahead of the talks , but no further details of the proposal were provided on Sunday .
The Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain was seeking a `` Schengen area '' between Britain and Ireland , which would allow free movement of people and a `` light-touch customs regime '' across the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . The Brexit department declined to comment on the story .
The report , which cited an unnamed source in the Brexit department , said that Irish citizens would be able to work freely in the UK , and British citizens would work freely in Ireland . Citizens of other EU countries could access the UK over the Irish border but would not be able to work in Britain without a work permit .
Separate papers would also address `` Continuity in the availability of goods for the EU and the UK '' and `` Confidentiality and access to official documents '' , the Brexit department said .
Eager to push talks past the opening divorce issues and on to the future trading and legal ties to the bloc , Britain also promised a series of `` Future Partnership '' papers in the run-up to October 's European Council . The first will be a proposal for new customs arrangements .
The push to move forward with Brexit comes as Prime Minister May 's top ministers moved to strike a more united tone on leaving the European Union , after in-fighting in the wake of an electoral failure in June in which May 's Conservative party lost its majority in parliament .
Some still dispute her approach , with former foreign minister for the now-opposition Labour party David Miliband and pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry warning in Sunday newspapers of the economic `` self-harm '' of leaving the single market .
However , pro-European finance minister Hammond and ardent Brexiteer trade minister Fox set out a joint position in the Sunday Telegraph that a transition period was needed when Britain leaves the EU , but single market membership would still end and the interim period would not be used to stop Brexit .
Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet that the article was the `` right way forward '' and would `` create certainty and a great new European relationship '' .

Scott Sargent
WILKES-BARRE — Accused Walmart gunman Scott Sargent wo n't be getting new attorneys and his trial is still on for later this month .
Luzerne County Judge David W. Lupas on Friday rejected Sargent 's request to remove his court-appointed lawyer , a move that would have likely once again delayed the case .
Sargent , 33 , of Shenandoah , is facing attempted murder charges on accusations he opened fire outside the Walmart store at the Wilkes-Barre Twp . Marketplace in October 2015 , exchanging shots with police until he was shot in the abdomen .
During a hearing on the matter Friday morning , Assistant District Attorney Jarrett Ferentino argued Sargent 's request was another delay tactic , like when he claimed he was n't competent to stand trial on the eve of jury selection in May .
“ The issue is Mr. Sargent does n't want to plead guilty and accept responsibility , ” Ferentino said . “ He does n't like that the competency argument did n't work . This is another attempt to kick the can down the road . ”
The prosecutor noted the evidence is overwhelming against Sergeant — with there being at least 20 eyewitnesses in addition to the officers involved — but he has rejected a plea deal .
Lupas last month ruled Sargent was competent to stand trial .
Prosecutors say that after opening fire outside the Walmart , Sargent got into a firefight with police , with one shot piercing a police SUV 's windshield and narrowly missing a Wilkes-Barre Twp . officer 's head . Wilkes-Barre City officer Alan Gribble ended the fight with a shotgun blast to Sargent 's abdomen .
Ferentino said he 's had to do trial prep with the officers involved several times already , making them relive that scary day .
“ We are ready to go . If we delay this case , it 's a miscarriage of justice , ” Ferentino said .
Ferentino said he heard rumblings that Sargent may now try a “ guilty but mentally ill ” defense . If so , the defense should have already revealed that to prosecutors so they could get an independent evaluation of Sargent , he said .
Sargent 's attorney Joseph Yeager did n't deny they are considering that option , but said he had n't committed to that route .
“ That 's a trial strategy issue , ” he said .
Sargent told Lupas that he was not happy with Yeager , of the public defender 's office . He said his dissatisfaction with Yeager is “ a lot deeper ” than a disagreement over pleading guilty .
He claims Yeager is withholding discovery evidence from him .
Yeager said he 's turned over everything except surveillance footage of the incident . He is scheduling a time for Sargent to watch it at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility . Yeager said the two have “ irreconcilable differences . ”
Lupas noted Yeager was being assisted by other attorneys with the public defender 's office . He said the group , including Yeager , could continue .
Sargent 's trial is set to start with jury selection on Oct. 16 , a day before the two-year anniversary of the shooting .
Sargent remains jailed at the county prison without bail .

The maker of Jim Beam bourbon whiskey , Beam Suntory , will be doling out more than $ 8 million ( Rs 55 crore ) as penalty after US regulators found it was allegedly bribing government officials in India to make inroads into the burgeoning market.The whisky-maker 's Indian subsidiary reportedly bribed officials to speed up process pertaining to acquiring licenses and distribution , the US Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement.The development comes as a blotch in the over 200-year old history of Jim Beam . The company , which is credited with giving birth to ‘ bourbon whiskey ' , brands its product as 'World 's finest ' and boasts of Hollywood actor Mila Kunis as its brand ambassador.According to the statement , “ from 2006 through 2012 , Beam 's Indian subsidiary used third-party sales promoters and distributors to make illicit payments to government employees to increase sales orders , process license and label registrations , and facilitate the distribution of Beam 's distilled spirit products ” .The parties involved reportedly received kick-backs through escalated bills and the expenditure incurred was fudged at the subsidiary level.While Beam has not accepted or denied the allegations , it issued a statement saying that it is “ committed to doing business the right way everywhere they operate. ” The company has agreed to cooperate in an investigation by the US Department of Justice and put in place an internal enquiry .

CAIRO — Madiha Yousri , an Egyptian actress known for her iconic film roles , has died . She was 97 .
The state MENA news agency says Yousri suffered age-related health problems and died late on Tuesday .
Hundreds of mourners , including prominent film figures , attended Yousri 's funeral , which was held Wednesday at a historic mosque in Cairo 's Sayedah Nafeesa district .
Prime Minister Sherif Ismail mourned Yousri 's passing and offered his condolences .
Yousri had more than 90 films to her name , dating back to the 1940s . She also starred in musicals featuring iconic Egyptian singers of the 20th century : Mohamed Abdel-Wahab , Abdel-Halim Hafez , Farid Al-Atrash and Mohamed Fawzy .
Born in 1921 , Yousri was married three times . Two of her marriages were to film stars Mohamed Amin and Fawzy , with whom she co-starred in several movies .
( Reuters Health ) – As work worries abate , sleep difficulties may also diminish when workers make the transition to retirement , according to a recent study from Finland .
In particular , complaints of nonrestorative sleep and waking up too early in the morning decreased significantly , especially among pensioners who had poor health and stressful work lives before retirement , researchers found .
“ People reported experiencing more early morning awakenings and nonrestorative sleep during the final working years than after retirement , ” said lead author Saana Myllyntausta , a psychology doctoral candidate at the University of Turku .
Sleep is considered nonrestorative when a person is still tired after sleeping seven to eight hours . Sleep difficulties and short sleep cycles are associated with an increased risk of heart disease , diabetes and early death , Myllyntausta and her colleagues note in the journal Sleep .
“ This study would suggest that sleep quality , a key component of our health , is considerably poorer during the working years , ” Myllyntausta told Reuters Health by email .
The study team analyzed survey data from 5,800 Finnish public sector employees who retired on a statutory basis between 2000 and 2011 . Mandatory retirement age specified in the public sector worker pension law was generally 63 to 65 until 2004 , the researchers note . In 2005 , it was expanded to age 63 to 68 , except for certain worker categories such as primary schoolteachers , for whom mandatory retirement is at age 60 .

Every four years , the participants responded to surveys and for the current study , researchers analyzed their responses during the years just before retirement and in the transitional years right afterward .
In the final survey before retirement , 30 percent of the employees reported sleep difficulties , but after retirement , 26 percent reported sleep problems . In the years immediately following retirement , the likelihood of sleep problems dropped 11 percent overall compared to the final years of work .
In particular , waking up too early was 24 percent less likely and non-restorative sleep fell by 53 percent . Little change was seen in difficulties falling asleep or maintaining sleep , however .
In general , sleep duration increased by about 20 minutes after retirement , and for those who had sleep difficulties or were heavy alcohol users before retirement , sleep increased by 45 minutes .
The researchers note that sleep difficulties before retirement occurred more noticeably in those with poorer health , shorter sleep times , psychological stress and job strain .
“ Retirement from work is a great opportunity to make positive changes in sleep , as working hours no longer dominate sleep timing and work-related stresses are removed , ” Myllyntausta said . “ People can make sure they get an adequate amount of restorative sleep . ”
This research is part of the overall Finnish Retirement and Aging study , which follows aging workers with wearable activity and sleep monitors from final working years into retirement .
“ What we have learned about aging and sleep up to now comes mainly from studies comparing young adults with elderly people , which somewhat neglect sleep changes in middle age , ” said Dr. Jean-Claude Marquie of the University of Toulouse in France who was n't involved in the study .
“ Yet , aging is a developmental process which takes place throughout adulthood , ” Marquie told Reuters Health by email . “ The failure of studies to examine these middle years means that it is unclear whether changes in habits , sleep length and quality of sleep occur gradually or only in later years . ”
The Finnish study , for instance , shows that sleep problems were rated higher in 2006 than in 1996 , which could reflect an increased public awareness of sleep problems or changes in working conditions , such as more stressful work and longer work schedules , Marquie said . In general , sleep problems started in the 30s and then increased into the 50s , and sometimes even the 70s .
“ Another important issue is that former shift workers show similar levels of sleep complaints as current shift workers , ” noted Marquie , who is studying the effects of night shift work on sleep , heart disease risk and aging .
“ Perhaps the main message is that some of the consequences of poor working conditions can be reversible ( but not all of them ) , and the transition to retirement may be a ‘ blessed ' period that is important not to push back too far , ” Marquie said .

Terre Haute , Indiana………When a new season beckons , a number of new driver/team combos come to the forefront to make a splash on the USAC Silver Crown Champ Car Series scene , which begins this Sunday , April 29 , at the Terre Haute Action Track with the “ Sumar Classic . ”
Just one year ago , it was the new combination of driver Chris Windom and team owner Gene Kazmark who stole the spotlight in their debut together at Terre Haute . For 2018 , Windom once again finds himself in a similar realm , taking on a new endeavor , but with an experienced team . There 's no other team that has been more of a consistent front runner over the past two-plus decades than Gene Nolen 's team . With USAC Triple Crown champ Jerry Coons , Jr. from Tucson , Ariz. as a teammate , you could n't ask for a better one-two punch than Nolen has in his familiar yellow cars this season .
Windom signed up for a full season campaign with Nolen , whose cars captured the 1998 and 2002 “ Sumar ” with driver Tony Elliott . Windom , the 2016 series driver champ from Canton , Ill. is one of four past “ Sumar ” winners in this year 's field for the 18th running of the event , including three-time series champ Kody Swanson of Kingsburg , Calif. ( 2014 ) , Shane Cockrum of Benton , Ill. ( 2015 ) and Greenfield , Indiana 's C.J . Leary ( 2016 ) .
A handful of drivers has reached the peak of victory in a Silver Crown car , but not yet at Terre Haute . Indianapolis , Indiana 's Tyler Courtney scored the victory in the most recent dirt race in September 's “ 4-Crown Nationals ” at Rossburg , Ohio 's Eldora Speedway . Ione , California 's Justin Grant and Kokomo , Indiana 's Shane Cottle have gotten the job done at each of the Illinois miles – Grant at Springfield in 2017 and Cottle at Du Quoin in 2007 . David Byrne 's lone win came on the pavement at Lucas Oil Raceway in Brownsburg , Ind . in 2014 , but the Shullsburg , Wisconsin driver has shown continuous improvement on the dirt and could be a contender come Sunday .
Brady Bacon heads a list of USAC National feature winners in Sprints and Midgets who are striving to break through for their first win in the Silver Crown Series . Broken Arrow , Oklahoma 's Bacon is a two-time National Sprint champ who 's making his first series start for the Klatt Enterprises team . Past “ Joe James/Pat O'Connor Memorial ” Salem ( Ind . ) Speedway Sprint Car winner Jacob Wilson of Crawfordsville , Ind . returns to action after being sidelined by injury since last August . Steve Buckwalter of Royersford , Pa. has been a standout in wing sprint cars and midgets over the years , collecting an Indiana Midget Week victory at Gas City I-69 Speedway in 2010 . Two-time USAC Sprint Car winner Bill Rose of Plainfield , Ind . has a plethora of laps throughout the years at the Terre Haute Action Track , coming oh-so-close to victory on multiple occasions .
Past HPD Midget champ Austin Nemire of Sylvania , Ohio is back for a full-season run in his Nemire-Lesko Racing ride . Binghamton , New York 's Coleman Gulick returns to the series for the first time since 2012 . Terre Haute Action Track veterans Matt Goodnight of Winchester , Ind . and Troy , Missouri 's Chris Fetter make the trek back to Terre Haute in their self-owned machines .
Past Silver Crown Rookies of the Year Aaron Pierce of Muncie , Ind . ( 2004 ) , Casey Shuman of Tempe , Ariz. ( 2016 ) and Columbus , Indiana 's Joss Moffatt ( 2017 ) will be joined by this year 's new crop of Rookies . Warsaw , Indiana 's Neil Shepherd , Denton , North Carolina 's Johnny Petrozelle , Mechanicsburg , Pennsylvania 's Dave Berkheimer and Korey Weyant of Springfield , Ill. each possess past Silver Crown experience at Terre Haute .
Meanwhile , New Castle , Indiana 's Kyle Robbins and Pendleton , Indiana 's have extensive experience under their belt on the Terre Haute half-mile in sprints and midgets , but this will be their first foray into gassing up a Silver Crown on the dirt after each made their debut on the pavement earlier this month at ISM Raceway in Phoenix .
Perhaps the most versatile background of any one driver in this year 's Rookie class is Pleasant Valley , New York 's Chris Dyson , the two-time American LeMans Series champion and three-time 24 Hours of LeMans competitor who recently finished as the runner-up at the 12 Hours of Sebring in a Trans Am competition , has made a handful of starts with USAC in midgets and sprints over the last few years , mainly on the west coast .
Austin Mundie of Dallas , Texas and Mike Haggenbottom of Levittown , Pa. come to Silver Crown racing from similar backgrounds in wing sprint car racing . Mundie comes from the 305 and 360 sprint car ranks , cutting his teeth at legendary venues such as Devil 's Bowl Speedway . Haggenbottom is hardly a Rookie when it comes to seat time , but he arrives in the Silver Crown Series with an impressive resume that includes a URC Sprint Car title , a stint in ARCA and five Tri-State Racesaver Series championships .
Pit gates open at 1pm while the grandstands open at 2pm . An open pit party will take place from 2-3pm . Silver Crown cars hit the track for hot laps beginning at 4pm .

GRAND RAPIDS , Mich. ( WOOD ) — The Kent County Land Bank Authority says it posted solid numbers in 2016 .
The authority takes tax-reverted properties from local government , fixes them up and then sells them , getting them back on the tax rolls .
“ We serve an important purpose in cleaning up the titles to the properties and insuring the highest and best development plans for those properties , as opposed to selling them at auction , ” said David de Velder of the Land Bank .
Officials with the authority say they received 131 offers on 21 tax-reverted properties last year . The average sale price was $ 46,000 .
That 's a big drop in the number of properties the Land Bank took possession of at the high point of the housing crisis . In fact , there 's a shortage of affordable homes available in Grand Rapids .
Ninety-five percent of the homes sold by the Land Bank are single family and owner occupied .

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said in a Twitter message on Monday that Chicago 's mayor must ask for U.S. government help if the city fails to reduce its homicide rate , which hit a 20-year high in 2016 .
The city responded that Trump and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had previously spoken and agreed to ways the federal government could help .
Story continues below Chicago murder rate is record setting – 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016 . If Mayor ca n't do it he must ask for Federal help ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 2 , 2017
The president-elect correctly reported crime numbers published by the Chicago Police Department on Sunday , but the figures were not record-setting .
Although up about 60 percent from the previous year , the 762 homicides in 2016 were the highest annual toll since 1996 , when there were 796 , according to police data .

During the presidential campaign , Trump periodically referred to Chicago , America 's third most populous city , as an example of rising inner-city crime , which ticked up nationally in 2016 after a two-decade downward trend .
As candidate , Trump associated high-crime cities with their Democratic leaders . Emanuel is a former chief of staff to Democratic President Barack Obama .
A spokesman for Emanuel welcomed the prospect of working with Trump once the Republican takes office on Jan. 20 , but noted Trump and Emanuel had already spoken on the issue . The two met in New York in December .
“ As the president-elect knows from his conversation with the mayor , we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety , ” spokesman Adam Collins said in a statement .
Collins said the federal government could help by passing stricter gun laws , improving cooperation between federal and local law enforcement and funding programs for at-risk youth .
“ We are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration , ” Collins said .
Chicago has outlined plans to reduce violence , including the scheduled hiring of 970 police officers over the next two years to raise the total to 13,500 .

Police in Chicago made more gun arrests in 2016 than in New York and Los Angeles combined , Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said on Sunday .
“ We will make 2017 a safer year for the city of Chicago , ” Johnson told reporters .
Johnson said he would lobby the Illinois legislature to reform sentencing guidelines for repeat gun offenders . Police would also focus on “ targeted , data-driven enforcement ” and make community policing “ a department-wide philosophy , ” Johnson said .
Kanye West is one of those epic artists and celebs who fans do n't get to see very often in an intimate setting . Which is why when he made his grand return to Twitter last week , people were immediately obsessed with keeping up with what the hip hop artist and designer had to get off his chest . And it was a lot . But in between his sometimes cryptic tweets , Kanye West shared a photo of his daughter North playing with some dolls in a very rare moment of openness about his personal life .
I mean , one can say that as a musician and fashion designer , 40-year-old West is always `` opening up . '' His most recent Twitter activity is definitely something to behold . Along with philosophic musings about authenticity and identity , West also announced some upcoming music and that he admires some Trump supporters . Say what you will about Kanye West , but he 's never boring .
What 's so gripping about the dad of three sharing a photo of North is that it 's usually his wife , Kim Kardashian , who 's all about putting family on display . West makes rare and random appearances in public , on Keeping Up With The Kardashians , and usually keeps his private life , well ... private . For good reason , too . People on the internet can be terrible and staying off social media might just be good for his mental health . West does n't owe us anything , though I 'm kind of loving this Twitter comeback and how he snuck this pic of his daughter in there .
On Tuesday , West tweeted a picture of North in her PJs stacking a bunch of action figures , dolls , and Barbies . There are probably a million other parents out there in the world who watched their kid do the same thing after breakfast and before the day really got started . The only difference is that North has some pretty special dolls .
Two of the dolls were set apart — one of Michael Jackson and one of her father . West captioned the picture , `` and we danced to music Michael all morning . '' Just minutes before he had tweeted a picture of just the two iconic dolls , along with the caption , `` me and Mike '' and added a laughing-crying emoji .
Just afterwards , West followed up with another philosophical thought , `` to be great is to be misunderstood , '' and then , `` never a master . Always a student . '' With that , West seemed to log off Twitter for the day , but it 's easy to see how listening to Michael Jackson all morning with your daughter could put you in a productive , take-over-the-world kind of mood .
West , like basically every other performer in the world , was definitely inspired by Jackson ( or a `` student '' of him ) , having sampled Jackson 's 1982 hit “ P.Y.T. ” on the 2007 single , “ Good Life . ”
Jackson 's security guards , Bill Whitfield and Javon Beard , released a book in 2014 in which they recount when West met Jackson , writing , according to an excerpt in Business Insider :
Once Kanye saw Mr. Jackson , he was the one who was starstruck . He started gushing . `` Oh my God , Mr. Jackson , it 's such a pleasure and an honor to meet you . You just do n't know . I 'm your biggest fan . I love you so much . '' The whole time , Kanye was like a kid in a candy store . I 've never seen somebody be so humble . To see him that way was surreal . Everybody knows that Kanye can be very arrogant , and here he was , just amazed to be in the same room as Mr. Jackson .
So his sharing a picture of North playing with the two dolls must have brought on some feels . Not every kid can say that their dad is an icon like Michael Jackson , right ?
The picture was taken just hours after West made a surprise call to New York City 's Hot 97 morning show to address his tweets , according to Complex , so the family had a quite the morning . You ca n't really call it a comeback , but it is out of his normal routine to be so public and so open to sharing personal details ( like pics of his kids ) on social media .
Who knows how much longer Kanye West will continue tweeting and randomly calling Hot 97 to make his presence known . This could be the time it sticks or he 'll delete them all in a matter of days . Hopefully , he 'll keep at it and share more sweet , intimate moments like this one .

Guam 's leader said on Monday that `` sometimes a bully can only be stopped with a punch in the nose '' , in a spirited defence of President Donald Trump 's rhetoric against North Korea which has the island in its crosshairs.While Trump 's critics accuse him of inflaming tensions with Pyongyang , Guam governor Eddie Calvo said he was grateful the US leader was taking a strong stance against North Korean threats against his Pacific homeland . `` Everyone who grew up in the schoolyard in elementary school , we understand a bully , '' Calvo told AFP . `` ( North Korean leader ) Kim Jong-Un is a bully with some very strong weapons ... a bully has to be countered very strongly . `` Calvo , a Republican , said Trump was being unfairly criticised over his handling of the North Korea crisis , which escalated when Pyongyang announced plans to launch missiles toward Guam in a `` crucial warning '' .He said North Korea had threatened Guam -- a US territory which hosts two large military bases and is home to more than 6,000 military personnel -- at least three times since 2013.He said previous presidents had also used strong words to warn off Pyongyang , pointing out Barack Obama said last year that `` we could , obviously , destroy North Korea with our arsenals '' . `` One president ( Obama ) said it one way , cool and calmly with a period ... the other said fire and fury with an exclamation point , but it still leads to the same message , '' Calvo said.He rejected suggestions that Trump and the North Korean dictator were as bad as each other when it came to the sabre-rattling playing out in the western Pacific . `` Well there 's only one guy that has vaporised into a red mist his uncle or a general because he fell asleep in a meeting with an anti-aircraft gun , that 's Kim Jong-Un , '' he said . `` There 's only one guy that 's killed his brother with one of the most toxic nerve agents ever created , that 's Kim Jong-Un . ''
A car with diplomatic license plates drives out of a compound near Glen Cove , N.Y. , on Long Island on Friday , Dec. 30 , 2016 . Russia maintains this and another weekend retreat for its United Nations diplomats about an hour 's drive outside New York City — each in one of Long Island 's old Gold Coast mansions . U.S. officials did n't clarify which of the two countryside compounds would be closed .
The 35 Russian diplomats whom the Obama administration ordered out of the country in retaliation for alleged hacking of the U.S. presidential election have left the country , a State Department official told NBC News on Sunday .
The diplomats ' families went with them , said the official , who said any other details would have to come from Moscow . Russian news agencies quoted Russia 's embassy as confirming the news , Reuters reported .
President Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of the diplomats on Thursday and imposed sanctions on two suspected hackers and three companies that allegedly provided support to cyber operations by Russia 's GRU intelligence service .
The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Donald Trump win the election , and NBC News has reported that intelligence officials believe `` with a high level of confidence '' that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign .

Sub for more : http : //nnn.is/the_new_media | Paris Swade for Liberty Writers reports , This 25-year-old named Reality Winner was arrested over the weekend and is facing charges that she took classified material from a government facility and leaking it to a news outlet via mail .
PYONGYANG : Less than two days after the assassination of the half-brother of North Korea 's leader , small girls in frilly pastel leotards opened an ice skating gala in Pyongyang to honour the late father of both men .
The Paektusan Prize International Figure Skating Festival is held every year to celebrate Kim Jong-Il , the leader who oversaw the North 's first nuclear tests .
His children - by different women - included both Kim Jong-Un , who inherited power from him five years ago , and Kim Jong-Nam , older by several years , who fell from grace after a bizarre attempt in 2001 to enter Japan on a false passport to try to visit Disneyland .
In exile Jong-Nam voiced occasional criticism of the regime . He was murdered at Kuala Lumpur 's international airport on Monday , apparently by two poison-wielding female agents .
With no announcement of the death by the North 's official Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) , the vast majority of Wednesday 's audience at the ice rink in Pyongyang would have been oblivious of the killing .
But for anyone who was aware , some elements of the programme could have appeared darkly ironic : One early number was set to Pink Floyd 's Hey You , lyrics : `` Hey you , out there in the cold , getting lonely , getting old . ''
In another , a skater performed a pistol-shot gesture to James Bond-like theme music .
“ Let us safeguard with our lives the Central Committee of the Party headed by the respected Supreme Leader Comrade Kim Jong-Un , ” read a white-on-red banner dangling over the ice .
“ Let us uphold great leader Kim Jong-Il as the eternal sun , ” proclaimed another .
Others read : 'Peace ' , 'Independence ' and 'Friendship ' .
`` SHINING STAR ''
North Korea marks Kim Jong-Il 's Feb 16 birthday as the “ Day of the Shining Star ” , although accounts differ as to where and when he was born .
Officially , he came into the world on the slopes of Mount Paektu , the spiritual birthplace of the Korean nation , in 1942 - which would make Thursday the 75th anniversary of the event . But according to independent historians he was actually born a year earlier and in the Soviet Union , where his father Kim Il-Sung enjoyed the backing of Moscow .
Kim Il-Sung would go on to found the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea – the North 's official name – and the Kim dynasty in 1948 .
Events scheduled for the occasion include a synchronised swimming show and a firework display . Above the ice rink hung portraits of Kim Jong-Il and his father , smiling benevolently .
Serried ranks of around 3,000 government officials in dark uniforms packed the arena , with other sections filled by women wearing colourful hanbok , traditional Korean dresses .
The perfomers included double Olympic gold medallist and triple world champion Evgeni Plushenko of Russia , and Brian Joubert of France , who won the world championship men 's singles gold in Tokyo in 2007 .
“ I just tried to give 100 per cent on the ice , ” Joubert told AFP .
Unlike most European Union members , France does not maintain diplomatic relations with North Korea , which is subject to United Nations Security Council sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes – which Pyongyang says are defensive in nature .
“ I 'm very curious . I hear a lot of things but I wanted to form my own opinion , I wanted to discover , ” Joubert said about his participation in the event . “ I 'm just doing my job . I do n't even try to find out who it 's for , I do it for the people who come to see the gala , so that they are happy . ”
Following their final practice of the spring on Thursday , the New England Patriots will enjoy a five-week break before the start of training camp at the end of July .
Tom Brady will take the opportunity to travel to China and Japan .
Thanks @ underarmour for the shirt ! It 's packed and I 'm excited about our visit to the great cities of Beijing , Shanghai , and Tokyo later this week . And I look forward to sharing with all of you the fun events and beautiful culture we will be experiencing ! ! @ tb12sports A post shared by Tom Brady ( @ tombrady ) on Jun 13 , 2017 at 5:46pm PDT
The Patriots ' quarterback announced on Instagram Tuesday that he will be visiting Beijing , Shanghai , and Tokyo later on this week . He also mentioned the trip at the Met Gala in May .

SINGAPORE : Mid-career Singaporeans keen to pursue nursing as a career can now apply for a new degree level programme at the National University of Singapore 's Alice Centre for Nursing Studies ( NUS Nursing ) , the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) and Workforce Singapore ( WSG ) announced on Saturday ( Feb 3 ) .
The new degree level Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses is targeted at mid-career Singaporeans with a prior degree qualification in any discipline other than nursing .
In a joint press release , MOH and WSG said the degree will be offered as a two-year Bachelor of Science ( Nursing ) programme at NUS Nursing . The course fees of S $ 74,500 will be fully sponsored and trainees will also receive training allowances of S $ 2,170 to $ 2,520 per month throughout the two years of training , depending on their years of prior work experience .
Upon graduation , trainees will also receive a one-time career transition bonus of S $ 2,000 . An on-the-job training incentive of S $ 18,000 per mid-career degree trained registered nurse will also be provided to employers to enable them to better support these nurses in their transition to a new career , said the press release .
Speaking at the career preview for the degree , Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor said : “ There has been a growing interest in nursing . In recent years , we have seen an increase of about 33 per cent in our total nursing intake from 1,500 in 2012 to around 2,000 in 2017 .
“ The introduction of the new two-year degree level Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses makes it more attractive for mid-career Singaporeans who have a prior degree in other disciplines to join the nursing profession . This is aligned with the Ministry of Health 's effort to build a strong local core of nurses in the healthcare workforce as we face an ageing population and rising incidence of chronic diseases . ”

Assistant professor at the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies Shefaly Shorey had previously attained her nursing diploma from the PCP at Nanyang Polytechnic , and will now lecture degree-level PCP nursing students at NUS .
“ This degree will be preparing for future leaders in nursing . Our curriculum is more at a deeper level – better critical thinkers , better communicators , better clinical decision-makers – those who can lead nurses in the future , ” said Dr Shorey .
The degree will be in addition to the existing two-year accelerated Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses at the diploma level conducted by Nanyang Polytechnic and targeted at mid-career Singaporeans with A-Level and diploma qualifications .
Since 2003 , more than 1,000 mid-career professionals have participated in professional conversion programmes for the healthcare sector . Of these , around 800 took programmes on nursing and 200 on allied health professions , according to the press release .
MOH added that it will continue to work closely with WSG and healthcare industry partners to explore and develop new PCPs for other professions in the healthcare industry .
Applications for the Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses at NUS Nursing are open until Mar 2 .

The Pagani Huayra Roadster is Horacio Pagani 's open-air tribute to the god of wind . If there ever was a drop-top to die for , the Huayra Roadster , which was just revealed ahead of its debut next month at the 2017 Geneva auto show , is probably the one .
“ The pursuit of beauty as a fundamental concept , an unbridled work of art , intelligence and open-air passion , ” founder Horacio Pagani said in a statement .
Here 's what we know about the Pagani Huayra Roadster , aside from its gorgeous looks so far . Like the Huayra coupe , the roadster gets a twin-turbo Mercedes-AMG V-12 engine tuned to produce 754 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque — more than the ultra-limited Huayra BC . The mid-mounted engine is mated to an AMT seven-speed gearbox built by X-Track . Production is limited to just 100 units at roughly $ 2.4 million a pop ( minimum , not including applicable taxes ) , and the run is already sold out , so no need to keep counting your pennies .
The chassis features steel tubes in the front and rear with a Carbo-Titanium and Carbo-Triax HP52 monocoque . The combination of those materials results in “ a 52-percent increase in stiffness , at the same weight , ” according to Pagani . But the roadster does n't weigh the same as the coupe version . At 2,822 pounds , the new model is 176 pounds lighter than the coupe .
The Huayra roadster gets an aggressive lower grille , wider wheel arches , roll bars , a carbon hard top with glass moonroof , and a soft fabric roof that can be installed quickly .
“ If we think of the Huayra Coupe as a personification of elegance and timeless lines , the Huayra Roadster was to be the rebellious sister , shapely and beautiful , but with a sharp edge for those who are careless , ” said a poetic Pagani , in a release .
Its suspension system was designed specifically for the roadster and features a lightweight aluminum alloy , called HiForg .
“ This lightened the car by 25 percent , compared to the Huayra coupe , an extraordinary result for a car already considered the paragon in optimizing power-weight ratio , ” says Pagani .
Brembo carbon ceramic brakes , forged aluminum wheels , with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires — 21 inches in the rear and 20 inches in the front — complete the pricy package .

SEOUL/Moscow - US Vice President Mike Pence put North Korea on notice on Monday , warning that recent US strikes in Syria and Afghanistan showed that the resolve of President Donald Trump should not be tested .
Pence and South Korean acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn , speaking a day after a failed missile test by the North and two days after a huge display of missiles in Pyongyang , also said they would strengthen anti-North Korea defences by moving ahead with the early deployment of the THAAD missile-defence system .
Pence is on the first stop of a four-nation Asia tour intended to show America 's allies , and remind its adversaries , that the Trump administration was not turning its back on the increasingly volatile region .
`` Just in the past two weeks , the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan , '' Pence said in a joint appearance with Hwang .
`` North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region , '' Pence said .
US President Donald Trump took a moment at the White House Easter egg roll Monday to deliver a terse message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un : “ Got to behave . ”
Trump made the off-the-cuff comment to a CNN reporter after kicking off the 139th annual Easter egg roll with First Lady Melania Trump .
“ Any message for North Korea , sir , Kim Jong-Un ? ”
“ Got to behave , ” said Trump .
The US Navy this month struck a Syrian airfield with 59 Tomahawk missiles after a chemical weapons attack . On Thursday , the US military said it had dropped `` the mother of all bombs '' , the largest non-nuclear device it has ever unleashed in combat , on a network of caves and tunnels used by Islamic State in Afghanistan .
Russia on Monday warned Washington against launching a unilateral strike on North Korea , after US Vice President Mike Pence said the era of `` strategic patience '' with Pyongyang was over .
`` This is a very risky path , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a news conference in Moscow . `` We do not accept the reckless nuclear missile actions of Pyongyang that breach UN resolutions , but that does not mean that you can break international law , '' he said . `` I hope that there will not be any unilateral actions like the one we saw recently in Syria . '' China Monday denied any political motive in the cancellation of flights by its flag carrier to North Korea , as pressure mounts on Beijing to help curb Pyongyang 's weapons programmes .
State broadcaster CCTV reported last Friday that Air China had suspended its Beijing-Pyongyang route , leading to speculation the move was intended to pressure the North .
But foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang distanced his government from the decision and said it was purely `` market-based '' . North Korea 's KCNA news agency on Monday carried a letter from leader Kim Jong-un to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad marking the 70th anniversary of Syria 's independence .
`` I express again a strong support and alliance to the Syrian government and its people for its work of justice , condemning the United States ' recent violent invasive act against your country , '' Kim said .
On a visit to the border between North and South Korea earlier in the day , Pence , whose father served in the 1950-53 Korean War , said the United States would stand by its `` iron-clad alliance '' with South Korea .
`` All options are on the table to achieve the objectives and ensure the stability of the people of this country , '' he told reporters as tinny propaganda music floated across from the North Korean side of the so-called demilitarised zone ( DMZ ) . `` There was a period of strategic patience but the era of strategic patience is over . '' Trump acknowledged on Sunday that the softer line he had taken on China 's management of its currency was linked to its help on North Korea .
The United States , its allies and China are working on a range of responses to North Korea 's latest failed ballistic missile test , Trump 's national security adviser said on Sunday , citing what he called an international consensus to act .
China has spoken out against the North 's weapons tests and has supported UN sanctions . It has repeatedly called for talks while appearing increasingly frustrated with the North .
But Pence and Hwang said they were troubled by retaliatory economic moves by China against the deployment in South Korea of a US anti-missile system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) .
South Korea , which accuses China or discriminating against some South Korean companies working in China , and the United States say the sole purpose of THAAD is to guard against North Korean missiles .
China says its powerful radar can penetrate its territory and undermine its security and spoke out against it again on Monday .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing the situation on the Korean peninsula was `` highly sensitive , complicated and high risk '' , adding all sides should `` avoid taking provocative actions that pour oil on the fire '' .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow could not accept North Korea 's `` reckless nuclear actions '' but the United States should not take unilateral action against it .
Trump 's national security adviser , H.R . McMaster , indicated on Sunday that Trump was not considering military action against North Korea for now , even as a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier strike group was heading for the region .
`` It 's time for us to undertake all actions we can , short of a military option , to try to resolve this peacefully , '' he said on ABC 's `` This Week '' programme .
The Trump administration is focusing its strategy on tougher economic sanctions , possibly including an oil embargo , a global ban on its airline , intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang .
Tensions have risen as Trump takes a hard rhetorical line with Kim Jong-un , who has rebuffed admonitions from China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programmes seen by Washington as a direct threat .
China says the crisis is between the United States and North Korea . Lu said China efforts to help achieve denuclearisation were clear , adding : `` China is not the initiator of the Korean peninsula nuclear issue . ''
China banned imports of North Korean coal on Feb. 26 , cutting off its most important export and Chinese media has raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the North if it unleashed more provocations .
Pyongyang has conducted several missile and nuclear tests in defiance of UN sanctions , and has said it has developed and would launch a missile that can strike the US mainland .
US officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology , including miniaturising a nuclear warhead .

Second T20I preview : Fast bowler Billy Stanlake claimed four wickets and captain Aaron Finch blazed his way to an unbeaten half-century as Australia crushed Pakistan by nine wickets in a Twenty20 tri-series match on Monday .
Pakistan , who thumped Zimbabwe by 74 runs in the opening game on Sunday , were stunned by Stanlake 's early burst of 4-8 and were dismissed for 116 .
Earlier , Finch opted to field after winning the toss and Stanlake blew away the top order before Andrew Tye finished off the tail with 3-38 . Shadab Khan top-scored with 29 as Pakistan top order batsmen crumbled against Stanlake 's pace and bounce .
Finch then led Australia to 117-1 in 10.5 overs by smashing six 6s and four 4s in an unbeaten 68 off 33 balls .
`` We had a disappointing tour of the UK . It 's great for us to get a nice start in the series , '' Stanlake said , referring to Australia 's six defeats against England in last month 's five one-day internationals and one-off T20 .
`` My role is to be aggressive up front and take wickets in the powerplay . ''
Finch picked up three slip catches as Pakistan was reduced to 24-4 .
`` The tone the bowlers set with the ball on a pretty good wicket was fantastic , '' Finch said . `` We 've been putting in plans , it did not come off in England , ( but ) it was a pretty polished performance here . ''
Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed said his team 's torrid start was tough to overcome .
`` The toss is very important , if you lose too many wickets in the first six overs , you ca n't survive in the match , '' he said . `` Credit to Stanlake , he bowled with pace and bounce . ''
Australia takes on Zimbabwe in the next match on Tuesday .

Kangana Ranaut on Queen , Manikarnika : Have always taken on diverse roles and broken most stereotypes
New Delhi : Kangana Ranaut 's journey in Bollywood is remarkable with roles that got her National Film Awards thrice . She is now geared up for her next , Manikarnika : The Queen of Jhansi , Mental Hai Kya and a sports drama directed by Ashwini Iyer Tiwari . The actress says she is someone who has always taken on diverse roles , has broken most stereotypes and believes in being off the beaten path .
Talking about Manikarnika : The Queen of Jhansi , Kangana , a Reebok brand ambassador , said in an e-mail interview , `` I met with a nerve-wracking accident while shooting the film . It left me with a scar on my forehead . But when I look back now , I carry this scar with pride . I am nowhere close to Jhansi Ki Rani , but her story definitely gave me courage and strength to do this physically challenging part . ''
`` I am someone who has always taken on diverse roles and broken most stereotypes , '' she added .
Manikarnika : The Queen of Jhansi is an epic biographical film based on the life of Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi . Kangana plays the lead role .
She is also a part of psychological thriller Mental Hai Kya , in which she shares screen space with her Queen co-star Rajkummar Rao . Kangana hopes the audience will like this film too .
`` We really do n't know about success and failure since it is not in our hands , but the script is nice and we are having a good time shooting the film . I hope the audiences like the film , '' said Kangana , who is currently busy filming this project .
After that , she will start working on Ashwini Iyer Tiwari 's sports drama in which she plays a kabaddi player .
`` I am really looking forward to working with her , '' Kangana said .
Experimentation has been a constant in Kangana 's career . She has donned a never-seen-before avatar for a new video campaign for fitness brand Reebok .
The actress is seen flipping tyres , doing handstand push-ups , box jumps , kick boxing and is even seen doing monkey bar exercises on a scaffolding , in a series of videos .
Kangana says fitness is a way of life .
`` I strongly believe that it helps me become a better version of myself physically , while also contributing immensely to my mental strength . The power of the mind is such that once I set my heart and mind on something , I will strive to achieve it no matter what . ''
`` I believe in taking the road less travelled , discovering new things about myself and pushing my own boundaries to reach a newer , better , fitter and stronger space , '' said Kangana , who won the National Film award for Tanu Weds Manu Returns , Queen and Fashion .
The 31- year-old is someone who also faced tough times in Bollywood . But she says that has not changed her as a person .
`` I am a straightforward person . I have always said exactly what is on my mind and voiced my opinion on what I believe is right — whether it is in my personal life , or professional . My experiences , whether good or bad , have definitely helped me evolve and made me who I am today , '' she said .
Working hard and giving her best to everything that she does , have been key to her .
`` The best feeling is being able to do something you think you would n't be able to . It is this high that I enjoy and what pushes me to brave any obstacles laid out for me , '' said Kangana .

Cannes has been memorable this year as I had the opportunity to showcase another side of myself , '' said the actress .

DUBLIN : The agent at the centre of an alleged scheme to illegally pass Ireland 's tickets for the 2016 Rio Olympics to touts was `` not genuine '' and was used to hide the involvement of banned ticket reseller THG , a Irish government report said on Monday .
The Olympic movement was rocked during the Rio Games when Europe 's top official , head of the Olympic Council of Ireland ( OCI ) Patrick Hickey , was arrested in a dawn raid on a luxury beachfront hotel by police investigating the alleged scheme .
Police in Brazil accuse Hickey of operating the ring with Dublin-based PRO10 Sports Management to funnel tickets intended for use by the Irish Olympic committee , and not authorised for resale , to international sports hospitality company THG Sports .
Hickey was released on bail in December . All involved deny wrongdoing .
A report commissioned by the Irish government in the wake of the scandal said on Monday it believed that PRO10 was effectively a front for THG , which had been banned by the organisers of the Rio Games .
`` It appears that Pro10 was not a genuine Authorised Ticket Reseller ( ATR ) but its involvement disguised the continuing role of THG and Marcus Evans as the real or de facto ATR , '' Judge Carroll Moran said in the report .

Evans is a British businessman whose namesake company controls THG .
The report cites Hickey 's personal assistant Linda O'Reilly , as saying it `` would appear that PRO10 was effectively a front or cover to allow Marcus Evans and THG to remain in the picture . ''
THG said in a statement it was satisfied that , at all times , it had `` acted lawfully in connection with the Rio Olympics , or any Olympics , '' but declined further comment .
Hickey , 72 , said in a statement he had received legal advice not to cooperate with the report in order to avoid prejudicing himself in relation to the criminal investigation in Brazil , but said the report contained `` significant inaccuracies . ''
He added that he was `` totally confident '' he would be cleared of all charges .
Hickey 's replacement as OCI president , Sarah Keane , told journalists the report `` did not make easy reading '' but that it neither confirmed nor refuted the possibility that criminal activity took place .
THG REJECTED
THG had been Ireland 's official reseller of tickets for the Olympics in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 .
But the Rio Organising Committee rejected the application of THG to act as reseller for the 2016 Summer Games , saying the fact it was already offering hospitality packages in Brazil breached its rules .
Police last year said they had uncovered emails between Hickey and Evans in which the pair discussed tickets , which police said the ring planned to sell at inflated prices and earn as much as 10 million reais ( 2.42 million pounds ) in profit .
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the emails .
Monday 's report noted that THG paid US $ 1 million ( 771,247.88 pounds ) to be appointed as Ireland 's ticket reseller for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 `` without an explanation being given at the time as to how it would recoup this sum or earn a return on such a large outlay . ''
The report was highly critical of the service provided by PRO10 , particularly to the friends and family of athletes , saying it was `` inadequate and chaotic '' and that PRO10 's services were `` unfit for purpose '' .
The judge said the refusal of THG , PRO10 and Hickey to participate in the preparation of the report was a `` major impediment '' to its work .
On Monday , the OCI 's Keane said a contract was signed with THG to retain its services until the 2026 Winter Olympics and that it was possible THG would take legal action to enforce it .
The organising committee of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games in Korea had rejected THG as Ireland 's authorised ticket seller , she added .
Ireland has been unable to find sponsors for the 2018 Games and will have to fund uniforms from its own resources , she said .

ROCHESTER , NY ( WROC ) – The state attorney general and education commissioner have launched a joint investigation into the circumstances of Trevyan Rowe 's death , officials announced Monday .
“ Treyvan Rowe 's death was a tragedy . His family deserves answers – and all Rochester families deserve to know that their children will be safe at school , ” said Attorney General Schneiderman in a statement . “ We 're partnering with the State Education Department to get to the bottom of what happened and ensure the district 's policies protect our children moving forward . ”
The investigation will review what happened in Trevyan 's case , officials say , and determine what protocols need to change going forward .
Trevyan Rowe , who had autism , was found dead in the Genesee River after wandering away from school days before . Investigators said Rowe had taken a bus to school on March 8 , but never went inside . Despite that fact , the district says he was wrongly marked as “ present ' ” by three teachers .
As a result , the family did n't figure out he was missing until that afternoon when he did n't come home . In the days following his disappearance , hundreds of volunteers joined police to search for Rowe . Three days later , his body was found in the Genesee River .
“ Any time there is a tragic loss of a child , we must look for answers to determine what events and procedures allowed for such a heartbreaking incident to occur , ” said State Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia .
The three teachers have since been placed on leave by the district . 911 employees were also suspended after it was learned 911 calls came in on March 8 for a person on the Freddie-Sue Bridge , but officials say employees did n't follow protocol and dispatch fire and SCUBA crews .
“ The Rochester community deserves to know what happened that allowed a child to a walk away from school and ultimately , tragically lose his life , ” writes Board of Regents Vice Chancellor T. Andrew Brown in a statement . “ The Board of Regents is committed to protecting the safety of all students by ensuring districts are following the proper school safety protocols . ”
Assemblyman Joe Morelle adds , “ It is unacceptable that the current system failed Trevyan and the Rowe family . We must do everything in our power to prevent another tragedy like this from ever occurring again . I am grateful to Attorney General Schneiderman and the State Education Department for their cooperation and dedication to providing peace of mind for our grieving community . ”

South Korean taekwondo athletes have performed for Pope Francis , after a planned show of Korean unity at the Vatican fell apart when the North pulled out at the last minute .
Pope Francis did n't seem to notice or mind , thanking the athletes Wednesday for their exhibition “ which was a show of the will for peace , the two Koreas together . ”
South Korea 's World Taekwondo organization , the Seoul-led international body , said last week that a demonstration team from the North withdrew from the performance over the U.S.-South Korean military drills .
The performance had been planned to ceremonially open the World Taekwondo 's Grand Prix competition this week in Rome .
The South 's team performed for thousands of people in St. Peter 's Square and featured a young girl releasing a dove in a sign of peace .

HONG KONG : A British banker , jailed for life in Hong Kong last year for the murder of two Indonesian women he tortured and raped in his luxury apartment , is due to launch an appeal on Tuesday ( Dec 12 ) .
Rurik Jutting , who is in his early 30s , a former Bank of America employee , had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih , 23 , and Seneng Mujiasih , 26 , in 2014 on grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders .
The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the financial hub .
The jury unanimously found him guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in the former British colony in November last year .
Jutting 's lawyer , Michael Vidler , said the grounds for appeal would focus on the `` directions given by the deputy judge to the jury '' .
Jutting is expected to appear in court .

In strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial , Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known .
He described Jutting as the `` archetypal sexual predator '' who represented an extreme danger to women , especially in the sex trade , and cautioned that the possibility he would murder again if freed would be very likely .
It took the jury , made up of four women and five men , about six hours , including a lunch break , to reach its decision .
Lawyers for Jutting , the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman , had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism had impaired his ability to control his behaviour .
The prosecution rejected this , stating Jutting was able to form judgments and exercise self-control before and after the killings , filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders , bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies .

Play Coming to Cal Lu in Honor of Black History Month
Satire and comedy come together in California Lutheran University 's upcoming show “ Colored Museum , ” a satirical play on the lives of African Americans in the United States . “ Colored Museum ” displays the story of 11 pieces of art , each with a story of struggles that minorities go through on a daily basis throughout time .
The play , as a celebration of Black History Month , is meant to “ put racial discrimination and black history into perspective , ” said Georgia Caines , a theatre arts major who plays two characters in the show .
The play will portray issues from slavery to social and economic injustice throughout the history of this country and is intended to make the audience feel “ uncomfortable , ” said Babatunde Awe , a communication major who will portray a drag queen in the show .
“ It 's important today because sometimes , for all of us in the world , our eyes are closed , because it is easy to have them closed , ” Awe said .
The importance of these stories is to understand the troubles within minority cultures and not fall back into the social stereotypes given throughout history .
“ It will spark conversation that we need , but are avoiding , ” Awe said .
Jordan Bedgood , a communication major at Cal Lutheran with two roles in the play , said , “ Leaving this cultural theme , and all these stories that you tell and getting people to realize that there are ways to look at things in a better light . That 's a powerful way of dealing with that , because they do n't know what to do . ”
The play brings light to not only the discriminations and troubles of those in the story , but also to appreciate how far minorities have come .
“ Let it teach you things , let it show you things and listen to the story , ” Bedgood said . “ Be prepared to have your opinions challenged , but in a good way . ”
The show will be performed Feb. 7-10 at 8 p.m. and Feb. 11 at 2 p.m. Tickets will be sold at the window at the Black Box Studio located between Mount Clef Field and the Mail Center . For more information , call 805-493-3452 .

After the shocking end to the sixth episode of The Handmaid 's Tale Season 2 , the show returned to reveal that Ofglen 's suicide bombing took out more handmaids than commanders , but that 's not to say her sacrifice was for nothing . Amongst the commanders who were killed was Commander Pryce , who was also the leader of the Eyes and Nick 's real boss . With him gone , Commander Cushing stepped in as head of security , but who plays Commander Cushing on The Handmaid 's Tale ? He probably looks familiar .
Canadian actor Greg Bryk plays the latest terrifying Commander . Bryk has had a number of roles , both on the big screen and the small screen , but you may know him best from the Saw films , in which he played Mallick . Bryk was also in the movies The Pawn , Men with Brooms , A History of Violence , Neil , Shoot 'Em Up , The Incredible Hulk , Act of Dishonour , and Lost & Found . Bryk has also had a number of roles on TV . In the early 2000s he starred in the sci-fi mystery drama , ReGenesis , for four seasons . He 's also had notable rules in the series Flashpoint , Covert Affairs , and Rookie Blue , before starring in the short lived drama series , XIII : The Series .
Following that , he made appearances on Nikita , Reign , Fargo , and The Expanse . He then starred in the SyFy original series , Bitten , as Jeremy Danvers , a werewolf . After the show was cancelled , Bryk continued do to TV work with appearances on Wynonna Earp , Mary Kills People , Saving Hope , and starred in the mini-series , Caught , as Cyril Carter . Besides his current role on The Handmaid 's Tale , you can also currently see Bryk on the Netflix series , Frontier , alongside Jason Momoa .
When he 's not acting in film or TV , Bryk also loans his voice to video games . He portrays preacher Joseph Seed in the Far Cry 5 game . In his personal life , Bryk has a beautiful family . He 's been married to his wife , Danielle Bryk , for over 20 years and the couple have three children together . Although Danielle is n't an actress she also works in television as a HGTV Canada host .
Although Bryk appears to be a great guy in real life , it 's fair to say most people hate him as Commander Cushing , and for good reason . In the latest episode of The Handmaid 's Tale , Cushing did things his own way , which basically means he was n't afraid to kill a Martha just reaching to get her ID because he believed she was about to commit some kind of act of terrorism . And with Commander Waterford still in the hospital , June was quite worried about Cushing 's questioning and what that meant for her . A point she made quite clear to Serena , who surprisingly jumped into action .
Enlisting the help of Nick , Serena submitted paperwork on behalf of her husband that accused Cushing of being a terrorist himself , which led him to be picked up by the Eyes . Although this was certainly a win for the ladies , and Waterford 's household as a whole , it 's a little hard to believe this will really be the last we hear from Cushing . Then again , in Gilead , it really only takes a whisper for someone to be accused of treason , and in this case that whisper came from , or at least it looks like it came from , a Commander . That could be enough to send Cushing to his death .
So this may have been Bryk 's final episode on the show , which is great for the characters , but a shame for fans . Bryk played the character well and he was appropriately terrifying . Though I ca n't say Cushing will be missed , it is a little disappointing that fans did n't get to see more of Bryk 's amazing performance in the role .
WASHINGTON : Press Secretary Sarah Sanders ' teared up as she fielded an unexpected question about school shootings from a kid reporter at the White House on Wednesday ( May 30 ) .
Sanders ' voice wobbled and she became visibly upset after 13-year-old Benje Choucroun asked a question about kids feeling unsafe at school .

The cub reporter - on assignment for `` Time for Kids '' - asked what the administration was doing to tackle the scourge of gun violence .
`` At my school , we recently had a lockdown drill , '' Choucroun began , describing the practice of training to hide if a shooter gets in the building .
The drills are a regular occurrence for US kids as young as three , who are sometimes told they are pretending to hide from `` bears '' or `` bad guys '' .
`` One thing that affects mine and other students ' mental health is the worry about the fact that we or our friends could get shot at school , '' Choucroun continued , reading from a written question .

`` Can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies ? ''
Sanders , a mother of three , better known in public for her pugilistic approach to briefings , appeared taken aback by the question .
`` I think that as a kid , and certainly as a parent , there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe . So I 'm sorry that you feel that way , '' she said .
`` This administration takes it seriously , '' Sanders said struggling to continue , before adding that administration was discussing ways to `` do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools and to make them feel safe and make their parents feel good about dropping them off . ''
Early in his administration Trump vowed to tackle gun control , but has since fallen in line with Republican gun lobby groups , backing more security measures in school and even arming teachers .
On Thursday , he is expected to travel to Houston for a campaign event , where he will also meet families involved in the deadly shooting at Santa Fe High School .
Earlier this month a 17-year-old student gunned down eight fellow students and two teachers , just one in a litany of US school shootings .
Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr speaks during a media conference with Iraqi Defense Minister Arfan al-Hayali and Iraq 's Interior Minister Qasim al-Araji ( not pictured ) in Najaf , Iraq May 3 , 2017 .
ERBIL , Iraq , ( Reuters ) - An influential Iraqi Shi'ite cleric plans to visit the United Arab Emirates on Sunday , strengthening his ties with Sunni-ruled states of the Middle East .
It will be the second such trip in as many months for Moqtada al-Sadr , who commands a large following among Iraq 's urban poor . He visited Saudi Arabia at the end of July .
The Emirati government will send a special plane to fly Sadr to the UAE and return him to Iraq , according to a statement on the cleric 's website .
The cleric is one of few Iraqi Shi'ite leaders to keep some distance from Shi'ite Iran , Saudi Arabia 's regional rival and the main backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . In April , Sadr called on Assad to `` take a historic heroic decision '' and step down , to spare his country further bloodshed .
Sadr 's office said his meetings end July with the Saudi crown prince , Mohammed bin Salman , resulted in an agreement to study possible investments in Shi'ite regions of southern Iraq . The Saudis will also consider the possibility of opening a consulate in Iraq 's holy Shi'ite city of Najaf , he said .
Sadr also announced a Saudi decision to donate $ 10 million to help Iraqis displaced by the war on Islamic State in Iraq , to be paid to the Iraqi government .
Baghdad and Riyadh had announced in June they would set up a coordination council to upgrade ties , as part of an attempt to heal troubled relations between the Arab neighbors .
Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2015 following a 25-year break , and Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir made a rare visit to Baghdad in February .

The National Council of Canadian Muslims ( NCCM ) sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau requesting that January 29 be designated as a “ National Day of Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia. ” This was the first anniversary of the attack on the Centre culturel islamique de Québec or CCIQ . Alexandre Bissonnette is charged with having killed six and wounded eight .
In the letter , NCCM Executive Director Ihsaan Gardee says that this horrific act of violence occurred “ solely because the victims were Muslims ” .
The January 29 , 2017 attack was not an isolated event . In June 2016 , a pig 's head was left at the mosque . Three weeks later the mosque 's neighbourhood was pamphleted and labelled as a Muslim Brotherhood centre . Following that , a blog site appeared . This blog also identified the CCIQ as a Muslim Brotherhood centre and raised the question “ which one is more serious , a pig 's head or a genocide ? ” This suggests a connection between these three events .
The January shooting followed and in August 2017 the President of the mosque had his car burned in an arson attack .
The mosque annually donated money ( 2001-2010 ) to the charity International Relief Fund for the Afflicted and Needy ( IRFAN ) . This charity had its status revoked by the Canada Revenue Agency and was declared a terrorism entity by the Government of Canada . The reasons given were that it was set up to fund Hamas , which according to the Hamas Covenant , is one of the wings of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Palestine .
Abdullah Assafiri is a leading figure in the mosque . The mosque has identified him as the “ directeur de la formation et de l'animation religieuse au Centre culturel islamique de Québec. ” He has been a spokesperson for the mosque at government hearings . As was revealed in the Holy Land Relief Fund terrorism funding trials in the USA , the Muslim Brotherhood had a list of its Shura Council members in North America . Among them was Abdullah Assafiri , who was listed as the Masul ( leader ) for “ Canada-East ” . He played no role in the trial .
In his testimony to the Senate of Canada , Muslim Brotherhood expert Dr. Lorenzo Vidino identified the NCCM as a Muslim Brotherhood front group .
NCCM was formerly known as the Council for American Islamic Relations Canada ( CAIR CAN ) . The parent agency of the Ottawa-based NCCM/CAIR CAN is CAIR USA . This has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department , CAIR USA and by the website of NCCM/CAIR CAN itself , which states that the Washington-based CAIR USA is its parent organization . Despite this evidence , Mr. Gardee has testified to the Parliament of Canada and to the CBC that the organizations have no relationship .
CAIR USA was also shown in American court documents to have been founded to support Hamas and it was listed as a terrorism entity by the United Arab Emirates in 2014 .
According to Haroon Siddiqui of the Toronto Star ( former editorial page Editor Emeritus ) , the Muslim Brotherhood does not exist in North America . Mr. Siddiqui quoted Dr. Jamal Badawi for this assessment . Perhaps Mr. Siddiqui was unaware that the North American Muslim Brotherhood lists Dr. Badawi in its 1992 phone book as being on its Shura Council .
The founder of the Muslim Brotherhood , Hassan al-Banna , stated “ it is the nature of Islam to dominate , not to the dominated , to impose its law on all nations and to expend its power to the entire planet. ” Unfortunately , this goal has the consequence of putting Muslim Brotherhood followers into conflict and competition with those who do not submit to their cause .
The shooting at the mosque was a complex event , surrounded as it was by four other traumatic events . These highlight the political nature of the Islamist organization known as the Muslim Brotherhood .
As such , we are left with a question : Was the mosque attacked solely because it was “ Muslim ” or is the situation something more complex ?
Tom Quiggin is a former military intelligence officer , a former intelligence contractor for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a court appointed expert on jihadist terrorism in both the Federal and criminal courts of Canada . The information for this op-ed is derived from the recently published book , SUBMISSION : The Danger of Political Islam to Canada – With a Warning to America , written with co-authors Tahir Gora , Saied Shoaaib , Jonathon Cotler , and Rick Gill with a foreword by Raheel Raza .
De Beers Group said Wednesday it would invest $ 94 million over the next four years to develop a Portland-area facility to craft its own lab-grown diamonds .
The company said a new company , Lightbox Jewelry , will sell pieces featuring the Oregon-grown diamonds for between $ 200 and $ 800 . The facilities will sit on almost eight acres of vacant industrial property in Gresham 's Vista Business Park .
Element Six Technologies Corp. , an Oxford , England-based synthetic diamond technology company owned by De Beers , acquired the site in December from the Port of Portland for roughly $ 2.3 million . At the time , it said the diamond lab would employ about 60 workers .
The full $ 94 million investment would come over the next four years . Once it opens , the plant could produce 500,000-plus rough carats of lab-grown diamonds a year .
`` The line will bring something new and innovative to the jewelry sector , featuring pink , blue and white lab-grown diamonds in a selection of accessibly-priced earring and necklace designs , '' De Beers said in a release .
DeBeers has long been the dominant force in the mined diamonds market , generating about $ 6 billion in annual revenue last year , but is now making a swift play to overtake the synthetic jewelry market .
In a news release , De Beers Group CEO Bruce Cleaver said consumers `` want but are n't getting '' affordable fashion jewelry that wo n't last forever , `` but is perfect for right now . ''
`` Lab-grown diamonds are a product of technology , and as we 've seen with synthetic sapphires , rubies and emeralds , as the technology advances , products become more affordable , '' Cleaver said . `` While it will be a small business compared with our core diamond business , we think the Lightbox brand will resonate with consumers and provide a new , complementary commercial opportunity for De Beers Group . ”
It was n't clear Tuesday how the biggest name in the global diamond trade came to select the Portland-area for a diamond factory , but the region is n't without expertise in the market .
Portland-based MiaDonna and Co. has been making jewelry from its own lab-grown diamonds since 2005 . The seven-person company last year grew sales nearly 20 percent to $ 2.4 million .

Eleven cats were left in cardboard boxes , laundry baskets and kennels outside the Edmonton Humane Society Wednesday morning .
“ While the abandonment of animals happens regularly outside our shelter , this is an unprecedented number for a single day , ” the group explained on Facebook .
It shared photos of the boxes and make-shift cages the cats were found in .
Wednesday 's temperatures were forecast to hover between -5 C and zero .
In the post , the humane society said the act is considered abandonment under the Animal Protection Act of Alberta .
The act says animals are considered abandoned if :
Left more than 24 hours without adequate food , water or shelter ( especially concerning if outdoors during winter temperatures ) ;
Left for five days or more after expected retrieval time from a registered veterinarian , boarding facility , or pet sitter ;
Found in a rental property after the tenancy agreement has ended .
The maximum penalty under the act is a $ 20,000 fine and a lifetime ban on owning pets .
“ We understand that circumstances arise where you may no longer be able to care for a pet and have to consider surrendering it , ” the group wrote . “ We realize this is a very difficult decision , and in the best interest of yourself and the animal we ask that you contact us first by calling 780-229-2935 to discuss your options and make an appointment for surrendering if necessary . Appointments must be made well in advance . ”
The humane society said abandoned animals have to be held for between three and 10 days before they can be processed . However , animals that are surrendered properly can be processed as adoption candidates as soon as they 're admitted and can find a new home faster .
“ Abandoning animals also impacts our capacity at the shelter , and results in having to delay appointments for pet owners who have made the decision to responsibly surrender their animal . ”

The contractor who shut down Donald Trump 's Twitter account has told Reuters he did so by mistake , but says he believes some of the U.S. president 's recent tweets breach the social network 's ban on hate speech .
Bahtiyar Duysak , 28 , said he clicked “ a few wrong things which I should n't have done ” on Nov. 2 , his last day at Twitter , causing Trump 's @ realDonaldTrump account – which has 44 million followers – to be taken offline for 11 minutes .
At the time , Twitter blamed a customer support employee on their last day at work and has since said it has taken steps to prevent such an incident happening again . Trump blamed a “ rogue employee ” for the temporary loss of his account .
In an interview in Frankfurt , Duysak told Reuters he was n't paying attention when a complaint came in an hour before he was to leave Twitter ‘ s San Francisco office for the last time , after cutting short a six-month assignment .

He thought he was dealing with one of many fake Trump accounts .
“ You should always double-check things before taking an action , ” Duysak told Reuters Television .
Twitter has not confirmed whether Duysak was the ex-employee responsible . The company declined to comment on Duysak 's actions or its investigation into the matter when contacted by Reuters .

Duysak said that some of Trump 's posts since the incident – in particular his retweeting of anti-Islamic videos posted by a British far-right fringe group – were a breach of Twitter ‘ s rules banning hate speech .
“ You do n't need to be an expert to understand that a policy violation has happened , that the rules were broken and that this can lead to hatred being spread , ” he said .
Twitter said it had no comment , and the White House did not respond to a request for comment .

After stints at Youtube and Google , Duysak joined Twitter as a safety policy operations agent on July 24 , according to correspondence seen by Reuters . The job involved checking violations ofTwitter ‘ s rules that could not be dealt with by its automatic computer systems .
Duysak , born in Germany to a family of Turkish origin , left the United States a few days after the incident and returned to his home town of Paderborn . He said he had hired a lawyer who liaised with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and assured him he had no case to answer .
He said he had apologized to , and made peace with , Twitter .
With President Rodrigo Duterte suspending anew the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan ( SK ) elections to May next year , expect barangay officials from around the country to work double-time and do what Tagalogs would call as “ pakitang gilas ( strut one 's stuff ) . ”
Such is the case with Barangay Ermita Chairman Felicisimo “ Imok ” Rupinta , whose recent suspension had taught him and his fellow barangay officials not to take the Duterte administration 's anti-drug war for granted .
And sure enough , Rupinta and his crew set about making things right for themselves and their constituents by launching into their own styled anti-drug campaign .
ADVERTISEMENT
This campaign is what yesterday 's Cebu Daily News banner story described as “ reverse labeling , ” a simple spin in which about 100 houses in the Ermita area were posted with posters that labeled them as “ drug free ” while the others who were n't will be invited to a meeting with Rupinta in which he will explain why they did n't receive their “ stamp of approval , ” so to speak .
As Rupinta himself explained it , this is different from the shame campaign conducted by Barangay Pajo in Lapu-Lapu City , which drew the attention of the Commission on Human Rights ( CHR ) .
As expected , Rupinta merely informed the local administration — with whom he 's not friends — and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in Central Visayas ( PDEA-7 ) , whose former chief was responsible for having him and his barangay officials suspended by the Ombudsman .
It 's not hard to speculate as to how Rupinta came up with his campaign . Even if he claims that it was his own initiative , we wo n't be surprised if the idea came from his political allies who are n't exactly friends with the Bando Osmeña-Pundok Kauswagan ( BO-PK ) .
For that 's how Ermita 's anti-drug campaign is rooted , in spite of what Rupinta may claim on the contrary . It 's rooted in politics and political survival , plain and simple . Despite this , the CHR should investigate this campaign .
If Rupinta had been reasonably aggressive in rooting out drugs in Ermita , the barangay would not have been classified as one of Cebu City 's drug hotspots even before the incumbent administration of Mayor Tomas Osmeña took over .
As it is , the failure of Barangay Ermita officials to coordinate with PDEA in last year 's drug raid is a stigma that wo n't be so easily erased with this reverse labeling drug classification campaign .
That stigma tarnishes Rupinta 's claims that there was extensive consultation on the reverse-labeling initiative since the Catholic Church wo n't stand up for it even with that little twist on the shame campaign .
Yet it is enough for the barangay chairman and his councilors to score political brownie points with his political patrons and allies , and in the end , that 's what probably matters more for the officials of Barangay Ermita .

SEOUL : South Korea coach Uli Stielike was sacked on Thursday , two days after a 3-2 loss to Qatar put the country 's hopes of automatic qualification for next year 's World Cup finals in jeopardy .
The 62-year-old former Germany midfielder , who took over on a four-year contract in 2014 , had been under pressure after two defeats in four qualifiers going into Tuesday 's match .
The Korean Football Association ( KFA ) confirmed the decision after a technical committee meeting in Paju , bringing an end to a reign that started on a high but ended with qualification for a ninth successive World Cup far from certain .
KFA technical director Lee Yong-soo also stood down on Thursday .
The loss in Doha leaves the Red Devils just one point ahead of Uzbekistan in second place in Group A of Asian qualifying with two matches remaining . The top two get tickets to Russia .

Third place would offer a passage to the World Cup via a playoff against the team in the same position in the other Asian group with another home-and-away tie against a CONCACAF team to follow .
South Korea host already-qualified Iran in their penultimate qualifier in late August before a trip to Uzbekistan in the final round of matches in early September .
The KFA have not decided yet who will take over as coach for the final two qualifiers .
South Korea have played at the last eight World Cup finals , reaching the semi-finals on home soil in 2002 , but they returned home from Brazil in 2014 without a win .
Stielike was brought in and restored some pride when he led the side at the 2015 Asian Cup , where his team reached the final without conceding a goal before losing to host Australia .
That was the only loss in 2015 for the South Koreans and they cruised through the second round of Asian qualifying with eight wins from eight matches .
A 6-1 friendly thrashing at the hands of Spain in June 2016 was a sign that the once all but impenetrable defence was developing cracks , however .
A 0-0 draw with Syria in September that year followed by a 1-0 defeat to Iran in Tehran made for a disappointing start to the third round of Asian World Cup qualifying and a stunning 1-0 loss to China earlier this year compounded it .

If you have n't remodeled in recent years , you might be surprised to find that new canister-style lights no longer include the traditional recessed receptacle that accepts a screw-in bulb . Rather , the light fixture itself is static , including a ring of LEDs inside a sealed module . When the LEDs eventually die ( after 10 years or so ) , you just replace the whole thing rather than removing and screwing in a new light bulb .
What 's wrong with the old way ? These new designs are considerably smaller than old canisters , are easier to install , and generally look better . ( It also keeps homeowners or renters from subbing in their own power-hungry bulbs . )
But what if you already have older-style canisters in your ceiling ? Eaton 's Halo Connect line offers a smart way to retrofit them , not by merely replacing an old incandescent BR style bulb with an LED , but by sliding in an entirely new downlight fixture that instantly modernizes the old unit .
Eaton Upgrading your recessed incandescent lighting with smart LED cans is relatively easy and not very expensive .
The Halo RL56 Wireless contains everything you need to retrofit a single 5- or 6-inch canister ( 4-inch cans are also available at Amazon ) , not just upgrading the look and replacing it with a modern LED light source , but giving it ZigBee connectivity features , too . To see how well they work , I installed three of the RL56 modules in a master bedroom , replacing three 5-inch canisters .
The biggest drawback of retrofit lighting like this is that installation can be difficult , though the units are at least intended to be simple . In theory , you simply screw an adapter into your old Edison-style socket and connect a pigtail plug to a connector on the LED module . That 's the easy part . From there you must use one of two methods to physically mount the module inside the old canister . Two options are included with the Halo Connect : two pairs of torsion spring brackets , or a trio of friction clips .
Christopher Null / IDG Once connected , spring clips can be used to hold the LED module in place .
Torsion springs work by holding on to clips mounted inside the canister . It turned out that my canisters did n't have these clips , but I managed to get the springs to work anyway as I found they could clip on to the top of the black cylinder inside the can—sort of , anyway . It took some trial and error to get the clips to hang on , and when they did n't grip , they would snap back like a mousetrap , catching my fingers more than once . The friction clips are another option , but these require extra assembly on the user 's part .
The included instructions , like many electrical products , are not written with even the slightest hint of usability in mind . Presented as a lengthy , double-sided sheet of paper in umpteen languages , the document is obtuse and confusing , even after careful reading . For example , a separate ground wire is included in the LED module , but the instructions are unclear when this needs to be connected .
Once installed , it 's time to connect your lights to your smart home hub . As simple ZigBee devices , the Halo lights do n't have their own app , but rather work with your existing hub—including both SmartThings and Wink .
I set the lights up with a Wink Hub 2 , and the process went smoothly . I assumed I 'd need to set them up one at a time , and though this was n't clear , Wink discovered all three lights at once . I did n't notice , though , because it had buried the other two lights at random spots in its device list . It was n't until I 'd disconnected them to try reinstalling them again , one at a time , that I realized my mistake , but eventually I had everything running smoothly .
Christopher Null / IDG This pigtail screws into your old lightbulb socket ; the orange plug attaches to the new LED module .
With the Wink app , I was able to group the lights into a gang that work together , change the color temperature of the light , dim them , and set automatic timers , all in unison . While they can be a bit slow to respond , I 've been impressed with the quality of the light and , particularly , the brightness . While rated at 600 lumens ( 65-watt equivalent ) and drawing less than 10 watts of power , they 're brighter than the 75-watt incandescents they replaced , perhaps in part because the light source is closer to being flush with the ceiling rather than being significantly recessed . The bulbs miss commands from the Wink app from time to time , but it 's hard to tell whether this is Halo 's fault , or Wink 's .
Ultimately , I 'm quite impressed with the kit ( and especially with the price ) , and provided you have a little patience ( and are willing to take a few raps to the knuckles from the spring clips ) , I fully recommend them for anyone looking to upgrade the look—and capabilities—of existing recessed canisters .
Note : These fixtures are also marketed by Eaton subsidiary Cooper Industries as the Halo RL560 .

Bettering last year 's sixth-place finish in the Metro Classic Conference and continuing its sectional streak .
Those are the goals for the unseasoned Catholic Central golf team this spring .
Noting that the “ outlook is bright ” with four freshmen and five sophomores on his 13-player roster , 10th-year coach Matt DeLorme set a realistic goal of finishing in the top half of the conference .
“ We are a young squad with not a lot of varsity experience throughout the team , ” DeLorme said . “ Anything is possible for this team with a little hard work and dedication . ”
Despite ending up sixth in the Metro Classic Tournament and overall standings a year ago , the Hilltoppers did qualify for their third consecutive WIAA Division 3 sectional thanks to a fourth-place finish – by one stroke — in the regional at Morningstar Golf Club in Waukesha .
The Hilltoppers then placed 11th out of 12 teams in the sectional at Blackwolf Run in Kohler .
DeLorme will be counting on his three returning letterwinners to lead the young group – Nick Hoffman , the team 's lone senior , junior John Pum and sophomore Luke Sassano .
Sassano was the team 's No . 2 player last year behind graduated all-conference performer Sean Kramer . Pum , named Academic All-State by the Golf Coaches Association of Wisconsin , was No . 4 .
Senior Bryce Hocking , last year 's No . 3 player who had the team 's low round in the regional , opted not to play this season .
DeLorme singled out the freshman trio of Ben Tweet , Bennett Robson and Brandon Pum as the team 's top newcomers .
The Hilltoppers host the first Metro Classic Mini Meet on April 10 at Brown 's Lake Golf Course .
“ They are a talented group of young athletes who have a passion for the game , ” DeLorme said . “ I look forward to working with them for yet another year . ”

He won the 2012 Champions League , four Premier League titles , five FA Cups , three League Cups and the Europa League with Chelsea .
Lampard , who was capped 106 times for England , is Chelsea 's all-time top goalscorer with 211 goals in over 400 appearances in all competitions .
`` The last man standing of an incredible era for @ chelseafc , '' Lampard wrote on his instagram account . `` What a pleasure to play with the greatest defender in the @ premierleague history .
`` He led the club both on and off the pitch from the moment he made his debut .
`` He set standards for everyone , whether it was demanding excellence in training , fighting for every win or respecting how fortunate we were to play for such a great club . ''

ISLAMABAD - Eight senior and junior officials of the NAB are among the list of 28 witnesses against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar in the corruption reference filed against him in the accountability court regarding the accumulation of assets beyond known sources of income , The Nation has learnt .
According to documents available with The Nation , besides the eight NAB officers , a number of officials of the Election Commission of Pakistan , the National Database and Registration Authority ( NADRA ) , the National Assembly , the Federal Investigation Agency and different banks are among the 28 witnesses against Dar in the corruption reference .
According to the documents available , the NAB has written letters to the witnesses , who belong to different government institutions and banks , to submit the required details regarding the case against Dar .
The NAB has told a witness through a letter , “ you are the prosecution witness in the subject reference , hence it is requested to be available for recording of evidence along with necessary record ” . The notice has been issued by the officer in-charge of the “ Witness Handling Cell ” of the NAB . Sources said that several witnesses have submitted the required record about Dar and his family to the NAB .
According to the documents , NAB eight senior and junior officers — Shakeel Anjum Nagra Additional Director ( Coordination ) Operations Division , NAB Headquarters Islamabad ; Umar Draz Gondal , Sub-Inspector Police Station NAB Lahore ; Zafar Iqbal Mufti , Banking Expert Nab Lahore ; Muhammad Adeel Akhtar , Assistant Director NAB Lahore ; Zavar Manzoor , Assistant Director NAB Lahore ; Iqbal Hassan , Deputy Director NAB Lahore ; Obaid Simon , Assistant Director NAB Lahore , and Nadir Abbasi Assistant Director/Investigation Officer NAB Lahore — are the witnesses in the reference against Dar .

Rampur : Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said the BJP government in the state had , in ten months , achieved development goals which were not achieved by the former BSP and SP dispensations during their long tenures .
Addressing a public gathering , he attacked the Congress , the SP and the BSP for allegedly exploiting and dividing voters through caste politics and appeasement to suit their needs .
Adityanath said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a very clear message against appeasement policies .
The chief minister said the BJP government in the state had achieved development goals in the last ten months which the SP and the BSP could not achieve during their long tenures .
He also enumerated several welfare schemes of the government , including enhancement of pension for 'Divyangs ' from Rs 300 to Rs 500 .
He also hit out at former state minister Azam Khan , without naming him , over the `` hooliganism '' allegedly prevailing in the city .
Adityanath alleged that the worst type of hooliganism existed in the city as shops and residences of people were demolished `` mercilessly '' .
He also hit out at the previous government , alleging that on the pretext of constructing a jail , it had planned to displace 250 families from a colony .
Adityanath termed it as anarchy and said that as long as the BJP was in power such incidents would not occur .
Panaji : The Bombay High Court on Wednesday issued notice to the central and the Goa governments over a petition filed by meat traders challenging the newly-introduced restrictions on cattle trade .
Quraishi 's Meat Traders ' Association of Goa challenged in the Goa bench of the high court the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( Regulation of Livestock Markets ) Rules , 2017 , contending that they violate the right to carry on trade and the freedom of religion under the Constitution .
Among other things , the association challenged rule 22 which provides that purchaser of cattle shall not sacrifice the animal for any religious purpose .
The Goa Animal Preservation Act , 1995 permits slaughter of bovines subject to compliance of certain conditions , and the Union government has no powers to make rules on matters pertaining to protection and preservation of livestock , the petition said .
WASHINGTON : Unusually high temperatures last month prompted a sharp decline in the need for heating , which dragged down overall US industrial output in January , the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday .
The decline in output for utilities , `` largely because of unseasonably warm weather , '' also impacted other sectors , as did the reduced production of automotive products , including vehicles and parts , the report said .
The Industrial Production index fell 0.3 per cent in January compared to December , reversing half of the previous month 's increase . Analysts forecast no change in output .
The utilities sector plunged 5.7 per cent , erasing all of the December gain . But mining increased 2.8 per cent , boosted by an 8.5 per cent increase in oil and gas drilling .
But manufacturing showed only a modest 0.2 per cent increase in output . A 2.9 per cent fall in production of vehicles and parts offset gains in other areas of manufacturing , such as machinery , textiles , petroleum and coal .
Production of consumer goods fell 0.8 per cent while construction materials were up 0.9 per cent .
Industrial capacity in use during the latest month slipped slightly to 75.3 per cent from 75.5 per cent in December .

While the X-Men spinoffs Deadpool 2 and New Mutants have been slowly revealing new details and bits of casting , word has been largely quiet on Dark Phoenix , the next film in the main X-Men saga . Production is set to get underway this summer , but we did n't know who would be starring or even who was directing , although it was rumored that longtime producer and writer Simon Kinberg would be making his directorial debut on the feature .
Now it looks like all engines are go for Dark Phoenix . Deadline reports that Kinberg is officially set to direct his own screenplay ( we reported back in February that he was circling the project ) , and most of the main players from X-Men : Apocalypse—Jennifer Lawrence ( Mystique ) , Michael Fassbender ( Magneto ) , James McAvoy ( Professor X ) , Nicholas Hoult ( Beast ) , Alexandra Shipp ( Storm ) , Sophie Turner ( Jean Grey ) , Tye Sheridan ( Cyclops ) , and Kodi Smit-McPhee ( Nightcrawler ) —are set to return ( the notable absence is Evan Peters , who plays Quicksilver ) . Filming is set to take place in Montreal .
For those unfamiliar with the Dark Phoenix story from the comics , it involves Jean Grey , whose powers become seriously amplified when she comes into contact with a cosmic entity known as the Phoenix . It eventually took over her personality , turning her into the “ Dark Phoenix ” that the X-Men had to defeat .
The Dark Phoenix previously appeared in X-Men : The Last Stand ( co-written by Kinberg ) , but was changed to be a split personality that Professor X buried in Jean Grey 's psyche . The Phoenix emerged when Jean Grey came back from the dead and was manipulated into working alongside Magneto .
It appears that Dark Phoenix will be going in drastically different direction ( although one that should be familiar to fans of the comics ) , and taking the X-Men universe cosmic with THR reporting that Jessica Chastain is in talks to play the villain , “ Lilandra , the empress of an alien empire called the Shi'ar , who leads the quest to imprison and execute Dark Phoenix , leading her into conflict with the X-Men . ”
That 's an impressive gathering of talent for a story that 's going to be heavily VFX driven , which is even more surprising when you consider that X-Men : Apocalypse was critically panned ( 48 % on Rotten Tomatoes ) and it made significantly less than X-Men : Days of Future Past . Rather than the franchise fading , it appears to be resurgent .
I 'm not sure if everyone just wants to go out on a high note or if Fox gave a dump truck full of money to Lawrence , Fassbender , McAvoy , and Hoult ( whose contracts expired after Apocalypse ) , but Dark Phoenix shows no signs of slowing down .
Dark Phoenix is set to open on November 2 , 2018 .
Bloc Party fans : Are you hoping for a miracle ? If you live in Europe , today might be your lucky day .
The British rock band 's 2005 debut album Silent Alarm is one of the greatest documents of Great Britain 's flourishing , pop-minded garage rock and post-punk scene in the aughts . The riffs , the drums , the world-conquering anthems : Silent Alarm is that good shit — so good Bloc Party have never come close to topping it in the 13 years since ( even if A Weekend In The City had some jams ) . Many of us who loved that album at the time still feel a deep nostalgia for it , and now the band is capitalizing on that nostalgia by taking its masterpiece on tour .
Thus far the Silent Alarm tour only constitutes six European and UK dates this October . Presumably they 'll do an American version of this jaunt if they have any interest in ( a ) making me happy and ( b ) making lots of money . In the meantime , this is it : Amsterdam , Paris , Berlin , Brussels , Dublin , and London . Bloc Party battalion , cross your fingers that current time-keeper Louise Bartle can pull off Matt Tong 's insane beats and fills , and plan your travel accordingly . Tickets go on sale this Friday .
TOUR DATES :
10/15 Amsterdam , NL @ AFAS Live
10/16 Paris , FR @ Le Zenith
10/18 Berlin , DE @ Columbiahalle
10/20 Brussels , BE @ Forest National
10/22 Dublin , IE @ 3 Arena
10/24 London , UK @ Alexandra Palace
Animal Collective also announced a Sung Tongs tour today , so I am assuming every album I ever loved in college will be performed on the road this year at some point . How about Funeral next ?

HAVANA : Cuba paid tribute to late leader Fidel Castro on Monday ( Jan 2 ) with a military parade to mark the 58th anniversary of the revolution that brought him to power .
Castro , who died on Nov 25 at age 90 , launched his nearly half-century rule with a guerrilla uprising that forced US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista from power on Jan 1 , 1959 .
Cuba marks the anniversary with a military parade every year - though this year soldiers marched without their equipment , unlike previous years when guns , tanks and missiles have sometimes starred .
Tens of thousands of soldiers , militia members , students and workers marched at Revolution Square in Havana .

Some carried a giant banner reading `` We are Fidel , '' others waved large photos of the revolutionary leader - who had requested that no cult of personality be created around him .
In keeping with his wishes , Cuba 's legislature , the National Assembly of People 's Power , unanimously passed a law last month banning monuments in his honor and infrastructure named for him .
The communist island is facing a difficult year in 2017 , which marks the last full year in power for Raul Castro , the younger brother who replaced Fidel when he stepped down in 2006 . Raul Castro has vowed to step aside when his current term ends next year .
The economy , which shrank 0.9 per cent in 2016 , has been hurt by the economic crisis in Venezuela , the island 's key backer , whose discount oil exports once kept Cuba afloat .
Meanwhile , Cuba 's historic rapprochement with the United States is under threat from US President-elect Donald Trump , who has vowed to halt the thaw if the Castro regime does not allow more democratic freedoms and economic reforms .
`` Cuba will not renounce a single one of its principles , '' student leader Jennifer Bello said defiantly in a keynote address at the parade , as Raul Castro and top military commanders looked on .
Fully normalising ties with the United States will be a `` long process , '' and `` much remains to be done , '' said Bello , who is a member of Cuba 's powerful Council of State .

GAZA CITY - Calm returned to the Gaza Strip and nearby Israeli communities on Wednesday after the worst military flare-up since a 2014 war raised fears of yet another full-blown conflict in the beleaguered Palestinian enclave .
The exchange of fire on Tuesday and into the early hours of Wednesday began with a barrage of rocket and mortars into Israel from Gaza .
Israel said it targeted some 65 militant sites in the Gaza Strip . It also said around 100 rockets and mortars fired from Gaza either exploded in Israel or were intercepted by air defences .
Three Israeli soldiers were wounded , one moderately and two lightly , the military said . There were no reports of casualties in Gaza .
Late Tuesday , an Islamic Jihad spokesman said a ceasefire had been reached , and on Wednesday senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya also spoke of an accord . Though Israeli officials denied being part of a ceasefire , calm was maintained on Wednesday .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel 's military had delivered the “ harshest blow ” in years to Gaza militants .
“ Since yesterday , the army has responded forcefully to fire from the Gaza Strip with attacks against dozens of targets of terrorist organisations in the harshest blow that we have dealt them in years , ” Netanyahu said at an event in Tel Aviv , according to his office .
Tuesday 's violence followed weeks of deadly unrest along the border between Israel and the blockaded Palestinian enclave .
In a rare joint statement , Hamas and Islamic Jihad declared shared responsibility for the rocket and mortar fire , saying it was in retaliation for Israeli attacks targeting their positions . Three Islamic Jihad members were killed in an Israeli strike Sunday , and the group vowed revenge . Islamic Jihad is the second-largest armed group in Gaza after Hamas .
Kuwait on Wednesday blocked a US-drafted UN Security Council statement that would have strongly condemned Palestinian rocket firings from the Gaza Strip on Israel that triggered the worst military flareup since a 2014 war .
The United States had circulated the draft text ahead of an emergency council meeting , to be held later Wednesday at Washington 's request , on the rocket and mortar attacks by Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
Kuwait , a non-permanent council member that represents Arab countries , said that it was blocking the statement to allow for consideration of a draft resolution it has put forward on the protection of Palestinian civilians .
In an email to the US mission seen by AFP , Kuwait said : “ We can not agree to the text put forth by your delegation especially as we are considering a draft resolution that deals with the protection of civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories and the Gaza Strip . ”
Kuwait earlier this month blocked another US-proposed statement that criticized Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas ' remarks about Jews as “ unacceptable. ” Israel on Wednesday approved construction of 1,958 new settler homes in the occupied West Bank , Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now told AFP .
It was fewer than the 2,500 for which Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week he intended to seek approval . It was the first tranche of settlement approvals since the controversial US embassy transfer to Jerusalem on May 14 , a move that infuriated Palestinians and intensified protests on the Gaza border , with at least 61 Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli forces that day .
Early Tuesday , some 28 mortar shells were fired toward Israel from the Gaza Strip .
Israel said most were intercepted by its air defence systems but put residents in the area on high alert , ordering them to stay within 15 seconds of shelters .
One mortar shell exploded near a kindergarten building , a military spokesman said , damaging the structure . No children were present at the time .
Israel 's military began air strikes soon after .
Later in the day , further rockets and mortar rounds from Gaza were intercepted or exploded in Israel , the army said .
It said some of the mortars fired were supplied by Iran .
On Tuesday night , a rocket hit an Israeli home near the Gaza border , but no one was hurt , the military said .
Israel 's military said it hit “ military targets ” including a tunnel stretching into its territory , weapons stores and militant bases .
Hamas said in a statement Tuesday that “ what the resistance carried out this morning comes within the framework of the natural right to defend our people ” .
The military flare-up followed weeks of deadly demonstrations and clashes along the Gaza-Israel border , beginning on March 30 .
The protests demanded that Palestinians who fled or were expelled in the 1948 war surrounding Israel 's creation be allowed to return to their former homes , now inside Israel .
They peaked on May 14 , when at least 61 Palestinians were killed in clashes as tens of thousands of Gazans protested the US transfer of its embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem the same day .
Low-level demonstrations and clashes have continued since .
At least 122 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the unrest . No Israelis have been killed .
Israel says its actions are necessary to defend its borders , accusing Hamas of encouraging thousands of Palestinians to break through the border and attack Israelis .
But Israel has faced international criticism and calls for an independent investigation over its use of live fire during the protests and border clashes .
Canada 's soldiers are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for us .
At the very least , you 'd think the government of Canada could in turn offer them fast and efficient public service . Apparently not .
Veterans Affairs Canada has royally screwed up at processing veterans ' disability benefits applications . As Canadian Press reported Monday : “ Veterans Affairs Canada says there were about 29,000 applications for disability benefits in the queue waiting to be processed at the end of November — a nearly 50 % increase since the end of March . ”
This leaves all of these former Canadian Armed Forces members waiting for months to learn whether or not they 'll receive these payments .
A popular Liberal government talking point is to blame the former Conservative government for all of their problems . In this case , there would be some truth to that as the previous government did cut departmental funding .
But now is not the time for partisan political talking points .
Justin Trudeau is the PM and the Liberals are in power . We do n't want to hear the blame passed around . We do n't want to hear how two wrongs make a right . We want action and solutions .
The truth is that successive governments have failed on this file . Trudeau should avoid becoming the newest on the list . The Liberals have hired new employees at the department , now they need to make sure they get the job done .
Canadians should n't hold their breath though . It seems this is not the only task at Veterans Affairs Canada plagued with managerial ineptness .
A Postmedia story by Tom Spears exposes the dreadful conditions that unraveled at an April 9 event marking the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge .
While 25,000 Canadians were in France to pay tribute to the battle that 's said to have made our nation , they were lucky if they heard the service . They were lucky if they got their hands on food . Or a bathroom . Or shade .
Spears sourced the hundreds of pages of complaint letters the department received from Canadians attending the event , one that saw elderly people stranded for hours , hungry and tired , some even suffering heatstroke due to poor event management .
These stories are unacceptable . Canada 's veterans deserve much , much better .
Sebastien Normandin wanted for attempted murder in relation to a 2016 incident in Victoria
International police operation Interpol have listed a Victoria man as a person of interest .
Sebastien Jack Pierre Normandin , 47 , was the suspect of a domestic violence incident in Victoria in late December of 2016 .
Normandin fled at the time despite two counts of attempted murder , allegedly in connection with a serious vehicle collision involving a former girlfriend that occurred at 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 27 of 2016 . Police were called to the collision in the 1000 block of Gillespie Place in Victoria .
The 1.9-metre-tall ( 6-foot-5 ) , 200-pound Normandin has been reported as the same Normandin who missed bail in the fall and who posts semi-regularly to social media , has a PhD in history and makes philosophical posts .
Normandin has a red notice status with Interpol – an equivalent to an international warrant – and is believed to have fled Canada to another country .
He 's wanted for attempt murder ( times two ) , assault causing bodily harm , criminal harassment , dangerous operation of a motor vehicle , assault causing bodily harm , assault and failure to comply with conditions .
A British cybersecurity expert who scuppered a global ransomware attack has thanked his supporters in his first public comments since his arrest in the US .
Marcus Hutchins praised the `` incredible show of support '' online using his newly relaxed bail conditions that allow him internet access after he appeared in court in Milwaukee on Monday to deny creating and sharing the Kronos banking malware .
The 23-year-old from Ilfracombe , Devon , was arrested on August 2 in Las Vegas 's McCarran airport as he returned from the Def Con hacking convention .
He tweeted : `` There 's a lot of people I 'd like to thank for amazing support over the past 11 days , which I will do when I get a chance to publish my blog .
`` I 'm still on trial , still not allowed to go home , still on house arrest ; but now I am allowed online . Will get my computers back soon . ''
He also cracked a joke with a list of things to do during Def Con , including partying , renting supercars , visiting Red Rock Canyon - and being `` indicted by the FBI '' .
After the hearing where he entered six not guilty pleas , defence lawyer Marcia Hofmann said she is confident he will be found not guilty at a trial .
She said : `` Marcus Hutchins is a brilliant young man and a hero .
`` He is going to vigorously defend himself against these charges and when the evidence comes to light , we are confident that he will be fully vindicated . ''
Hutchins , also known as MalwareTech , is accused of creating and distributing the banking trojan between July 2014 and July 2015 alongside another defendant , who has not been named and is at large .
In May this year , Hutchins was hailed a hero for curbing the WannaCry ransomware attack that infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries and crippled the NHS .
Prosecutor Dan Cowhig told an earlier court hearing that Hutchins admitted to interviewers that he created the code and hinted that he sold it .
Hutchins , who works for Los Angeles-based computer security firm Kryptos Logic , was freed on a 30,000 US dollar ( £23,000 ) bail .
His bail conditions now allow him to travel around the US and live in Los Angeles so he can be near his legal team ahead of his trial , which has been set to begin on October 23 .
Japan 's education ministry on Thursday it had found documents that could back up opposition parties ' suspicion that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe used his influence to unfairly help a friend set up a business .
TOKYO : Japan 's education ministry on Thursday it had found documents that could back up opposition parties ' suspicion that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe used his influence to unfairly help a friend set up a business .
Abe has repeatedly denied abusing his authority to benefit his friend and his grip on power is not in danger . But the affair has chipped away at Abe 's support , according to opinion polls , and it looks unlikely to fade away .
`` I am taking this result seriously , '' Education Minister Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference , referring to the unearthing of the documents during a second investigation , after an initial one found nothing .
The Asahi newspaper reported last month that it had obtained documents showing that the Cabinet Office had told the education ministry that Abe wanted a new veterinary school run by a friend to be approved .
The report led to opposition questions about the process by which the government decided to allow a veterinary department to be set up in a state special economic zone , since the government has not approved such departments in decades because of concern about a glut of veterinarians .

Opposition politicians and the media have identified Abe 's friend as Kotaro Kake , the director of the Kake Educational Institution , which wants to open the veterinary department .
An official at the institution declined to make immediate comment on Thursday , and Kake was not available for comment .
The Kake Educational Institution issued a statement last month saying it was following the procedure necessary to set up a veterinary department and it abided by the law .
Abe told parliament that being a friend of the school operator did not mean he had helped the institution get permission to open a new school .
The affair is Japan 's second political controversy linked to a school in recent months . In the other case , an educational group with ties to Abe 's wife got what critics said was a favourable land deal to build a school .
Abe 's wife , Akie , and Abe denied any wrongdoing in connection with that case .
A voter survey by public broadcaster NHK showed on Monday that 48 percent of those polled said they supported the Abe government , down three percentage points from a month ago , while the disapproval rating for the government rose six percentage points to 36 percent .

Jennifer Aniston is adamant that she always wears a bra .
In a new interview with Vogue , Aniston , 48 , reacted to being deemed “ the OG of # FreeTheNipple ” because of her nipples ' appearances throughout her 10-season run on “ Friends . ”
“ Yeah , I do n't know what to say about that ! It 's just one of those things , I guess , ” she told the magazine . “ I wear a bra , I do n't know what to tell ya ! And I do n't know why we 're supposed to be ashamed of them — it 's just the way my breasts are ! But hey , OG , I 'm not going to complain ! ”
She added that people should tune out superficial criticisms .
“ In my own brain , I 've shifted my perspective , so who gives a s–t ! If you 're going to walk out and have your nipples showing , or your belly is a little bloated , or you 're not at the weight you want to be — you are perfect no matter what you are and no matter where you are and who cares ! ”

BARCELONA ( Reuters ) - Cristiano Ronaldo scored a sensational goal and was then sent off for a combination of his provocative celebration and for diving as Real Madrid beat Barcelona 3-1 in an explosive Spanish Super Cup first leg on Sunday .
Gerard Pique scored an own goal early in the second half to give Real the lead in the annual curtain raiser between the Liga champions and the King 's Cup holders although Lionel Messi looked to have saved his blushes by scoring a controversial penalty in the 77th minute after Luis Suarez was fouled .
Substitute Ronaldo rattled in a sensational strike from outside the area three minutes later to restore the Liga and European champions ' advantage , earning a booking for removing his shirt and mimicking Messi 's celebration at the Santiago Bernabeu in last April 's Clasico .
Ronaldo was given a second yellow card moments later for diving to attempt to win a penalty and will miss Wednesday 's second leg at the Bernabeu . After he was ordered off , the Portuguese pushed referee Ricardo De Burgos Bengoetxea in frustration .
Barça rallied late in search of an equaliser but Spanish forward Marco Asensio instead extended Madrid 's advantage in the tie with a scorching strike from outside the area in the 90th minute to cap a thrilling second half .
`` These games are like this , you switch off for one second and relax and loads of things happen , but I 'm very happy with the game , '' said Real captain Sergio Ramos .
`` We 're fighting for a trophy and this is an important step . ''
Barça midfielder Sergio Busquets said : `` A 3-1 defeat at home is very difficult to take ; the tie seems very tough for us now but we 'll try and make a go of it , even though we 've made it almost impossible for us .
`` Whoever scores first in these games has a huge advantage , and Madrid did very well on the counter-attack . ''
The highly entertaining second period was in stark contrast to a sleepy opening 45 minutes which lacked the atmosphere associated with football 's biggest rivalry due to the game not selling out and with a large number of tourists present .
Barça failed to sparkle , with Gerard Deulofeu proving an unfit substitute for the departed Neymar , while Real looked lightweight up front without Ronaldo , who began on the bench , and lacking creativity in the absence of the suspended Luka Modric .
The game burst into life after the break , however .
Pique , who scored the winner in the pre-season Clasico in Miami and who has so often turned up the heat in the rivalry both on and off the pitch , inadvertently broke the deadlock by diverting Marcelo 's cross into his own net .
Barça suddenly woke up and were denied an equaliser due to a brilliant double save by Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas .
The Costa Rican was left fuming moments later though when he was adjudged to have brought down Suarez , with the Uruguayan appearing to dive to win the penalty .
Messi levelled from the spot , scoring for the first time against Real at the Nou Camp since 2012 , but he was soon upstaged at the other end by Ronaldo .
Asensio had the last word , however , the 21-year-old producing a stunning strike and putting Madrid well in charge in their pursuit of a first Super Cup since 2012 .

REUTERS : Stoke City winger Ibrahim Afellay is uncertain where he will ply his trade next season , as there has been no movement in terms of extending his contract beyond the current campaign with the Premier League club .
The injury-prone Dutchman has featured regularly since he returned in December from an eight-month spell on the sidelines for a knee problem , making five of his nine appearances so far from the bench .
`` No news at the moment . For this kind of question you have to ask my agent . I only focus on my work on the pitch and I work very hard every day , '' the 30-year-old Afellay told British media when asked if he would like to remain .
`` That 's the only answer I can give at the moment . It 's a nice club , of course , but for the moment I can say nothing . I am focused on the job on the pitch . The rest is not for me . ''
Stoke , who are ninth in the table after 25 games , travel to face third-placed Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday Feb.26 .

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) - The agent at the centre of an alleged scheme to illegally pass Ireland 's tickets for the 2016 Rio Olympics to touts was `` not genuine '' and was used to hide the involvement of banned ticket reseller THG , a Irish government report said on Monday .
The Olympic movement was rocked during the Rio Games when Europe 's top official , head of the Olympic Council of Ireland ( OCI ) Patrick Hickey , was arrested in a dawn raid on a luxury beachfront hotel by police investigating the alleged scheme .
Police in Brazil accuse Hickey of operating the ring with Dublin-based PRO10 Sports Management to funnel tickets intended for use by the Irish Olympic committee , and not authorised for resale , to international sports hospitality company THG Sports .
Hickey was released on bail in December . All involved deny wrongdoing .
A report commissioned by the Irish government in the wake of the scandal said on Monday it believed that PRO10 was effectively a front for THG , which had been banned by the organisers of the Rio Games .
`` It appears that Pro10 was not a genuine Authorised Ticket Reseller ( ATR ) but its involvement disguised the continuing role of THG and Marcus Evans as the real or de facto ATR , '' Judge Carroll Moran said in the report .
Evans is a British businessman whose namesake company controls THG .
The report cites Hickey 's personal assistant Linda O'Reilly , as saying it `` would appear that PRO10 was effectively a front or cover to allow Marcus Evans and THG to remain in the picture . ''
THG said in a statement it was satisfied that , at all times , it had `` acted lawfully in connection with the Rio Olympics , or any Olympics , '' but declined further comment .
Hickey , 72 , said in a statement he had received legal advice not to cooperate with the report in order to avoid prejudicing himself in relation to the criminal investigation in Brazil , but said the report contained `` significant inaccuracies . ''
He added that he was `` totally confident '' he would be cleared of all charges .
Hickey 's replacement as OCI president , Sarah Keane , told journalists the report `` did not make easy reading '' but that it neither confirmed nor refuted the possibility that criminal activity took place .
THG REJECTED
THG had been Ireland 's official reseller of tickets for the Olympics in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 .
But the Rio Organising Committee rejected the application of THG to act as reseller for the 2016 Summer Games , saying the fact it was already offering hospitality packages in Brazil breached its rules .
Police last year said they had uncovered emails between Hickey and Evans in which the pair discussed tickets , which police said the ring planned to sell at inflated prices and earn as much as 10 million reais ( $ 3.14 million ) in profit .
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the emails .
Monday 's report noted that THG paid $ 1 million to be appointed as Ireland 's ticket reseller for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 `` without an explanation being given at the time as to how it would recoup this sum or earn a return on such a large outlay . ''
The report was highly critical of the service provided by PRO10 , particularly to the friends and family of athletes , saying it was `` inadequate and chaotic '' and that PRO10 's services were `` unfit for purpose '' .
The judge said the refusal of THG , PRO10 and Hickey to participate in the preparation of the report was a `` major impediment '' to its work .
On Monday , the OCI 's Keane said a contract was signed with THG to retain its services until the 2026 Winter Olympics and that it was possible THG would take legal action to enforce it .
The organising committee of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games in Korea had rejected THG as Ireland 's authorised ticket seller , she added .
Ireland has been unable to find sponsors for the 2018 Games and will have to fund uniforms from its own resources , she said .

A poorly worded online solicitation seeking donations to support medical costs for an ill youngster is not from ARRL and is a scam ! Some members have reported receiving an email with the subject line “ Help Support Dawn , ” dated on or about June 30 , stating that “ Dawn ” is the critically ill son of an ARRL member and requires urgent surgery .
“ ARRL would never send an unsigned email like this to our members , ” said ARRL CEO Barry Shelley , N1VXY . “ This is clearly a hoax , and we would never solicit for private causes in this fashion . To prey on the willingness of our members to help other hams in need , is particularly despicable . ”
The attempt to solicit funds through GoFundMe and PayPal may be aimed at collecting personal and credit card information . ARRL members are urged not to repost , forward , or respond to this request .
The Tier 1 ( General ) visa , meant for highly skilled professionals who needed a minimum point score to qualify , was shut by Theresa May in 2011 , when she was home secretary .
LONDON – Indian doctors , IT engineers , teachers and other skilled professionals in the UK joined a demonstration against the Home Office outside Downing Street on Tuesday , protesting against the problems they face on their continued stay in a visa category closed in 2011 .
The Tier 1 ( General ) visa , meant for highly skilled professionals who needed a minimum point score to qualify , was shut by Theresa May in 2011 , when she was home secretary . Professionals from Pakistan , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , and other countries were also present at the demonstration .
Aditi Bhardwaj , one of the organisers of the protest , told Hindustan Times that the future of hundreds of Indian professionals and their families was uncertain after they spent nearly a decade in Britain , contributing taxes and skills the country needed .
“ These are people who have spent over a decade here , working in highly reputed professions , many of which have serious employee shortages . They have devoted their professional lives contributing to the growth of Great Britain , ” she said .
“ They have made the UK their home , bought properties , invested in businesses . They all are law-abiding citizens . None have been convicted of any criminal offence . ”
Apart from inordinate delays in processing applications for indefinite leave to remain ( ILR ) , the professionals allegedly face refusal on grounds such as rectification of tax returns being considered evidence that their “ character and conduct ” is undesirable .
Bhardwaj said : “ Skilled migrants with excellent educational and professional skills are being refused ILR on the ground of ‘ tax error rectification ' because of small errors they have made in their tax returns in the past , which they have long ago rectified and paid off .
“ Tax error rectification is not illegal or unlawful anywhere in the world , and not even in the UK Financial Act , 2007 . ”
The protestors also said that the policies of the Home Office towards them were discriminatory , hostile and inhumane .
Overall , nearly 600 non-EU professionals were said to be affected , with more likely to come forward with their cases in the near future .
Some of those affected had applied for a judicial review of the rules being applied to them , but Bhardwaj said they were yet to get a date when it would be heard . Seeking such a review affects a migrant 's right to work , which imposed further constraints .
However , a Home Office spokesperson said : “ We aim to resolve all visa applications as quickly as possible and we continue to meet service standards for straightforward applications .
“ It is vital , however , that the correct decisions are made , particularly with complex tier-1 applications that require detailed consideration and verification of evidence with HMRC ( tax authorities ) . These robust checks are essential to avoid the potential abuse of our immigration or tax system . Where such abuse is identified , we will act accordingly . ”
Umodzi Party leader Professor John Chisi says his party is ready to work with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) claiming the two parties have similar manifesto and agenda .
Speaking in an interview on Friday , Chisi said there is no different with what his party would have done if won the 2014 tripartite elections with whatever the ruling DPP government is currently doing .
He mentioned about issues of building technical colleges in each constituency as one of the similar development plan in the two parties ' manifesto .
“ We are ready to work with DPP if they want us . We have one agenda and manifesto but we shall wait from them , “ he said .
He then commended the government of professor Peter Mutharika for commissioning the gensets saying this is good development for Malawi especially at this time when the country is facing persistence blackouts .
The Umodzi Party leader said this will create business and there will be employment as investors will come to invest in the country .
Chisi said his party can not work with the main opposition Malawi Congress Party ( MCP ) because he is not aware of its manifesto .
He declared to contest as a member of parliament for Blantyre City South east constituency under his party .
DPP spokesperson Francis Katsaira was not picking his mobile phone for a comment .
Chisi is well known in attacking MCP and its leader Dr Lazarus Chakwera on Malawi Broadcasting Cooperation ( MBC ) television and radios .
WASHINGTON – House Speaker Paul Ryan has highlighted on Twitter a school secretary benefiting from the Republican tax overhaul , then deleted the tweet after online criticism that he is cheering an increase of $ 1.50 a week .
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that changes in tax withholding were sparking bigger paychecks , citing as one example Julia Ketchum of Lancaster , Pennsylvania , whose check went up $ 1.50 a week .

Ryan on Saturday posted a Tweet noting the secretary 's increase and linking to the AP story . He has posted several other examples of worker pay increases and bonuses since the overhaul , some as much as $ 1,000 .
Ryan 's spokeswoman did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .
NEW YORK : A 27-year-old from Bangladesh detonated a home-made pipe bomb strapped to his body in a crowded New York subway passage during the morning rush hour on Monday ( Dec 11 ) , injuring three people and putting the city on edge just six weeks after a deadly truck attack .
Akayed Ullah told police investigators he wanted to avenge US airstrikes on the Islamic State group and was also inspired by Christmas terror plots in Europe , and chose the location for his attack by the Christmas posters on the subway walls , US media reported .

His bomb failed to detonate properly , leaving him the only one seriously injured in the incident .
President Donald Trump used the attack to call for tougher US immigration rules , saying the current `` lax '' policy `` allows far too many dangerous , inadequately vetted people to access our country . ''
`` Today 's attempted mass murder attack in New York City - the second terror attack in New York in the last two months - once again highlights the urgent need for Congress to enact legislative reforms to protect the American people , '' Trump said in a statement .

BOMB ONLY PARTIALLY DETONATED
The blast took place in the subway station at the Port Authority bus terminal , not far from the city 's iconic Times Square , sparking commuter panic and travel disruptions .

A closed-circuit security video showed commuters scattering as the bomb exploded and one body - that of the bomber - on the ground after the smoke cleared .
Authorities attributed the minimal damage from the simple device attached to Ullah 's chest to a malfunction .
The explosion left him with several burns to his torso and hands , and he was sent to a hospital in `` serious '' condition .
The other three injured people suffered ringing in the ears , headaches and other minor complaints , and there was no significant damage to the subway structure .
`` Fortunately for us , the bomb partially detonated , '' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said . `` It did not fully have the effect that he was hoping for . ''
Cuomo said Ullah was not part of a `` sophisticated network , '' but appeared to have been `` influenced '' by the Islamic State or other extremist groups .

CHRISTMAS ATTACKS THREAT
The attack came as the Christmas-New Year holiday season was moving into high gear , underscoring the possible threat that lone actors inspired by Islamic State or Al-Qaeda pose to festive crowds .
In Berlin last year , an IS-inspired Tunisian refugee drove a large truck into a crowd at a Christmas market , killing 12 .
Islamic State supporters have made online threats and urged sympathisers to conduct attacks on Western targets during the holiday season .
New York was rocked on Oct 31 , the Halloween holiday , when an immigrant from Uzbekistan drove a rented truck down a busy bike and pedestrian path , killing eight people and injuring 12 .
In November , the US State Department issued an alert for travelers to Europe during the holiday season , reminding them of the Berlin attack as well as the assault on a New Years Eve party in an Istanbul nightclub last year that left 39 people dead .
`` US citizens should exercise caution at holiday festivals and events , '' the State Department warned .
`` Extremists continue to focus on tourist locations , transportation hubs , markets/shopping malls and local government facilities as viable targets . ''
Cuomo said the latest bombing underscored that New York is a perennial target , 16 years after the 9/11 attacks .
`` This is New York . The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy , against freedom , '' he said .
A bomb in a subway station `` is in many ways one of our worst nightmares , '' Cuomo said .
TRUMP DEMANDS TIGHTER IMMIGRATION
The White House quickly turned the attack into a justification for its crackdown on immigration , which has seen the Trump administration slash refugee arrivals , block travelers from six Muslim-majority countries , and press for tighter restrictions on all those seeking to legally move to the United States .
Sayfullo Saipov , the Halloween attacker , had entered the country in 2101 under the `` Diversity Immigrant Visa '' program , by which the United States has sought to widen the sources of immigrants .
Ullah arrived seven years ago as the member of a family already in the United States , under what is known as `` chain immigration . ''
Trump has called to eliminate both programs and move to a merit-based immigration policy .
A senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said on Wednesday that the Guards were ready to implement a policy preventing regional oil exports if Iranian oil sales were banned by the United States .
LONDON : A senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said on Wednesday that the Guards were ready to implement a policy preventing regional oil exports if Iranian oil sales were banned by the United States .
President Hassan Rouhani appeared on Tuesday to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries if Washington presses ahead with its goal of forcing all countries to stop buying Iranian oil .

Praising Rouhani 's remarks , Major-General Qassem Soleimani said he was ready to implement such a policy if needed .
`` I kiss your ( Rouhani 's ) hand for expressing such wise and timely comments , and I am at your service to implement any policy that serves the Islamic Republic , '' Soleimani , commander of foreign operations for the elite Revolutionary Guards , said in a letter published by state news agency IRNA .
Rouhani did not elaborate on his threat but Iranian officials have in the past threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz , a major oil shipping route , in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action against Iran .

REUTERS : Leicester City captain Wes Morgan has `` progressed well '' and could recover from a back injury in time for Tuesday 's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid , manager Craig Shakespeare said on Monday .
Morgan has been on the sidelines due to a nerve problem in his back for over a month and the decision will be made on Tuesday morning .
`` I need to see if there 's any reaction from today ( Monday 's training session ) , '' Shakespeare told reporters .
`` I 'm really pleased with the way he 's progressed over the last three days but the final decision will be made tomorrow morning .
`` I 'd like to find out from the player , but my eyes tell me today that we should both be fairly pleased with the way he 's come through . ''
Leicester must overturn a 1-0 deficit at the King Power Stadium after Atletico striker Antoine Griezmann 's disputed penalty gave the Spanish side a narrow advantage last week .
Shakespeare said his players had to be streetwise and must find attacking solutions if they are to progress to the semi-finals .
`` We have to be mindful in terms of us being smart and our game management has to be good , '' Shakespeare added .
`` We know what we have to do and we ca n't sit back for 90 minutes because we need to score . ''
Midfielder Andy King and defender Yohan Benalouane , who both came off with injuries during Leicester 's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday , were both back in training and will be available to face Atletico .

It is the most non-traditional of major curling events .
Curlers are learning to embrace it ; fans enjoy it and London has just landed it .
The World Financial Group Continental Cup will be held at Western Fair Sports Centre Jan. 11 through 14 in 2018 .
The event will be used by some of the top curlers in the world in preparation for the 2108 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang , South Korea .
The announcement was made Tuesday at the Sports Centre and given the history of London holding successful major curling events , the excitement of bringing yet another of those events to the Forest City was obvious .
“ It will rank up there with the ( Scott 's Tournament of Hearts ) and the Brier , ” said London 's Peter Inch , chair of Curling Canada 's board of governors . “ This is a different event . It 's like the Ryder Cup of curling . It is n't just men . It is n't just women ; it 's both . We get the best of both teams , also the best of the world 's ( players . ) This will be the first time London sees the best world players . ”
The Continental Cup is a competition between Team North America and Team World over three competitions ; the traditional team games , mixed doubles and , like golf , skins . Point values are assessed to each match .
This year 's event was just held in Las Vegas .
The other noticeable difference in the competition is the crowd activity . Like stadium golf , this event encourages loud and boisterous crowds .
It 's one of the reasons the event is being held at Western Fair rather than Budweiser Gardens where the Scotties and Brier were held previously .
“ You are going to be right on top of the players which we like , ” Inch said . “ We want this noisy . We do n't want a quiet arena . We want it loud , bells , everything happening so the players feel they are in that atmosphere . We believe the Western Fair District makes that atmosphere work for us . ”
Each side has three men 's and three women 's teams . The winning side receives $ 52,000 while the losing side gets $ 26,000 . The side that generates the highest points total from the six skins ' games will receive an additional $ 13,000 .
It 's also an event that gets a lot of air time on sports networks . TSN will air a guaranteed 28 hours of the event .
The high quality of curling will be guaranteed by the selection process used to pick the participants of the event , the 14th Continental Cup .
Team North America will be Canada 's Winter Olympic men 's and women 's team . The other two Canadian teams will be the winners of the 2017 Scotties and the 2017 Briers .
USA Curling will add a men 's and women 's entry to Team North America at a later date .
“ I 'm excited , ” Inch said . “ I was the hardest one who could n't say anything . I wanted to spread the word and let 's get going . I 'll still be on the board of Curling Canada so I ca n't volunteer for this but I will be the loudest one out there spreading the word about this event . ”
Veteran , well-known curler Ted Smith is the co-chair of the event . Even though some of the “ purists ” are n't completely sold , Smith is looking forward to it .
“ I 've never tried it , ” he said . “ I 've just tried the traditional game but mixed doubles is going into the Olympics . I think it 's a great event and it 's catching on . It 's just going to take a little time . ”
London has held several high profile events and the success those events have achieved is one reason Curling Canada keeps coming back .
“ The sponsors always seem to be there ; the ticket sales always seem to be there the volunteers always seem to be there , ” Inch said . “ In a lot of places we are seeing the first two happen but have trouble with the third thing . We 've never had trouble with that in London . ”
Smith said the bid was put together through the joint efforts of the London , Ilderton and St. Thomas Curling Clubs along with the Highland Golf and Curling Club .
He also said that most of the volunteers that were involved in previous high profile curling events are involved in this one and it helped in landing the bid .
“ Many of us have been around so they know it 's not new people and they have an idea what we can offer , ” Smith said .
At least eleven times a day , I wonder what exactly is causing my toddler 's irritability or meltdown . She 's learning new words by the day , but connecting her emotions or feelings to those words is taking a little longer than I anticipated , and what she needs or wants remains a mystery much of the time . That 's why figuring out whether she needs a snack or a nap is such a dilemma . If you 're in the same boat , you need to brush up on these signs your toddler is tired , not hungry because toddlers can be so tricky to read .
If your toddler is fussy and crying outside of meal or snack times , or they turn down food they otherwise enjoy , those are signs that your toddler is really tired instead of hungry . Raising Children , an Australian parenting site , broke it down for us struggling parents : `` Grizzling and crying can mean your child is tired , but it can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between tired grizzling and hungry grizzling . '' They suggested this simple tip for parents wondering what to offer their struggling kiddo : `` If your baby has had a feed within the last two hours and is ... cranky , she 's probably tired . ''
The same goes for toddlers . If your kid has eaten recently but still is n't settling , it 's a good indication that he needs to take a time out with his bed for a little while . Here are a few other signs that can help you decipher your toddler 's grumps .
1 It 's Not Mealtime Giphy If your little one is having a meltdown at a time he does n't normally eat , that can signal that their fussiness is caused by needing to sleep or rest . One suggestion made by the Women 's and Children 's Health Network that can make mealtime more streamlined : `` Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time . '' That way you can offer something to eat at the first sign of hunger or fatigue .
2 They Turn Down Food They Otherwise Love If your little one does n't ever like broccoli , that 's not a good test of whether she is tired instead of hungry . But if you offer a handful of granola or apple slices that your toddler would typically gobble up and she balks , her grouchiness might be down to tiredness instead . Registered dietician Natalia Stasenko wrote on Real Mom Nutrition that toddlers who get increasingly cranky at mealtime might need to have their dinner served 30 minutes earlier so that they are n't too tired to eat their meal .
3 They 're Hyper Or Giddy If your kid is bouncing off the walls , you might be tempted to think they need to go run out their extra energy at the park . Counterintuitively , if your toddler is acting hyper or giddy , he might be overtired . Sleep expert Dana Olberman of Sleepsense explained that little ones can get wound up when they should be winding down , `` Logic dictates that a child who 's not getting enough sleep should be sluggish and lethargic , but the opposite is , in fact , much more likely . Kids get into a very hyperactive state when they 're exhausted . ''
4 They Wakes In The Night Giphy While it 's possible that your toddler is waking in the night and asking for Cheerios because she 's actually hungry , it 's also possible that your little one is waking because she 's overtired . Among other problems , overtiredness in children can cause night waking , according to BabySleep101 . You can give them the Cheerios , but you might want to consider putting your toddler to bed a little earlier .
5 They 're Bored Easily With Their Toys The Royal Society for the Welfare of Mothers and Babies in Australia pointed out that when a toddler is overtired they can show some curious signs that you would n't necessarily associate with needing sleep . For instance , if your little one is overtired , they might act bored with toys that would usually keep their interest . If your toddler seems bored and is asking for snacks , she could just be tired instead .

A Brantford woman charged with fraud repeatedly denied lying when she was cross-examined Tuesday by assistant Crown attorney Larry Brock .
Christina Paige Imola , known as Paige , said that she and her husband , Luigi , also charged with fraud , have been trying without success for five years to get documentation to help their case , which is being heard in Superior Court .
`` I 've asked and asked for the correspondence that 's not produced in this case , '' Imola said . `` I know there are emails missing . I 've spent all my life savings trying to fight this . ''
The Imolas have pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud over $ 5,000 and possession of the proceeds of crime in connection with more than $ 500,000 stolen from Ball Media between 2007 and 2012 when Paige Imola was the firm 's director of operations .
The couple is representing themselves .
After the Crown wrapped its case early this month , Paige Imola opened her defence by testifying last week .
Tuesday was the first chance for the Crown to cross-examine the defendant .
Brock said that Paige paid herself far more than the salary she and Ball Media president John Ball had agreed on . And that she used the company 's credit cards as her `` personal debit card '' and then low-balled her income on her tax returns , he said .
`` You misled the federal government when you filed your 2010 tax return , '' Brock said .
`` Your approved salary was $ 68,000 gross per year but you wrote cheques of $ 110,978 net that year , deposited cheques you wrote to your son , Zach , for $ 24,584 and had personal charges on the credit cards of just under $ 50,000 for a total excess payment of $ 162,451 for the year - which is net , not gross . ''
Brock produced Paige 's tax return for 2010 on which she claimed a gross income of $ 149,671 .
`` That was the T4 I received , '' she said , indicating that someone else had produced the T4 and Ball had reviewed it .
Brock said there is no documentation that `` truly reflects what you took from Ball Media in 2011 but your gross income would have been in excess of $ 300,000 - three times the gross salary of the president , owner and founder of Ball Media .
`` Is your evidence that the president wanted to give an employee three times the amount of his own income ? ''
`` I 'm not going to say three times , '' Paige said .
Paige repeatedly said she had an agreement with Ball to be paid more than the president or vice-president Darcy Scott and to take extra payment in the form of personal purchases made on the corporate credit cards .
Brock said that the Imolas were over-leveraged on their home and personal credit cards .
`` You were living on the edge financially . You were in overdraft while writing cheques to yourself from Ball Media . ''
He said that they bought their home on St. Andrews Drive , just steps away from the Ball family , in 2005 for $ 500,000 with a $ 375,000 mortgage . And , after making substantial improvements , re-mortgaged the home in 2007 for $ 750,000 .
The couple had numerous vehicles including Harley-Davidson motorcycles , a Porsche SUV and a Porsche convertible . They also purchased a vacation home in Florida with another couple and outfitted it with purchases made on the Ball Media corporate credit card .
`` It was your husband who approached John Ball after a Florida trip together about hiring you , '' Brock said .
`` Your husband told John Ball , 'You wo n't have to worry about my wife . She 'll always have your back ' . What he did n't tell John Ball is you 'd have his wallet as well . ''
`` I disagree , '' said Paige .
Brock listed a number of allegations Paige made during her testimony , including that Ball told her privately she did n't have to take an agreed-upon paycut and that he urged her to take pay by using company credit cards . She also said Ball sometimes forged his Scott 's signature and that he once inappropriately hugged her .
`` These are serious allegations , '' said Brock . `` But not once did you put them to John Ball '' who was on the stand for six days while Paige cross-examined him .
Brock also said that Paige created documentation after she was charged criminally in the case and sued civilly by John Ball .
`` This type of document would have been retained by Ball Media , '' Brock said about some of Paige 's invoices from her early days as a sub-contractor for the firm .
Brock also accused Paige of stealing a note that she produced earlier in the trial to bolster her claim that Ball wanted to give her extra perks and pay . The note read : `` Keep Paige happy . ''
He said that written during a time when Paige and Scott were in a disagreement and Ball , attempting to be a peacemaker , gave each a similar note .
`` The note ( you produced ) was handed to Darcy Scott and the ( Keep Darcy happy ) note was handed to you and you both laughed . ''
Brock said Scott put his copy in his desk .
`` You waited for an opportunity and you went into his office and without permission stole that note from his desk and kept it , '' he said .
Paige said she did not . `` I disagree , '' she said . `` John wrote it and slid it across the table to me . ''
Brock also questioned why no emails exist as evidence of Imola 's salary claims .
`` This criminal trial produced thousands upon thousands of emails , '' he said .
`` If John Ball had actually offered you anything other than a base salary of $ 85,000 , you surely would have confirmed that in a letter or an email that would be captured on the server . ''
`` He wanted our conversation to be personal , '' said Paige .
The trial will continue Wednesday .

Call me a complainer
Posted on May 30 , 2018 by Fred Allebach
A certain narrative is being promulgated in town . In this narrative , some community members are tagged as complainers or members of a vocal minority . For example , at a city council meeting , a comment was made to me by the owner of a local business , “ here to do some more complaining ? ” This tagging , name calling , and laying on of disrespectful comments accomplishes one goal .
The goal is to delegitimize community members and their ideas through the making of demeaning and sarcastic comments . This type of delegitimization has been commonly invoked about the pink door and leaf blower controversies . Pink door and leaf blower people are seen as trivial . This trivializing scorn was and is still used even by the local paper of record . Others use demeaning tags to negatively characterize the rich and powerful , or citizens concerned with civic issues like tourism , wine tasting , affordable housing , town character , and type of development .
A dynamic gets set up . People with differing opinions ( belief systems and primary assumptions ) , heap scorn upon each other , and this begets hatred and disrespect . The end result is intractable dispute , which is what Sonoma has on many fronts . The scorn bubbles out in comment sections and on Facebook , an ongoing war of different interests where all talk and few listens . Sonoma has turned into a zero-sum game , with few actors looking for a win-win .
What could the local competing interests be that cause such disrespect ? In very general terms , as I see it , one side is the growth cohort , for whom economy , and Manifest Destiny , American-style capitalist ideology is primary . Growth people believe all natural resources that contribute to endless consumption will keep appearing from a limitless frontier , with no apparent costs . Growth people see their views as self-evidently true .
On the other side is the conservation cohort , who believe in various forms of sustainability , social and environmental justice , and a carrying capacity future , one that does not rely on an endless increase of consumption to be successful . Sustainability people see their views as self-evidently true , and in my opinion , there is more factual basis for this view .
What is really at stake here is how human systems on earth are conceived of and framed , and what is then seen as desirable , smart , intelligent , practical , adaptive , sustainable , etc . I have attempted various ways to frame the context of Sonoma disputation : it 's a class issue ; greedy vs. sharing ; a racial redlining issue ; exclusive vs. inclusive ; a Social Darwinist/religious/ traditional/ every dog for himself ethos against one more empathetic and inclusive ; a fire and brimstone Jesus versus a compassionate Jesus belief backdrop ; a strict father versus nurturing family ethos ; economic bottom line only versus triple bottom line . At the end of the day , the camps seem to break down into those who see money and economy as primary , and those who have wider horizons .
A recent meme has opened up about how moving out of California is salvation from the excesses of Progressivism run amok . This is red state/ blue state stuff . A lot of Sonoma disputation revolves around an essential red-blue dichotomy . In Sonoma , complainers are blue state people who want their conservative little town to be bluer .
Just what man 's place in nature is , and what a reasonable and solid future might be , is open to question . Unfortunately for us as humans , the bulk of our reality is socially constructed , so even while we can conceive of and create objective , substantive scientific information , reason still must be filtered by highly subjective cultural assumptions ( beliefs , not facts ) , that while fundamentally similar , differ enough to put us in endless Tower of Babel conflict . We 're screwed by our own smarts and interpretive abilities .
In the Age of Trump , formerly disputatious topics have now taken on a new level of cutting edge delegitimization . Science and objective information are fake news ; human caused climate change is a joke , our enemies are all of a sudden our friends , dictators and autocracy are good , the educated are deluded ; California is the evil empire , immigrants are rapists and animals ; the world is turned upside down . Whatever we think , it seems to be OK to hurl insults with barely a thought . After eight years of Obama obstructionism , only a thin veneer of comity now separates us from real civil war . I can see how easily it might happen .
The Trump factor has contributed to the lowering of the tone of local discourse . A new level of overt disrespect is now sanctioned . Like Trump , a simple tag repeated over and over will do . Concerned citizens are “ newcomers ” , delegitimized as non-resdients , as complainers , and trivial leaf blower idiots . And what do the delegitimizers then expect ? We all live happily ever after ? No , once the scorn is brought out it lowers the common denominator to swampish levels . Scorn begets hate and disrespect .
All scorn mongers and taggers are responsible here , for helping create a bad situation .
The real work for wanting to have a say in local issues is not on Facebook or in the comment section anyway ; it is being involved and showing up , and commenting to actual decision makers , developing relationships with different players , learning the full context , knowing how the city and county work , and making informed , substantive , and decorous comments . Being involved is a long-term process that takes concentration , dedication and work . Facebook is a diversion that all too often degenerates into name calling . Facebook segregates into tribes of like-minded folk who find it easy to create enemies , to stoke a sense of community and solidarity… Human behavior stays the same regardless of communications format .
Maybe because on the big issues the Sonoma city council is divided , there is really no hope of a larger community win-win ; all votes are telegraphed ahead of time when growth vs. conservation issues are at stake : Cook and Edwards generally on one side , Hundley and Harrington generally on the other , and everyone trying to work on Agrimonti to win . What could a newly-elected council bring us ? A growth majority ? A sustainability majority ? More split stalemates and a purgatory hell for two years ? Three votes would sure do good for anyone 's program .
The city bureaucracy sees the need for income , and appears to be growth biased , just to stay afloat , even if sustainability ideals would be nice in a perfect world . For me , doing the right thing is good enough in and of itself ; for the city , money is needed to do the right thing , and getting money opens the door to Faustian compromises . “ You ca n't serve God and Mammon both , Mammon being money… ”
I do n't know how to cut the cake here really . I 've tried being reasonable , and to push what seems to me to be the eminently reasonable and inclusive sustainability paradigm . Reason does not seem to be doing the trick , as other devious humans have reason that works differently from mine . Being “ reasonable ” is contingent on all buying into a similar set of assumptions ; if not , there can be no common ground or common sense .
Maybe to get a point across is not a substantive matter at all , it first takes respecting someone , or respecting a cohort , and to respect a person who may hold differing opinions is possibly more a matter of the heart than of convincing with your facts . Someone you respect is worthy of listening to , and not of being tagged as deluded , illegitimate , or as a complainer . And , facts seem to be more a matter of belief than proof anyway ; why even try to prove anything ? Just try to be respected and then get a little bit of your program enacted on that basis .
But shoot , playing nice may just perpetuate an unjust status quo , so the trick is to play nice , get respected , and say your truth in an assertive and forceful way .
Personally , I think the growth cohort is wrong , and that they are advocating a maladaptive , short-term program . The writing is on the wall for a J-curve crash and human system collapse , as wanton consumption destroys underlying ecosystems needed for common species survival . The antidote is a simple comprehensive , triple bottom line planning ahead , more inclusive than to just economy , but to which the growth cohort stubbornly will not open up to… Call me a complainer .
Sonoma is characterized by the existence of parallel universes , which revolve around and round and never really open up to each other . This failure to communicate will be our collective undoing . One thing is for sure , a continuation of zero-sum outcomes only breeds more fighting and more zero sum outcomes . Call me a complainer .
In my opinion , the real minority is the .01 % , and the new 9.9 % modern American aristocracy . Sonoma 's demographic may have shifted so that the values of the 9.9 % are primary here . In Sonoma , the 90 % may be complainers , and a vocal minority because they want more out of civic process than new restaurants , hotels , and new forms of expensive entertainment that somehow equal a community benefit , even though it has been shown by the Hidden in Plain Sight study , that these benefits only accrue to the top players . Call me a complainer .
Talk , talk , talk , at the end of the day , we are all screwed by a tendency to be parochial and to devolve into name calling , and by our inability to communicate effectively about the issues of the day . At the very least , by not being an insulting person , it is easier to sleep at night and have a clear conscience . Hate and scorn destroys the giver as miuh as the reciever .

The federal government has approved N39 billion loan to Electricity Distribution Companies ( DISCOs ) for the supply of meters , Minister of Power , Works and Housing , Babatunde Fashola , has disclosed .
The minister made the disclosure on Monday in Kano at the 18th Monthly Power Sector Stakeholders Meeting hosted by Kano Electricity Distribution Company ( KEDCO ) .
He said the gesture was part of power sector recovery programme of the government aimed at ensuring uninterrupted power generation and distribution .
He added that it was also aimed at ensuring that every consumer of electricity is provided with a meter .
“ It is also aimed at ending the series of complaints by consumers who applied for meter but were not supplied at the appropriate time , '' he said .
The minister explained that the successful implementation of the power sector recovery programme would assist in resolving the conflict between distributors and consumers over tariff collection .
Mr. Fashola said power generation improved tremendously in 2017 to 6 , 863 megawatts compared to 2016 .
He attributed the reason for the increase to government 's efforts to end rampant vandalism of gas pipelines .
“ With this development , we have also noticed increase in the distribution of electricity to consumers across the country . ''
Mr. Fashola said presently , the Federal Government is generating electricity beyond the carrying capacity of distribution companies , “ which is a serious challenge to our efforts . ''
“ It is a serious problem that the distribution companies do not have enough carrying capacity to accommodate more of the generated electricity due to one reason or the other , ” he said .
He said that government had embarked on several projects to expand transmission capacity and distribution of power in the country .
In his remarks , the Chief Operating Officer of KEDCO , Raul Zing , said the company had spent over N200 million for the construction of power sub-station at Dakata , in Nasarawa Local Government Area .
He said the sub-station , which was commissioned by the Minister , would create 100 small scale industries and supply electricity to over 10,000 houses in the area .

Think Bhuvneshwar Kumar and England , and the mind goes back to India 's tour of 2014 here . The medium-pacer swung the ball — red and white — all summer , almost on a string . It was n't a trip to remember for the Indian team , not in the Test arena at least , but Bhuvneshwar stood out for his consistent display across formats .
So when the 2017 Champions Trophy finally arrived , you probably would have thought : `` Ah , Bhuvneshwar bowling in England , I will have some of that '' . However , the past two weeks have been very different from what we had seen three years ago , or even during India 's practice games at The Oval . The white ball simply has n't swung .
How many deliveries do you remember from Bhuvneshwar that have actually moved like they do when he has them on a string ? Two , maybe three , is the answer , and that is being generous . The second delivery he bowled to Azhar Ali in Birmingham , shaping away from the batsman ; the first ball to Niroshan Dickwella at The Oval , just enough movement to beat the batsman 's waft through air ; the last ball of the first over to Hashim Amla , once again at the Oval , just moving away slightly and inducing a proper edge that fell short of slip due to lack of pace .
“ There is not much swing available and it is tough to pinpoint why the ball is not swinging this time in England . The wickets are not generally this hard during this time of the year , and during the 2013 Champions Trophy and even in the 2014 tour , the wickets were softer , allowing for more swing , ” said Bhuvneshwar , after the win against South Africa on Sunday .
Hard wickets mean ample bounce from the batsmen , and they have made merry in this tournament , like they usually do in the shorter formats . Add to it , a lack of movement and the small fact that India needed to drop a pacer for this must-win game against South Africa . The sky was clear blue , the sun was out , and it was a shiny day when Virat Kohli decided that he wanted to play Bhuvneshwar ahead of both Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami against South Africa .
Chop and change has been the norm for Indian pacers ever since Kohli assumed full control of the Indian team . First , it came through in the Test arena , wherein he has held the reins longer . It could particularly be seen in the long 2016-17 season gone by , as the Indian skipper shuffled his fast bowlers at every opportunity possible against West Indies , New Zealand , England and Australia .
Bhuvneshwar played the least number of matches among this bunch , including Ishant Sharma , Shami and Umesh . There is n't much wrong to find in here , for Kohli has always thought long and hard about opposition and conditions . In India , you can not really play Bhuvneshwar unless there are n't other options available . The one occasion when conditions trumped all of that — on a lively track in Kolkata against New Zealand — Umesh promptly made way for the swing bowler .
He finds more use overseas , of course , and the West Indies ' tour was a sharp pointer in this scheme of things . St Lucia was tailor-made for Bhuvneshwar , as was Kolkata , and he duly delivered five-wicket hauls in both games . The surprising bit came in thereafter . He was handed the new ball against England in Mumbai and then against Bangladesh in Hyderabad , on hard decks completely different from the ones he had been picked for . Herein , a new aspect of Bhuvneshwar 's ability emerged .
On a flat track that afforded very little movement even in his initial spell on day one , Bhuvneshwar brought forth reverse swing as an added weapon in his armoury . Along with Ishant and Umesh , he put on a show of moving the old ball almost as well as the new one , if not better . Why did this aspect stand out ? Well , Bhuvneshwar was n't the quickest bowler , and you need pace to be able to impart reverse on the old red ball . The increase in pace — by atleast 4-5 mph — was remarkable .
Post the 2014-15 Australia tour , Bhuvneshwar spent considerable time away from the game working on his fitness . After never ending spells in England and Australia , that season had broken his body , and for good reason . The concept of workload management was totally lost on the Indian think-tank , and who could blame them , as they were at the fag end of a long overseas international schedule . This is what long arduous tours do — they break down Indian fast bowlers , and Bhuvi was the latest entry in that list .
His return to full fitness — and peak form — stands out , then . Unlike , say , Shami , who still struggles at times from the after-effects of his long-term injury that occurred almost in parallel with that of Bhuvneshwar . Why is this aspect important at this point , though , when India are busy competing in the 2017 Champions Trophy , limited-overs cricket that is ? The answer can be found in the aforementioned instances that highlighted the lack of swing throughout this tournament .
“ When the ball does n't swing then you have to alter the length . You have to bowl a bit back of the length . Normally , we bowl fuller lengths to get wickets but here we are holding the length back , ” said Bhuvneshwar , post the game on Sunday .
For someone who moves the white ball under lights in the sub-continent ( 26 wickets in the recent IPL season ) , an obvious lack of movement should have been a massive handicap . Instead , Bhuvneshwar has come into his own with his clever variations in pace as well as his steady line and length . Just consider how he bowled to Hashim Amla on Sunday .
The Indian plan was not to give runs , and both Amla and Quinton de Kock were tied down . In particular Amla , who likes to cut the ball short of length , was denied space on either off or leg side . Bhuvneshwar 's subtle variation in pace — ranging from 78 to 87 mph — did n't allow him to settle down . Never mind their opening stand of 76 runs , the runs had n't flowed , thus squeezing the middle-order and etching out those two run-outs that eventually changed the game .
Ideally , Kohli would have picked Yadav or Shami as his first-choice fast bowler , for their ability to move the ball as well as using the bounce on English wickets on account of pace . At present though , with flat pitches laid out in favour of the batsmen , it is imperative to hold a steady line , not allowing batsmen any room to work with .
Need of the hour was an all-weather bowler then , with the Indian captain knowing fully well that Bhuvneshwar was the perfect man for this job . And the medium pacer — or should I say pacer — did n't disappoint .

Screenshot from a video provided by Pacific Yellowfin Charters shows an astute seal seeks shelter on the swim grid of a tourist boat in Frederick Arm , north of Campbell River .
A seal escaped the jaws of hungry orcas by hitching a ride on a nearby tourist vessel on July 1 , and the encounter was caught on video .
A pod of transient orcas were hunting the harbour seal in Frederick Arm , an inlet north of Campbell River , when the savvy animal swam up to the boat and climbed aboard .
Footage provided by Pacific Yellowfin Charters shows the worried-looking seal hiding behind the boat 's outboard motor on the swim grid , a low platform at the stern of the vessel .
The clever seal occasionally glances up at passengers aboard the 26-foot boat . But it 's mostly focused on its hungry hunters , which circulate below and breach menacingly just meters away .
The boat eventually navigated away from the scene , and the seal slipped away .

SHOAL CREEK , Ala. : Shoal Creek finally re-opened for practise rounds on Wednesday afternoon as players scrambled to get in last-minute preparations for what looms as a waterlogged U.S. Women 's Open .
The course was closed late on Monday afternoon and remained off-limits on Tuesday as it was drenched by more than four inches of rain from sub-tropical storm Alberto .

More rain Tuesday night and Wednesday morning - an additional 1.62 inches - kept the course closed until 1 PM local time ( 1800 GMT ) , when players were allowed to begin practise rounds .
The U.S . Golf Association ( USGA ) , which runs the championship , is still intending to play without preferred lies .
`` It remains our intention to play 72 holes and play the ball as it lies , '' said USGA senior managing director John Bodenhamer , who expressed confidence the event would begin on time on Thursday morning , assuming it remains dry overnight .
The topic of whether preferred lies should be allowed has been a hot one the past two days .

Cristie Kerr , the 2007 champion , said that it would be a `` joke '' if players were not given the chance to clean mud from their balls .

Marjorie Ellen Ryan-Poynor , 50 , died at 2:15 p.m. Saturday , Dec. 9 , at Saint Louis University Hospital .
Memorial Mass will be 11 a.m. Thursday , Dec. 14 , at Ss . Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Alton . Burial will be at St. Patrick 's Cemetery in Godfrey .
Gent Funeral Home in Alton is handling arrangements .
In her opening statement in the final debate before Ontario 's general election , Liberal leader Kathleen Wynne stood by her government 's decisions with a new catchphrase— “ sorry , not sorry. ” She then listed policy initiatives she says are successes and not reason for contrition .
She concluded by saying “ I 'm really not sorry that we 're no longer asking single moms to raise a family on $ 11.40 per hour , ” referring to her government 's decision to increase the minimum wage to $ 14 this year and $ 15 next year .
The fundamental problem , however , is that — prior to the hike — the situation she describes was a reality for only a very small number of Ontarians . Only 2 % of people working for the minimum wage in Ontario were single parents .
Which raises an obvious question . What are the typical demographic and social characteristics of Ontario 's minimum wageworkers ?
In reality , minimum wageworkers tend to be young — 60 % were below age 25 ( again , prior to Wynne 's minimum wage hike ) . The vast majority of these young minimum wageworkers ( over 86 % ) lived with their parents . And were generally not the primary or sole earners in their households .
The combination of these trends means that not only were the most minimum wageworkers not single parents , most were n't living in low-income households . In fact , 85 % of minimum wageworkers in Ontario did not live in low-income households as defined by Statistics Canada 's low income cut-off line .
So , if the government 's goal is to direct resources to Ontarians living in low-income households , throwing money out of a helicopter is approximately as well-targeted a strategy as raising the minimum wage .
Given these realities , it 's not surprising that empirical literature from Canada suggests raising the minimum wage has no impact on poverty rates , and in some cases , it can increase poverty .
Crucially , trying to help such a small number of low-income people with a shock to such a big chunk of the labour market creates significant unintended economic consequences that wind up hurting rather than helping people .
For many of the young people described above , a minimum wage job is a first step on the economic ladder and a source of valuable experience and skills that leads to better paying jobs . But substantial economic research suggests employers react to minimum wage hikes by hiring fewer people , cutting back work hours , and shifting to more automation . So opportunities for young people to gain experience decline — again , without any observable impact on poverty .
To be clear , helping single parents who rely on a minimum wage income is an important policy objective . But Ontario 's big increase to the minimum wage was misguided , to say the least , and we have better policy tools available .
For example , the federal Canada Workers ' Benefit ( formerly the Working Income Tax Benefit ) that directly tops-up the wages of low-income households , better targets assistance to those that need it without harmful unintended consequences .
Premier Wynne says “ sorry , not sorry ” about her government 's decision to dramatically increase the minimum wage . Unfortunately , however , the evidence suggests more young people will now hear “ sorry , not hiring ” from a greater number of prospective employers in Ontario .

ISLAMABAD : Pakistan on Monday ( Aug 14 ) celebrated 70 years of independence from British India with a patriotic display including a giant flag and a show of airpower , as the military 's top brass vowed to wipe out terrorists days after a deadly blast .
Celebrations began at the stroke of midnight with firework shows in major cities .
At the highly symbolic Wagah eastern border crossing with India , army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa raised a massive national flag on a 400 foot ( 122-metre ) pole as crowds chanted patriotic slogans .
Following the chest-thumping performance Bajwa said the country was making progress and promised to `` go after each and every terrorist in Pakistan '' .
`` We have made a few mistakes in the past , but we are on the road to development under the guidance of our constitution , '' he added .
A powerful bomb targeted a military vehicle in the restive capital of Balochistan province late Saturday , killing 14 people including several troops .

The military later said the blast , claimed by the Islamic State group , was intended to mar independence day celebrations .
Pakistan also faces fresh political turmoil after the Supreme Court last month sacked Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif following an investigation into corruption allegations against his family .
In Islamabad his newly-elected successor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi , along with top generals and foreign dignitaries , presided over a 31-gun salute and flag-raising ceremony to mark the holiday .
`` The independence that we got 70 years ago was the fruit of the exemplary struggle of our ancestors , '' said Abbasi in an address to the nation . `` Thousands of Muslims have made sacrifices for our future and the future of our children . ''
Further south in Karachi the day began with a changing of the guard at the mausoleum of the country 's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah , where politicians and military commanders laid floral wreaths .

'LONG LIVE PAKISTAN '
The skies above the capital were later streaked with multicoloured smoke as the air force hosted Pakistan 's largest air show to date .
Fighter jets criss-crossed over the leafy capital in aerobatic manoeuvres as thousands packed shoulder-to-shoulder applauded from a park below . Planes from close allies Saudi Arabia and Turkey also took part .
In Lahore students cruised through the eastern city 's streets on motorbikes waving flags and screaming `` Long live Pakistan ! ''
Up north in the Swat valley near the restive border with Afghanistan celebrations were more subdued , with events at schools cancelled due to `` prevailing law and order '' issues .
In nearby Peshawar , the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province , Christians held special services at a church and freed doves to mark the holiday .
`` Four years back my father and brother died in this church in a suicide attack , but I am still here praying for my beloved country , '' schoolteacher Neelam Anwar told AFP .
In August 1947 the British Raj was dismantled with the subcontinent divided into two independent states - Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan .
Millions were uprooted in one of the largest mass migrations in history , with experts estimating at least one million died in the communal violence unleashed by partition .
The carnage sowed the seeds of the acrimony that led to three wars , and generations later this defining moment in the subcontinent 's history is still polarised by nationalism and rancour .
The countries still wrangle over a large part of their shared border , especially in disputed Kashmir . They even recognise their independence from British rule on separate days , with Pakistan claiming August 14th and India celebrating the following day .
While Disney 's Solo : A Star Wars Story had no trouble coming away with a box office win over the Memorial Day holiday weekend , the movie made more headlines for how it failed to impress , underperforming with a three-day tally of $ 84.4 million and a four-day Memorial Day holiday weekend total of $ 103 million . The Star Wars spin-off had the extended holiday weekend all to itself in its debut , but this weekend it will face three newcomers , STX Entertainment 's Adrift , Paramount 's comedy Action Point and Blumhouse Tilt 's thriller Upgrade , neither of which will usurp Solo , or even Deadpool 2 , most likely , for what could be a rather tame weekend . We 're predicting Solo will come out on top with $ 39.7 million .
Solo : A Star Wars Story debuted in 4,381 theaters , the fifth-widest release of all time , behind The Dark Knight Rises ( 4,404 theaters ) , The Twilight Saga : Eclipse ( 4,468 theaters ) , Avengers : Infinity War ( 4,474 theaters ) and Despicable Me 3 ( 4,529 theaters ) . It likely wo n't drop any theaters this weekend , and considering how much it underperformed , it may even try to add a few theaters , but none of the competition will come close to the 4,381 theaters Solo is currently playing in .
Of the new releases , STX 's Adrift will get the widest opening with 3,015 theaters , while Action Point will open in an estimated 2,000 theaters and Upgrade is slated for a debut in around 1,400 theaters . Only Upgrade currently has enough reviews to warrant a TomatoMeter score on Rotten Tomatoes , and it has the critics ' approval for now with an impressive 85 % rating on RT . It remains to be seen how the critics will respond to Adrift and Action Point , but none of the new releases will give Solo or Deadpool 2 a run for their money . We 're predicting that Solo will lead the way with $ 39.7 million , followed by Deadpool 2 with $ 26.5 million , with the top 5 rounded out by Avengers : Infinity War in third with $ 12.6 million , Adrift in fourth with $ 8.3 million and Book Club in fifth with $ 6.4 million .
We 're predicting the top 10 will be rounded out by Action Point ( $ 5.8 million ) , Upgrade ( $ 3.6 million ) , Life of the Party ( $ 3.1 million ) , Breaking In ( $ 2.8 million ) and Show Dogs ( $ 2 million ) . Also opening in limited release this weekend is The Orchard 's American Animals , FilmRise 's Breath , IFC 's A Kid Like Jake , Cohen Media Group 's Rodin and Vertical Entertainment 's Social Animals . There is no indication as to whether or not these films will be expanding in the coming weeks and/or months .
Looking ahead to next weekend , Solo 's likely two-week run at the top will probably come to an end , with a trio of high-profile newcomers hitting theaters . Warner Bros. will release its highly-anticipated Ocean 's Eleven spin-off entitled Ocean 's Eight , alongside the Global Road action-thriller Hotel Artemis and A24 's thriller Hereditary . While no theater counts have been given yet , Ocean 's Eight will likely get the widest release of the bunch and has been shaping up to be a sleeper hit of the summer . Take a look at our projected top 10 for the weekend of June 1 , and check back Sunday for the top 10 estimates , courtesy of Box Office Mojo .

Now that the t2017 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony is behind us ( but you can watch an edited version of the show on HBO on April 29 at 8:00 pm ET ) , it 's time to look forward to next year ; who will be in the Rock Hall 's class of 2018 ?
There are only a few inductees each year , and there are so many artists that deserve the honor , so we broke it down to different subgenres , and who we felt should be inducted from each . Starting with post-punk , which is the single most neglected subgenre , by the Hall , which has jumped from the CBGBs era to U2 and R.E.M . to the Lollapalooza era of the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Nirvana , Green Day and Pearl Jam , and skipping many crucially important bands in between .
Likewise , the Hall of Fame is pretty weak on metal ( as opposed to hard rock , which is well represented with AC/DC , KISS , Aerosmith and Van Halen ) . To hear the Rock Hall tell it , metal goes straight from Black Sabbath to Metallica . They 've missed a lot .
So , consider this a public service to the Hall 's nominating committee and voting body : here 's who should get in next year .
~
The Post-Punk Band : The Cure – There are a lot of bands from this era that deserve to be in the Hall of Fame , including Depeche Mode , the Smiths and Joy Division , as well as American bands like the Pixies , the Replacements and Sonic Youth . But the Cure , who debuted in 1978 with their “ Killing An Arab ” single , has been around the longest , and are still a huge touring act ( they sold out a three-night stand at New York 's Madison Square Garden last summer ) . And they continue to influence new bands . Classic Material : 1980 's Boys Do n't Cry , 1981 's Faith , 1982 's Pornography , 1985 's The Head on the Door , 1987 's Kiss Me Kiss Me , 1989 's Disintegration , 1992 's Wish
The Alt-Rock Icon : Jane 's Addiction – We 've discussed this before , but Jane 's should have been inducted before any of the bands that they paved the way for : Nirvana , Green Day and Pearl Jam . As Rage Against the Machine 's Tom Morello said at Jane 's Addiction 's Rock Walk dedication ceremony , “ Nirvana often gets credit for being the first ‘ alternative ' band to break through , the band that changed music and led rock out of the hair metal wilderness of the ‘ 80s . That 's just not true . It was Jane 's Addiction . Inspiring , intelligent , furiously rocking and artistically deep as f—. ” It was also Jane 's who spearheaded the first Lollapalooza tour , making the point that American fans enjoyed all kinds of music — hard rock , industrial and hip-hop , to name a few . Soon , touring festivals would be all the rage , which led to all of the “ destination festivals ” that dominate the summer schedules of rock , hip-hop , pop and EDM acts . Classic Material : 1987 's Jane 's Addiction , 1988 's Nothing 's Shocking , 1990 's Ritual de lo Habitual

The Hip-Hop Legend : Ice-T – A lot has been made about the fact that LL Cool J — hip-hop 's first solo superstar — has yet to be inducted , and we agree that LL should be a Hall of Famer at some point . But LL did n't have the connection to rock music that Ice-T did . “ Rhyme Pays , ” the opening track off Ice 's 1987 debut features Black Sabbath 's “ War Pigs , ” while “ Shut Up , Be Happy , ” the opening track of 1989 's The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech… Just Watch What You Say ! , featured vocals by punk icon Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys and a sample of Black Sabbath 's “ Black Sabbath. ” He used “ Black Sabbath ” again , along with Led Zeppelin 's “ When the Levee Breaks ” on “ Midnight ” from 1991 's O.G . Original Gangster . Sure , lots of hip-hop artists sampled rock songs , but Ice was actually a fan of the music he was sampling . Ice was the the sole hip-hop act on the first Lollapalooza tour , which is where he debuted his metal band , Body Count ( who just released their latest album , Bloodlust ) . Classic Material : 1987 's Rhyme Pays , 1988 's Power , 1989 's The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech… Just Watch What You Say ! , 1991 's O.G . Original Gangster
The Radio Favorites : The Cars – It 's truly mystifying that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has n't inducted the Cars already : they have tons of hits , they were loved by radio and MTV and critics , and as popular as they got , they were always edgy enough to be cooler than most of their peers . Classic Material : 1978 's The Cars , 1979 's Candy-O , 1980 's Panorama , 1981 's Shake It Up , 1984 's Heartbeat City
The Singer-Songwriter : Carole King – She 's already in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , actually : she was inducted in the “ Non-Performer ” category in 1990 as half of the Gerry Goffin/Carole King songwriting team , and that was appropriate , as they are one of the greatest songwriting teams that popular music has ever known . However , that honor does n't cover the fact she 's also one of the greatest singer-songwriters ever , not to mention one of the best-selling ones : her 1971 album , Tapestry , has been certified diamond for selling over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone . Classic Material : 1971 's Tapestry ; the list can start and end there .
The First Time Nominee : Rage Against the Machine – The Rock Hall usually likes to induct a first-time eligible artist , and next year , both Rage and Radiohead hit their big 25 year anniversaries . But in this politically charged era , Rage seems timelier than ever , and a good reminder to younger artists that having a political stance does n't keep you from the top of the charts or from the stages of arenas . ( But we do think Radiohead deserves to be voted in at some point , too . ) Classic Material : 1992 ' a Rage Against the Machine , 1996 's Evil Empire , 1999 's The Battle of Los Angeles
The Metal God : Randy Rhoads – As mentioned above , there are lots of metal bands who need to be inducted into the Hall of Fame , and soon . Among those , and at a bare minimum , this shortlist would include Motorhead , Judas Priest and Iron Maiden ( and maybe Slayer ) . But first , we 'd love to see one of the genre 's most influential guitarists get his due . He 's not eligible as an artist , as he never released anything under his own name , but he should certainly get the Award for Musical Excellence , which has recently gone to Nile Rodgers , Ringo Starr , and the E Street Band . Randy Rhoads tragically died in a plane crash in 1982 at the way-too-young age of 25 , but in his short lifetime changed the game for metal guitarists , adding a fleet-fingered classical style to the lexicon . After a few years in Quiet Riot ( before their success ) , he joined a newly-solo Ozzy Osbourne , and the two albums that they made together are among the greatest in metal history ( and gave one of its icons a great second act , after leaving Black Sabbath ) . Classic Material : Ozzy Osbourne 's 1980 Blizzard of Ozz and Ozzy Osbourne 's 1981 Diary of a Madman
Employees of U.N. refugee agency UNRWA staged a rally in the blockaded Gaza Strip yesterday to protest the recent termination of their permanent employment contracts . Protesters decried the agency 's decision on Monday to terminate the permanent contracts of hundreds of UNRWA employees and replace them with temporary contracts .
`` This move will adversely affect the services provided by the UNRWA in the Gaza Strip and those provided to more than 1.3 million Palestinian refugees [ across the region ] , '' Amir al-Meshal , head of the UNRWA employees ' union , said at the protest . `` These reductions are the beginning of the agency 's slow demise , '' he lamented . He went on to urge the international community to financially support UNRWA , warning that recent reductions in the agency 's budget would have a negative impact on Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip and throughout the region .
Last month , UNRWA was forced to end its emergency food program , a move that will likely have an adverse impact on food assistance provided to 1.3 million Palestinian refugees in the blockaded Gaza . UNRWA has struggled with a severe crisis since the U.S. suspended $ 65 million in promised financial aid late last year . According to the U.N. , UNRWA requires some $ 250 million per year to implement all of its aid programs .
Twenty-four hours before Friday 's first pitch of the National League division series , there was a team meeting around the Dodger Stadium mound . All the Dodgers wore official gear , except for Clayton Kershaw , who stood in the back in baggy basketball shorts and a T-shirt .
After manager Dave Roberts spoke , he turned over the floor to left-hander Rich Hill , at 37 the oldest active Dodger . Typical of Hill , he implored his teammates to exert every bit of energy they had within them .
“ Go out there and bring that intensity , bring the passion , bring that aggressive attitude , ” Hill said he told the Dodgers . “ So when you look back years from now , we 're going to not look at it in regret , but look at it as , ‘ I did everything that I could to succeed . '
“ Again , whether we look back at the end of the day and we can call ourselves world champions or we go home knowing that you did everything that you could as an individual to succeed , that 's really it . ”
Hill has employed that ethos to great success over the last two years . Languishing in independent ball during the summer of 2015 , he resolved to commit himself more fully to his craft . Since he resurfaced with the Boston Red Sox that September , he owns a 2.65 earned-run average over 49 starts .
He did so by breaking with tradition and throwing more of his steep curveballs than anyone in baseball . And , late this season , as opponents caught up to him , he reversed course and pumped up more fastballs .
The pitcher opposite Hill in Saturday 's Game 2 at Dodger Stadium has done the opposite . Arizona Diamondbacks left-hander Robbie Ray has reintroduced a curveball into his regular repertoire , complementing his 95-mph fastball and his strikeout slider .
“ It 's basically just resurrecting a pitch that was there , ” Ray said .
He scrapped the curveball several years ago in the minor leagues , thinking the slider was sufficient . His 4.90 ERA last season proved him wrong . Wielding the curve and the slider , he lowered that ERA by two runs in 2017 .
Arizona 's Game 1 starter , Taijuan Walker , came away from watching Wednesday 's wild-card game a “ little tired. ” He lasted one inning Friday night . Ray , who made a 34-pitch relief appearance in the wild-card game , said the outing provided him an understanding of what to expect on Saturday .
“ I felt like I handled it pretty well , ” he said . “ I was able to control my emotions . But I feel like a start is a little bit different , knowing that you 're coming into the game and setting the tone for the whole game . But I do feel like getting into that game gave me a little bit of a taste of it . ”
Ten years ago Friday , Hill earned his first taste of the postseason , a failed three-inning start that ended the Chicago Cubs ' season . Back then , he said , he was more results oriented . His evaluation of his performance depended on how much success he found .
Now , he said , he rates himself on his effort , and he ensures he spares no expense .
“ There are no set rules , ” Hill said . “ When you 're out there and you 're playing , you improvise and you use that creativity to your advantage . ”
On Friday night , he planned to immerse himself in Clayton Kershaw 's intensity and , soon , exude it himself .
“ You 're going out there and you 're putting yourself in a position to fail . But in doing that , you 're giving it everything you can to succeed , ” Hill said of Kershaw . “ So , when you see guys going out there and whether it 's a live performance of any kind — theater , music , baseball , whatever , a professional sport — you appreciate that genuine passion that they have . That 's what Clayton brings . ”

PARIS : French police charged a man on Monday ( Dec 11 ) in connection with the extremist murder of a police couple after his DNA was matched to traces found in their home near Paris , legal sources said .
Mohamed Lamine Aberouz , 24 , has been linked to Larossi Abballa , the Islamic State extremist who claimed the June 2016 attack in a live video from the murder scene before being killed by police in a shootout , the sources added .
Aberouz , who was not on a terrorism watchlist but was known to be radicalised , was arrested in the western Paris suburb of Les Mureaux . He was charged with being an accomplice to murder in connection with a terrorist act and remanded in custody .
His brother has already been charged with providing logistical assistance to Abballa , whose chilling attack - one in a string of assaults in France since January 2015 - caused shock in police ranks .
Abballa stabbed police captain Jean-Baptiste Salvaing to death outside his home in Magnanville , 60 kilometres west of Paris , and then slit the throat of his companion Jessica Schneider in front of the couple 's three-year-old son .
In a Facebook Live video from the scene , he called for further terror attacks .

Aberouz was already investigated over a foiled attack by a group of female jihadists who tried to set set fire to a car containing gas canisters near Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris in September 2016 .
Charged with failing to report that plot , he spent four months in preventive custody before being released in January .
Investigators believe that a notorious French IS member , Rachid Kassim , directed both attacks from the Middle East , using the encrypted Telegram app .
Kassim is believed to have been killed in a coalition air strike near the Iraqi city of Mosul in February .

Rock Island County Clerk Karen Kinney says they 've seen about 30 percent more early voters than in 2014 in the county . She says about 4,300 people voted early .
The others are expected to turnout in high numbers for Primary Day as well .
Democrats in Rock Island County have the option to choose between former Sheriff Jeff Boyd and current Sheriff Gerry Bustos . Republican Keko Martinez is running unopposed .
The race everyone will be watching is the race for Illinois Governor , six democrats are running for their ticket . JB Pritzker , Chris Kennedy , Dan Biss , Bob Daiber , Tio Hardiman and Robert Marshall .
Republicans have incumbent Bruce Rauner squaring off against Jeanne Ives . Ives has local candidate and Rock Island County Board member Rich Morthland as her running mate .
`` We do have a very conservative base here in Rock Island County among the republicans , a lot of those people like Ives , '' said Rock Island County Republican Chair Mike Steffen . `` I think either one would do a great job as governor . ''
Clerk Kinney believes the high turnout so far is because of the Sheriff 's and Governor 's races .
But whoever takes the ticket for both sides , Republicans and Democrats say they 'll rally behind the candidate chosen .
`` We have to unify behind whoever our candidate is , '' said Steffen .
`` I 've spoken Democrats supporting all of the candidates , '' said Rock Island County Democrat Chair Doug House . `` We 're going to be together Wednesday regardless of what happens on Tuesday . ''
The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take suo motu cognisance of the tragedy at government-run BRD hospital in Gorakhpur where more than 60 children died in five days due to alleged disruption of oxygen supply.Lawyer Rajeshwari Reddy had mentioned the matter before Chief Justice of India JS Khehar and pressed for judicial intervention , contending that the “ criminal negligence ” of hospital authorities led to the loss of innocent lives.The CJI , however , said : `` We have seen the state Chief Minister and the Union Health Minister visiting the hospital and taking stock of the situation . They are taking interest ( sic ) . `` CJI Khehar added that he was mindful of the situation , but the case ultimately relates to `` one hospital in one state '' . The Allahabad High Court would be in better position to assess the situation and issue appropriate directives , he said . `` Why do n't you go to the High Court concerned ? File a petition there and it could look into it , '' the CJI told Reddy.Before the Supreme Court takes suo motu cognisance of an issue , it usually is vetted by the PIL committee of the court.Over 60 children have reportedly died at BRD Medical College Hospital since August 7 , many for want of oxygen whose supply was disrupted after bills were not paid to the vendor . At least 30 children perished between August 10 and 11 alone.While the Uttar Pradesh government warned of exemplary action against those responsible for the tragedy and have announced a ‘ high-level inquiry into the incident ' , the central government has also stepped in to cool the tempers . They have announced a regional medical centre at a cost of Rs 85 crore in Gorakhpur to conduct research on ailments that afflict children .
U.S. stock index futures were higher on Monday as tensions on the Korean peninsula eased slightly after key U.S. officials played down the risk of an imminent war with North Korea .
REUTERS : U.S. stock index futures were higher on Monday as tensions on the Korean peninsula eased slightly after key U.S. officials played down the risk of an imminent war with North Korea .
Global stocks lost nearly US $ 1 trillion in value last week after President Donald Trump warned North Korea that it would face `` fire and fury '' if it threatened the United States , leading to a war of words between Pyongyang and Washington .
However , U.S. officials including National Security Adviser H.R . McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo played down the risk on Sunday , while South Korea 's president said resolving Pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions must be done peacefully .
The S & P and the Dow posted their worst weekly decline last week in nearly five months due to the tensions .
The three major U.S. stocks indexes still managed to break a three-day losing streak on Friday as the chances of another interest rate hike this year were reduced following a weaker-than-expected July consumer price data .
The Federal Reserve has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure that has been stuck at 1.5 percent since May despite the labor market being near full employment .

For many , the needless death of Diana , Princess of Wales , in the late summer of 1997 was one of the decades ' most heartbreaking moments . But more than 20 years on from the passing of the People 's Princess , the tragic event is still shrouded in mystery . Now , an important participant in that fateful night 's drama has finally stepped forward , and his revelations add a new level of poignancy to the entire episode .
Born on July 1 , 1961 , into a family that included U.K. war leader Sir Winston Churchill , Diana Spencer could boast a wealth of aristocratic connections . Indeed , when her father was made the eighth Earl Spencer in June , 1975 , she joined their ranks , becoming Lady Diana at the tender age of 13 . As a young noblewoman , she would often stay on estates owned by Queen Elizabeth II . But it was through her elder sister , Lady Sarah McCorquodale , that Diana would meet Prince Charles – the immediate heir to the British throne – in 1977 .

In fact , Sarah had been seeing Charles at the time , but their relationship fizzled out . It would not be until three years later that the prince got to know Diana a little better . After going on only a dozen dates , the pair became engaged and then soon married on July 29 , 1981 , making Diana the Princess of Wales . During their union , the couple would welcome two children – Prince William and Prince Harry – into the world .

Over half a million children were abandoned or put up for adoption by distraught parents , under China 's family planning policy . Now , Get Real goes on a journey with those seeking to reunite with their families .
JIANGSU , CHINA : The moment she saw her daughter , Madam Shen Mei Zhen sprang forward and hugged her tightly , tears of joy streaming down her face .
She had , against her will , given away her then two-day-old baby Wu Xue Ying nearly 39 years ago .
The two embraced in an emotional reunion in August 2017 – their first meeting since Ms Wu was given up for adoption .
“ My daughter , I have wronged you . I am so sorry . My daughter , have you suffered much ? ” wailed Mdm Shen . “ I 've cried so many tears for you . I 've been searching for so long and have been so heartbroken . ”
Seeing her lost daughter in the flesh after so many years , the older woman could not stop caressing her child 's face and would n't let her go , overwhelmed with feelings of both relief and guilt .

“ I am responsible for sending her away . I have done her so much wrong , ” she said brokenly . “ After we sent her away , I could not sleep that night . I quarrelled vehemently with my husband . I asked him to retrieve her , but he said we could not afford it . ”
Under China 's then newly-implemented one-child policy - which mandated that couples could only have one child because of the rapid population growth – Mdm Shen and her husband had to give up one of their four kids .
As the couple told the investigative programme Get Real , defying the law and keeping their youngest would have cost them their jobs . and taken away their only means of survival in their village in Jiangsu Province , north of Shanghai .
Mdm Shen vividly recalls the day she gave her baby away – she had dressed her in a rabbit sweater and a cotton jacket , with a piece of paper with her birth details carefully tucked inside her clothes .
“ My husband brought her to a bridge and passed her to the middlemen , ” she recounted . “ I wept and wept . ”
Defying the law would have cost Mdm Shen and her husband their livelihood .
This family 's story is echoed across a country where at least half a million children – mostly girls - were abandoned by their parents or put up for adoption because of China 's family planning policy , leaving families shattered and causing decades of pain .
A very few rare and fortunate cases – like Mdm Shen and Ms Wu – have now found each other again , after years of searching and anguished wondering , thanks to the efforts of a volunteer group .
Get Real documents the mission to such reunite families , and the miraculous , emotional result for some . ( Watch the episode here . )
DO N'T LET THE DOGS GET THEM
Under the population control policy , China 's government imposed expensive fines on families who violated the limit , forcing women to choose between abortion or abandonment . The policy was eventually scrapped in 2015 .
Some parents who chose to abandon their kids left them in public places , such as bus stops , markets and government offices , in the hope that someone would pick them up .
Mr Li Yong Guo , who is working to reunite such families , said : “ After leaving their child at these places , the family members would not leave immediately , but hide at a distance to watch lest stray dogs or cats take the child away . ”
In 2011 , Mr Li founded the volunteer group Jiangyin Relatives Tracing Association , to help the city 's elderly parents locate the children they had abandoned .
In the past seven years , they have helped to reunite more than 100 families . But in a country of nearly 1.4 billion , finding one 's family is a formidable task , as he admitted :
The probability of finding a match is similar to striking first prize in lottery .
His team of 300 volunteers – many also searching for their own families - go online to reach out to children who believe their birth parents were from Jiangyin city . At the same time , hopeful parents sign up with the association through registration drives .
Blood samples are collected , and DNA testing is used to link these parents and their children .
Registration drive at which DNA samples are collected .
The association holds these events every weekend during the summer holidays and has amassed a database of more than 2,000 old folks looking for their children .
“ If we do not organise these kinds of events , these people have no way to find their family , ” explained Mr Li .
A CHANCE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS
For birth parents like Mdm Zhou Juying , the registration drives offer a glimmer of hope , and the chance to right the wrongs of the past .
“ Family planning officials came to my house and stayed for three days and nights . I did not want to give the child to them , ” she recalled .
“ I try not to think too much , otherwise I will cry even more . I think about him all the time , wanting to get him back . ”
Zhou Xiao Yun , like many abandoned children now grown up , seek to close that circle in their lives .
Teacher Zhou Xiao Yun has been searching for her birth parents for over 20 years . While she had very loving adoptive parents , her childhood was not easy , she said .
I am especially sad during festivals . I wonder if my birth parents left an extra pair of chopsticks for me ; just the thought of it pains my heart .
A volunteer with the association , Ms Zhou recognises that many abandoned children , who are now adults like her , want to close that circle in their lives – to find out more about their roots , their surnames at birth , and where they were born .
“ What they most want to know , is why they were abandoned , ” she said . “ Some hate their parents and want to know why they were the ones who were given up instead of the other siblings . ”
WATCH : The faces of anguish - and a special reunion ( 5:03 )
‘ NO ' TO REUNION
But not everyone is so keen to reconnect with their lost loved ones . Some birth parents fear being hated by the child they left behind , said volunteer Wang Zhou Li .
Others are worried their existing children would object violently to their search .
“ They are afraid that if they find their abandoned child , their other children would stop supporting them financially . So they do n't even start looking , ” said Ms Wang .
Then there are the adoptive parents , some of whom resort to extreme measures to prevent reunions from happening , said fellow volunteer Ms Zhou . They move homes multiple times , or simply lie to their children that they were not adopted .
“ In the north , a lot of parents keep the child away from school , afraid that the child will take off and forget about them . If the children are illiterate , then they will remain farmers , ” she said .
You ca n't leave because you ca n't read – so you wo n't be able to find your family .
Ms Han Feng Ying from Handan city discovered the fact of her adoption when she was six from other children in her neighbourhood . Her adoptive father never spoke to her about it
“ He treated me like his own and probably did not want me to find my birth parents , ” she said .
SEARCH , OR REGRET FOREVER
Fortunately for Ms Wu Xue Ying , her adoptive mother Mdm Yang Ai Yun did not stop her searching for her birth mother . This was despite the older woman 's constant fear that she might lose her adopted daughter once she found her roots .
“ If she visits me , then she cares . If not , then that reflects on her maturity , ” said a teary Mdm Yang , who has two children of her own .
Mdm Yang Ai Yun with her adoptive daughter .
Ms Wu , 39 , had sent her blood sample to the Jiangyin association from her home town in Anhui some 500km away . She hoped for a match but was aware that the odds were extremely low .
“ At this age , if I still do n't look for my birth parents , I may regret it forever , ” she said .
When she was seven , she found out from her classmates that she was adopted , and they refused to have anything to do with her after that . “ They said I was … not my parents ' natural child . They belittled me and refused to play with me , ” she said .
For years , she kept her feelings of insecurity and unhappiness a secret . “ On the outside , I come across as a cheerful person and someone who gives joy to others . But the pain I feel inside , no one knows , ” she said .
Ms Wu Xue Ying was plagued by insecurities
She was one of the lucky ones – three months after she sent in her blood sample , her wait finally came to an end . She received news from Mr Li that her sample matched that of a couple in their records .
“ I did n't believe it . My mind was a complete blank . I was frozen and I thought I was dreaming , ” she said . “ I was extremely excited , so much that I secretly cried . ”
MORE WORK AHEAD
During the emotional meeting with her birth parents , Ms Wu comforted her guilt-ridden birth mother as Mdm Shen repeatedly apologised .
“ I do n't blame you , it was a long time ago . Living conditions were hard or you would n't have given me away , ” Ms Wu told her , assuring her that she felt no resentment .
Ms Wu and Mdm Shen , reunited .
She now has two families – but there 's no fairy tale ending for her yet , as she has to tread carefully between the two , so as not to upset one side or the other .
Her anxious adoptive mother and brother are still trying to come to terms with the new situation .
“ Even now , they when I try to talk to them about it , they will cry , ” she said . She reassured them that she had no plans to move away to live with her birth family .
On her part , Mdm Shen missed her new-found daughter greatly after Ms Wu returned to her hometown .
“ I ca n't bear to be parted from her , so far away in Anhui , ” she said . “ But I 'm still really elated . Being able to reunite with my daughter , my life is now complete . ”
Mr Li Yong Guo , founder of the Jiangyin Relatives Tracing Association
The efforts of one volunteer group has transformed the lives of these women – but in the Jiangyin association 's DNA database , there are still 3,000 seekers waiting for their own happy ending .
For Mr Li , the feeling of successfully reuniting a family is indescribable .
“ Seeking relatives after many years of separation and reuniting them is no simple feat , ” he said . “ I hope we will continue to have such positive results , even surpass what we have already accomplished . ”

Several big-name hedge fund investors trimmed their stakes in healthcare companies in the second quarter as the sector led the broad U.S. stock market higher , rallying as Republican efforts to repeal and replace President Obama 's signature healthcare law dimmed .
NEW YORK : Several big-name hedge fund investors trimmed their stakes in healthcare companies in the second quarter as the sector led the broad U.S. stock market higher , rallying as Republican efforts to repeal and replace President Obama 's signature healthcare law dimmed .
New York-based Jana Partners sold all of its shares in nine healthcare companies , ranging from small-cap biotech company Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc to health information company WebMD Health Corp to insurance giant Aetna Inc , according to quarterly filings released Monday .
Billionaire Daniel Loeb 's Third Point sold 175,000 shares , or about 18 percent of its stake , in health insurance company Humana Inc and 5 million shares of hospital products maker Baxter International Inc , a cut of approximately 10 percent of its prior position .
Healthcare stocks in the S & P 500 rose 6.7 percent in the second quarter , more than double the 2.6 percent gain in the broad S & P 500 index . Senate Republicans delayed a vote on a healthcare overhaul bill on June 27 after it became clear that they did not have enough votes for it to pass . One month later , a scaled-down plan to replace the Affordable Care Act failed in the Senate .
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers ' stock holdings , in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying . But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come out 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions .
Overall , hedge funds gained 1 percent in the second quarter , according to Chicago-based fund tracker Hedge Fund Research , less than half of the 2.5 percent gain in the first quarter .

Jana Partners sold all of its stake in Resolute Energy Corp , while New York-based Omega Advisors sold its entire stake in seven energy companies , including Cheniere Energy Inc , Eclipse Resources Corp , and Williams Partners LP .

The car of a Turkish citizen was violently attacked Friday with sticks by PYD/PKK terrorist supporters in Germany , according to a witness .
Ibrahim Yıldız vehicle was attacked as he and his children were inside while in the Lebenstedt district of Salzgitter province , according to Bülent Demir , 42 , who has been a shopkeeper for 20 years .
`` While around 600 PYD/PKK members were demonstrating in the city center , they saw Ibrahim Yıldız passing by in his car and they attacked the car , '' Demir told Anadolu Agency .
`` There were children in the car . They were very afraid , '' he added . He also said Yıldız 's brother , Mustafa , also witnessed the incident and recorded it .
`` In the footage , supporters of the terrorist organization are carrying banners , rags and attacked Ibrahim 's car with sticks brutally , while cursing , '' he said , noting there was a lot of damage to the vehicle . Police have launched an investigation into the incident .
Germany has experienced a growing number of radical protests and violence by PYD/PKK supporters since the group launched a campaign two weeks ago to protest Turkey 's Operation Olive Branch-launched Jan. 20 to clear PYD/PKK and Daesh terrorists from Afrin in northwestern Syria .
The Turkish General Staff said the military operation is to establish security and stability along Turkey 's borders and the region as well as protect Syrians from terrorist oppression and cruelty .
The PKK has been banned in Germany since 1993 , but remains active with nearly 14,000 followers among tat country 's Kurdish immigrant population .
Turkey has long criticized NATO partner , Germany , for not taking serious measures against the PKK that uses the country as a platform for its fund-raising , recruitment and propaganda activities .
After tension broke out in parts of the country this past weekend many celebrities took to their social handle try and preach peace to the entire nation .

Stolen victory or not this thing is done and dusted ! Uhuru is President ! ” The letter reads in part .
He goes on to advice Raila to take the battle to court saying he will put up a strong case .
“ The only hope you have is the courts and with all the evidence I know you can put a strong case if it 's a path you want to take ! For now you must speak and tell your army to retreat we ca n't loose twice ! Let us win in one , not the battles but in peace !

We ca n't be making 10 steps ahead then 20 back ! Baba speak !
Yours Trully , Jalang ' o ” He adds .
In a previous letter to the president , Jalang ' o urges him to get police out of Kisumu and other towns so that life can go back to normal . He asks him to speak to Raila and unite Kenyans once again as they 've always done .

EXPAND NoMad L.A. chef Ashley Abodeely Audrey Ma
Going from the kitchen of the world 's best restaurant ( according to the judges of the World 's 50 Best Restaurants ) to a food truck in Los Angeles might seem like a strange career trajectory , but it suits chef Ashley Abodeely just fine .
Abodeely worked as a line cook at Eleven Madison Park ( which received the aforementioned No . 1 spot on the World 's 50 Best list this year ) , then became a sous chef and eventually an executive sous chef at NoMad in New York City . This year , she moved to L.A. to head up the NoMad food truck , with the eventual plan of leading the opening team of NoMad L.A. in late fall of this year . And that time on the truck has introduced her to a whole world of good eating .
`` I 'm a newbie to L.A. and the West Coast in general , '' Abodeely says . `` In the past year I 've driven all around this town serving our NoMad food to Angelenos . During that process I 've come across some amazing and super tasty food from other trucks in the city . These are a few of my favorites . ''

`` I 've seen it in the stores across the country , but to finally have a freshly made ice cream sandwich from the truck is incredible .

Definitely a unique truck design as well ! They are at most food truck events all over the city . '' cool.haus

A MOUNTAIN biking star woke to discover his treasured bikes had been stolen just days after his 18th birthday .
Thieves broke into a locked shed at Louis Meade 's family home near Meifod overnight on December 13-14 making off with around £10,000 worth of bikes .
A total of eight bikes were stolen , including Louis ' competition and training bikes , his 15-year-old brother 's brand-new motocross motorcycle , and his parents ' bikes .
“ My little brother went to the shed , and discovered they were all gone , ” said Louis .
“ When he ran in and told us we were all shocked and devastated . This was my race bike , which I had taken all across the world , that had gone .
“ And not only that , all my family 's bikes and my brother 's motorbike .
“ I 'm absolutely devastated . Bikes have always been my passion and I simply ca n't afford this loss . ”
Louis has been competing for four years , and was crowned Wales ' top junior rider in 2016 as well as making it into the UK 's top five . The stolen racing bike , a black and yellow Solid Strike , has taken him to competitions across the UK as well as Sweden and Austria .
With it gone , the Llanfyllin High School pupil now faces uncertainty over whether he will be able to compete next year , but friends have set up a page online to try and raise the money to get Louis back on a bike .
Two friends , Dan Griffiths and Kaos Seagrave , have also planned a sponsored Snowdon climb to boost their fundraising efforts . They will set off on the toughest route to the top , Crib Goch , on January 28 – with their ankles tied together .

Louis added : “ I 'm absolutely gutted , without those bikes I 'm not sure if I will be able to race in the 2017 season and chase my dreams .
“ People are being really kind in helping raise money , but it 's not just the value of the bikes – it 's the feel of being watched and robbed . ”
Dyfed Powys Police are appealing for information on the theft .
n Anyone with information , or who may have been offered any of the bikes for sale , is urged to contact the police on 101 .
Georiga Manhunt
A deadly escape by two inmates in Georgia has prompted an intense , large-scale manhunt .
A nationwide manhunt is now underway for two armed inmates accused of breaking out of a prison transport bus in Georgia after killing two corrections officers with their own guns . Investigators say 43-year-old Donnie Rowe and 24-year-old Ricky Dubose were somehow able to overpower two guards onboard a prison transport bus Tuesday morning in Putnam county . The pair disarmed the guards and fatally shot the 42 and 58-year old officers before carjacking a passing motorist and taking off . At this point , police are still looking for the stolen green Honda . They believe the men are armed with two guns taken from the slain corrections officers and so far , they have no reason to believe the inmates have split up .

Brock Eurchuk and Rachel Staples , whose son Elliot Eurchuk died from an accidental overdose Friday in his Oak Bay home , call for changes to the laws governing youth health care . ( Keri Coles/Oak Bay News )
The parents of a Victoria teen who died from an accidental overdose Friday are calling for changes to the laws governing youth health care .
Elliot Eurchuk , 16 , died at his home on Friday . His parents , Rachel Staples and Brock Eurchuk , believe he took street drugs to help him sleep .
Elliot had been battling drug dependency after he was prescribed opioids for four major surgeries in 2017 , including two for a fractured jaw and two shoulder reconstructions as a result of sports injuries . When his prescriptions of the highly addictive opioids ran out , he turned to street drugs for relief . He tried to hide the addiction from his parents , and was successful for awhile as he was shielded by the law .
The Infants Act states that children under 19 years of age may consent to a medical treatment on their own as long as the health care provider is sure that the treatment is in the child 's best interest , and that the child understands the risks and benefits of the treatment .
“ Kids try to make these decisions for themselves . If they do n't want the help , there is nothing in our legal system that allows us as parents to get them the help they need , ” said Staples .
“ That kind of policy basically knocks parents to their knees in their efforts to help their children . In our son 's case it ultimately led to his death because we had no control over his medical direction . ”
Staples and her husband attempted to get access to Elliot 's health records after he had been in and out of hospital with serious infections . They were told that Elliot did not want them to know what was going on . Due to the Infants Act , doctors honoured Elliot 's wishes and told the parents nothing . An event in early February changed that .
Elliot was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 31 with a blood infection , which had him in the hospital for 26 days to get multiple rounds of IV antibiotics . On Feb. 9 , Elliot was given a day pass . His dad took him to meet some friends for a movie and picked him up right afterwards to take him back to the hospital . At some point between drop off and pick up , Elliot got some opioids .
He was found by the medical team at the hospital early the next morning , not breathing and with blue lips . They administered naloxone and saved Elliot 's life . It was at this point that his parents overheard a doctor talking to Elliot about naloxone and they got their first insight into what was happening to him .
“ Even then it was n't a direct conversation about what he had taken , ” said Staples . “ I 'm a health care provider , I know what naloxone is . That was their only way of telling us that Elliot was using opioids from the streets . ”
Staples and Eurchuk want to be clear that they are not blaming individuals , it is the system they feel needs to be changed . The Infants Act should be altered to allow parents to play a role in their child 's health care . If youth are displaying at-risk behaviour , Staples and Eurchuk think parents should be told about what is happening and have a say in their child 's medical treatment .
“ When a parent suggests that their child is not capable of making responsible medical decisions I think that needs to override [ the child 's ] desires , ” said Staples .
They are also calling for alternatives to opioids in pain management .
“ I just do n't understand why opiates are the first line of approach for pain and why they are so widely prescribed when they are so addictive . There has got to be something else , particularly when you are dousing a young developing brain in opioids. ” said Staples . “ After his surgeries , Elliot came home with a prescription , like a bucket full of opioids . Yes , his surgery was extremely painful , and yes it is awful for the short-term but the long-term ramifications of opioids is just too risky . ”
The final message that Elliot 's parents want to get out , is for kids to make sure that if they are going to experiment , they do n't do it alone .
“ Elliot was alone , ” said Staples .
The family is trying to cope and plan a funeral in an age where word travels instantly – they only had three hours between finding their son 's body and getting calls from the school district and media .
“ We are putting on a face for these media interviews but when we wake up in the morning , we are broken . Completely broken . We wake up multiple times a night gasping for breath , thinking about our son 's heartbeat stopping , ” said Eurchuk .

Magic in a Bottle : Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection Glenlivet 1943
Independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail has decided to make our lives a lot better with the Private Collection Glenlivet 1943 , a magical 70 year old offering that 's apparently one of the world 's oldest and most exclusive single malt whiskeys right now . Before you get too excited , you should know we 're talking about a very limited edition here , with pricing set at a cool £30,000 or around $ 40,000 per bottle .
Just forty decanters are up for the grabs , which makes this collection exceptionally rare . After spending 70 years in a first-fill Sherry hogshead cask , this liquid elixir is finally ready to tease your pallets in the best way possible . Distilled on 14 January 1943 , Cask 121 was being filled and closed as a historic WWII meeting was taking place miles away in North Africa , at the Casablanca Conference .
According to Gordon & MacPhail , many distilleries closed after October 1942 , which might make this batch even more valuable .
Cask 121 has been nurtured and cared for by four generations of the family , which is why it stands no comparison to other drinks . On a more professional note , it is worth mentioning that Private Collection Glenlivet 1943 boasts a rich chestnut brown color and a full , fresh flavor of dark chocolate , oranges , and oakiness .
The whiskey is bottled in bespoke hand-blown decanters , adorned with gold engravings , while a handcrafted wooden box presents this drool inducing package to the world . As you can imagine , these decanters will be extremely sought after , even though that price tag would make them untouchable for most of us .

This statement was originally published on pen-international.org on 23 November 2017 .
PEN International is extremely concerned about increasing restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and opinion in Catalonia during and following the referendum on independence of 1 October 2017 . As the upcoming regional election on 21 December draws near , the organisation is particularly alarmed by reports of unprecedented levels of harassment and violence against journalists .
`` For any election to be free and fair , it is vital and self-evident that journalists should be able to work without harassment , intimidation , and undue interference , so that they can operate freely , talk to anyone they want , and write what they wish . The media has a legitimate role in a democracy : as a watchdog , as a platform for campaigns , as an open forum for debate , and as a public educator , so that people can participate fully and meaningfully in the elections . The way the Spanish Government has reacted to the crisis so far is a cause of great concern , and it is contrary to the kind of message Spain - like the European Union - conveys to other countries with bitterly contested and partisan elections . Democracy begins at home , '' said Salil Tripathi , chair of PEN International 's Writers in Prison Committee .
Following the credible and well-documented reports of excessive use of force by law enforcement agencies on voting day 0 which require thorough and impartial investigation by an independent expert body - PEN International is further highlighting a rapidly worsening climate for press freedom . The rising polarisation of the debate around Catalonian independence is having a direct impact on media freedom , characterised by a lack of balanced reporting on both sides of the debate , including in public service broadcasting . Examples of the deteriorating climate for freedom of expression include :
- Cases of journalists being subjected to harassment on social media , and in some cases physical violence . Both those in favour and against Catalan independence are reported to have been involved , with public and private actors said to be implicated in these acts ;
- The judicial authorities pursuing 'insult ' charges against the editor of the satirical El Jueves magazine as well as radio comedian Eduard Biosca for jokes they made about Spanish police officers ;
- Teachers from three schools in La Seu d'Urgell are under investigation for alledgedly promoting hate speech , following classroom debates about the referendum and the crackdown by Spanish police ; and ,
- A teacher was reportedly briefly arrested and remains under investigation for alleged incitement of hatred for having criticised the police violence on social media .
PEN International has already expressed concern about the use of judicial measures to clamp down on democratic debate in Catalonia and the use , in some cases , of pre-trial detention for criminal charges for non-violent expression of dissenting political opinion . Among others , this includes high-profile cases such as the indictement of senior secessionist civil society leaders Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart for rebellion and sedition , as well as similar charges against high-profile political leaders and cases against scores of local politicians on charges including criminal disobedience , prevarication and misuse of public funds .
`` A democratic election is not possible when governments inhibit or chill freedom of expression during the electoral campaign , '' said Marjan Strojan , chair of PEN International 's Witers for Peace Committee . He added that `` The Spanish authorities must show restraint and accept that also separatist speech can contribute to pluralism and must be tolerated in a democratic society , as long as it does not incite violence . ''
PEN International underscores the importance of unhindered freedom of expression and a free press as cornerstones of a democratic society . In the context of the coming election campaign starting on 6 December 2017 , we call upon the Spanish and Catalan authorities to :
Take all necessary measures to ensure a free and fair election , including with regard to the media in particular :
- Ensure that journalists can perform their job without undue interference ; and ,
- Guarantee access to media and ensure unbiased coverage and equal treatment of all political parties by public service media ;
Abstain from using the judiciary as a tool for supressing freedom of opinion , expression and debate ; and ,
Take all necessary measures to engender a climate conducive to allowing the Catalan people to peacefully express their political opinions , including on self-determination .
A man in Sweden is charged with raping girls in Canada and two other countries entirely through online contact , in what prosecutors are calling a potentially precedent-setting case .
Bjorn Samstrom , whose trial is underway , is charged with dozens of offences , including `` gross rape , '' involving 27 girls , two of them Canadian , according to one of the prosecutors in the case . The other girls are in the United States and Britain .
The allegations involving the Canadians date back to 2015 , when the two girls — one from Ontario , the other from Alberta — were 13 , the prosecutor said .
In an interview from Stockholm , Annika Wennerstrom said Samstrom is accused of coercing girls to perform sexual acts in front of webcams by threatening them or their families .
Under Swedish law , rape does not have to involve intercourse , Wennerstrom said . It can be another act considered to be equally violating .
The country 's highest court has previously ruled that sexual assault , which is a lesser charge , can be committed through the internet but has yet to convict someone of rape in the same way , she said .
Wennerstrom said the courts have said in other cases that rape could `` hypothetically '' occur over the internet , but the offences being tried did not meet the threshold .
She believes the crimes Samstrom is accused of committing are `` horrific '' enough to be considered rape .
`` We see them as rape of a different kind , '' she said . `` They are forced to do it , they are threatened to do it , it 's painful and it goes on , in some cases , for a long time . They have absolutely no choice and they are terrified . ''
Police found video recordings of young English-speaking girls while investigating Samstrom in connection with another alleged sex crime involving Swedish complainants , the lawyer said . In some of the footage , they could hear Samstrom 's voice or see other information that linked him to the video , she said .
HONG KONG : Hong Kong police said on Tuesday they had arrested a prominent member of the opposition Democratic Party for `` misleading police '' after he claimed he had been assaulted and illegally detained by mainland Chinese agents in the city .
Howard Lam was shown on local television being taken away by police in a van with handcuffs in the early hours of Monday morning . He was questioned at a police station , with evidence taken from his home including a tablet computer , mobile phones and a pair of sunglasses .
`` We believe the information he gave is false , '' Cheng Lai-ki , a superintendent of police , told reporters . The police said in a statement that Lam had been arrested for `` misleading police '' .
Lam had last week held a press conference , claiming he had been beaten by mainland Chinese agents in Hong Kong before being dumped on a beach in what activists said was a shocking breach of Hong Kong 's autonomy by Chinese authorities .
Lam , who remains in police custody , could n't be immediately reached for comment . But the Democratic Party disputed the police claims and continued to stand by Lam 's version of events .
`` Up to now , I can see no cogent evidence for me to disbelieve Howard Lam , '' Albert Ho , a senior member of the Democratic Party , told Reuters .

Ho was also critical of the police for turning an alleged victim of a brutal assault into a suspect without making clear their grounds for doing so .
Hong Kong , a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 , was handed back amid promises that Beijing would grant the city a large degree of autonomy and freedoms not allowed in mainland China , under a so-called `` one country , two systems '' arrangement .
Lam , a longstanding and active member of the city 's largest and most established opposition political group , the Democratic Party , said he had also been warned in a telephone call not to give an autographed photograph from Barcelona 's star footballer Lionel Messi to the widow of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo .
Lam said he was confronted by men speaking Mandarin , the main language in mainland China but not widely used in Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong , outside a sports store . Lam was n't , however , able to give concrete evidence to back up his claims the men were Chinese agents .
Lam had said the men took him away and interrogated him in a nine-hour ordeal . He also showed reporters wounds on his body , including welts and a series of metal staples that he said the men had punched into his skin for being `` unpatriotic '' . He was knocked out and eventually found himself dumped on a remote beach , Lam added .
But in CCTV footage carried on local television , a man in sunglasses and a medical face mask with a passing resemblance to Lam was shown walking freely in the area at the time of the purported abduction .
Lam , when shown the footage , said on local television before his arrest that he believed the man in the footage was not him .
Hong Kong 's leader Carrie Lam said she was confident the police would investigate the matter fully .

Winston Churchill is hot again .
In the past year , he has been essential to the first season of The Crown on Netflix as well as the star of two feature films . While Churchill , released earlier this year , focuses on the British leader 's role in planning D-Day , the Oscar nominee The Darkest Hour looks at an earlier point in World War II . The new film reveals — when Britain faces the reality of 300,000 troops trapped in France — how the prime minister must juggle all the political forces to confront Germany 's advance .
Like the best history lessons on film , The Darkest Hour takes us places textbooks ca n't reach , into the minds of leaders and within the fears they experience . Like the most memorable journeys to the past , the movie limits the scope of its narrative to a specific period of time so it can delve beneath the surface to explore real issues people and nations face . Like the classic bio pics , this is as much a story of the chaos surrounding a person as it is an examination of how that person tries to cope .
As the film opens , in 1940 , Britain faces the reality there may not be a way to stop Germany 's march across Europe . Without support from the United States , and pressure from Hitler 's forces increasing every day , British Prime Minister Chamberlain finds himself with little public support for his strategy of diplomatic negotiation . When he suddenly resigns , Churchill becomes the surprise choice to succeed , a move questioned by King Edward VIII . How these two leaders search for a way to work together , as Churchill tries to move beyond his accidental ascension , fuels the narrative of a country trying to grasp the truth that it could lose its freedom .
At this point in the movies , when so many historical films have been made about the same topics , finding fresh ways to tell the familiar can be challenging . Screenwriter Anthony McCarten makes this conflict as intimate as possible , avoiding grand speeches in favor of compelling exchanges between Churchill and others , while director Joe Wright uses his camera to examine the underground world where the man manages his country and his life . The “ War Rooms ” as they are called — now open to tourists — invite audiences to see a world below the streets where the leader openly shares his ambitions and fears .
Any biopic , even one as fresh as this , demands a central performance to fill the story and honor the subject . Gary Oldman embraces this challenge with a portrayal of nuance , variation and rich interpretation . Yes , we know the actor is there beneath the heavy makeup as we savor Oldman 's eyes , his expression of voice , his passion for the words . By letting us know he is in command of the portrayal — not the latex he wears — the actor controls how we connect with his character and the story . Oscar nominee Oldman makes us want to keep watching because of what he will say not because of how he looks .
Yes , Churchill is hot again . And , thanks to the authenticity of The Darkest Hour , we want to learn even more .
Film Nutritional Value : Darkest Hour
Content : High . The story of how a leader confronts the challenges of the moment , and acts within his truth , gives the film its authentic core .
Entertainment : High . All the makeup may help Gary Oldman look like Churchill , and his mastery of the man makes us believe we experience Churchill .
Message : High . The lessons of how one leader confronts and communicates truth should , hopefully , inspire others to follow his approach .
Relevance : High . Any opportunity to learn more about any historical figure can be worthwhile . And this film tells us a great deal about a great leader .
Opportunity for Dialogue : High . The movie can prompt conversation between you and your children about a significant moment and person in history .
5 Popcorn Buckets . Darkest Hour , running 2 hours and 5 minutes , is rated PG for “ some thematic material . ”
Churchill reveals D-Day backstory
Of the world leaders that changed the 20th century , Winston Churchill is a new star at the movies . While history books celebrate his political savvy and brittle instinct , he had not been the star of a film for several years . And it took the Netflix series The Crown — with John Lithgow 's layered portrayal — to bring this fascinating British leader back into focus .
The Oscar-nominated The Darkest Hour is , actually , the second film about the leader in recent months . Earlier in 2017 we saw Churchill , a well-intentioned if flawed examination of how Britain 's Prime Minister struggled with Allied plans to invade France in June 1944 at the height of World War II . While this film intends to offer a fresh take on Churchill 's concerns about the D-Day blueprint , it gets caught up in the hero 's dark moments . Not since Oliver Stone dug into Richard Nixon 's psyche in the troubled film Nixon has a filmmaker so celebrated a hero 's ugly side . And Churchill 's director , Jonathan Teplitzky , does n't seem to know when to stop .
Like the best biopics , Churchill confines its narrative to a limited period of time , the days immediately before the planned D-Day launch . As General Dwight D. Eisenhower finalizes the plans for the invasion , Churchill remembers another war when ambitious ideas led to massive injury and death . He remains haunted by the past as he struggles to understand the present and project into the future . As much as he wants to believe in Eisenhower 's expertise , Churchill 's memories make it difficult to understand . So he begins to undermine , object and manipulate his way through a different approach that could achieve a similar outcome . Yes , he wants to win the war . But not this way .
If Teplitzky had limited the film to these military uncertainties , Churchill the movie would better honor Churchill the man . But the moviemaker ca n't let well enough alone . He seems determined to prove that the leader 's emotional weaknesses cloud his judgment . It 's as if Teplitzky has so little respect for Churchill the leader that he refuses to imagine how someone so practiced could be so challenged . And the director goes for dramatic thrills to shock rather than meaningful moments to illuminate . We 're left with a portrayal of a man who leads in spite of himself . And lets his emotions paralyze his judgment .
As troubling as Churchill may be in the script , Teplitzky 's approach gives actor Brian Cox a dream job . And he makes the most of every moment . Cox , a reliable supporting player in many movies , reaches beyond the material to make Churchill a living creature . He fills the gaps that writer Alex von Tunzelmann leaves in his screenplay with layers of command and control . Cox makes us believe in the man we remember from history not necessarily the man presented on the pages of the script .
Ultimately , as flawed as Churchill the movie may be , its presence reminds us of the essential role movies can play to bring history to life . As we celebrate the bravery of D-Day , some 73 years later , we thank the people who gave their lives to make us free . While Churchill may disappoint , The Darkest Hour is certain to please . And it shares the Churchill we need to remember .
Churchill , running 1 hour and 45 minutes , is rated PG for “ thematic elements , brief war images , historical smoking throughout , and some language. ” It is available on demand for online streaming .

Perhaps no car is capable of producing as sweet of an exhaust note as a Jaguar F-Type equipped with a supercharged V-8 , but the four-cylinder version of the sports car is giving it a good try . In the video below , the more economical F-Type revs its engine , and it 's enough to get us excited .
New for the 2018 model year , Jaguar is offering an F-Type with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder from its Ingenium engine family . Although it ca n't produce 550 hp like the F-Type R , the new model delivers a more-than-healthy 296 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque via an eight-speed automatic that routes power to the rear wheels . It is n't the quickest sports car , with an estimated 0-60 time of 5.4 seconds , but its lighter weight promises increased agility .
On paper , the four-cylinder Jaguar F-Type seems like a pretty good value . It 's just as good-looking as the R , and a lot cheaper . Prices for the 2018 Jaguar F-Type Coupe with the turbo-four start at $ 60,895 , including a $ 995 destination fee . Typically , an F-Type R will set you back more than $ 100,000 . Of course , the V-6 is another option to consider . So many choices…
Hear the four-cylinder Jaguar F-Type unleash its exhaust note in the video below .

People love Starbucks . People love unicorns . So it was only a matter of time before these two joined forces and created something so delicious , so majestic , so magical that we 'll be throwing an entire month 's wages at daily frappuccinos . Oh we wish we were exaggerating but the bank statements will speak for themselves .
In 2017 , all the best foods come in unicorn colours . Easter eggs , hot chocolate , cheese toasties and bagels , they 're all dressed in that mixture of gentle blues , pinks and purples . The only thing missing from that list is an ice cold coffee - UNTIL NOW . Yep , Starbucks have finally got their act together and created the unicorn frappuccino .
Whilst it remains purely conjecture at the moment , a Redditor recently posted a pic with the caption 'Unicorn Frapp topping ' , and as we all know , if the internet says 'Unicorn Frapp topping ' three times then it becomes a real thing . And so began the campaign for a unicorn frappuccino , with Instagram taking the reins as coffee fans began posting pics using the # UnicornFrappuccino hashtag . The colourful drink is a mixture of soft purple and blue , topped with cream and dusted with coloured sprinkles .
Loading ...
Food blogger Mike Fahey managed to get his hands on an early prototype of the drink , as he reviews on his Snacktaku YouTube page . Fahey , who has inside connections to Starbucks ( his wife works there ) , described the rainbow drink as having a sour raspberry flavour which kind of tastes like fresh fruit or mango , but was accompanied by a `` horrible sour syrup '' and sprinkles of sour sugar on top - definitely a drink for those with a sweet tooth .

There 's still no official date that the Unicorn Frapp is due to hit Starbucks , but rumour has it that we 'll know when to expect it by 19th April . Only one day to go people !

Rose McGowan has reacted to Harvey Weinstein 's indictment on rape and criminal sex act charges in New York .
McGowan previously accused the disgraced movie mogul of rape – allegations which helped accelerate his downfall and triggered the Me Too movement .
On Wednesday , 66-year-old Weinstein was indicted and , if convicted of the most serious charges , could face between five and 25 years in prison .
McGowan posted on social media to welcome the news .
The 44-year-old actress said : “ INDICTED . FINALLY . I 've been indicted by the media he 's bought out for years to trash me . Now it is a new chapter for both of us . What would others say about you if they did n't know who you were ?
“ Who I am has been told to the world for me in magazines , newspapers , blogs , videos , tabloids . The narrative of me – my story – has been sold to you as a work of fiction . The media often cuts you when they can , especially if they 've been paid off to – the journalists and reporters who are safe in their cubicles and do not have to drown in your tears or see the bruises .
Harvey Weinstein listens during a court appearance in New York ( Steven Hirsch/New York Post via AP , Pool ) More
“ All they see is numbers . Views . Ratings . And all you were told is that I was a horror show . Someone damaged . Someone off-kilter . Someone not right .
“ Luckily , many worldwide saw through this fiction , sadly , far more continue to hound me with this false narrative without realizing that every evil thing they repeat about me means they are doing the work of a rapist . ”

MADRID — ZDF 's “ La Señora : The Woman Who Defied The Inquisition , ” Invercine & Wood 's “ An Ordinary Soldier ” and “ Día Cero , ” from Spain 's Versus Ent. , feature among 10 projects to be presented at the 2nd Pitch Copro Series , the biggest industry event at this year 's Conecta Fiction .
A co-production forum for European , Latin American and Latino U.S. drama series whose project competitions are backed by Spanish TV giants Movistar + and pubcaster RTVE , Conecta Fiction established itself in a vibrant first edition last June as Spain 's premiere drama series event .
Unspooling June 18-21 in Galicia 's Santiago de Compostela , at the end of the St. James Way , 2017 's inaugural edition caught the modern miracle of the international drama series scene where many titles now have a market outside their country of origin and companies team to share IP and divvy up release windows . The 10 projects to be profiled were selected from nearly 100 submissions 58 % from Europe , 19 % from Latin America , 13 % from the U.S . The 2nd Pitch Copro Series sessions will take place June 19 .
Sponsored by Movistar + and Spanish pubcaster RTVE , which offer development support for the winning project , the second Pitch Copro Series points up further contours in Europe and Latin America 's still-emerging higher-end drama series production landscape : the Germany-Spain production axis ; innovation in comedy formats ; France 's TV renovation ; Spanish-language producers ' bold embrace of genre ; above all , perhaps , the consolidation of woman 's fiction : Dramas driven by heroines who battle to shape their futures , whatever the challenges .

Budgeted at reportedly over €20 million ( $ 24 million ) , so by far the highest-end of series on display , “ La Señora : The Woman Who Defied The Inquisition ” is billed as a true-life action adventure . It turns on the extraordinary Gracia Nasi , a Jewish noblewoman and kind of Renaissance Europe Oskar Schindler , who leverages her own huge wealth via bribes , donations , the payment of higher taxes to wrestle protection from European states , while she set up an escape route for Inquisition-menaced Jews from Portugal to Constantinople and began to create a Zionist state . Written by Emmy-winning Gavin Scott ( “ The Borrowers , ” “ Legends of Earthsea ” ) and Germany 's Kersken Uwe , the 10-part “ La Señora ” is produced by G5fiction , part of ZDF , and ZDF Enterprises , the German pubcaster 's commercial arm .
Produced by Spain 's Versus Entertainment in association with Diffferent Entertainment and Sentido Films ( “ La próxima piel ” ) , “ Día Cero ” is the latest example of high-profile film companies , here distribution-production house Versus , moving into TV production . It weighs in as a high-concept comedy half-hour about people confronting the end of the world when it did n't happen . Suddenly , their pre-Apocalypse passions , errors and illusions leave hostages to fortune .
Alejandro Miranda 's Versus lead-produces . Based out of Diffferent , David Sainz , star-scribe of the enormously popular web-series “ Malviviendo , ” writes with Enrique Lojo ( “ Serramoura ” ) . Producing are Miranda , Diffferent 's Teresa Segura and Rafael Portela at Sentido Films .
A scribe on “ Profugos , ” Pablo Larrain 's pioneering HBO Latin America series , Enrique Videla writes and Julio Jorquera directs “ An Ordinary Soldier. ” It promises an intimate portrait of Chile 's Augusto Pinochet , a dictator who defined himself as a “ an ordinary soldier. ” Described as an action-drama , the six-part series marks the latest drama from Invercine & Wood . At the forefront of Chile 's high-end drama , it teamed with Turner Latin America to produce “ Mary & Mike , ” presented at this year 's Natpe and Berlin , directed by Jorquera , and a pioneering upscale pay TV drama made with Turner Latin America .
“ An Ordinary Soldier 's ” protagonist is obviously a man . Apart from this title , however , five projects at Conecta Fiction 's 2nd Pitch CoPro Series turn around women ; the remainder frame couples or ensemble casts .
Director of the Jaume Collet-Serra produced “ Mindscape , ” and episodes of “ The Department of Time ” and now Movistar + 's “ Giants , ” Jorge Dorado will pitch historical drama “ Cuatro Amores , ” an almost text-book narrative of a woman , Luisa , and her battle to live her own life , create her own storyline , in a post-Civil War Spain and Paris from 1940 to 1976 .
“ La Comandante , ” co-written again by Videla and a return-to-arms action thriller , features a woman in a role which would most ordinarily just a few years back have been allotted to a man – think “ Taken. ” Elisa Ramirez , once part of the armed guerrilla underground battling Pinochet , returns to Chile , to old allies and enemies , to free her abducted daughter , take what it may , who has been kidnapped during a business trip to the Atacama .
Part inspired by real events , “ El Palmar ” ( Apocryphal ) , an example of Spanish noir , tracks a Belfast homicide squad officer , Anne Keane , who travels to Seville to investigate the stomach-churning murder of an Irish bishop in a religious sect . With echoes of “ The Name of the Rose , ” Dan Brown , and indeed “ The Bridge , ” “ El Palmar ” is backed by Spain 's Emotion Media and Area de Television y Notices ( ATN ) .
Produced by Elephant , the most established of French production companies presenting projects in Santiago , the central question asked by the true events-inspired “ The Florence Cassez Case ” is whether the heroine , French citizen Cassez , really forged her own destiny or was a passive victim of events . Sentenced in 2007 to 60 years for kidnapping and organized crime , the Cassez Case series offers to portray “ the true story , its context and its heroine . ”

Just the second edition of an event which looks set to once more attract top TV executives from Latin America , plus a larger turnout from Spain , France and Germany , the 2nd Copro Series underscores new two trends for the forum : Renovation in an ever more cosmopolitan French fiction production sector ; Spain 's burgeoning new drama series production ecosystem .
The presence of three French projects , one from Germany , plus a focus on Germany , gives this year 's Conecta Fiction a far more European thrust .
Adding to France 's notable sci-fi fiction scene – think Thomas Cailley 's Series Mania winner “ Ad Vitam , ” “ Missions , ” prized at the 2017 MipDrama Screenings , or Lagardère Studios ' “ Trepalium ” and “ Transfer ” – the late ‘ 60s “ Ummo ” tracks a French scientist and Spanish female journalist plumbing mysterious disappearances and murders in Madrid . These may – or may not – be connected with the alleged arrival of an alien race , the Ummos . Nicolas Deprost 's Paris-based Wild Horses produces .
A potential highlight , bringing something new to the table , romantic drama “ Once a Year , ” from a woman screenwriter , Delphine Labouret , is a down-the-years ' romantic thriller tracking two lovers , both happily-enough married , who experience love at first sight in 2000 and agree to meet just once a year , on Dec. 29 . If one does n't show , that means the end of the affair .
At least five of the 10 projects at Conecta Fiction are set up by companies founded in the last ten years , or are being developed by companies moving into the sector : ZDF unit G5fiction , launched in 2015 , Versus Ent . ; Chile 's Invercine & Wood and Villano Producciones . Spain 's Kubelik Productions was founded 2008 .
Kubelik is developing ‘ Condor , ' an international crime thriller set in 1976 in which a rogue Spanish intelligence operative and ex-Chilean activist team to expose an international conspiracy targeting dissidence to Latin American dictatorships . At Conecta Fiction last year with “ Penumbra , ” Spanish author Pablo Barrera writes with Spain 's Alberto Macías . “ Condor ” marks the third project at the Copro Series turning – as past context , central issue , or source of suspense – on the homicidal crimes of Augusto Pinochet 's regime .
The 2nd Conecta Fiction is supported by Galicia 's Xunta government via the Galician Agency of Cultural Industries ( AGADIC ) , as well as the ICEX Spain Trade and Investment export board and Fundación SGAE , the training arm of Spanish rights collection society SGAE . Connect Fiction is produced by Inside Content .

Recovering addicts in SWFL weigh in on Trump 's opioid plan
Kristina Miller of Buckingham lost her brother to the opioid epidemic—after overcoming her own addiction to a doctor 's post-surgery prescription of pain killers .
“ We got a life sentence of a heartache . We 'll never get over this , ” Miller said . “ That 's a call the doctor should make – no more , not to continue to give people stuff that should only be for end of life terminal or something like that . ”
The number of deaths from opioids more than doubled in Lee County last year compared to in 2016 .
“ We know that 66 percent of people who get opioids illegally get them from us . They get them from parents , or grandparents , or neighbors , ” said Deborah Comella , the executive director of the Lee County Coalition for a Drug-Free SWFL .
While Miller says doctors were her and her brother 's problem , she thinks President Trump 's plan to put drug dealers to death is a step in the right direction .
“ Make them go to the morgue . Make them realize what 's coming of this . You 're taking people 's lives , ” Miller said .
But Hank Bertodatto , a recovering alcoholic who 's lost more than a dozen friends to opioids , does n't think the death penalty will help .
“ It 's a vicious cycle and I do n't think that by scaring people into the death penalty is really going to stop the problem , ” Bertodatto said .
President Trump 's plan calls for up to $ 13 billion of funding for treatment .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that a new North American Free Trade Agreement could be agreed quickly , as Canada hailed progress on forging new rules for the auto industry , the pivotal issue in talks to revamp the 24-year-old accord .
Ministers from the United States , Canada and Mexico responsible for NAFTA met in Washington to narrow outstanding differences in the hope of tying up a deal in the coming days .
`` NAFTA , as you know , is moving along . They ( Mexico ) have an election coming up very soon , '' Trump said at a cabinet meeting briefly attended by reporters .
`` But we 're doing very nicely with NAFTA . I could make a deal really quickly , but I 'm not sure that 's in the best interests of the United States . But we 'll see what happens , '' he said .
While details are not yet clear , a new NAFTA is likely to push the region 's automakers to source more parts from North America in order to create more jobs . Such an outcome could also raise costs for Detroit 's main car manufacturers .
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland , U.S. Trade Representative ( USTR ) Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo are pressing for a quick deal to avoid clashing with Mexico 's July 1 presidential election .
To do so , they must reach a compromise on several contentious U.S. demands , including raising the regional automotive content requirements to qualify for tariff-free trade .
Trump 's negotiators had initially demanded North American-built vehicles contain 85 percent content made in NAFTA countries by value , up from 62.5 percent now , and said that half the value must be U.S.-made .
Industry officials say the regional demand has been cut to about 75 percent and the U.S. content pitch dropped .
Entering the USTR 's office near the White House , Freeland said the latest talks would focus on the auto sector rules of origin , calling it `` the heart '' of the new NAFTA .
`` We have been making good progress . This is an issue which is fiendishly complex , '' she told reporters .
Trump on Monday again fanned uncertainty by threatening to tie a NAFTA deal to Mexico 's immigration controls , a suggestion the Mexican government quickly dismissed .
Mexico , which at the outset of the Trump presidency said it would treat the NAFTA revamp as part of a general review of its relations with the United States , has pushed back in the talks by threatening to become less cooperative with Washington .
Two weeks ago Mexico vowed to analyse all cooperation with the United States and the government on Tuesday circulated an official 's letter to the Mexican Senate saying President Enrique Pena Nieto would soon consider the findings of the review .
Arriving for talks with Lighthizer , Mexico 's Guajardo said flexibility will be needed to reach a deal . Guajardo said that Mexico would not accept any U.S. tariffs on aluminium or steel - another measure Trump has threatened to tie to NAFTA . A U.S. exemption to tariffs ends on by May 1 .
Negotiators say a new NAFTA could be possible by early May .
`` In the coming 10 days we can really have a new agreement in principle , '' said Moises Kalach , head of the international negotiating arm of the CCE business lobby , which represents the Mexican private sector at the talks .
`` As soon as there is political will from the American government to go for a final deal , I think we can close this , '' Kalach told Mexican radio . `` We 've had all our ( negotiating ) teams in Washington for two weeks and we will continue working all this week , the weekend and into next week . ''

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A federal judge on Thursday blocked the deportation of 50 Indonesian Christians who have been living illegally in New Hampshire while they seek to reopen their immigration cases to argue they would likely face religious persecution in their home country .
The group includes people who fled violence in that country two decades ago and had been living openly for years in New England under an informal deal with Immigration and Customs Enforcement until President Donald Trump 's administration last year ordered an end to the arrangement .
U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston ruled that ICE can not move forward with deportation until the Indonesians have a chance to make their cases for legal residence by arguing they would face persecution or violence if sent back .
She ruled that processes used by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals were not adequate to protect their rights as they could be deported while their cases were still pending to the world 's largest majority-Muslim nation .
“ Thus , under this Kafkaesque procedure , they will be removed back to the very country where they fear persecution and torture while awaiting a decision on whether they should be subject to removal because of their fears of persecution and torture , ” Saris wrote .
Saris , who previously temporarily blocked their deportation pending her latest ruling , issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Indonesians ' removal until after the board ruled on whether to reopen their cases .
Sandra Pontoh , pastor of the Madbury Maranatha Indonesian Fellowship in Madbury , New Hampshire , who has been working on the immigrants ' behalf welcomed the news .
“ That 's what we were hoping she would say , ” Pontoh said in a phone interview . “ My friends will have enough time and their lawyers will have enough time to work on their cases . ”
The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment .
Members of the Indonesian community , who live along New Hampshire 's seacoast began receiving orders to return in August , as they showed up for routine ICE check-ins .
In September , they sued , contending their removals violated their due process rights under the U.S. Constitution . Federal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them .
Federal courts do not have direct authority over immigration matters . But over the Justice Department 's objections , Saris in October ruled that she had jurisdiction .
Their cause has drawn the support of New Hampshire 's all-Democratic congressional delegation , including U.S . Senator Jeanne Shaheen , and Republican Governor Chris Sununu .

PARIS : The son of Equatorial Guinea 's president was put on trial in his absence on Monday in France , accused of buying palatial Parisian properties and exotic cars with money plundered from his native country , a small oil-rich state on Africa 's west coast .
Teodorin Obiang , the eldest son of President Teodoro Obiang and a vice-president himself , denies charges of laundering embezzled public funds , which expose him to a sentence of 10 years in jail and huge fines if convicted .
The case is the first of several to reach court in a broader judicial investigation into allegations of illicit acquisitions in France by long-time leaders and family relatives in several African countries including Gabon and Congo Republic .
Obiang stayed away but his lawyer requested that the trial be suspended on the grounds that his client had not been given enough time to properly prepare his defence in a complex case , having been summoned to trial just three weeks ago .
`` We 're not talking about a moped theft charge , '' Emmanuel Marsigny , his lawyer in Paris , told Reuters .
Among the acquisitions at the centre of the trial is a large property bought for 25 million euros in 2005 on Paris 's upmarket Avenue Foch , with gymnasium , hammam steam room , hair-dressing studio and a discotheque with cinema screen .
In addition to luxury clothing and jewels , prosecutors say Obiang , 48 , built up an exceptional collection of costly cars , which along with clothes , jewels and real estate took the value of all his assets to around 100 million euros ( US $ 105 million ) .
Obiang says his purchases were above-board .
But prosecutors say the assets do not tally with his salary at the time of the purchases . According to a parallel U.S. inquiry , he earned US $ 80,000 a year as farming and forestry minister , a post that obliged him to refrain from other business dealings .
Beyond Obiang 's case , the broader French probe known as the `` ill-gotten assets '' investigation concerns purchases in France by the family of Gabon leader Ali Bongo as well as Congo Republic leader Denis Sassou Nguesso .
Those two strands of inquiry , police say , concern more than 60 properties in Paris and 200 bank accounts .
The court said when it opened proceedings that it would decide on Wednesday whether the trial slated to end by mid-January would go ahead as planned or be suspended in response to the request from Obiang 's lawyer .

The generally smooth launch of bitcoin futures on Cboe Global Markets could pave the way for other cryptocurrency-related products like options and ETFs , the head of the exchange operator said in an interview on Monday .
It may take U.S. regulators a bit longer to warm to the idea of a proliferation of products and securities related to digital currencies , but Cboe Chief Executive Ed Tilly said this weekend 's debut should support progress toward that .
“ We will be building confidence in the coming months , and stay tuned , there are more to come , ” he said . Chicago-based Cboe operates markets in options , futures , equities and currencies .
The most-active contract exhibited the volatility that has become bitcoin 's hallmark , surging 20 percent at one point to trigger a five-minute trading halt .
“ We saw pretty volatile overnight markets , a lot of price moves , but everything worked as it should , ” Tilly said .
Cboe was the first U.S.-based , traditional exchange to offer bitcoin futures , and its widely anticipated launch on Sunday evening was seen as a litmus test for more mainstream adoption of the digital asset .
By early afternoon on Monday , nearly 3,700 contracts had traded hands , with nearly 20 trading firms participating . Most of the activity was concentrated in the January , or front-month , contract XBTF8 .
“ Just about all of the participants who had shown us readiness late last week and even into this weekend , showed up , ” Tilly said .
On the heels of the launch , three fund managers , REX Shares LLC , Van Eck Associates Corp and First Trust Advisors LP , went back to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking permission to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds .
The SEC has denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals so far , but proponents think a successful debut of futures could breathe new life into the plans . Cboe plans to wait until there have been a couple of settlements on the one-month futures contracts before it moves forward with any new crypto-derivative products , said Tilly .
Those could include options on futures contracts and on ETFs , Tilly said . Cboe has also appealed a ruling by the SEC that blocked a Cboe-listed bitcoin ETF proposed by the Gemini bitcoin exchange , which Cboe uses for the final settlement price of its bitcoin futures contracts .
Bitcoin is the largest of the hundreds of crypto-currencies that have flooded the over-the-counter market in recent years , and as demand for other digital coins rises , futures on those coins will follow , Tilly said . “ I do see other currencies going forward . ”
Let 's Do it Again
Bitcoin has almost tripled in value in the past month and is up around 15-fold this year . That volatility had some worried about how Cboe 's bitcoin futures would trade .
Just after the opening tick of $ 15,000 at 6 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday , the price of the contract surged 10 percent higher . Cboe had the option of halting trading at that point , but allowed it to continue because trading was orderly , Tilly said .
Following another 10 percent climb , Cboe halted trading in the futures contract for five minutes .
“ Markets came back in line and we reopened in an orderly fashion , ” said Tilly . “ We could not have been more pleased with the way that played out last night . ”
Also around the time trading started , Cboe 's website , which is not connected to the company 's trading engine , briefly went down . Tilly said the outage was the result of traffic that was around six times more than the site receives on an average weekday .
Never has a new product launch at Cboe exceeded the level of interest and anticipation around bitcoin futures , he said . “ It 's just been so exciting for us to bring this to market . I told the team last night , I said , ‘ let 's do this every Sunday ! This is a ton of fun . ' ”

NASHVILLE — Country star Eric Church says he felt “ broken ” after the Las Vegas massacre . So he tried to fix it the only way he knows how — with music .
Church wrote a song called “ Why Not Me , ” which he performed during his show Wednesday at the Grand Ole Opry , and dedicated it to the victims and survivors of the shooting .
Church had performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival two days before 58 people were killed there . The senseless deaths of so many people — many of them his fans — was weighing him down .
“ That night something broke in me , ” said Church , near tears . “ And the only way I 've ever fixed anything that 's been broken in me is with music . ”
He told the crowd he was inspired to write “ Why Not Me ” after thinking about his fans who perished in the violence .
“ I saw that crowd . I saw 'em with their hands in the air . I saw 'em with boots in the air , ” he said . “ What I saw , that moment in time that was frozen , there 's no amount of bullets that can take it away . ”
Victims of the Las Vegas massacre
He also said the song was for two people who were n't in the Grand Ole Opry crowd to hear it — Sonny and Heather Melton .
“ Last night , somebody sent me a video , of a lady named Heather Melton , ” he said . “ And she was talking to Anderson Cooper on CNN . And she had on our ‘ Church Choir ' tour shirt . And he said ‘ What brought you to Vegas ? ' And she goes , ‘ We went there to see Eric Church . ' Because it was Sonny 's , her husband that died , it was his guy . ‘ And we went there to see his guy . ' And then she said we have tickets for the Grand Ole Opry tomorrow night . ”
Church pointed out two empty seats in Section 3 , Row F .
“ There are some empty seats . That 's their seats , ” said Church , his voice filled with emotion . “ The reason I 'm here , the reason why I 'm here tonight is because of Heather Melton , her husband Sonny who died and every person who was there . ”
Sunday is a big day for football and parties as the Patriots take on the Eagles in Super Bowl LII .
But super Sunday is also known as one of the biggest drinking days of the year .
With that comes sobering consequences according to MADD Hawaii Founder Carol McNamee .
“ There are a number of holidays and other days that are considered the most dangerous , ” McNamee said . “ And I know that Super Bowl is right up there at least in the first four or five … even if you 're on the road and you have n't done anything and you have n't even gone to a party , be extra cognizant of the fact that other people might not be driving too well . ”
Statistics show that the in the first hour after the big game is over there is a 70 percent increase in car accidents .
That 's not the only consequence of drunk driving .
In 2013 more than 10,000 people died in alcohol related crashes , and if you do n't die or wreck your car , you could get arrested for DUI .
According to Marcus Landsberg , a DUI defense attorney , “ there 's always a spike for DUI attorneys after the Super Bowl or any holiday that encourages drinking . ”
If convicted of a DUI , you could have your license suspended for a year , have to do 72 hours of community service , pay a $ 1000 fine , and you could spend 5 days in jail .
“ The easiest way to avoid being convicted of a DUI is not to drink and not to drive , and definitely do n't do both at the same time , ” Landsberg said .
Lani Nakamura , co-owner of Wisp Restaurant & Lounge , said they are providing free soda and coffee for designated drivers at their restaurant 's party .
“ Of course we always encourage other forms of transportation such as catching a cab , Uber , or Lyft , ” Nakamura said . “ We want to be responsible in our community . We do n't want our customers to injure anybody else , and we do n't want to be a part of that . We want to make sure everybody has a great time and gets home safely . ”
McNamee said the best thing to do before you head off to any Super Bowl LII event is to plan ahead .
Making your transportation arrangements before you start drinking guarantees you 'll get home safely .
DENVER ( AP )  The driver of a van was killed Tuesday when the vehicle went through a railroad crossing and was struck by a commuter train that serves the Denver airport , authorities said . Four train passengers suffered minor injuries .
Police and federal railroad officials were investigating the crash .
The crossing gates were working but it was not clear when they started to go down , police Sgt . Chris Amsler said . The gates were down when the train hit the van , he said .
The rail line has had problems with its automated crossing gates since it began running nearly a year ago , requiring its operator to post off-duty police and flaggers at crossings as a backup to keep drivers off the tracks .

An officer and a flagger were working at the crossing in suburban Aurora when the van drove toward it as a train approached about 3:50 a.m. , Amsler said .
The officer tried to stop the van but it kept going and was hit by the train and pushed for about a quarter of a mile before the conductor was able to stop .
Three of the injured passengers on the train were treated at the scene and one was taken to a hospital .
The Regional Transportation District opened the airport train line in April despite problems during testing with crossing gates going down when trains were not passing or not fully going down when they were .
State regulators required posting workers at the crossings as a temporary solution .
The Federal Railroad Administration granted several 90-day operational waivers to allow the airport trains to run while RTD and its contractor , Denver Transit Partners , work to resolve the problem . The most recent waiver was granted in January .
FRA investigators were at the scene Tuesday . The agency said the investigation will have no immediate impact on the agency 's waiver for the rail line .
There have been other problems since the line opened , including sporadic delays and power outages .
In May , about 80 passengers were evacuated when a train became stranded on a 50-foot-high bridge .
The cause was lightning that severed a wire supporting electricity lines , disrupting power used by the electric powered trains , RTD said .
During the initial investigation Tuesday , trains were running from downtown 's Union Station to a station in Aurora , where airport-bound passengers were transferred to shuttle buses .

LONDON/BEIJING - China 's Nanjing Hanrui Cobalt , which sells the metal to a firm approved by the London Metal Exchange , said it was unable to ascertain that its products did not involve the use of child labour in Africa .
Nanjing Hanrui is a supplier to another Chinese company , Yantai Cash , which is on the LME 's list of firms whose cobalt meets its quality standards .
Concerns about the sourcing of Yantai 's metal have reduced interest in the LME 's cobalt contract , trading sources said , although there is no proof to date that children are involved in its extraction .
The issue is sensitive because cobalt chemicals are used in batteries to power the electric vehicles whose rapid growth is revolutionising the motor industry . Car companies are worried about possible scarcities of responsibly sourced cobalt .
Nanjing Hanrui said in a statement that it was examining its cobalt supply chain in the Democratic Republic of Congo , adding that initial findings showed `` a part '' of its cobalt came from `` small-scale mining and artisanal mining areas '' .
As this investigation started just over a month ago , the company still lacked experience in supply chain compliance management and it was `` not yet possible to judge whether there is a risk of child labour , '' the statement said .

Nanjing Hanrui said it was stepping up its supply chain studies with the help of experts .
Liu Xiaohan , manager of the international trade department at Yantai Cash , said in an emailed response that the firm bought part of its cobalt from Nanjing Hanrui , which is a business partner of Yantai Cash .
`` We are currently unable to confirm what you discuss about Nanjing Hanrui 's artisanal mining and the risk of it involving child labour , '' Liu said .
This is because Yantai Cash has just started to set up a responsible management system and has not yet completed supply chain traceability , he added .
Yantai Cash 's metal can be delivered against the LME 's cobalt contract , which was launched in 2010 .
The LME said action would be taken if any evidence was found of practices that fell below its standards .
Concerns arose in the market about the source of Yantai 's metal in June after it started buying from Hanrui , sources said .
`` The market is worried Yantai 's cobalt is sullied by child labour , the LME should take it off the deliverable list , '' a source on the exchange 's cobalt committee said .
The source said customers did not want to take the risk of getting Yantai metal . `` They are shunning the contract . ''
TAINTED
Cobalt metal is used in alloys for jet engines , while cobalt chemicals are a key ingredient for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles .
Consumers worried about potential scandal are under pressure to ensure the cobalt they use is not tainted by child labour in DRC , the source of about 65 percent of the world 's cobalt .
Concerns about shortages of cobalt from untainted sources have prompted carmakers to take steps to secure supplies for the longer term .
Volkswagen last month held talks with Glencore , China 's Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , commodity trader Traxys , U.S. miner Freeport-McMoran and Eurasian Resources Group about securing cobalt supplies .
`` Besides supplies and costs , other topics in discussion include future capacity expansion , sustainability and transparency , '' a VW representative said .
A report last month from Amnesty International said about a fifth of cobalt production in the DRC is mined by hand , including by children , often in dangerous conditions .
`` At least on a temporary basis , they have to ban Yantai Cash from the good delivery list , '' a cobalt industry source said , adding that worries about Yantai metal had negatively impacted prices , volumes traded and open interest , a measure of the flow of money into the market .
LME cobalt at around US $ 70,000 a tonne has recently traded well below benchmark prices gathered by Metal Bulletin , a trade publication .
The discount has widened since June 19 , when worries about where Yantai 's material was sourced from started to filter through the market . It has averaged US $ 4,500 a tonne since June 19 from near US $ 400 a tonne between Jan 2 and June 16 .
Open interest crashed by more than 40 percent to 308 tonnes between June 19 and 22 , while volumes traded on the LME in the third quarter at 1,949 tonnes are less than half the levels in the previous three quarters .
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING INITIATIVES
Yantai Cash said it is willing to work with companies in the cobalt supply chain `` as well as other stakeholders to promote the alleviation of child labour and other human rights risks '' .
It recently submitted an application to join China 's Responsible Cobalt Initiative ( RCI ) . A representative of the RCI secretariat said Yantai Cash 's application would be accepted by Dec. 12 if there are no objections from the RCI board .
The RCI was formed last year under the umbrella of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Metals , Minerals and Chemicals Importers & Exporters ( CCCMC ) . Its members agreed last month to establish the association as a legal entity with more than 20 members involved in the cobalt supply chain
The LME too has been looking at the subject of responsible sourcing and has been working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , which gets involved in setting such standards , for several years .
`` There is no international standard in this area and the jurisdictional differences between certification regimes , audits and codes are extensive , '' the LME spokesperson said .
Last month the exchange sent out a survey on responsible sourcing , auditing and certification of metal to all producers delivering metal against LME contracts .
`` The LME 's recent survey sent to all LME-listed producers was designed to elicit further information with regard to the sourcing of materials , '' a statement said .
`` We have been clear that any evidence of sub-standard practices that fall short of our requirements would be investigated by the LME and action would be taken , '' it added .
The LME said it wanted to apply international standards on responsible sourcing . These would cover sustainable environmental management and occupational health , required for producers wanting to deliver against LME contracts .

MOUNT PLEASANT , S.C. — It was n't the Easter bunny that startled a South Carolina homeowner and his family . It was n't even a burglar .
The Post and Courier of Charleston reports Susie and Steve Polston were worried that someone was trying to get into their home on Sunday . Instead , Polston 's 16-year-old son found the intruder : a nine-foot alligator crawling on their second-story porch .
The family says the alligator climbed a back stairwell to the porch , crunched through the aluminum screen door and nestled between a sofa and a swinging bench .
State law requires a nuisance-trapped alligator to be killed , but the family did n't want that . The other choice was to wait it out , but the alligator was eventually euthanized .
Last year , an alligator rang a doorbell , while another fell asleep on a porch .
Beardy 's and Okemasis First Nation in Saskatchewan will receive millions of dollars in compensation on Wednesday from a settlement that stems from a dispute dating back to the 1885 Northwest Rebellion .
The Specific Claims Tribunal ruled in 2015 that the federal government breached its lawful obligation to pay the First Nation members treaty annuities after the Northwest Rebellion .
READ MORE : Beardy 's and Okemasis First Nation awarded $ 4.5 million in compensation
The First Nation announced in December that the tribunal had awarded it $ 4.5 million and that the government had until late January to appeal .
Following the rebellion , the federal government at the time believed Beardy 's and Okemasis First Nation members were involved in the resistance and withheld annuities from the First Nation and 13 others in Saskatchewan from 1885 to 1888 .
The First Nation says on its website that it will make a one-time , $ 250 payment to registered members .
It says it has also set up a trust fund and will use the borrowing power to help refinance an existing consolidation loan , as well as secure a loan for the re-development of a community-owned service station .
“ We feel that distributing the total sum of the settlement would not be a responsible course of action . We do however recognize the current , immediate needs of our people , ” a statement on the First Nation 's website said .
“ With these two critical factors in mind , we have developed a plan that strikes an appropriate balance of protecting our Nation 's future , while meeting some of the immediate needs of our people . ”

The First Nation is about 90 kilometres north of Saskatoon .
The per capita distribution of money will happen March 2 and 3 at the community 's recreation centre .
After the rebellion , the federal government labelled men , women and children on the First Nation , along with the 13 others , as “ rebel Indians ” even though many could not have possibly taken part in the resistance .
In addition to withholding annuity payments , a pass system was strictly enforced , not allowing residents to leave the reserves without permission .
Abidjan , Côote d'Ivoire , 8 December 2017 – The African Development Bank 's 2017 Country Results Brief released recently is dedicated Tanzania .
The report analyzes Tanzania 's economic situation as a country at the crossroads that has maintained an average growth rate of 6 % over the last decade — supported by the industrial sector and agricultural exports — with human development gains . The brief reviews the Bank 's performance in Tanzania against the goals it set itself , including how it intends to help the country achieve inclusive and sustainable development , with the overarching objective of raising the country to middle-income status by 2025 .
“ Tanzania is an excellent example of how the Bank can have an impact on development through its High 5s , ” said AfDB Director General for East Africa Gabriel Negatu . “ Thanks to our investments , the country is well on track to becoming a middle-income country by 2025 . ”
Among other investments , the Bank is doing a great deal to modernise roads , which are vital for the country 's development and the well-being of its population : nearly 12,660 km of roads has been built over the past ten years , facilitating the mobility of people and trade . The AfDB now plans to put more emphasis on improving urban transport systems and regional roads connecting Tanzania to neighboring countries .
Another priority for the Bank in Tanzania is to create a dynamic private sector that can provide productive jobs—a crucial element for the country 's future and its people , as some 800,000 young people enter the labor market every year . .
This Country Results Brief describes recent economic and social trends in Tanzania , particularly those related to the Bank 's five key development priorities , the High 5s : Light up and Power Africa , Feed Africa , Industrialise Africa , Integrate Africa , and Improve the quality of life of the people of Africa . It also reviews how the Bank manages to optimise its investments by improving people 's quality of life :
Light up and power Africa —70 % of Tanzanians still do not have access to electricity and the demand for energy continues to grow . With its New Deal on Energy for Africa , the AfDB is working to unify efforts to provide universal access to energy . The Bank has built 630 km of transmission and distribution lines .
Feed Africa — 40 % of Tanzanians live in food insecurity , while the country has large pockets of arable land . Optimal use of these lands in agriculture would significantly improve the living conditions of the population . The Bank 's action in this domain has dramatically improved the lives of four million Tanzanians .
Industrialise Africa —The Tanzanian economy suffers from a lack of industrialisation . Only a quarter of the population has access to financing to engage in entrepreneurship and small-scale development projects . The Bank supports financial institutions that have granted 155,000 microloans and project investments to benefit 455,000 people .
Integrate Africa — With its Regional Integration Policy and Strategy , the Bank aims to facilitate the flow of goods and services , as well as the mobility of people and investments . It has built 12,660 km of roads in the country .
Improving the quality of life for the people of Africa — Tanzania 's economic growth has not been fast enough , nor inclusive enough to create jobs and improve people 's quality of life . The Bank is working to strengthen the technical skills of thousands of Tanzanians to enable the country 's economy to realize its full potential in sectors with high recruitment potential . The Bank has already enabled 3,860 people to benefit from vocational training and another million to gain access to education .
This report reviews Tanzania 's progress on the Bank 's High 5s , based on a set of indicators from the Bank 's 2016-2025 Results Measurement Framework . It also assesses the effectiveness of the Bank in managing its operations in the country .
“ Our footprint in Tanzania is strong , as we have hardwired our Business Delivery Model into project design for sustainable outcomes ” , said Simon Mizrahi , Director for Delivery , Performance Management and Results .
In order to meet the specific needs of Tanzania , the Bank is getting closer to the ground and optimising the use of its resources . All these changes will help achieve the desired structural transformation in Tanzania and on the continent , in line with the Bank 's ten-year strategy . The High 5 priorities are an integral part of that effort and will remain at the centre of the Bank 's ambitious plans to support Tanzania 's transformation within a decade .
Today , the Bank has a portfolio of 21 operations in Tanzania , valued at US $ 1.8 billion .

MIAMI COUNTY — Miami County Park District is seeking a new 1.5-mill operating levy to replace its current 1.1-mill levy this November .
According to Miami County Park District Executive Director Scott Myers , the parks ' popularity has surged in recent years and will welcome nearly 900,000 visitors through its gates by the end of 2017 . That figure is estimated to eclipse 2016 's attendance of more than 679,000 people .
This summer , the board of park commissioners approved to replace its current 10-year , 1.1-mill levy with a 10-year , 1.5-mill levy on June 27 .
If passed , the existing levy of 1.1 millage will be canceled and replaced by the new proposed levy . The district is in the eighth year of the current 10-year levy .
The new operating levy would raise $ 3.4 million per year or $ 1.1 million more than the current levy , Myers said .
Myers said the park district conducted a community survey , which garnered favorable feedback from the community .
Myers said the park district 's growth in areas such as programming from adult to toddler education , conservation , environmental protection , and school education has been due to the community 's demand for such activities .
“ In order for us to continue to do this with the growth that we have , we ca n't continue to do it at this pace . With additional usage comes additional maintenance and additional law enforcement , so those costs have gone up quite a bit over the last few years , ” Myers said .
“ We have an excellent park system , and people in this area value parks . A great park system allows folks , from a mental and physical health standpoint , ( to be ) healthy . It helps kids . It 's so great for the kids to have an area where they can go — walk in woods or walk in the river and see blue herons and see the eagles — to see wildlife in the parks . Those will be experiences they 'll never forget . ”
If passed , the levy will cost $ 52.50 per year for the owner of a $ 100,000 home , or an additional $ 18 per year compared to the current levy .
The levy accounts for approximately 85 percent of the park district 's budget .
The Miami County Park District has expanded from seven parks in 2001 to 15 parks in 2016 and has nearly doubled its park acreage from 1,290 acres to 2,116 acres in the same time period .
Myers said there are no current plans to add more parks to the current system . He said the long-term plan is to add additional bathrooms at the Lostcreek Reserve and expand the park district 's off-road bike trails and maintain the parks ' current infrastructure . Myers said the levy , if passed , will dedicate $ 100,000 per year to expand the off-road bike trail east and west of Piqua and tie-in to its nearby park systems in the future .
The park district has been operating at a 1.1 mil levy level since 2001 .

RIYDAH : The global renown of billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal made his involuntary detention in early November at Riyadh 's Ritz-Carlton hotel one of the biggest single shocks of Saudi Arabia 's anti-corruption crackdown .
The campaign , led by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , swept up nearly 400 members of the kingdom 's political and business elite . Authorities estimated financial settlements from the accused would net about US $ 100 billion .
In late January , a BBC broadcast featured a Canadian businessman who said he had spoken with the prince via video link and that the prince appeared to be sitting in jail rather than at the five-star hotel . Saudi Arabia 's authorities had converted the hotel into a luxury prison where hundreds of the kingdom 's wealthiest figures were being held .
Reuters reached out to Saudi authorities for comment ; they denied the allegations . Then , they invited us to see Prince Alwaleed at the Ritz for ourselves .
The interview was arranged within hours . At 1am on Jan 27 , a government car picked me up and drove me through the hotel 's massive front gates . It was the first time I had seen them open in nearly three months .
After a brief wait and a tour of the hotel 's empty facilities , I was escorted to an ornate sixth-floor suite where Prince Alwaleed was waiting .

Officials told me not to film outside the suite or catch any of them on camera . No conditions were placed on the interview itself .
The prince promptly took control , ushering me into the office and enthusiastically granting permission to film . The officials exited the room , leaving only the two of us throughout our 25-minute discussion .

Prince Alwaleed said he had been treated well during his time at the Ritz .
He took a defiant stance on the accusations of corruption , saying that he was innocent and that he was certain he would emerge from the process in full control of his assets and his company , Kingdom Holding .
It is impossible to know if Prince Alwaleed was truly free to speak his mind , given that he was still in detention as part of an extrajudicial legal process .
He appeared thin , but he was confident and upbeat , even making jokes as he took me on a tour of the suite . He smiled broadly and insisted that we take a photo together .
I recorded our exchange on my iPhone , propped up by a golden tissue box and a water bottle on his desk .
Hours later , the prince was released .

The people of Toronto woke up reeling Tuesday morning . Still trying to make sense of the tragic van attack that left 10 people dead and another 15 injured .
The mourning process truly began as the first victim was identified that day , followed by others later in the afternoon .
It is those victims who are in our thoughts . It is their lives that deserve to be honoured and recognized . Theirs are the families that are left with searing holes in their hearts .
Yet people all across Canada still have questions . Who is Alek Minassian , the 25-year-old now charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder ? Why did he do what he 's alleged to have done ? What was going through his mind ?
These are legitimate questions . The public – to say nothing of the families – are owed proper answers from our tireless journalists and law enforcement officials .
Bit by bit , a story is emerging . It seems Minassian was socially awkward , suffering from a form of autism . A social media post suggests he was part of an online community that complains about the lack of romance in their lives .
We may never get a full understanding of the why . That does n't mean people need to take this silently . It does n't mean we have to shrug and leave this behind .
This case may not fit the legal or technical definitions of terrorism . But it certainly is terrorism in the way we casually speak about it .
A vehicular ramming is the new mass shooting , at least in places in Western Europe and Canada where semi-automatic weapons are more difficult to acquire .
They are touted in glossy publications by ISIS and Al-Qaeda as the ideal attack . These terror groups have called for these exact attacks here in Canada .
Minassian does n't have to have been a religious extremist to have been inspired but what he saw in the news and online . The ISIS types have promoted this new style of attack and now it seems others have taken the ball and run with it .
They 're tough attacks to prevent . And that 's precisely why the terrorists like them so much .
In the meantime , 10 families are left picking up the pieces while the rest of the city mourns .

PESHAWAR - The American Consulate General Peshawar 's Regional Security Office and the American Embassy 's International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section ( INL ) hosted a six-day study tour in Boston , Massachusetts , from May 24 to 29 , for seven Pakistani law enforcement officials to study issues related to protecting urban communities and facilities against terrorist attacks .
The Pakistani delegation visited local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies to examine how they work to keep American cities and critical infrastructure secure . The Pakistani visitors studied investigative techniques aimed at disrupting attacks during the planning phase , physical security upgrades to thwart attacks , and ways for security forces and the public to respond to attacks .
“ The Pakistani police make sacrifices every day to keep their communities safe . Both in the United States and Pakistan , we depend on the police to protect our people , and we will continue to stand together with the people of Pakistan in the fight against terrorism and in our commitment to security and rule of law in Pakistan , ” INL Director Gregory Schiffer said .
For almost 40 years , the United States and Pakistan have worked to improve citizen security and enhance police capacity across Pakistan .

TORONTO , March 10 ( Reuters ) - Canada 's main stock index declined on Friday as weakness in commodity prices fueled a decline in shares of the heavyweight natural resource sectors .
At 9:40 AM EST ( 1440 GMT ) , the Toronto Stock Exchange 's S & P/TSX composite index fell 101.84 points , or 0.64 percent , to 15,759.08 .
In a goof-up by the organisers , former goalkeeper Bhaskar Ganguly was not called for felicitation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi just before India 's U-17 World Cup match against the USA here on Friday , despite his name being there in the list.Prime Minister Narendra Modi felicitated the captains of Indian football teams that played in the Asian Games . But when Ganguly 's name was called after P K Banerjee and Syed Nayeemuddin , Rajasthan footballer Magan Singh Rajvi came out and received the shawl and memento from the Prime Minister . `` There was a mix-up but as soon as we came to know of it , we decided to rectify it . Bhaskar was later felicitated privately at the half-time of the India vs USA match . We also apologised to him for the incident , '' an official from the organisers of the felicitation ceremony told PTI.Others felicitated by the Prime Minister included IM Vijayan , Bhaichuing Bhutia , Sunil Chhetri and Bembem Devi . PM Modi presented all of them with a shawl and a memento .
In a different world , or at least a better world than the one we 've created , this would n't be a story .
But in today 's world , sadly , it is .
Ed Hervey , the B.C . Lions ' general manager , is African-American . Jarious Jackson , the Lions ' offensive co-ordinator , is African-American . So 's Mark Washington , the Lions ' defensive co-ordinator . So 's Torey Hunter , the Lions ' director of player personnel .
In the NFL and CFL , this level of minority representation in key organizational positions is unprecedented . Never mind that each man is almost overqualified for his job . And never mind that each of the four wants to be judged on wins and losses , not skin colour .
In 2018 , this is still newsworthy . Maybe one day , the game will get to a place where it wo n't be a story , and that will be a great day . Until then , this is important and each of the four men understands that even if they do n't like it .
“ Sure , it 's a story and we 're proud that it 's a story , ” says Hervey . “ But in today 's era , should it be a story ? Probably not . We 're more than capable of doing the job . We just need the opportunity . ”
Even if those opportunities were n't always there .
“ There were guys 30 , 40 years ago who were qualified who were n't given opportunities , ” says Washington . “ All these men have more than earned it . They put the work in and they 've been successful . It 's not a token thing at all . These men are good at what they do . ”
Which should be the point , but it 's never that simple .
The CFL likes to believe it 's colour-blind , that it makes decisions based on merit , and its record allows it to make that claim . At least more forcefully than the NFL .
Currently there are n't any black head coaches in the Canadian game , but six of the 18 offensive and defensive co-ordinator positions are filled by African-Americans , including Jackson and Washington , Calgary defensive co-ordinator DeVone Claybrooks , Winnipeg defensive co-ordinator Richie Hall , Saskatchewan offensive co-ordinator Stephen McAdoo and Montreal offensive co-ordinator Khari Jones .
In Hamilton , Orlondo Steinauer returned to the Ticats this season with the title of assistant head coach after serving as the team 's defensive co-ordinator from 2013 to '16 . Marcus Brady also left his post as the Argos ' offensive co-ordinator this off-season to take a job with the Kansas City Chiefs .
In the front office , Hervey and Montreal 's Kavis Reed sit in the general manager 's chair and Hunter and Ottawa 's Jean-Marc Edme serve as directors of player personnel . In a nine-team league , that 's notable .
Hervey also says it 's reflective of the CFL .
“ I 'd say the opportunities we 've seen have been far greater than what they 've seen down south , ” he says . “ The CFL has always been more open .
“ In my case , I built up some equity in Edmonton as a player and a scout and my opportunity came quickly . I was fortunate but I was also ready . ”
There 's that question of opportunity again . The NFL currently employs eight minority head coaches : seven African-Americans and Ron Rivera , the Carolina Panthers ' head coach . That ties for the highest number of African-American coaches in league history which , theoretically , suggests the Rooney Rule has made an impact .
As for the reality , that depends on who you ask . Enacted in 2003 , the Rooney Rule forces NFL teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior front-office positions . There were six black coaches in NFL history from the league 's inception in 1920 to 2003 . In the 14 years since , there have been 12 black head coaches .
So some progress has been made . But there have also been charges of sham interviews that satisfy the letter of the Rooney Rule but have n't created substantive change . Critics also point to the lack of African-Americans in the two key offensive coaching posts — co-ordinator and quarterbacks coach — which is notable because the majority of head coaches come from the offensive side of the ball .
Last year there were three black offensive co-ordinators in the 32-team league . All were fired this off-season . Currently there 's one , Kansas City 's Eric Bieniemy , although Philadelphia 's Duce Staley has been promoted to assistant head coach . There were also two black quarterback coaches in 2017 : Byron Leftwich in Arizona and David Culley in Buffalo .
In the CFL , there are three African-American offensive co-ordinators in the nine-team league : Jackson , McAdoo and Jones . It 's presumed Jackson or Washington will succeed Wally Buono as the Lions ' head coach following this season . It 's also thought Steinauer will eventually take over in Hamilton from June Jones .
“ I do n't look at it as colour , ” says Jackson . “ I just think there are qualified people who are doing the job . ”
As for the GM 's office in the NFL , there were four African-Americans following Cleveland 's firing of Sashi Brown and the Giants ' firing of Jerry Reese in the off-season . When Reese was hired in 2007 , he was the third African-American GM in NFL history . The first was Baltimore 's Ozzie Newsome , hired in 2002 .
“ I 'll be open with you , ” says Hervey . “ I knew I was Edmonton 's first black GM . I knew , after Roy ( Shivers , in Saskatchewan ) , I was one of the first black GMs . I pay attention to that stuff . I felt I had a responsibility to do the job the right way because I wanted aspiring African-American or African-Canadians , to see there is an opportunity out there . ”
Geroy Simon is the Lions ' director of Canadian scouting . Hervey was asked about his future with the team .
“ If I 'm doing my job right , he wo n't be here in three years , ” he said . “ He 'll be running his own team . ”
And there will be an opportunity for him to run his own team because that 's the way it should work .

More than a baker 's dozen of flour products have been pulled from grocery store shelves .
As of April 16 , Ardent Mills recalled 16 varieties of Robin Hood and Creative Baker flour from stores across Canada with a wide range of product codes and package sizing .
`` As a result of the food-safety investigation , the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ( CFIA ) identified additional products that could pose a health risk . Those products have now been added to the updated recall warning , '' CFIA spokesperson Maria Kubacki said on Monday .
`` The CFIA is warning the public not to consume these products , '' she added . `` If consumers have any of the recalled products in their home , they should throw them out or return them to the store where they purchased them . ''
On its website , Ardent Mills said it is co-operating with CFIA 's food safety inspection and direction to expand the flour-products recall .
`` Ardent Mills is aware of one illness associated with the consumption of flour , and thankfully that person has fully recovered , '' the company said in a press release . `` There have been no illnesses reported with the products subject to the April 12 and 16 voluntary recalls . ''
The company noted it is committed to doing all it can to provide ingredients that make safe , healthy and good tasting products .
But it does add that `` flour is a raw agriculture commodity made from wheat , which is grown outdoors where bacteria and microbes , such as E. coli O121 , are often present . ''
The release seems to suggest that because there is no heat process used to cure the wheat , it remains possible that E. coli O121 can still be harboured in the product until it is cooked .
`` The normal milling process uses the simple , time-honoured traditions that were invented more than 100 years ago . Today 's mills , however , have significantly improved food safety . Nonetheless , neither the original process nor today 's process contain a kill step to eliminate microbes , such as E. coli O121 that may originate with the wheat . Common kill steps applied during food preparation include thoroughly boiling , baking , roasting , microwaving and frying . These so-called kill steps will render the microbes or bacteria harmless . ''
Initially , only 10-kilogram bags of Robin Hood All Purpose Flour with code BB/MA 2018 AL 17 and 6 291 548 that were sold in British Columbia , Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba were considered to have been possibly contaminated with E-coli .
But as of April 4 , the Public Health Agency of Canada opened the recall up to be one of national concern .
As of Sunday , Robin Hood bags of varying sizes containing the following codes are being recalled :
Lot codes :
BB/MA 2018 FE 02 and 6 307 548
BB/MA 2018 FE 03 and 6 308 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 26 and 6 300 548

BB/MA 2018 AL 28 and 6 307 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 29 and 6 303 548
Additionally , Creative Baker All Purpose Flour , 10-kg bags with lot code BB/MA 2017 OC 26 6 300 SK is also being recalled .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. judge who will decide if wireless and pay TV provider AT & T Inc may purchase Time Warner Inc said on Friday that he saw “ no big issues ” in pre-trial preparations .
The Justice Department has said that the $ 85 billion deal is illegal because AT & T , once it owned movie and television show maker Time Warner , would have the ability and incentive to raise prices that it charges cable , satellite and streaming rivals for Time Warner 's content .
AT & T disagreed , and the case will go to trial on March 19 .
Judge Richard Leon noted during a short pre-trial hearing on Friday that he was pleased to see that “ no big issues ” had arisen that he needed to resolve .
The judge set a further pre-trial hearing for Feb. 16 . He will also meet informally on Feb. 12 with small groups of lawyers from both sides to discuss how the trial will proceed .
The two sides are expected to exchange witness lists , with a maximum of 30 witnesses , and expert reports on Friday .
Both sides said they intended to call former Justice Department economists to support their case . AT & T will call Dennis Carlton , from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business , while the Justice Department will call Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley .
U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the deal while on the campaign trail in 2016 . Trump has also criticized Time Warner 's CNN news network and , in November , reiterated his opposition to the proposed transaction .
AT & T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told analysts on a conference call this week that he expected the case to be resolved through litigation . “ We remain very confident that we 'll complete this merger , ” he said .
Columnist Mike Smyth writes about this fall 's referendum on whether B.C . should switch to a proportional-representation voting system .
You might also like :
British Columbians voted twice in referendums to change the way we elect our MLAs . Both times , they rejected a proportional-representation voting system .
Now the governing NDP-Green alliance is hoping the third time 's the charm with another referendum this fall .
And this time , they 're determined not to repeat the same losing scenarios of the past .
The first pro-rep referendum was in 2005 , when a majority of British Columbians voted in favour of a PR system called single transferable vote or STV .
Just one problem : Gordon Campbell 's Liberal government insisted on a “ clear-mandate ” threshold — a minimum 60-per-cent ‘ yes ' vote for the referendum to succeed . The final result came up just short , with 57 per cent voting in favour of STV .
This time around , the NDP-Green team is setting the bar as low as possible for the referendum to pass : A threadbare majority — 50 per cent plus one — is all that will be required .
That first referendum also required a “ super majority ” to prevent regional dominance , meaning the ‘ yes ' vote had to pass in at least 60 per cent of all the province 's electoral ridings .
The NDP-Greens are chucking out that rule , too . No super majority needed . No minimum voter turnout will be required , either .
On Wednesday , Attorney General David Eby rolled out more details of the next referendum , revealing a two-part ballot question .
The first part will ask voters if they want to keep the current first-past-the-post system for electing MLAs or change to PR .
The second question will ask voters to choose among three different pro-rep voting systems , asking them to rank the systems in order of preference .
If the first question passes by that bare majority , the government will then implement the most popular pro-rep voting system selected in the second question .
But there 's another big change from the losing ways of the past .
In 2009 , British Columbians voted on the STV voting system again . Only this time the government produced detailed maps showing how the province 's electoral boundaries would be changed .
The STV system would have seen the province 's electoral map radically redrawn into 20 enormous ridings with multiple MLAs representing each one . Some of the ridings were larger than European countries . When voters got a look at the map , support for STV crumbled .
The 2009 result : Just 39 per cent voted in favour of the pro-rep system , easily defeating it .
Now the NDP-Green team is avoiding that pitfall , too , confirming Wednesday that no detailed electoral boundary maps will be provided to voters . Those “ technical details ” will be worked out later .
It 's easy to understand why they 're playing these tricks . A pro-rep system could dramatically boost the number of Green MLAs , allowing them to continue their governing partnership with the NDP , while freezing the Liberals out of power .
But if British Columbians smell a rat — and this stacked deck certainly has a malodorous whiff — they might reject proportional representation for a third time .

Kohima : The BJP has decided to forge an alliance with newly-floated Nationalist Democratic People 's Party ( NDPP ) led by former chief minister Neiphiu Rio for the 27 February Assembly poll in Nagaland .
The BJP has dumped its 15-year-old alliance partner , the ruling Naga People 's Front ( NPF ) .
A decision to this effect was taken in New Delhi on Friday at a meeting between BJP president Amit Shah and Rio in the presence of BJP 's Nagaland president Visasolie Lhoungu , the party 's state media cell convener , K James Vizo said on Saturday .
He said the NDPP would contest 40 of the 60 seats in the state Assembly while the BJP would field candidates in to remain 20 seats .
The BJP is the only party till date to announce that it will contest the election .
Eleven parties including the ruling Naga People 's Front on 29 January had decided not to contest the 27 February polls , agreeing to the demand of tribal bodies and civil society groups to resolve the protracted Naga political problem first .
Later , the BJP had announced it would contest the polls .
The state BJP sources said the party 's grassroots workers were against the party forging any pre-poll alliance with anyone .

Dear J.T . & Dale : Our company has a strict “ no overtime ” rule ; they do n't want to pay for it . Recently , a colleague who started around the same time I did just got promoted . When I asked how she did it , she told me she had been putting in extra hours on her own time over the past year and that her boss wanted to reward her . Is that legal ? It seems wrong if the only way to get promoted is by working for free .
— MARCY
DALE : It does seem wrong , Marcy , but as for the legalities involved , we turn once again to our favorite employment attorney , Scott Gordon , of Rodey Law in Albuquerque , New Mexico .
SCOTT : It is illegal for an employer to allow an hourly employee to work for free . An employer is allowed to have a strict “ no overtime ” rule , but simply having a rule is not enough : If the employer knows or even suspects that hourly employees are breaking the rule by working “ off the clock , ” the employer must pay for the work that was done . If an employer actually encouraged an hourly employee to work for free — straight time or overtime — the employer would be in big trouble with the Department of Labor . In this situation , under federal law , the employer owes the employee time-and-a-half for every hour over 40 worked in every work week since she started work a year ago , plus additional damages in the same amount . This employer needs a good lawyer .
J.T . : Thanks , Scott . However , while forcing someone to work overtime without pay is illegal , in this case it sounds like the employee took it upon herself to invest her personal time into getting ahead and standing out on the job . There 's nothing illegal about that .
DALE : Well , Scott 's point is that it 's illegal for the company to allow it . And if management is “ rewarding ” the employee , then they were aware . Bang . Guilty .
J.T . : Yes , there are times when an ambitious employee sometimes needs to go the extra mile to get the skills and experience necessary to move up . My guess is that this woman asked her boss what level of proficiency she needed to get to in order to receive a promotion , and then she set out on a course to get it . If you , Marcy , do n't want to spend your free time developing your skills , that 's OK . It just might take you longer to get promoted .
DALE : Oh , that hurts . Mark this down as the day J.T . went over to the dark side .
J.T . : Would it help if we called it “ self-improvement ” ?
DALE : Yes , if it 's something like working on an MBA . Further , let 's be clear that there are other ways to stand out . Be the person who has the best ideas or is the most productive during regular hours , then use that reputation to go to a company with some standards and some class .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - English Premier League clubs are set to discuss whether to shut the transfer window before the start of the 2018-19 season when they meet next month , British media have reported .
Representatives from the 20 ­top-flight clubs are due to attend ­a shareholders meeting on Sept. 7 with the majority pushing for a new , earlier , transfer deadline to be introduced .
Talks are expected to take place between all the clubs about whether to change the end of the window , which currently closes on Aug. 31 nearly three weeks after the first game .
It will be proposed that the ­transfer deadline is brought forward to the week before the start of the 2018-19 Premier League season , The Daily Telegraph reported on its website .
British media said the majority of Premier League clubs favour an earlier window closure , with the approval of at least 14 of the 20 required for a new rule to be introduced .
Clubs from other European leagues , including Spain and Italy , would be allowed to sign players from England in line with their own domestic deadlines but transfers between Premier League clubs would not be allowed once the season starts .
Swansea City manager Paul Clement , who has left Gylfi Sigurdsson out of the squad having been unsettled by repeated bids from Everton , spoke about the window after Saturday 's draw at Southampton in their opening game .
`` It would be a better situation if the window closed before the start of the season and then people know that they have got their group for the first game - they are available , they are n't available , '' Clement told a news conference .
`` I know there are talks about changing that for the future and my opinion is that it should be changed . Before the first game you should know who you have got and who you have n't got .
`` At our managers ' meeting at the Premier League ... we spoke about it . The majority of clubs are in favour , but maybe all have to be for it to go through . ''
The January transfer window would be unaffected .

Mumbai 's monsoon is at its peak right now , and one of the best ways to keep your outfits from getting ruined in the downpour is to opt for shorter silhouettes . Switch your skinny jeans for cropped versions , trade in the ankle-grazing skirts for minis , and give maxi dresses a break for midi versions . If you 've been looking for a dress that 's just right for the season , Kriti Sanon 's latest pick will make your day . After all , the star knows what she 's doing when it comes to dress—we 've seen her in everything from a tiny camouflage number to that peek-a-boo white bodycon this season already .
For her latest outing in the city , Sanon went the girly route with a pretty fit-and-flare dress that featured sheer sleeves . The teal midi was worn with strappy nude sandals , and Sanon spruced up the simple pairing with accessories . Her pick for the rainy Mumbai afternoon : a handful of gold rings , and Bollywood 's favourite new style of jewellery , chunky gold hoops .
More often than not , you 'll see Kriti Sanon flaunting beachy waves on casual outings , and this occasion was no different . Instead of a fussy hairstyle that would be hard to manage in Mumbai 's humidity , the actor stuck with her tried-and-tested hairdo . A pretty shade of pink lipstick , bold brows and glowing skin completed her look .

The Florida inventor who designed the first `` bump stock , '' nearly two decades before the Las Vegas gunman used one to massacre 58 people on Sunday , never made a dime off of his creation .
REUTERS : The Florida inventor who designed the first `` bump stock , '' nearly two decades before the Las Vegas gunman used one to massacre 58 people on Sunday , never made a dime off of his creation .
For years , Bill Akins fought to capitalise on his idea - with the U.S. government , his former business partner and a rival competitor - but found himself stymied at every turn .
The 63-year-old Marine veteran and Elvis impersonator voiced his sorrow at the tragedy in Las Vegas , where authorities said Stephen Paddock had bump stocks installed on 12 of his rifles . The device allows semi-automatic weapons to fire almost as rapidly as machine guns , which are largely outlawed .
`` I would like to express my dismay and sincere condolences to the victims , families and anyone affected by the recent Las Vegas mass shooting , '' Akins said during a telephone interview from his home about 45 minutes north of Tampa , Florida .
But he also defended the devices as protected under the U.S. Constitution 's right to bear arms .
`` People need to recognise that we either have a constitution , or we do n't , '' he said .

Akins first came up with his idea while watching a documentary about World War Two in 1996 that showed twin anti-aircraft guns firing at Japanese warplanes from a U.S. Navy ship .
He saw the barrels sliding back and forth with each concussive recoil and wondered if he could design a device that would mimic that action , turning a semi-automatic rifle that fires once per trigger pull into a weapon capable of shooting hundreds of rounds per minute .
The result , which he eventually termed the `` Akins Accelerator , '' seemed promising enough . Akins teamed up with a firearms industry businessman , secured two letters from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) affirming the mechanism behind the device was legal , and poured his savings into the project .
But the ATF outlawed the device in 2005 , concluding that the retail version transformed semi-automatic rifles into illegal machine guns .
Another company , Slide Fire Solutions , began making its own version of the bump stock that was approved by the ATF , in large part because it lacked a recoil spring that Akins had included .
Akins transferred his patent to an outdoor sporting goods company , FosTecH Outdoors , and the two rival manufacturers engaged in a legal battle over patent infringement before settling the case in 2012 .
The owner of FosTecH , whose website says the company strives to be `` your bump fire stock specialist , '' did not return a request for comment .
The seller 's site said it had suspended sales of bump stocks while it works on catching up with demand , which has skyrocketed since the Vegas shooting due to customers ' concerns that the item could be outlawed .
Slide Fire 's founder , Jeremiah Cottle , did not return multiple calls for comment .
Akins is limited in what he can say about the litigation , saying only that he is `` legally prevented '' from discussing certain aspects of the bump stock industry . But he made clear his ire at the ATF .
`` They just destroyed our business , '' he said .
The ATF did not immediately comment on the case .
Court documents showed the agency required all customers who purchased an Akins Accelerator to remove the spring , rendering the device inoperable .
`` JUST A TINKERER ... WITH AN IDEA ''
Akins ' device was intended to improve upon `` bump firing , '' a practice in which shooters fired from the hip while keeping a thumb hooked inside a belt loop for stability , using the gun 's recoil to activate the trigger more quickly .
His innovation let users brace rifles against their shoulders in a more normal firing stance , improving accuracy and control .
Akins put up his own property as collateral for a loan to launch the business . He estimated he sold several hundred devices , priced at more than US $ 1,000 each , before he was shut down - not enough to cover his startup costs .
He filed two unsuccessful federal lawsuits against the ATF , leaving him with a workshop full of unused Akins Accelerators .
`` Boy , did I get an education , '' he said . `` I 'm not a person who 'd ever done business before with a corporation , never worked in the firearm industry before , just a tinkerer that came up with an idea . ''
Akins is largely retired , though he still dons his Elvis costume for occasional gigs . He gave up his longtime National Rifle Association membership after he said the group offered no help in his fight against the ATF . But , he said , he remains a steadfast supporter of the right to bear arms .
He scoffed at the NRA 's willingness to accept stricter regulation on bump stocks , saying any law would run afoul of the Second Amendment .
`` Congress has the right to pass laws , '' he said . `` But Congress is not supposed to pass a law that violates the constitution . ''

The first time Huong Tran pitched a group of Vietnamese investors on Epomi , a beauty retail startup she founded in 2014 , she was shocked by their reaction .
“ They told me that women are too emotional to run a business and they do n't like investing in them , ” she said . “ This was one of the leading international VC firms in Vietnam—I did n't expect this . ”
Until that point , Tran rarely had trouble convincing others to take her seriously . A Vietnamese national with an MBA from Duke and a decade of leadership experience at top multinationals like Samsung and GSK , she had a long track in business . At the time of her pitch , Epomi already had rapid sales growth , an adoring customer base , favorable contracts with top suppliers , and a clear plan to lead Vietnam 's fast-growing beauty retail market .
Tran eventually found investment for her startup , but her initial experience is not uncommon . In both developed and emerging economies , gender discrimination is a universal challenge . So is sexual harassment—a problem that 's becoming increasingly visible in light of the seemingly endless string of harassment scandals happening in the tech world .
Compared to other Asian countries , however , Vietnam performs relatively well on some measures of gender equality . For example , women hold 17.6 % of board seats in Vietnam , more than any other country in the Asia-Pacific region except Australia ( 20.1 % ) , according to a recent study by Deloitte . The study , which looked at 64 countries globally , also found that Vietnam outperformed the global average ( 15 % ) , as well as more developed neighbors like Singapore ( 9.4 % ) and China ( 9.2 % ) .
Women also run a substantial share of Vietnam 's small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) . Roughly 25 % of SMEs in Vietnam are owned by women , according to a 2016 report by the Mekong Business Initiative ( MBI ) , a development partnership co-led by the Asian Development Bank and the Australian government . In South Asia , by contrast , only 8 % of SMEs are women-owned .
Women lead some of Vietnam 's largest and most iconic companies as well . One of the most prominent is Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao , who is best known as founder and CEO of Vietjet , a popular budget airline that listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange earlier this year , and which helped make her Southeast Asia 's only female billionaire .
High-profile female executives can also be found in a diverse array of other industries , from retail to agriculture , as well as on the startup circuit .
In some industries , women hold a large share of senior management positions too . Between 2014 and 2016 , I worked with a Singapore-based healthcare data company to launch a new service line in Vietnam . During that project , I made sales calls to nearly every multinational pharmaceutical company in the country . While many of those offices are still headed by foreign men , the majority of my business contacts were women . Behind the scenes , women often ran the show .
But not every industry had the same sensibility . Back in 2015 , in a series of stories for Techonomy about Vietnam 's burgeoning IT sector , throughout dozens of interviews and site visits with local IT services firms , I came across almost no women . As in most countries , women are underrepresented in Vietnam 's tech industry , though some educational organizations are keeping this in mind as they work to build the country 's STEM talent .
“ Vietnam has some prominent female business leaders , but that does n't mean there 's gender equality across the economy , ” says Shuyin Tang , a Principal in the Vietnam office of Patamar Capital ( formerly Unitus Impact ) , an impact investment fund with offices in San Francisco and across Asia . To help bridge the gap , Patamar Capital recently launched an investment fund specifically for women-owned businesses in Southeast Asia .
Other organizations are also working to support Vietnamese businesswomen . For example , MBI recently helped launch the Women 's Initiative for Startups and Entrepreneurship , a multi-stakeholder program that will provide programming and services to support women-owned businesses in Vietnam , which a vision to expand to the Mekong region . Another one is Women of Vietnam , a private community launched by a Vietnamese-Australian entrepreneur in 2015 .
Organizations like these are tackling a thorny and sometimes contentious topic . “ Anyone who brings up gender in the workplace is wading into deep and muddy waters , ” wrote Sheryl Sandberg in Lean In , her bestselling book on gender and work in the modern era . “ The subject itself presents a paradox : forcing us to acknowledge differences while trying to achieve the goal of being treated the same . ”
Yet around the world , there 's a growing movement to encourage gender equality and prevent discrimination against women in business . As this movement heats up in Vietnam , expect to see more women entrepreneurs taking charge in this fast-growing and dynamic country .
Climate resilience has become a buzzword in the recent lingo of the Post-Maria response mechanism . The government asserts that Dominica can become the first climate resilient country in the world and continues to communicate this message encouraging the public to get on board .
For its part , the Dominican public has responded in various ways voicing their concerns and seeing actions taken by private individuals and companies both in support and criticism of this position .
The youth of the Dominica State College , in particular , have responded in a rather commendable way , specifically the Literary and Debate Society .
Recently , a debate was held at the UWI auditorium on Friday 29th June 2018 on the topic , “ Achieving the goal of becoming the first climate resilient country in the world is a real possibility ” .
The proposing team consisted of Kareen George , Ogechi Ejingiri , and T'kaeyah Jno Baptiste while on the opposing team there was Elleen Commodore , Carsim Birmingham and Abiyomhi Joseph . In that debate , we saw the opposing team met out a solid victory against the proposition , essentially their argument being that “ No it is not possible for Dominica to be the first climate resilient country ” .
Elleen Commodore in her speech cited that any good goal must be S.M.A.R.T ( specific , measurable , attainable , relevant and timely ) . The goal to be first the climate resilient country is not S.M.A.R.T , Elleen argued , there is no way to assess it as achievable .
Chief judge Kevin Francis speaking on behalf of the judges stated that they wished more use had been made of statistical evidence on both sides and recommended that the technical division of the college should be included in such a debate . He pointed out that , ultimately , the opposing team 's argument contained more compelling evidence .
Elleen Commodore won the best speaker and Abiyomhi Jospeh won the best rebuttal receiving various prizes for their efforts . Remarkably the debate was done completely on the initiative of the students .
However , they did receive support . Trudy Christian lecturer and mentor to the club was able to help manage and organize the event in a manner that helped make it a success .
Several sponsors supported the event including Dominica News Online . See gallery below for more photos including the debate flyer and list of sponsors .
NEW YORK : New York is launching a new ferry service on May 1 , offering a quicker and cheaper commute into Manhattan for hundreds of thousands of people travelling from the Bronx , Brooklyn and Queens .
Mayor Bill de Blasio , a progressive-wing Democrat seeking re-election in November , dedicated the first of 20 new ferries on Monday ( Apr 17 ) , calling it `` Lunchbox '' - a name chosen by elementary school children .
Each boat can carry 150 passengers and will operate 365 days a year from 5:30am to 8:30pm on week days , and from 7:30am to 9:30pm on weekends . The service launch comes one month ahead of schedule .
`` It 's going to improve the quality of life for New Yorkers , '' the mayor announced on Monday . All the new boats will be equipped with WiFi .
One-way trips will cost US $ 2.75 - the same price as a subway fare .
`` We want to make things a little calmer , a little less stressful , and a ride on the ferry make things a little nicer and gets you were you need to go a little faster , '' de Blasio said .
The US financial capital is investing US $ 30 million a year on the service , so as to better serve one of the best natural harbours in the world .
Apart from a free ferry that links Manhattan to Staten Island , the most isolated of the five New York boroughs , there has been no city-run service since the 1970s .
One of the new routes will link the Rockaways in Queens to Wall Street in 55 minutes , slashing current journey times by at least half an hour .
`` All these people today have a two-hour commute , on good days . It is going to be a game changer , '' said Roland Lewis , president of the Waterfront Alliance association which has spent 10 years campaigning for the service .
The service will create 200 jobs and is expected to clock up 4.6 million annual trips , including by tourists who can take advantage of the cheap tickets to see the stunning Manhattan skyline from afar .
`` You cant beat that price , '' said Jonathan Figueroa , director of operations .

This marks the end of another event for 630 CHED Santas Anonymous before delivery begins next weekend .
The charity had a bit of a slow start this year , but it 's not too late to contribute .
“ They 're low this year . Hopefully this helps out , but they still need your help , ” said Hatton . “ So keep those donations coming , delivery weekend starts next Friday so we 're under the deadline here . ”
The goal is to collect 25,000 gifts for Edmonton kids . And if you 're not sure what they 're hoping to put under the tree , Hatton had some ideas .
“ Books , science set , colouring things—things that will help you learn at the same time are fun for the kids , ” he explained . “ Lots of fun musical instruments were donated too , which is pretty cool . ”
You can also still sign up to volunteer at Santas Depot or to become one of Santas helpers for delivery weekend .
Overall , the Tower of Toys was a success—and there 's still time to help Santas meet its goal .
“ Big thanks to everybody that was listening , ” said Hatton . “ We killed it this year , it was awesome . ”
The mission of 630 CHED Santas Anonymous is to see every child in the Edmonton area open a new toy on Christmas morning .

New Delhi : The BJP on Wednesday asked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal why he has not taken action against his minister Satyendar Jain , who has been booked for alleged corruption . The party alleged that the AAP leaders have been `` shameless '' in defending Jain and it reflected their moral turpitude .
The Opposition 's reaction came after the CBI conducted searches against Jain in connection with alleged violation of norms in hiring architects for the Public Works Department ( PWD ) handled by him . Manoj Tiwari , the chief of Delhi BJP , said that Jain 's continuation in the cabinet of Delhi government , even after filing of a criminal case against him , is against democratic tradition .
He alleged that Kejriwal was not taking any action against Jain because he was the `` accountant '' of all the `` black deeds '' of the government . `` Chief minister Kejriwal can not take any action against him because he is the accountant of all the black deeds of Delhi government and if he reveals the truth then legal action will certainly be taken against the AAP leaders including Kejriwal , '' Tiwari said in a statement .
The AAP dispensation including Kejriwal has defended Jain , alleging that the move by the Centre was an attempt to divert people 's attention from the `` good works '' of Delhi government . Kejriwal alleged that Jain was targeted as the BJP was against the new norms for hospitals announced by the minister and wanted it scrapped . BJP legislator and Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said that Jain 's defence by chief minister , deputy CM Manish Sisodia and other AAP leaders was `` shameless '' .
`` It shows the depth of moral turpitude to which AAP has fallen . Kejriwal and his team have unconditionally compromised with corruption , '' he alleged . Gupta alleged that the AAP government was `` unlawfully '' hiring 24 professionals as 'creative team ' causing `` loss '' of crores of rupees to the government exchequer . `` The selected firm specialised in providing cooks , helpers , security guards etc not creative team , '' he alleged .
The CBI has booked Jain in a case pertaining to alleged corruption in hiring a creative team for the Public Works Department to suggest new architectural designs and bring down costs , officials said . Jain , who holds the PWD and Health portfolios , is already facing a Central Bureau of Investigation case related to alleged money laundering .

The mood around the locker room and during postgame interviews after Sunday 's loss to the Toronto Raptors was generally positive . Losing to the Raptors is not like losing to the bottom-dwelling Mavericks . And , in truth , if the Lakers played the way they did Sunday against all of their opponents , they 'd have more wins .
Here are five takeaways from Sunday 's 123-114 loss .
1 . The Lakers coaches addressed two problems with one move on Sunday . They had n't been able to find playing time for Tarik Black lately . Although Black 's ankle had felt better for about a week , Lakers Coach Luke Walton did n't want to take away playing time from Thomas Robinson to get Black back in the fold . On Sunday , he used both players in the same lineup . It got Black back on the court , and it addressed a major problem the Lakers have had : defense .
Photo Photos from the Lakers ' 123-114 loss to the Toronto Raptors on Jan. 1 .
2 . What Walton also created was a competitive situation that served the Lakers very well early in the game . Robinson said the two players fed off each other . “ We just play our games , go out there and give it all we have and let the end results be the end results , ” Black said . “ We do n't look at the stat sheet . I did n't know I was almost at a double-double , and I have n't spoken to him but I 'm pretty sure he did n't know either . We just go out there and play. ” Robinson was one rebound away from a double-double to go with his 12 points . Black was one point and one rebound from a double-double .
3 . Even as he 's become such a hot shooter , Nick Young has remained one of the Lakers ' best defenders . “ Tonight he picked up some foul trouble so we had to get him off DeRozan , ” Walton said . “ Obviously everybody 's going to slip from time to time but I think for the most part he 's been pretty consistent with that defensive effort and spending energy on the defensive end . Even tonight , I did n't agree with the foul call , but he came over from the weak side and did a verticality at the rim when their big [ man ] was rolling . For our shooting guard that 's hot shooting threes to be the guy that makes that read … speaks to how much he 's trying to play the right way and be the guy that helps us win . ”
4 . Brandon Ingram 's aggressiveness showed on a few plays . On one , he used his length to get around Toronto center Jonas Valanciunas for a one-handed dunk . It wowed the Staples Center crowd and offered a glimpse of Ingram 's potential .
5 . The Lakers backup guards are often a big part of their production from that position , but Sunday Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams combined to go 4 for 16 . They each had one assist and missed the free throws they took .

VANCOUVER – A sometimes bruising leadership campaign ends today in Vancouver for British Columbia 's Liberals as they elect a new leader who will be tasked with returning the party to power after a 16-year term in office that ended last summer .
An estimated 60,000 party members were eligible to vote online and by phone to replace Christy Clark , who resigned after the New Democrats formed a minority government with the support of the Green party following a non-confidence vote that brought down the Liberals .

Dion Leonard had just begun the second stage of the Gobi March , a 250-kilometre race through the Gobi Desert in China , when he noticed a stray dog was following him . On Day 3 , halfway through a river crossing , he heard yelps and saw the dog standing on the riverbank , unable to follow . He knew , as he turned back to carry the dog across , he 'd reached a “ turning point. ” “ I went to these races trying to win them but I stopped as I went halfway through a river crossing because she was yelping and whining and barking , ” said Leonard , 41 , of Edinburgh , who completed the race in 2016 . “ It was then that I started to realize I had a real deep feeling for her and the bond was really forming. ” Read more : Stray pup races alongside man throughout seven-day ultra-marathonArticle Continued BelowThe dog , who would later be named Gobi , tailed Leonard for nearly 128 km and captured the world 's attention online . Leonard has chronicled the experience , and the ensuing whirlwind adventure to adopt Gobi , in Finding Gobi¸released Tuesday.Shortly after the race , Gobi went missing . But Leonard was so affected by the dog , he launched a crowdfunding campaign and travelled to China to find her . He searched the streets of Urumqi every day , with the help of a team of locals , by posting flyers , interviewing residents , and spreading the word online . Throughout the search , tips poured in , along with some ominous threats to both Gobi and Leonard.But one call , from a local man , led to Leonard 's reunion with the Gobi , who was found on the side of the road . Due to an injury to Gobi 's hip — which required surgery — and the mandatory quarantine process , Leonard spent four months in China with the dog , before they returned to Edinburgh together . Gobi now lives with Leonard , his wife , Lucja , and their cat , Lara .

The Nelms brothers , whose film “ Small Town Crime ” received rave reviews at this year 's SXSW Film Festival , have signed with ICM Partners .
Eshom and Ian Nelms will be repped by ICM in all areas and continue to be repped by LBI Entertainment .
“ Small Town Crime ” stars John Hawkes and Octavia Spencer and was acquired by Saban Films following its premiere at the festival last month . The film follows an alcoholic ex-cop ( Hawkes ) who finds the body of a young woman and , through an act of self-redemption , becomes hell-bent on finding the killer but unwittingly puts his family in danger .
The film is expected to bow nationwide later this year . In his review for Variety , Joe Leydon said “ Small Town Crime ” “ comes across as neither pastiche nor parody , but rather as a seriously down-and-dirty crime story with a savage sense of humor . ”
“ At the center of it all , Hawkes stands tall — or at least he tries to , even when his character is staggering drunkenly , or passing out altogether , ” Leydon added .
Along with their film endeavors , the Nelms brothers are also developing a handful of TV projects that are being kept under wraps .
Other credits include “ Waffle Street ” and “ Lost on Purpose . ”
A judge has denied bail for James Alex Fields Jr. , the man accused of plowing into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville on Saturday , killing one , during white supremacy rallies .
Fields , 20 , of Ohio , is facing charges including second-degree murder , malicious wounding and hit-and-run .
Judge Robert Downer denied bond for Fields on Monday , according to The Associated Press .
Federal authorities opened a civil rights investigation in the case .
Fields was driving a Dodge south on 4th Street and speeding when he rear-ended a sedan , police said . The crash occurred around 1:45 p.m. Saturday .
The sedan struck a minivan , which had slowed down for a group of people crossing through the intersection .
`` The impact of the crash pushed the vehicles into the crowd of pedestrians , '' police said . `` The Dodge Challenger fled the scene , but was located and stopped a short time later by Charlottesville Police . ''
Heyer was pronounced dead at a local hospital , police said . Nineteen other people were hurt , with injuries ranging from serious to minor .
History teacher Derek Weimer told The Washington Post he taught Fields at a high school in Kentucky . Fields wrote a long paper about the Nazi military for one class , according to the teacher .
CHICAGO : It would be illegal for Illinois state or local government employees to forcibly remove travelers from flights under a bill introduced by a lawmaker on Monday after a United Airlines passenger was violently dragged from an aircraft last week .
The Airline Passenger Protection Act , introduced by Republican Illinois state Representative Peter Breen , came after Dr. David Dao , 69 , was pulled from a United flight at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport to help make space for four crew members .
The treatment of Dao sparked international outrage , as well as multiple apologies from the carrier , and raised questions about overbooking policies of airlines .
Under Breen 's measure , passengers could not be removed from flights by state or local government authorities unless they were presenting a danger to themselves or others , a public emergency was taking place or the passenger had caused a serious disturbance , according to a copy of the bill introduced in the state capital Springfield .
`` A commercial airline that removes validly seated customers without serious cause breaches the sacred trust between passengers and their airlines , '' the bill said .
The legislation would also bar the state of Illinois from making travel arrangements , doing business with or having investments in any commercial airline that maintained a policy of removing paying passengers to make room for employees traveling on non-revenue tickets .
Dao , who was traveling to Louisville , Kentucky , from Chicago on April 9 , suffered a broken nose , a concussion and lost two teeth when he was pulled from his seat by officers from the Chicago Department of Aviation 's security force to make room for four employees on the overbooked flight .
The three officers , who have not been named , were put on paid leave last week , the department said .
United on Friday said it was changing its policy on booking its flight crews onto its own planes following the incident . The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Illinois bill .
Lawyers for Dao have moved quickly to preserve evidence from the flight , filing a motion to keep surveillance videos , cockpit voice recordings , passenger and crew lists , and other materials related to United Flight 3411 in preparation for a possible lawsuit .
The city and United agreed to preserve the evidence , Dao 's attorney , Thomas Demetrio said on Saturday .

While Lisa Haydon might not be a name that pops up on your social media feed every single day , but every time it does , it makes headlines . From announcing her pregnancy in a bikini to owning breastfeeding like the normal thing it should be , she 's always breaking barriers . This time around , the actor has taken the Kim Kardashian route and bleached her hair a global platinum blonde .
We reached out to the model-actor on the reason behind her dramatic hair do-over . “ I wanted to do something different—a little bit revolutionary . My two options were either a lob with highlights or to go platinum . Florian ( Hurel ) and Daniel Bauer were ever so encouraging and really excited to do it . I was concerned that the colour should be absolutely perfect , as this kind of thing can go both ways . To be honest , Florian worked really hard on it and I like it even better than what I had imagined . ”
Mumbai-based celebrity hairstylist and makeup artist Florian Hurel created the look on the sets of her new show , Top Model India . Daniel Bauer and students from his academy are manning the hair and makeup team for the show .
While this hair colour is a first , Lisa Haydon has been setting fitness goals for the longest time now . Six months into giving birth to her son Zack Lalvani , she is back to her toned self ( a picture of her at the Amfar Gala in Paris from July is proof that it really did n't take her as long ) . While she still has n't posted a clear image of her son as yet , she does provide everyone with glimpses of small , cute moments on Instagram with partial shots of him .
Check out the gallery above for a look at Haydon 's new platinum blonde hair colour .

Marvel Studios held the Los Angeles premiere of Avengers : Infinity War last night , which brought practically the entire cast out of the woodwork for the huge event , which marked the first public screening of the movie , just four days before it debuts . Before the screening , most of the Avengers assembled on stage , where their fearless leader , Robert Downey Jr. , who kicked off the MCU with 2008s Iron Man almost exactly 10 years ago , delivered an emotional speech to the fans . While no video of the speech has surfaced online yet , a new report reveals what the MCU 's biggest star had to say to the adoring fans .
Just before Infinity War crushed the audience , the actor kicked off his memorable speech by stating that he `` has some words , '' adding that he hoped , `` you all brought a bag lunch . '' He then went on to praise Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige for laying the groundwork for the 19 inter-connected movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe , stating that if anyone else took credit for the MCU 's success it would be , `` heresy '' and `` blasphemy . '' He then went on to discuss his past struggles with addiction and how he was redeemed by getting to play Tony Stark , a.k.a . Iron Man . Here 's a portion of the actor 's speech below .
`` I want to talk about the past , present , and future . The past for me was 30 years of dependency , depravity , and despair .... otherwise known as 'An Actor Prepares ! ' The present is this moment of glory for all of us . And the future ... ? That is always uncertain . But looking at these friends behind me , it seems like things might brighten up after all . None of us are in competition with each other . We are all competing for each other , and for you . If you play a superhero in one of these movies , and it works , you become a big star ! And it ... is ... meaningless . Unless , you use that to achieve something higher . You have to take direction from peers , and your family , and occasionally even an actual director . ''
The actor also referred to Don Cheadle , who stood to his right during his speech , as `` Miles Davis , '' a reference to Cheadle starring in and directing the 2015 biopic of the jazz legend , entitled Miles Ahead , while adding that directing a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie is like a `` crucible , '' adding that you either come out of the experience as `` steel or dust . '' He also called upon Marvel for more diversity , referencing the MCU 's first female director in Anna Boden , who , along with her longtime directing partner Ryan Fleck , is directing Captain Marvel , which is currently in production . Here 's another excerpt from Robert Downey 's premiere speech below .
`` Now at least half a directing team is female . Making these movies is so taxing that it is clearly a woman 's job . It 's essentially gestation . But we do n't know how to do that . Wakanda rules the day and rightfully so . By the way , Wakanda forever ! can do that as an honorary black man : Tropic Thunder , 2008 ! This is the MCU , right in front of you . It 's all about fighting for equality . The whole idea is to make space for others to succeed , and exceed our expectations . ''
Downey ended his speech by stating that these movies are `` metaphors for how our world should be , or could be one day , if we fight for it . '' He also praised Iron Man and Iron Man 2 director Jon Favreau , calling him the `` man who started it all , '' while declaring that Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was the `` First Lady of Marvel '' but now there are many . You can head over to Entertainment Weekly for their full report on Robert Downey Jr.s ' speech from the Avengers : Infinity War premiere .
Japan 's Junichi Mitsubori , famous third-generation wagashi master , recently visited Humber College in Toronto to offer a rare glimpse into the creation of these traditional confectionery works of art .
Wagashi is a generic term for Japanese-style confections that draw on the principles of Japanese culture , blending esthetic beauty with the seasons . Made with a mixture of azuki sweet bean paste and fruit , the soft , pliable mounds of paste are delicately sculpted into intricate , stunning balls of sheer beauty .
Dressed in austere black , Mitsubori , president of the Japanese Sweets Association , spoke with the help of an interpreter on the role of wagashi in formal events like the traditional Japanese tea ceremony , and on how wagashi is used in both sweet and savoury snacks and how the artistic designs express the beauty of nature and the seasons .
The art of wagashi is steeped in tradition and is one where patience is the key , as every piece is a reflection of the person who delicately carved meaning into each .
Mitsubori , who also recently spoke at the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre and offered hands-on master classes at Gusta Cooking Studio in Markham , has taught and performed around the world , but Toronto was his first stop in North America .
“ You will see these healthier sweets options taking main stage rather than being part of a plate , ” said Baron Hau , chef and director at Gusta Cooking Studio , who organized the master 's visit . “ Since we introduced seasonal wagashi in our class roster last summer , we have seen many cake decorators and small business owners coming for them . ”

Several municipalities in the Rock Island County will see changes on their tax bills in 2018 .
Here is a look at what has passed and what is still being considered .
In Rock Island County the property tax levy was increased by 6.5 percent . But most of that increase is covered by an agreement in Exelon . A home in the county valued at $ 100,000 is expected to see a slight decrease on the portion of taxes they pay to the county .
But another portion of the property taxes to all Rock Island County residents will increase .
The forest preserve potion of county property taxes will cost an additional $ 1.90 based on a home valued at $ 150,000 . This is to fund repairs to the dam and spillway at Loud Thunder Forest Preserve and to fund upgrades . The County Forest Preserve District will borrow $ 4.5 million through the purchasing of bonds .
Moline-Coal Valley School District approved a property tax decrease . Homes in Moline and Coal Valley will see about a $ 15 decrease on the portion of the bill paid to the school district . That is the estimated cost on a home valued at $ 100,000 . The decrease is attributed to a rise in home values . The EAV went about around two percent .
Still being discussed is a potential property tax increase for homes in the City of Rock Island . Monday , December 11 , was the first reading of the city 's 2018 budget . In it is a proposed 9 percent property tax increase . That is estimated to be about a $ 60 increase on a home valued at $ 100,000 . The city is citing a lack of revenue as part of the reason for this increase .
REUTERS : West Bromwich Albion hit back from a goal down to beat Hull City 3-1 on Monday as second-half goals by Chris Brunt , Gareth McAuley and James Morrison piled on the misery for Mike Phelan 's struggling side .
Robert Snodgrass gave Hull the lead at the Hawthorns in the 21st minute , sliding in to volley Ahmed El Mohamady 's cross into the net and the Tigers were good value for their lead at the break .
But West Brom started the second half strongly and equalised four minutes in after sustained pressure yielded a corner which Brunt dispatched into the net with a powerful header .
McCauley struck in the 62nd minute , the referee ruling that his header had crossed the line before being cleared as Hull failed to deal with another set piece , and Morrison scuffed a left-footed shot home 11 minutes later .
Hull remained mired in the bottom three on 13 points while West Brom are eighth on 29 ahead of their trip to Tottenham Hotspur .

NBA Finals 2018 : Under-the-radar players to watch for Cavs-Warriors
Two players off the bench may have a big say in the NBA Finals series between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors .
Omnisport NEWS News 30 May 2018 , 23:16 IST 37 Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
Warriors
It is hard to believe anyone could be under the radar in an NBA Finals that features two teams that will face off for a fourth straight year .
However , there are two players who will have key effects on games that could mean wins for the Cleveland Cavaliers or the Golden State Warriors .
They may not score in double digits every night or even grab five to eight rebounds , but what these two players will do could sway the series one way or the other .
1 . Golden State Warriors : Jordan Bell . During the offseason , LeBron James made an example of Bell in a pickup basketball game . But when that happened , Draymond Green , who was playing in the game as well , took the soon-to-be rookie aside and made a point after James hit a fadeaway in Bell 's face making him look silly .
`` Draymond was on my team , and he was just like , 'Look , you ca n't do anything about that . Just worry about the next play ' . But he also said if LeBron is taking those types of shots , that 's what we want because we 're going to make more threes than he makes twos , '' Bell told NBC Sports Bay Area .
The Warriors picked up Bell for a specific reason . He is the type of forward who can defend and rebound and match up with multiple positions on the floor . He can match up with James . He will not be able to stop him , but his energy will have an effect on James . If the Warriors can get James tired , they will have an even better chance of winning this series .
Bell , along with Kevon Looney , will be on James throughout the series . They will annoy the man as much as they can , and in the process , they will save Klay Thompson and Green a foul or two . That will be what they will try to do . We will see how long they stick with it .

2 . Cleveland Cavaliers : Larry Nance Jr. One of the Warriors ' biggest annoyances during the Western Conference finals was P.J . Tucker . The former Toronto Raptors forward was all over the glass for much of the series , and his offensive rebounding gave the Houston Rockets numerous second chances . In fact , their offensive rebounding was key to a couple of wins down the stretch . The Warriors went 2-2 in the series when they were outrebounded on the offensive end .
Larry Nance Jr. will play a similar role on the boards off the bench , especially if Kevin Love is unable to go in game one . Nance went five for five from the floor ( much of which came off offensive rebounding ) in Love 's absence in game six of the Eastern Conference finals and will likely get some time in the NBA Finals .
If he can get some rebounds that lead to second-chance points , the Cavaliers will have more chances at three-pointers that they must hit if they hope to win this series .
SINGAPORE : As demand for cleaning services continues to increase , the Government is putting place plans to help the industry adopt technology and cope with the manpower crunch .
An Industry Transformation Map ( ITM ) for the Environmental Services Industry was launched on Monday ( Dec 11 ) , with a series of initiatives to help companies drive innovation , train workers and improve procurement practices .
The aim is that by 2025 , about 30,000 workers in the environmental services industry can benefit from higher value-added jobs , said the National Environment Agency ( NEA ) in a media release .
Autonomous vehicles could also be used to clean the streets of Singapore .
Minister for Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said that later this week , NEA and the Ministry of Transport will be putting out a Request for Proposal for this purpose . He did not give further details .
“ In the near future , we can see autonomous cleaning equipment having the capability to ‘ talk ' with one another and take the lift to other floors to perform cleaning operations more independently , ” said Mr Masagos at the launch of the ITM .

“ This will free up their human co-worker 's time to focus on higher value work such as equipment fleet management or maintenance , or customer service , ” he added .
“ Automation can make the work easier , robots can perform routine , repetitive or unpleasant tasks ; data analytics can optimise the deployment of limited resources - all these will enable the industry to be better and smarter in its service delivery . ”
7 COMPANIES TO CONDUCT TRIALS OF TECH SOLUTIONS
One of the new initiatives under the ITM is a programme called INCUBATE , which seven organisations have signed on to .
In collaboration with NEA , the seven organisations will introduce technology trials for cleaning and waste management systems on several private premises .
City Developments Limited ( CDL ) , for instance , intends to use sensors to track the level of ammonia in toilets as well as deploy robotics like autonomous scrubbers for hard floor cleaning to address the manpower crunch .
There will also be a rodent monitoring system on trial to help with pest control .
Such technologies will be tested at CDL properties such as City Square Mall , Le Grove Serviced Apartments and Republic Plaza .
“ CDL adopts innovative technologies and solutions to continuously raise the operational efficiency and environmental performance of our properties , '' said CDL 's group general manager Chia Ngiang Hong .
`` This also helps to further enhance the comfort and well-being of our customers and tenants , ” he added .
At Changi General Hospital , its Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technology will look into an autonomous or semi-autonomous cleaning and disinfection system .
Chang Airport Group ( CAG ) , meanwhile , is testing “ fill ” sensors in some of its rubbish bins in Terminal 3 . The sensors will alert cleaning staff when the bins are full .
CAG said it plans to retrofit 150 bins with such sensors in Terminal 4 for the next stage of trials .
NEW CONTRACTING MODEL
Another key prong of the ITM is to improve productivity through encouraging better procurement practices .
Instead of focusing on headcount requirements when drafting cleaning contracts , the Government is hoping service buyers will specify desired outcomes instead .
Real estate developer Pontiac Land has adopted such a contracting method since April this year at five of its properties , including Millenia Walk and Millenia Towers .
The company said it switched to the new model because of manpower constraints under the old contracting model .
“ The contractor had trouble finding staff . So even if we specified 10 people in the contract , sometimes only eight would turn up ... the contractors were also in a hard place , ” said Pontiac Land 's senior vice president of strategic procurement Kwee Wei-Lin .
But switching to a outcome-based contracting model means that the company had to work closely with the service provider to help them understand the performance based indicators .
“ We were very specific with what we wanted ... for example , we use photographs to illustrate how clean we want the floor to be , ” Ms Kwee explained , noting that the company saw 7 per cent cost savings under the new contracting model .
“ The positives for the contractor was that it gives them flexibility with his headcount arrangement and encourages them to innovate and use technology to help productivity , ” she added .
NEA said it has worked with other Government agencies and industry stakeholders to develop a guide for drafting such outcome-based contracts .
It consists of specifications or clauses for drafting such contracts , guidelines on performance evaluation and templates for inspections and performance monitoring .
UPGRADING SKILLS
A skills framework for the industry was also launched on Monday .
Jointly developed by NEA , SkillsFuture Singapore ( SSG ) and Workforce Singapore ( WSG ) , the guide provides key information on existing and emerging skills that are needed for jobs in the cleaning and waste management sectors .
Using the framework , employers will be able to identify the skills needed and invest in training for their workers , said NEA .
It added that those who wish to join the cleaning and waste management sectors can also identify the relevant training programmes to upgrade their skills .
Less than half of those surveyed are n't insured for earthquakes and wildfires

British Columbians have no one to blame but themselves for not being ready for an emergency , a survey commissioned by the provincial government suggests .
Fifty-four per cent of the more than 1,200 respondents said they have a draft emergency plan , according to results released Monday suggest , but only 13 per cent of them have actually completed one .
Emergency kits were also lacking around the province : Only four in 10 people have one in their car , and only three in 10 have one ready at home .
And there 's no good reason why : most people cited “ personal laziness ” and “ apathy . ”
Most British Columbians had some emergency supplies , but key items were lacking .
Only 60 per cent had prepared at least four litres of water per person per day , and less than half had cash in small bills , a battery-powered or hand-crank radio , a whistle or a dust mask .
If the worst did happen , most people were n't prepared to rebuild , either .
Around half of people living in Metro Vancouver and on Vancouver Island were insured against earthquakes , and less than half of southern Interior and northern residents were covered for wildfires .
All around , most people admitted they did n't really understand how their insurance worked or what it covered .
ISLAMABAD - Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has said that Pakistan greatly values its relations with the US and looks forward to their further enhancement in different spheres particularly economy and trade .
The Minister made these remarks in a meeting with Ms Laurel Miller , the Acting US Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Minister Dar and Ms Laurel Miller exchanged views on broadening the regional connectivity and cooperation , particularly in the context of Pak-Afghan ties , with a view to achieving economic progress and well being for people of the region .
The Minister said that Pakistanis were peace loving people and the Government was pursuing the policy of good neighbourly relations .
He stated that Pakistan supported all efforts for lasting peace and prosperity in brotherly Muslim country Afghanistan as it is imperative for peace in the region .
The Minister referred to his scheduled visit to Washington for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings and said he looked forward to interacting with senior US leadership .
The Minister shared with Laurel Miller key economic indicators and Pakistan 's all encompassing drive for economic reforms in collaboration with development partners including the US .
He said that efforts were now afoot to consolidate economic gains made so far and achieve higher , sustainable and inclusive economic growth .
Dar also apprised the visiting dignitary about the progress on efforts to eliminate the scourge of militancy and said that after the success of Operation Zarb e Azb , Operation Raddul Fasad had been launched to attain internal peace and security .
He said that Pakistan wo n't allow its territory to be used for acts of militancy against anyone and nor would allow breach of its sovereign integrity from any external elements .
Pakistan had made great sacrifices in the war on terror which supported the cause of international peace , the Minister said .
The international community must support and acknowledge Pakistan 's efforts in this war , Dar added .
Ms Laurel Miller appreciated the macroeconomic stability that Pakistan has achieved under the leadership of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and particularly lauded efforts of Finance Minister and his team in this regard .
She hoped that current visit by US National Security Adviser and Finance Minister 's forthcoming visit to Washington would contribute to firming up Pak-US ties and set the tone for their future bilateral cooperation .

U.N. human rights experts urged China on Wednesday to release Liu Xia , the widow of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo , and allow her to seek treatment for deteriorating health , including travelling abroad .
GENEVA : U.N. human rights experts urged China on Wednesday to release Liu Xia , the widow of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo , and allow her to seek treatment for deteriorating health , including travelling abroad .
The appeal came nearly a year after Liu Xiaobo died of liver cancer on July 13 , 2017 while in custody , having been jailed in 2009 for `` inciting subversion of state power '' .

Liu Xia , an artist and poet who suffers from depression , has been under effective house arrest since her husband was awarded the prize in 2010 . She has never been charged with any crime and was last seen in public at his funeral accompanied by Chinese authorities .
`` We are disturbed by reports of the deteriorating health of Liu Xia . She is reportedly physically restricted at an unknown location and suffers from severe psychological distress , ” U.N .
independent experts on enforced disappearances , arbitrary detention , and human rights defenders said in a joint statement .
`` We reiterate our call to the Chinese government to disclose her whereabouts and release her , '' they said .

China has repeatedly said Liu Xia is free and is accorded all rights guaranteed to her by Chinese law .
However , Beijing-based Western diplomats have said she has been closely monitored by Chinese authorities since her husband 's death and has only been able to meet and speak to friends and family in pre-arranged phone calls and visits .
A friend who recently spoke to her by telephone said in May that she was losing hope of leaving the country .
In the past , Chinese dissidents have been allowed to leave the country and take up residence in a willing Western nation .
But President Xi Jinping , who came to power in 2013 , has presided over a sweeping campaign to quash dissent throughout Chinese society , detaining hundreds of rights activists and lawyers , with dozens jailed .
The U.N. experts voiced alarm at `` the growing trend of deaths in custody in China '' - who have included activist Cao Shunli in 2014 and Tibetan monk Tenzin Delek Rinpoche in 2016 .
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , in a speech last month , accused China of preventing independent activists from testifying before U.N. rights bodies . He voiced concern that conditions were `` fast deteriorating '' in the autonomous regions of Tibet and Xinjiang .
`` A number of Chinese human rights lawyers are in detention or simply disappeared , '' Alim Seytoff , director of the Uighur service at Radio Free Asia , said at a panel last week .
`` The situation of freedom of expression of Uighurs in the northwest of China is even worse , '' he said .
China , responding to `` unfounded accusations '' by Western states at the U.N. Human Rights Council , said last week that it encourages activists but `` does not allow any organisation or individual to engage in subversive or destabilising activities using the pretext of protecting rights or freedom of speech '' .
`` Meanwhile , the government is cracking down on ethnic separatists and violent terrorists ' activities to safeguard national security and protect people 's lives and property , '' Chinese diplomat Jiang Yingfeng told the forum .

BANGKOK : Tourists attending a full moon party in southern Thailand on New Year 's Eve said they were left with burns when a pyrotechnic display showered revellers with red-hot embers .
Footage of the incident on the popular backpacker island of Koh Phangan was posted online , showing how cheers turned to screams of panic as a giant sign reading `` Happy New Year 2017 '' was set alight at midnight .
Sparks could be seen raining down on the crowd , aided by an onshore breeze .
Eyewitnesses described mass panic as people scrambled to get out of the way of the display .
`` It was just like a shower of burning sparks , '' Lucy Coyle , a 20-year-old British tourist attending the party with her boyfriend , told AFP . `` It felt like people were stabbing you with pins all over your body ... everyone was trying to get out . ''
Coyle later posted pictures on Twitter of what she said were dozens of burns across her body .
@ TheSun here are some of the burns I received from the fireworks at thailands full moon party . These are just a few we 're covered head to toe pic.twitter.com/uAh4psZ2fz — lucy coyle ( @ lucy_coyle ) January 1 , 2017
Freddie Jacobs , another British tourist , said thousands were crammed onto the beach at the stroke of midnight , many under a sign they had no idea was about to be set alight .
`` My girlfriend fell to the floor , she was getting so many burns I had to cover her like a blanket , '' the 23-year-old said , adding he and his partner were covered in burns the next day .
Backpackers flock to Koh Phangan for its famously raucous full moon parties . But its laid-back charm belies an equally relaxed attitude to safety .
Police confirmed the incident but played down tourist reports of injuries and mass panic .
`` One female tourist aged around 30 was slightly injured , she got treated and went away , '' Colonel Somchai Noppasri , the island 's police chief , told AFP .

Protesters clashed with police trying to reclaim disputed religious artefacts from a museum in Catalonia on Monday , in the latest display of tension between Catalan separatists and Spain 's central government ahead of a Dec. 21 election .
BARCELONA : Protesters clashed with police trying to reclaim disputed religious artefacts from a museum in Catalonia on Monday , in the latest display of tension between Catalan separatists and Spain 's central government ahead of a Dec. 21 election .
A monastery in neighbouring Aragon region says over 44 of its artefacts were sold illegally to Catalonia in the 1980s and the issue has become a symbol of broader disagreement between opponents and supporters of Catalan independence .
Culture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo angered Catalan nationalists in November by using special temporary powers to accept a petition by a judge from Aragon calling for the artefacts to be returned to their previous home , the Monastery of Sijena .
The previous month , Madrid took control of Catalonia to quell the crisis over secession and called a snap regional election .
Hundreds of demonstrators on Monday massed at the museum of Lleida in western Catalonia where the artefacts were kept and pro-independence groups called supporters to stop the police from removing them .
There were minor scuffles , though no injuries were reported and the artefacts were eventually taken away at around noon .

Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont , currently in self-imposed exile in Brussels , criticised the move on Twitter and blamed the three principal unionist parties running in upcoming elections , the ruling People 's party ( PP ) , the socialist party and Ciudadanos .
`` Carried out at night and using a militarised police force , as always , and taking advantage of a coup d'etat to plunder Catalonia with complete impunity : This is the model that Ciudadanos , PSC and PP defend , '' Puigdemont said .
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said his government could not oppose court rulings because it would mean stepping outside the rule of law .

BEIRUT : U.S.-allied militias in northern Syria announced on Tuesday the formation of a civilian council to govern Raqqa after their planned capture of the city from Islamic State militants .
The Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) , which include a large contingent from the powerful Kurdish YPG militia , has advanced towards Raqqa with the help of air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition .
The SDF - made up of both Kurds and Arabs waging a military campaign against Islamic State - said local officials had been setting up the council for six months .
Reuters reported last month that the political wing of the SDF was helping to install a civilian council to run the eastern Syrian city , Islamic State 's base of operations in Syria .
A preparatory committee met `` with the people and important tribal figures of Raqqa city to find out their opinions on how to govern it '' , the SDF said in a statement .
Spokesman Talal Selo said the SDF would `` provide all the support '' and had already turned over some towns around Raqqa city to the council after driving out Islamic State militants .
The extent of Kurdish control in Raqqa 's future is sensitive both for residents and for Ankara , which has fought a three-decade Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey and fears growing YPG ascendancy just over the border in northern Syria .
The United States says a final decision has yet to be made on how and when Raqqa will be captured . But the SDF is pressing its assault near the city to isolate and ultimately take Raqqa while plans for civilian rule take shape .
The establishment of a local council allied to the SDF in Raqqa could expand a sphere of Kurdish influence that has grown in northern Syria during the six-year , multi-sided conflict . It would mirror governing arrangements put in place in the Manbij area after the SDF repelled Islamic State .

Eclipse Resources Corporation is pleased to announce that the Company and Eclipse Resources-PA , LP , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company , have entered into a definitive Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire certain oil and gas leases , wells and other oil and gas rights and interests covering approximately 44,500 net acres located in the counties of Tioga and Potter in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ( such transaction , the “ Flat Castle Acquisition ” ) from Travis Peak Resources , LLC ( “ Travis Peak ” ) . The aggregate purchase price for the Flat Castle Acquisition is $ 93.7 million ( subject to customary purchase price adjustments ) and is payable entirely in shares of Eclipse Resources ' common stock . In addition , the Company announced today that the Company and Eclipse Resources Midstream , LP , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company , have entered into a definitive option agreement pursuant to which Eclipse Resources Midstream . LP acquired the exclusive right to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of Cardinal NE Holdings , LLC for an aggregate purchase price of $ 18.3 million in cash ( such transaction , the “ Cardinal Acquisition ” and , together with the Flat Castle Acquisition , the “ Transactions ” ) from Cardinal Midstream II , LLC . The Transactions were approved by a special committee of the Company 's board of directors composed entirely of independent directors and the Flat Castle Acquisition is expected to close in January 2018 , subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions ; provided that the Flat Castle Acquisition will have an effective date of September 1 , 2017 and contemplates a second closing for purposes of curing any title or environmental defects with respect to the properties being acquired . In conjunction with this press release , the Company has posted a presentation with additional details regarding the Transactions to the Investor Center of its website at www.eclipseresources.com .
Transaction Highlights :
Acquiring an approximately 44,500 highly continuous net acre position in Tioga and Potter Counties , Pennsylvania with a low entry cost of ~ $ 1,900 per acre . 1
Acreage is largely delineated by 22 industry Utica Shale wells ( including the Painter 1H well drilled by Travis Peak ) with the Company 's preliminary analysis indicating gas in place exceeds the Southeast Ohio 's Utica Shale Dry Gas “ Core ” area .
Expected to create a new , highly contiguous core area , the “ Flat Castle ” Project Area , with few unit size restrictions supporting extensive “ Super-Lateral ” development and the application of the Company 's innovative drilling and completion techniques which we believe will generate enhanced returns .
Initial project area “ Type Well ” estimates indicate EUR 's of between 2.0 and 2.3 Bcf per 1000 feet of lateral at a cost of approximately $ 1,025 per lateral foot , consistent with or better than the Company 's current Southeast Ohio Utica assets .
Will acquire one proved developed producing well with approximately 6.5 net MMcf per day of production .
Anticipated to add approximately 87 net drilling locations ( based on a 16,000 foot lateral length ) while increasing the Company 's Utica dry gas acreage by approximately 85 % .
Purchase price for Flat Castle Acquisition payable 100 % in Eclipse Resources ' common stock , which the Company believes will preserve ample liquidity while substantially increasing scale . The number of shares of Eclipse Resources common stock to be issued to Travis Peak will equal $ 93.7 million divided by the 30-day volume weighted average price per share of Eclipse Resources ' common stock ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the closing date , subject to certain customary adjustments and a collar between $ 2.35 and $ 2.60 .
Entered into an option to acquire Cardinal NE Holdings , LLC , which owns midstream infrastructure with associated gathering rights on the acreage to be acquired by the Company in the Flat Castle Acquisition . The Company expects that the proximity of this infrastructure to Dominion 's gathering system will allow Eclipse Resources to build , own and operate the gathering system as wells are drilled , which will reduce the Company 's per unit gathering costs and improve returns .
1 Net of proved producing reserves
Benjamin W. Hulburt , Chairman , President and CEO of Eclipse Resources , commented on the Company 's acquisition , “ Eclipse Resources has today announced it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire a strategic Utica acreage acquisition in north , central Pennsylvania that is expected to significantly increase the Company 's inventory of highly economic drilling locations and allow the Company to continue to leverage its innovative drilling and completions techniques while remaining Appalachian basin focused . We are excited to begin operating in this project area , which we term the 'Flat Castle ' Project Area , with our first well anticipated to spud during the first quarter of 2018 and the full scale development anticipated to start in the fourth quarter of 2018 . We believe the additional scale from this largely contiguous acreage acquisition will be enhanced through the efficiency gains generated by our 'Super-Lateral ' development as we apply our operational and technical learnings from the Ohio Dry Gas Utica to the Flat Castle Project Area . From a geological perspective , this area is similar in depth to our Ohio Dry Gas acreage and is well delineated with a meaningful number of offset results , while lying within what we believe to be the highest gas in place of the prospect area .
`` We believe that the location of the Flat Castle Project Area , which is significantly west of the more currently constrained Northeastern Pennsylvania peers , will support our ability to reliably move gas out of the Flat Castle Project Area for the foreseeable future . The Company anticipates that the gas it produces in the Flat Castle Project Area will be transported through the Dominion and Tennessee gathering systems , which are exposed to improving Appalachian price differentials .
`` We have been patient and extremely rigorous in our acquisition efforts to ensure we pursue opportunities for our shareholders that will enhance our inventory of highly returning , core drilling locations at attractive valuations . We believe the Flat Castle Project Area is located in one of the best underdeveloped areas of the Appalachian Basin and will nicely complement our existing asset base , with the potential returns on these wells competing with those in our core Utica Dry Gas acreage . ”
Paris : Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery is confident his side have what it takes to get the better of titleholders Real Madrid after the teams were drawn together in the Champions League on Monday .
The sides will meet in the last 16 , surely not the tie PSG would have wanted after winning their group ahead of Bayern Munich .
Real , the two-time defending European champions and 12-time winners overall , came second behind Tottenham Hotspur in their group and will host PSG in the Spanish capital in the first leg on 14 February .
`` I do n't think it 's the worst draw possible . I think we are of a level where we can play against Real Madrid , '' said Emery .
`` If you want to do something big in the Champions League you have to play against the best sides . ''
`` I think these matches will be the centre of the footballing world when they come around . ''
Bayern were rewarded for finishing behind PSG with a tie against Besiktas , the Turkish champions , while the French club will once again have to overcome one of the Spanish giants .
Last season Paris faced Barcelona in the last 16 and were eliminated in extraordinary fashion , winning 4-0 at home in the first leg only to lose 6-1 in the return at the Camp Nou .
In that match , Barcelona needed to score three times from the 88th minute onwards and did so .
But since then PSG have strengthened , signing Neymar for a world record €222 million ( $ 264 million ) from Barça and beating Madrid to the signature of Kylian Mbappe from Monaco .
The tie will be the first meeting of the sides since the 2015-16 group stage , when Madrid won 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu after a 0-0 draw in Paris .
`` I have lots of friends in Madrid , I know Real Madrid well too , having watched a lot of their matches . I know what the atmosphere is like there , '' said Spaniard Emery .
`` It is a wonderful opportunity for us . I am sure the team will be in perfect shape when the tie comes around . ''
Meanwhile , Emery admitted that he has allowed Neymar to return to his native Brazil to deal with a family matter .
The 25-year-old was suspended for Saturday 's 3-1 win over Lille in Ligue 1 anyway , and now looks likely to miss Wednesday 's League Cup tie at Strasbourg , where Paris lost 2-1 only 10 days ago .
`` Neymar called me on Saturday . He said to me he had a family issue and wanted to know if the club and I would allow him to go to Brazil to deal with the problem , '' said Emery .
`` The person comes first , then the footballer . We gave him permission to make the trip . I hope he 'll be back in three or four days , but I do n't know if he 'll be back for Wednesday 's match . ''

CEBU City Jail Warden Arnel Peralta said that should the city extend assistance , they are willing to have the financial aid audited by the city government .
In a phone interview , Peralta said they will continue to ask the local government unit to provide food allowance for the city 's inmates .
“ There is COA . They are tasked to audit expenses but yes ( we are willing to have it audited by the city ) . Why not ? ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Peralta said they were informed by the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology ( BJMP ) national headquarters about the delay of the inmates ' subsistence allowance due to the increasing number of prisoners .
Peralta has asked for help from the city government . Mayor Tomas Osmeña , when sought for comment , said the city used to provide assistance for the inmates . However , it was stopped when the BJMP refused to have it audited .
“ Hopefully we can get help . But if they ca n't give it , we will not force them because this is optional , not compulsory ” Peralta said .
As of now , he said , they still have enough food for the inmates .
Meanwhile , Vice Mayor Edgardo Labella urged Councilor Dave Tumulak , deputy mayor on police matters , to create a program to decongest Cebu City Jail .
“ Tumulak should make proper recommendation to the mayor and the council . If there 's a proper request ( for budget augmentation ) , then we will act on it accordingly , ” said Labella .
At present , 4,772 detainees are housed in the jail , which is supposed to accommodate only 1,600 inmates .
Labella pointed out that some inmates have served more than their supposed jail sentence because they lack proper legal assistance and their cases are not heard speedily .
( Part 1 )
In true Cebuano fashion , the year 2016 kicked off with the Sinulog festivities ; but for the Cebu provincial government , last year 's events had a different twist in light of Cebu 's hosting of the 51st International Eucharistic Congress ( IEC ) from January 23 to 31 .
Held just a few days after the Sinulog festival , the IEC was a week-long event , which saw the Provincial Capitol suspending work on January 29 to help ease traffic for the IEC procession attended by at least 200,000 Roman Catholic devotees from all over the world who filled the streets along Osmeña Boulevard .

As the month of February rolled in , the Cebu provincial government was inundated with intense traffic woes as much-needed repairs for the first Mandaue–Mactan bridge began .
Commuter influx was high and the traffic congestion brought about by the project , which also saw the demolition of 50 houses of informal settlers located under the bridge , caused a grid lock .
Commuters , desperate to beat the heavy traffic , left their homes several hours ahead while some resorted to taking ferry boats to cross Mactan Channel .
By February 17 , the Mactan-Cebu Bridge Management Board ( MCBMB ) convened to address concerns with Gov . Hilario Davide III worried about the effects the bridge repairs would have on the business community and the riding public .
With an original project timeline of 320 days or 10 months , the P129-million bridge repair project was momentarily stopped .
Work resumed on April 2 under a much shorter target date , with August 29 as its projected completion date as the Department of Public Works and Highways ( DPWH ) worked 24/7 to meet the deadline .
By the first week of August , the repair was completed ahead of schedule after DPWH project engineer , Danilo Pasicaran , requested the contractor , Jegma Construction and Development Corp. , to add more manpower and equipment and to work 24/7 .
2016 elections
Barely three months shy of the May elections and with only four months left in his term , provincial board ( PB ) member Thadeo “ Teddy ” Ouano , 71 , died from complications of prostate cancer and diabetes on February 26 .
Ouano served three terms as Mandaue City mayor from 1998 to 2007 before he was elected to the PB for two terms , from 2010 to 2016 . He was chairman of the committee on environment and natural resources as well as the committee on ways and means .
Apart from his wit and contagious humor , Ouano was well remembered for having authored , among others , the Provincial Fisheries Ordinance which bans the capture , transport and sale of all shark species and their parts in the entire province .
With Ouano seeking a third term under One Cebu before his passing , his son Thadeo Jovito or “ Jonkie ” , took his stead to carry the Ouano political torch .
Meanwhile , the Commission on Elections ( Comelec ) went full force to ensure that the elections would be smooth-sailing in Cebu .
As part of regular preparations , Comelec reshuffled poll supervisors by the second week of February .
While the country braced for a new kind of leadership as then-presidential frontrunner Rodrigo Duterte took the lead , the Cebu provincial government likewise prepared for a new chapter as incumbent Governor Davide ran for a second term in office against former Government Service Insurance System ( GSIS ) chief Winston Garcia .
For the vice gubernatorial post , incumbent Vice Governor Agnes Magpale 's candidacy was challenged by Garcia 's running mate , Nerissa Soon-Ruiz , a five-term member of the House of Representatives .
A delay in the canvassing of votes from three Cebu municipalities pushed back the official proclamation of reelected Governor Davide and Vice Governor Magpale until the Comelec was able to resolve problems in the transmission of votes from the towns of Malabuyoc , Santander and Cordova .
In Barangay Gabi , Cordova , a special election was held due to misprinted ballots for one of its precincts affecting 436 voters .
The hitch in the canvassing of votes for Cordova also resulted to a delay in the proclamation of other candidates in the 6th congressional district to which Cordova belongs .
With Gabi 's special election held on May 13 or four days after the elections , its subsequent transmission of results finally paved the way for the proclamation of the winners for the gubernatorial seat on May 13 .
Garcia conceded defeat to Davide a few days earlier , with Davide garnering 616,381 votes over Garcia 's 593,725 votes .
“ Our service will continue . We will strive to strengthen our healthcare services . That will remain our top priority followed by food security , infrastructure and peace and order , of course , social services , ” Davide said shortly after his proclamation .

Industrial pollution has reached even the most remote corners of Earth : the deepest part of the sea .
Scientists have discovered “ extraordinary levels ” of polychlorinated biphenyls , or PCBs , in the Mariana and Kermadec trenches , two of the deepest ocean chasms on the planet .
“ Trenches have been considered as pristine environments , but also ( given their locations and topography ) as likely sinks for contaminants that enter the marine environment , ” Alan Jamieson , a marine ecologist at Newcastle University in England , wrote this week in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution .
Banned in the 1970s , PCBs were once widely used as dielectric and coolant fluids in transformers , capacitors and other electrical devices . About 1.3 million tons of the chemical was produced , and an estimated 35 % of that is now residing in coastal sediments , according to the study .
Known as persistent organic pollutants , these contaminants do not degrade naturally and can stick around in the environment for decades . The chemicals bond with bits of plastic and other kinds of organic debris , and are transported in air , soil and coastal waters . They 've even been found in the Arctic , far from industrialized areas .
While exploring life in the ocean 's hadal zone , a region 3.7 to 6.8 miles deep , Jamieson and colleagues measured contaminants in tiny shrimp-like scavengers called amphipods .
These crustaceans feed at the bottom of ocean trenches , ingesting any contaminants found in the environment . The pollutants are then stored in their in fat tissue . The contaminants spread through the food chain when the amphipods are eaten by bigger animals , such as fish .
Using deep-sea landing vehicles equipped with baited traps , the scientists collected samples of three species of amphipod from the Mariana Trench , in the western Pacific , and the Kermadec Trench , off New Zealand . Each of the 12 animals they collected was contaminated .
“ Regardless of depth , regardless of trench , regardless of species , ” Jamieson said , pollutants “ were present in all of them . ”

The study found elevated concentrations of contaminants , including flame retardants , in the upper portions of the trenches , about 4.5 miles deep . But amphipods with the most pollutants came from the Mariana Trench , possibly because the chasm is located closer to industrialized regions and beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . Plastic debris and dead animals contaminated with industrial chemicals sink into the ocean , where they 're eaten by the amphipods .
The PCBs and flame retardants found in the trenches can have “ devastating effects on the hormonal , immune and reproductive systems , ” wrote Katherine Dafforn , an ecotoxicologist at the University of New South Wales , in an article accompanying the study .
In parts of the world considered relatively pollution-free , the concentration of PCBs is less than one nanogram per gram of material sampled . ( There are 1 billion nanograms in a gram . ) In polluted areas , that level can rise to several hundred nanograms per gram .
PCB levels in the crustaceans from the Mariana Trench were up to 50 times greater than in crabs from the Liaohe River , one of the most polluted waterways in China , the study found .
While not as common as PCB pollution , the level of flame retardants in the deep ocean was comparable to or higher than levels in coastal waters off New Zealand .
The “ disturbing ” results show the deep ocean is much more connected to the surface than most people think , Dafforn wrote .
Jamieson added that the deepest point in the ocean , Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench , is only about seven miles deep — about half the length of Manhattan . That 's far from remote , he said .
In future studies , Jamieson said he hopes to determine how these pollutants affect the physiology of deep-sea creatures and their surrounding ecosystem .

WASHINGTON : Apple overtook Samsung in the fourth quarter as the largest smartphone producer in a declining global market for handsets , a research firm said Friday ( Feb 2 ) .
A survey by research firm IDC showed Apple - which reported its quarterly data Thursday - led all vendors with 77.3 million iPhones sold , giving it a 19.2 per cent market share .
Even though Apple 's unit sales were down 1.3 per cent from a year earlier , it was able to move ahead of South Korea 's Samsung , whose 74.1 million devices sold gave it a market share of 18.4 percent , IDC said .
Huawei held the number three position with a 10.2 per cent market share , followed by fellow Chinese makers Xiaomi and Oppo , with 7.0 and 6.8 percent , respectively , according to IDC .
Overall smartphone sales were down 6.3 per cent with 403.5 million handsets shipped , according to the survey .
IDC said the data showed consumers appeared in no rush to upgrade to the most expensive flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung .

`` The latest flock of posh flagships may have had consumers hitting the pause button in the holiday quarter , '' said Anthony Scarsella , an IDC research manager .
Scarsella said these high-end devices `` proved to be more of a luxury than a necessity among upgraders . ''
IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said that as the top brands expanded their offerings , `` brands outside the top five struggled to maintain momentum . ''
Samsung , which reported a 4.4 per cent decline in the fourth quarter , remained the top smartphone vendor for the full year with a 21.6 per cent market share , to Apple 's 14.7 per cent , IDC said .

Overall smartphone sales for 2017 were virtually flat - down 0.1 per cent at 1.47 million units , the report said .
A separate survey from Strategy Analytics found similar market share for smartphone vendors but found a nine percent drop in fourth-quarter sales , described as the largest decline in the smartphone era .
`` The shrinkage in global smartphone shipments was caused by a collapse in the huge China market , where demand fell 16 percent annually due to longer replacement rates , fewer operator subsidies and a general lack of wow models , '' said Linda Sui of Strategy Analytics .
Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Dell Technologies Inc said on Friday it is evaluating a potential public offering of its common stock or a potential business combination between the U.S. computer maker and business software provider VMware Inc .
`` The potential business opportunities currently being evaluated by Dell Technologies do not include the sale to a third party of Dell Technologies or VMware , '' Dell said in a filing . ( bit.ly/2DV54Tk )
Dell , the world 's largest privately held technology company , has been under pressure to boost its profitability and is seeking new avenues for growth after the debt-laden EMC deal failed to deliver performance it projected .
The company said in the filing there can be no assurance that any potential business opportunity will be pursued .
VMware 's shares were up nearly 2 percent .
“ We are not in a position to speculate on the outcome of Dell 's evaluation of potential business opportunities , ” VMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in a statement .

President Trump on Monday answered two days of bipartisan furor over his initial response to deadly protests in Charlottesville , Va. , with a new statement for the first time explicitly blaming white supremacists for the “ racist violence ” over the weekend .
“ Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs , including the KKK , neo-Nazis and white supremacists , '' the president said in a roughly two-minute statement , reading from a teleprompter at the White House .
`` To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend 's racist violence , you will be held fully accountable . Justice will be delivered , '' Trump added .
His statement was a hastily arranged do-over that implicitly acknowledged the need to staunch the self-inflicted damage his first reaction had caused him and his administration . Criticism and outrage had continued to build , including among Republicans , to Trump 's Saturday remarks blaming “ many sides ” — in effect lumping together the anti-racism counter-protesters with the gun-wielding white supremacy groups Trump declined to name .
Adding to the pressure for the White House , just ahead of the president 's scripted comments , a Virginia judge in Charlottesville declined to set bail for the 20-year-old Nazi sympathizer , James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio , who is charged with murdering a woman and injuring 20 others when his car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters and pedestrians Saturday .
Even before he belatedly spoke against the white nationalists , however , Trump drew more criticism for a tweet early Monday in which he attacked the African American chief executive of the pharmaceutical company Merck , Kenneth C. Frazier , within an hour of Frazier 's resignation from a White House manufacturing council to protest Trump 's initial failure to explicitly condemn the racists in Charlottesville .
The president had told reporters on Friday that he 'd hold a “ pretty big press conference on Monday , ” but after the weekend 's events no press conference was on his official Monday schedule . Instead , by mid-morning the White House circulated word that Trump would make a statement on Charlottesville .
Once he came to the lectern with the presidential seal , the president first took some time to extol his administration as he often does for various economic gains . After segueing to roughly two minutes of remarks denouncing the hate groups , Trump pivoted and left , ignoring reporters ' shouted questions as he had Saturday , including several asking if he regretted his delay in specifically blaming the racists .
White House aides declined to respond to requests for information , including about why the president 's promised press conference was canceled .
Prior to his public statement , Trump met privately with Atty . Gen. Jeff Sessions and new FBI Director Christopher A. Wray to discuss the civil rights investigation of the two days of chaos in Charlottesville that the Justice Department announced late Saturday .
After his Saturday statement , Trump continued to tweet through the weekend and into Monday , mostly on other subjects ; those referring to Charlottesville did not denounce or even refer to white nationalists .
Yet on Monday the president quickly attacked Merck 's chief executive after the company announced that Frazier had resigned from the president 's advisory council on manufacturing . Its statement said , “ America 's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred , bigotry and group supremacy . ”
Frazier said he felt “ a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism . ”
Trump responded on Twitter less than an hour after Merck posted Frazier 's statement : “ Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President 's Manufacturing Council , he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES ! ”
On social media , many critics noted the contrast between Trump 's quick condemnation of Frazier and his failure — to that point — to denounce racist groups by name . The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said that Trump “ proves again he 's capable of immediate and personal condemnation . Why not for white supremacists ? ”

Halifax 's special events advisory committee has passed a motion to ask council to consider committing $ 300,000 to bid for the 2020 IIHF Women 's World Championship .
The committee met Wednesday and discussed bringing the hockey tournament to the municipality , based on an application for funding submitted by Hockey Nova Scotia .
“ Halifax last hosted this event in 2004 . It was an incredible showcase for the female game and it really helped to raise the profile of the sport in our province . Should this event come back to Nova Scotia , we are confident that we would see similar results , ” said Darren Cossar , the executive director of Hockey Nova Scotia .
Hockey Canada has secured the rights to host the 2020 games and is operating the bid process . According to a staff report , Hockey Nova Scotia met with staff from the municipality and the province in March and submitted a letter of intent to Hockey Canada in April .
READ : ‘ History-making ' : Two Nova Scotians named to Canadian Women 's Olympic Hockey Team
The report says Halifax is currently shortlisted for the final bid process “ however , there is no information as to what other cities are being considered due to the confidential nature of the bid process . ”
The deadline to submit the final bid is July 6 , and Hockey Canada is expected to select the host city by the end of September .
The seven-day championship is tentatively scheduled for late March to April 2020 .
“ What I find is most exciting is that this is going to be something that the young women in not only Halifax but the province , have something to look forward to . They have new role models at an international level , ” said Coun . Steve Adams , who is on the advisory committee .
“ It 's going to increase the exposure for women 's hockey . It 's going to increase their interest and it 'll help not only perhaps the women 's leagues but to get more girls involved in hockey . ”
Halifax 's bid would be in partnership with the Town of Truro and the Municipality of Colchester . The plan is to have games played at Scotiabank Centre in Halifax and the Rath Eastlink Community Centre in Truro .

Having a five-hour layover is my idea of a living nightmare , and that came to mind after I booked a flight to Cambodia . However , rather than hang around the Singapore airport I tagged on an extra day . But I have two regrets : I should have stayed longer and I should have brought an empty suitcase .
Right away I noticed why Singapore bills itself as a “ garden city. ” Everywhere is green—and clean . ( Not a piece of litter in sight . Is getting arrested for spitting chewing gum on the street an urban myth ? ) Leafy streets are flanked with lush gardens spilling over gravity-defying decks of skyscrapers . Smaller than New York City , this island of less than 300 square miles with a population of four million has 50 parks and four nature reserves . No wonder downtown has grown vertically , but in a good way .
The architecture , including my hotel , is astounding . The ParkRoyal on Pickering has marvelous sky gardens along balconies and walkways . It 's dubbed a “ hotel within a garden ” and the ‘ hotel of the future . ' Much of Singapore is futuristic , particularly the Marina Bay Area .
To get my bearings and a birds-eye view of the city I took a ride on the Singapore Flyer . At 165 metres ( 540 feet ) high this giant observation wheel is bigger than the London Eye and boasts views as far as Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear day .
From here it 's an easy walk to Gardens by the Bay , 250 acres of park and its soaring “ Supertrees ” that could be the backdrop for a science fiction flick . I could have spent the day here , strolling two glass-domed , air-conditioned conservatories— a great way to beat the afternoon heat .
But here too is the iconic Marina Bay Sands comprising three hotel towers connected at the top by a ship-like roof terrace . It 's big and brash like a Vegas hotel but another outstanding view is worth the price of admission to the Observation Deck . If you want to splurge on a room , hotel guests can swim in the world 's largest rooftop swimming pool and gaze down at the skyline .
Closer to earth is the bar at Raffles Hotel , where the Singapore Sling originated . Here you can sip the legendary cocktail while eating peanuts and chucking shells on the floor without getting arrested .
Singers ( AKA Singaporeans ) are obsessed with food . Ask a cab driver to take you to his favourite hawker centre ( AKA food courts ) for chili crab . I had the messy delicacy at Jumbo Seafood at Clarke Quay , with a side of steam buns washed back with ice-cold beer . The place is hopping . Or if you 're craving fish porridge for breakfast get in line at the Maxell Food Centre , where Anthony Bourdain ate chicken rice . And barbecued satay from just about anywhere is a sure bet .
If you time it right , the Intercontinental Hotel has a dazzling weekend Dim Sum buffets at the Man Fu Yan restaurant . Come here hungry : dozens of hand-crafted dishes are offered . The place is packed with locals so it 's a good idea to make a reservation before leaving your hotel .
Before hitting another hawker centre , burn a few calories ( and dollars ) shopping on Orchard Road with its 22 shopping malls and six shopping centres . And there 's the night markets . The Bugis Street market sells a lot of junk and trashy souvenirs , but it 's fun and colourful and great for throw-away threads . If you want to seriously damage your credit card , the shopping mall back at Marina Sands is home to just about every international label and new designers . And Singapore , namely Sim Lim shopping center , is the place for electronics . I found gadgets for travellers that I did n't realize I needed . Who does n't need a portable battery or a new mirrorless camera ?
Many airlines flying to Asia and Australia have stopovers in Singapore and its airport is probably one of the best layovers . It has all kinds of free amenities , orchids everywhere and mesmerizing Koi ponds . But if you can add a few days onto your trip , Singapore will likely surprise you .
Madurai : A massive fire that broke out on the premises of the famous Meenakshi temple was put out in the early hours of Saturday and the devotees were allowed to offer the morning prayers .
The fire reduced 40 shops to ashes .
`` The hall with 1,000 pillars , which houses the temple museum , has not suffered any damage , '' District Collector Veera Raghava Rao , who supervised the fire-fighting operations , told reporters .
He added that a special team was formed to look into the impact of the fire on the temple , especially the 7,000-square foot Vasantharayar Mandapam , `` which has been affected '' .
There were no casualties , the collector said , adding that a police investigation was underway .
A preliminary probe revealed that the fire broke out late on Friday night due to an electrical short-circuit in one of the shops situated near the 1,000-pillar hall .
About 40 shops , selling puja articles and toys , were gutted in the fire and steps were being taken to clear the area of smoke , the police said .
Fortunately , the sculptures in the hall were saved by the timely intervention of the temple staff and the fire and rescue services personnel , the temple authorities said .
Mani , a flower vendor at the temple , said the mortar paste had peeled off at several places inside the Vasantharayar hall , while the paintings on the roof were destroyed .
Besides , two pillars got dislocated in the impact of the fire , a temple official said on the condition of anonymity .
The east tower entrance of the temple has temporarily been shut for cleanup works and the devotees are being allowed inside through the other gates .
Meanwhile , various Hindu outfits staged a protest , demanding relocation of the shops from the temple premises .
A huge posse of police personnel has been deployed in and around the temple .
The famous Sri Meenakshi Amman temple , one of the oldest in the country , attracts thousands of devotees every year .
Exxon Mobil Corp 's chief executive said on Wednesday that he hopes the new attorney general in New York `` comes to a different conclusion '' than predecessor Eric Schneiderman on a climate change probe into the world 's largest publicly traded oil producer .
DALLAS : Exxon Mobil Corp 's chief executive said on Wednesday that he hopes the new attorney general in New York `` comes to a different conclusion '' than predecessor Eric Schneiderman on a climate change probe into the world 's largest publicly traded oil producer .
Schneiderman , who resigned earlier this month after allegations of physical abuse by four women that he denied , had alleged Exxon withheld information about its internal climate change discussions and misled the public about what it knew . Exxon has long denied the charges .

The investigation has spread to other states , including Massachusetts , and has put Exxon squarely in the middle of the ongoing debate about fossil fuels and climate change .
CEO Darren Woods , who spoke at Exxon 's annual shareholder meeting in Dallas , said he was `` committed to being part of the solution on climate change . ''
Woods added he has not reached out to Barbara Underwood , who was appointed to replace Schneiderman . He said he was not sure if Exxon attorneys have talked to Underwood or her office .
`` I 'm real confident on where we stand . I hope whoever comes in steps back and takes an objective look ... and comes to a different conclusion , '' Woods said .

Underwood , a Democrat appointed by the New York State Legislature , has said she will not run for election to a full term this November . At least six candidates of various political backgrounds have announced their candidacies .
`` Let 's see what that election brings , '' Woods said .
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli , who oversees state pension funds that hold about 11.5 million Exxon shares , has also long criticized the company 's response to climate change and voted against a slate of 10 board nominees at the company 's annual meeting .
`` The fund can not support board directors who refuse to acknowledge substantial risks to Exxon 's bottom line and fail to help it transition to a lower carbon future , '' DiNapoli said in a statement . All 10 board nominees were approved .

As demands for farm-loan waivers grow across Punjab , Haryana , Tamil Nadu , Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh , and Karnataka–after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra wrote off loans worth Rs 36,359 crore and Rs 30,000 crore respectively–India faces a cumulative loan waiver of Rs 3.1 lakh crore ( $ 49.1 billion ) , or 2.6 % of the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2016-17 .
A waiver of this scale could pay for the 2017 rural roads budget 16 times over or pay for 443,000 warehouses or increase India 's irrigation potential by 55 % more than the achievements of the last 60 years .
Note : * Uttar Pradesh & Maharashtra have sanctioned the farm loan waivers .
While such waivers could provide succour for 32.8 million indebted farmers , an IndiaSpend analysis of the impact of previous farm-loan waivers indicates such bailouts are band-aids of uncertain efficacy and do not address a deeper malaise gripping India 's agrarian economy .
Over nine years to March 2017 , the central and state governments waived Rs 88,988 crore ( $ 13.9 billion ) in loans to 48.6 million farmers . The nationwide Rs 52,000 crore ( $ 11.3 billion at Rs 45.99 per dollar ) loan-waiver announced by the United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) in 2008 occupies the bulk of this figure .
The waivers were primarily meant to discourage suicides by farmers , apparently caused by widespread indebtedness . However , our analysis shows this had little or no impact on suicide rates , probably because 32.5 % on average , or 79.38 million , small and marginal farmers across India ( with farm holdings of less than 1 to 2 hectares in size ) rely on informal sources of credit .
Meanwhile , loan waivers have led to a rise in the non-performing assets of banks , especially public-sector banks , and are likely to have a significant bearing on the state and national fiscal deficits . In 2013 , agricultural non performing assets ( NPAs ) accounted for about 41.8 % of “ priority sector ” –which also comprises micro and small enterprises , affordable housing , and student loans–NPAs in public and private banks–up from 25 % in 2009 , according to a 2015 study on NPAs in priority-sector lending in India 's public and private banks , published in the International Journal of Science and Research ( IJSR ) .
For example , Maharashtra 's Rs 30,000 crore farm-loan waiver for small and marginal farmers will raise the state 's fiscal deficit to 2.71 % , which is three-fourths ( 1.18 percentage points ) higher than the budgeted deficit of 1.53 % of the gross state domestic product ( GSDP ) for the current financial year , according to this 2017 report by ratings agency India Ratings and Research ( Ind-Ra ) . Uttar Pradesh 's Rs 36,359 crore farm-loan is 2.6 % of its GSDP , estimated the agency quoted in Mint in April , 2017 . The 14th Finance Commission says fiscal deficits should not exceed 3 % of state budgets .
22.1 million ( 67.5 % ) small or marginal farmers wo n't benefit from loan waivers
About 85 % of all operational farm holdings in India are less than two hectares in size , as IndiaSpendreported on June 8 , 2017 . Since 1951 , the per capita availability of land has declined 70 % , from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011 , and is likely to decline further , according to the latest available ministry of agriculture data .
Owners of these shrinking farms find it difficult to use modern machinery and are often too poor to afford farm equipment . Manual labour increases costs , and size and output further limits access to loans and institutional credit .
On average , a third of Indian small and marginal farmers have access to institutional credit . This means no more than 10.6 million of 32.8 million small and marginal farmers in the eight states demanding loan waivers could benefit from debts being written off .
The other 22.1 million farmers depend on moneylenders and relatives for borrowings , according to the 2011 agricultural census and the National Sample Survey Office 's 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households , the latest available data .

Previous loan waivers did not stop farm suicides : NCRB data show
In 2007 , before the UPA 's loan waiver for 30 million farmers across 18 states ( Andhra Pradesh , Bihar , Chhattisgarh , Gujarat , Haryana , Himachal Pradesh , Jammu & Kashmir , Jharkhand , Karnataka , Kerala , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra , Orissa , Rajasthan , Tamil Nadu , Uttar Pradesh , Uttarakhand , West Bengal ) , 16,379 Indian farmers committed suicide , according to National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) data .
A quarter of these suicides ( 4,238 ) were reported from Maharashtra . In 2009 , the year after the loan-waiver was announced , the state government promised an additional waiver of Rs 6208 crores . This led to a drop in farm suicides in India 's richest state , by GDP ; but in 2010 , suicides rose again , by 6.2 % . By 2015 , seven years after the Centre 's bail-out , Maharashtra recorded 4,291 suicides , its highest rate ever , accounting for 34 % of such deaths nationwide , according to the latest available NCRB data .
Telangana reported a similar trend . In 2014 , when Telangana waived Rs 17,000 crore in loans to 3.6 million farmers , 1,347 farmers committed suicide in the newly formed state . By 2015 , 1,400 suicides were reported .

‘ Moral hazard ' : Agricultural NPAs grow three-fold between 2009 and 2013
While loan-waivers provide no more than temporary relief , they place a significant burden on public finance and the economy and they “ engender a moral hazard ” , Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel cautioned on April 6 , 2017 , echoing the arguments of financial experts who believe such bail-outs deter even capable farmers from honestly repaying their loans .
“ Waivers undermine an honest credit culture… It leads to crowding-out of private borrowers as high government borrowing tend to ( impose ) an increasing cost of borrowing for others , ” the RBI governor said , calling for a consensus among states on loan waiver promises . “ Otherwise sub-sovereign fiscal challenges in this context could eventually affect the national balance sheet . ”
After India 's first major farm-loan waiver of Rs 10,000 crore in 1990–announced by a Janata Party government led by then Prime Minister VP Singh–it took almost nine years for banks to recover , the Economic & Political Weeklyreported in April 2008 .
Since the 2008 farm-loan waiver , agricultural NPAs rose three times , from Rs 7,149 crore ( $ 1.2 billion ) in 2009 to Rs 30,200 crore ( $ 4.7 billion ) in 2013 , according to this 2015 study on NPAs in priority-sector lending in India 's public and private banks .

These NPAs affect the credibility of lending institutions . Shares of banks fell 4 % after Maharashtra announced its loan waiver , Business Standardreported on June 13 , 2017 . Further , with public-sector banks ( PSBs ) accounting for the major share of farm credit–52 % in Maharashtra , followed by 32 % from co-operative banks and 12 % in private banks–these PSBs are “ more vulnerable ” , said this 2017 Kotak Institutional Equities report .
While agricultural credit grew 547 % over 10 years , rural road infra grew 10.5 %
Without repaying debts , farmers wo n't get fresh kharif credit . This is why they want loan waivers as well as remunerative procurement price — M S Swaminathan ( @ msswaminathan ) June 13 , 2017
Indebtedness is a symptom and not the root cause of the farm crisis , according to a 2007 expert group report on agricultural indebtedness , chaired by economist R Radhakrishna . The average farm household borrowing has not been “ excessive ” , the Radhakrishna report said . The factors contributing to the farm crisis are “ stagnation in agriculture , increasing production and marketing risks , institutional vacuum and lack of alternative livelihood opportunities ” , the report said .
More recently , others have emphasised this point ( here , here and here ) : It is clear a loan-waiver alone can not solve India 's agrarian crisis .
The data reveal a more-than-necessary focus on agricultural credit , as other fundamental problems remain unaddressed .
Over a decade to 2014-15 , as institutional credit in agriculture grew 547 % , from Rs 1.25 lakh crore ( $ 19.4 billion ) to Rs 8.45 lakh crore ( $ 131.4 billion ) , rural road construction–which increases access and boosts agricultural income and productive employment–grew 10.5 % according to this 2016 research paper .
Roughly 7 % of India 's total grain output , 10 % of seeds and between 25 % and 40 % of fruits and vegetable–overall a third of farm harvest spoils–are wasted every year because there is n't enough storage and supply-chain infrastructure , according to the 2015 IJSR paper .
Irrigation , increasingly vital in an era of climate change , has failed Indian farming . No more than 47.6 % of India 's farms are irrigated , as IndiaSpendreported on June 8 , 2017 , and the decadal growth in net-irrigated area to 2010 was 0.3 % , according to ministry of agriculture data .
These low investments eventually make farming expensive and prices volatile .
For example , despite a good harvest , tur ( pigeon pea ) , an important pulse , today fetches 63 % less than it did in December 2015 ( Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal compared with Rs 11,000 per quintal ) .
Since 2010 , the cost of cultivating tur has risen by 78 % .
To curb the impact of market fluctuations , this 2016 report by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended improving the “ procurement capacity ” –or money available to buy farm produce–of states , lifting export bans , raising stock limits–which is how much produce traders can hold–and including “ risks and externalities ” while framing the minimum support prices ( MSP ) for various produce . For those commodities protected by the government 's MSP policy–these include fruits and vegetables–the Radhakrishna committee recommended a price-risk mitigation fund , which would allow hedging losses in market fluctuations .

These investments , as agricultural economist MS Swaminathan pointed out in his tweet , require capital expenditure , which may now be hit by the recent decisions to waive farm loans . States are unlikely to get help from the Centre this time , as finance minister Arun Jaitley indicated on June 13 , 2017 .
“ States which want to go in for this kind of schemes ( farm-loan waivers ) will have to generate them from their own resources , ” said Jaitley . “ Beyond that the central government has nothing more to say . ”
Rs 3.1 lakh crore : How we calculated the comparisons 1 . The 2017-18 budget for rural road construction ( under the Prime Minister 's Gram Sadak Yojana–a national rural road scheme ) is Rs 19,000 crore . We divided the total potential farm waiver of Rs 3.1 lakh crore by 19,000 = 16.31 times , rounded off to 16 . 2 . To arrive at the figure of 443,000 warehouses , we found that the average cost of one 10,000 sq ft warehouse is Rs 70 lakh ( at the average rate of Rs 700 per sq . ft. ) . We divided the total potential farm waiver of Rs 3.1 lakh crore by 70 lakh = 443,000 . 3 . Since the first five-year-plan of 1951 , Rs 2 lakh crore has been spent to create 109 million hectares of irrigation potential , according to this 2012 planning commission report . Irrigation potential is the area that can potentially be irrigated when it is fully utilised . From this , we found that Rs 1,835 crore can create an irrigation potential of 1 million hectares . We divided the total potential farm waiver of Rs 3.1 lakh crore by 1,835 crore per hectare = 169 million hectares , which is 55 % more than the 109 million hectares .

THE TALISAY City Aquastars pulled themselves a win away from advancing to the overall finals of the Governor 's Cup Inter-Cities/Municipalities Basketball Tournament after pulling off a 93-70 come-from-behind win over Sibonga in Game 1 of the best-of-three South Division Finals at the Talisay City Sports Complex last night .
The Aquastars , who are still unbeaten after 11 games in this tournament , used a huge late-game run to crawl back from a 10-point deficit in the third to pull off the victory .

Jay Deiparine topscored for Talisay with 28 points while Bryle Cuyos led the losing squad with 18 .
Sibonga led by 10 , 51-41 , in the third but Talisay slowly got back in the game and entered the payoff period trailing by just four , 56-60 .
With Sibonga 's key players in foul trouble , Talisay City went on a rampage in the fourth , building double-digit leads that took the fight out of the hard-fighting Sibonga squad .
Liverpool attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho was not included in the 22-man travelling squad for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Hoffenheim , the Premier League club said on Monday .
REUTERS : Liverpool attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho was not included in the 22-man travelling squad for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Hoffenheim , the Premier League club said on Monday .
According to reports in British media , Barcelona target Coutinho submitted a transfer request last week after Liverpool rejected a second bid worth 100 million euros ( US $ 117.96 million ) from the La liga club .
Coutinho also missed Liverpool 's 3-3 draw at Watford on Saturday due to a back injury , with manager Juergen Klopp conceding he had no control over the 25-year-old 's future at the club .
Under current UEFA rules , Coutinho 's participation in the play-off round against Hoffenheim would not jeopardise a move in the current transfer window . The Brazil international will remain eligible to feature for another club in next month 's Champions League group-stage .
The Merseyside club will also be without striker Daniel Sturridge , who has failed to recover from a thigh injury sustained during the pre-season .
Hoffenheim host Liverpool at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena on Tuesday before the two sides meet again at Anfield next week .

The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is making “ community visits ” in Nova Scotia this week , as it seeks to put a crisis of confidence behind it .
The inquiry 's director of health , Terrellyn Fearn , said officials begin three days in Halifax on Tuesday , before moving on to Membertou and Millbrook First Nations .
“ We 've talked to family and survivors on what kind of process they would like , and this is the process they felt most comfortable with , and that 's what we implemented , ” she said Monday .
READ MORE : Missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry executive director resigns
The visits are being held to prepare for nine community hearings starting this fall across the country , Fearn said .
For weeks , the commission has faced questions from concerned family members who say they have lost faith in the process , which is expected to take at least two years and cost $ 53.8 million .
In an open letter released last week , some family members called on the commission to start over from scratch , citing the resignation last month of one of the commissioners , Marilyn Poitras .
Some Aboriginal leaders have argued the inquiry has not put families first , and fails to respect their voices .
Fearn said Monday the inquiry is attempting to address concerns through these meetings .
“ It 's through these community visits that we 'll actually be able to meet families and survivors in person , answer their questions and start to build a relationship with them so they 'll feel comfortable enough to engage in the process , ” said Fearn , herself a member of the Glooscap First Nation in Nova Scotia 's Annapolis Valley .
Coverage of the missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry on Globalnews.ca :
Journalists have been asked to stay away from the sessions , which are being held at undisclosed locations . Inquiry officials are meeting with families and survivors who want to register with the inquiry , or have questions .
She said the inquiry has seen major growth in participation in the last month , and now has almost 500 registrants .
“ Our shift in this new direction is illustrated by the vast numbers of increasing participants , ” she said .
Families and survivors can speak to the inquiry 's health support staff to discuss their options and possibly begin telling their stories ahead of the hearing , she said . Legal counsel will also be available if participants wish .
“ I know there have been some concerns around the legalistic process of the hearings ; this part of the community visit and our intake process is really focused around the family and the survivor . And they 're really the one in the lead . ”

Assembly of First Nations Chief Perry Bellegarde has acknowledged that First Nations leaders are divided on what to do about the troubled inquiry . Bellegarde is steering a middle course , saying the commission needs to focus all its energy on ensuring the stories of families are front and centre , adding it is critical it improves communications .
Last month , commissioner Michele Audette told the AFN that there was a lack of communication at the beginning of the inquiry process , in part because the commissioners were told not to speak or go to events . But she said they “ were too silent , ” which was a mistake .
She told reporters the inquiry has “ been in crisis mode for quite a few weeks now . ”
Fearn said her own family has experience with the issues being explored by the inquiry , and she has a responsibility to them .
“ I know there are a lot of good constructive criticisms out there … there are also a lot of good things that are happening , and there 's a lot of support from families and survivors , ” she said .
“ By the very nature of the work , within Canadian society we are going to be pulling up the roots , shaking the roots of the marginalization of Indigenous women . And whenever you pull up those roots from the ground , it unsettles the earth . And I think a lot of what we may be seeing now is some of that unsettling . ”
Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital said on Monday it gave Uber and its ousted chief executive , Travis Kalanick , a month to review its recommendations before filing a lawsuit last week to force him off the board and rescind his ability to fill three seats .
REUTERS : Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital said on Monday it gave Uber and its ousted chief executive , Travis Kalanick , a month to review its recommendations before filing a lawsuit last week to force him off the board and rescind his ability to fill three seats .
The lawsuit , filed last Thursday , also accused Kalanick of concealing a range of misdeeds from the board and scheming to retain power at Uber Technologies Inc even after he was forced to resign as CEO in late June .
`` We know that many of you are asking why Benchmark filed a lawsuit against Travis last week . Perhaps the better question is why we did n't act sooner , '' Benchmark said in a letter to Uber employees on Monday . ( http : //bit.ly/2fFWmwK )
Kalanick was still involved in the day-to-day operations at Uber , which has created a sense of uncertainty and undermined the search for his replacement , Benchmark Capital said .
`` Indeed , it has appeared at times as if the search was being manipulated to deter candidates and create a power vacuum in which Travis could return , '' Benchmark said in the letter .
The well-regarded venture firm was an early investor in Uber and said in the lawsuit that it owns 13 percent of Uber and controls 20 percent of the voting power .

Parmanu : The Story Of Pokhran release postponed for third time ; John Abraham starrer out on 6 April
Mumbai : The impending clash between Anushka Sharma 's Pari and John Abraham 's Parmanu : The Story Of Pokhran on Holi has been averted .
Both the films were scheduled to open on 2 March . But John has given in to box office wisdom and Parmanu : The Story Of Pokhran will now release on 6 April .
# Parmanu # TheStoryOfPokhran , which was slated for release on 2 March 2018 , will now release on 6 April 2018 ... Stars John Abraham , Diana Penty and Boman Irani ... Abhishek Sharma directs ... Poster announcing the new release date : pic.twitter.com/592G0lOASO — taran adarsh ( @ taran_adarsh ) February 2 , 2018
Apparently , John had little choice , a person close to the production said . `` Anushka Sharma 's scare-fest in Pari is already grabbing a whole lot of attention . The latest promo has sent chills down the nations 's spine . Whereas John 's promotion for Parmanu : The Story Of Pokhran has not even started . Rather than rush into release , better sense prevailed . After a spate of flops , Parmanu : The Story Of Pokhran is crucial for John . The film has to work as he has signed only one film ( to be directed by Milap Jhaveri ) after Parmanu : The Story Of Pokhran . John wants to take no risks . It has to work , '' he added .
So now , Pari has 2 March all to itself .

Washington : The US has filed a lawsuit in a federal court in the northern district of Illinois seeking to revoke the American citizenship of a 37-year-old Indian-origin man convicted of terrorism .
In 2009 , Khaleel Ahmed pleaded guilty to charges of providing material support to terrorists through his efforts to travel abroad in order to murder or maim US military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan . He was sentenced to eight years and four months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release in 2010 .
`` Civil de-naturalisation is one important tool in our anti-terrorism efforts . We will continue to zealously seek out and prosecute individuals like Mr. Ahmed , '' acting Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio said after filing a lawsuit to de-naturalise Ahmed in a court in the northern district of Illinois on Tuesday .
Ahmed obtained US citizenship in 2004 .
The civil de-naturalisation complaint alleges that Ahmed concealed and affirmatively misrepresented his criminal conduct throughout his naturalisation proceedings , and that his application would have been denied had immigration authorities known about his provision of material support to terrorists .
`` The US will never be a safe haven for those seeking to support terrorists , '' Special Agent in-charge James Gibbons said . `` When individuals lie to obtain immigration benefits , the system is severely undermined and the security of our nation is put at risk , '' he said . Khaleel Ahmed 's conviction and the conduct on which it was based require revocation of his naturalisation on several independent grounds , he further added .
Between 2004 and 2007 , Khaleel Ahmed and his cousin , Zubair Ahmed , made preparations to travel abroad , and did in fact travel to Egypt with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of US military forces , he conceded in the guilty plea .
After returning from Cairo , the cousins discussed , sought , and received instruction on the use of firearms , including sniper rifles , and in counter-surveillance techniques . They also collected and distributed videos of attacks on US military forces overseas , manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry .
In 2009 , the US District Court for the northern district of Ohio accepted the cousins ' guilty pleas , and in 2010 , sentenced Khaleel Ahmed to eight years .
Born in India in 1980 , Ahmed was a beneficiary of chain immigration . He arrived in US on 16 August , 1998 , as a lawful permanent resident ( as a child of a brother or sister of a United States citizen ) . He became a US citizen on 31 March , 2004 .

GUATEMALA CITY : A strong 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit western Guatemala early on Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) , killing at least two people and causing power outages , as well as damage to some buildings , officials said .
The quake , originally estimated to measure 6.6 on the Richter scale before being revised upward , occurred at 1.29am ( 3.29pm Singapore time ) .
The epicentre of the quake was about 156 kilometres west of Guatemala City in the department of San Marcos , the Institute of Seismology said .
The tremor was felt across most of the country , including the capital , as well as in neighbouring Mexico , according to Guatemala 's National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction .
`` Moderate damage is reported to houses in southwestern areas and there are power outages in several parts of the country , '' agency spokesman Julio Sanchez said , adding that a 5.6-magnitude aftershock hit across the border in Mexico minutes after the first quake .

A man was killed in the southwestern Guatemalan village of San Sebastian after an old church collapsed , the agency said .
News reports said another victim , a woman , died of a heart attack in a small village near the border with Mexico .
President Jimmy Morales posted a message on Twitter , saying `` stay calm and be alert to possible aftershocks . ''
Guatemala is in a risk zone for tremors , located where the Caribbean Cocos tectonic plates converge with North America 's tectonic plates .
San Marcos was hit by earthquakes in 2012 and 2014 that left dozens dead .
LONDON - Islamic State militants have aspirations to launch mass-casualty chemical attacks on targets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe , the British security minister said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday . Ben Wallace also said British authorities feared that as the militant group was driven out of strongholds in the Middle East such as the Iraqi city of Mosul , Britons fighting for the group would return home and pose a growing domestic threat .
`` The ambition of IS or Daesh is definitely mass-casualty attacks , '' Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper . `` They have no moral objection to using chemical weapons against populations and if they could , they would in this country . The casualty figures that could be involved would be everybody 's worst fear . '' The report said no specific chemical plot had been identified but security services had been carrying out exercises to prepare for the possibility .
Islamic State used sulphur mustard gas in an attack on the Syrian town of Marea in August 2015 , according to global watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons .
Wallace pointed to the dismantlement of an Islamic State cell in Morocco in February as evidence of the group 's ambition to carry out chemical attacks elsewhere . `` Moroccan authorities dismantled a cell involving chemical weapons . They recovered toxic chemical and biological substances and a large stock of fertiliser . The substances found could have been used to produce home-made explosives and could have been transformed into a deadly toxin , '' he said .
About 800 Britons are thought to have travelled to Syria , many to join Islamic State , since the outbreak of the civil war in that country . Around 100 have been killed . `` The big concern is if Mosul collapses and all the other bases of Isis ( Islamic State ) collapse . We know there are a significant number of fighting for IS in Syria . They will probably want to come home , '' said Wallace .
In a separate report , the Sunday Telegraph newspaper quoted the head of Britain 's regulator of charities as saying that reports of links between charities and extremism had trebled over the past three years to reach a record high . The Charity Commission made 630 referrals to police in 2015/16 over `` allegations made ... about abuse of charities for terrorist or extremist purposes , including concerns about charities operating in Syria and other higher risk areas '' , the report said .
Bangkok : Indian male boxers endured a mixed day at the Asian Youth Championships , where three advanced to the medal rounds and qualified for the Youth Olympics , while six others lost in the quarter-final stage in Bangkok on Monday .
Ankit Khatana ( 60kg ) , Bhavesh Kattimani Kumar ( 52kg ) and Aman ( +91kg ) won their respective quarterfinal bouts to enter the semifinals and book a berth in the Youth Olympics , which will take place in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires later this year .
While Ankit defeated Korea 's Seomho Shin by unanimous decision , Bhavesh got the better of Malaysia 's Rasdenal Haikal Muhamad , also a 5-0 verdict .
Aman , on the other hand , had to toil hard for his 3-2 triumph over China 's Ma Jinyang .
However , it was curtains for Barun Singh ( 49kg ) , Himmat Singh ( 91kg ) , Akash Kumar ( 64kg ) , Akash Kumar ( 56kg ) , Vijaydeep Duhan ( 69kg ) and Ronak ( 81kg ) .
Himmat was pummelled by Uzbekistan 's Javokhir Thgaymurodov . Going down to Kazakhstan 's Tagat Shaiken in a unanimous decision was the Akash competing in the light welterweight ( 64kg ) division .
The Akash competing in the bantamweight ( 56kg ) category lost Uzbekistan 's Abdumalik Khalokov . This too was a 5-0 decision .
Vijaydeep was defeated by Yermakhan Zhakpekov of Kazakhstan , while Ronak lost to Uzbekistan 's Timur Merzhanov .
Earlier , Barun fought hard but could not prevent a 2-3 loss to Laurente Cruz of the Philippines .
Yesterday , five Indian women boxers assured themselves of medals , two of them also qualifying for the Youth Olympic Games , after advancing to the semifinals .
Anamika ( 51kg ) and Astha Pahwa ( 75kg ) were assured of medals and tickets to the Buenos Aires .
For women , four weight categories -- 51kg , 57kg , 75kg and 60kg -- will feature at the Games and from the ongoing event , the top-four will make the cut .
Each country is entitled to a maximum of two women and three men qualifiers and if it ends up achieving more than that , the nation in question will have to pick among the qualifiers .
The Youth Olympics are scheduled from October 6 to 18 .
KUALA LUMPUR : The Malaysian state of Penang will continue to impose its hotel levy , despite a new federal government tourism tax coming into effect on Jul 1 , according to local media citing the state 's chief minister Lim Guan Eng .
This would mean that tourists staying in accommodation while in Penang may be subject to two tourism taxes .
Lim said on Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) that the tax was still needed to promote tourism products in the state , according to local reports .
In Penang , those staying in hotels currently have to pay RM3 per room for hotels above four stars and RM2 per room for hotels below three stars .
The federal government tax coming into effect from July will be added to the prices of all types of premises used as accommodation for tourists , such as registered hotels and inns .

Rates start from RM2.50 ( US $ 0.60 ) a room each night at a non-rated accommodation to RM20 a room each night at five-star accommodation .
The measure was given the green light after the Tourism Tax Bill 2017 tabled by Tourism and Culture Minister Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz in the last session of parliament was approved in a majority vote .
According to Malaysian media , Minister Nazri said that states which have implemented their own tourism charges would be asked to stop the collections when the Tourism Tax comes into effect .
However , Lim said he was “ surprised by the statement because there has been no consultation between the ministry and the state on the issue ” .
Lim said the Malaysian Association of Hotels ' Penang Chapter has agreed that RM3 was a small amount “ but useful ” .
He also expressed concern over the money collected from the national tourism tax saying it would affect businesses if the state removed their own tax . He said a percentage of the money collected from the national tourism tax should be given back to the state .
“ I believe many will not feel the pinch with RM3 for hotel stays but RM20 is different , ” he added , suggesting that the tourism tax be levied only on foreigners .
Penang , Langkawi and Malacca are among the state authorities that have levies for tourist accommodation .

EDINBURG , Texas – Police in Texas acting on a tip found 16 immigrants locked inside a tractor-trailer parked at a gas station about 20 miles ( 30 kilometres ) from the border with Mexico , less than a month after 10 people died in the back of a hot truck in San Antonio .
Edinburg Assistant Police Chief Oscar Trevino says the immigrants may have been locked inside the 18-wheeler in Edinburg for at least eight hours before being freed by officers late Sunday morning . He had earlier said there were 17 immigrants locked in the tractor-trailer before correcting the number on Monday to 16 .
Trevino said none of the people inside the tractor-trailer required medical attention . He said they were hungry and thirsty and were given food and water at the scene .

Those found locked in the tractor-trailer included eight people from El Salvador , six from Mexico and two from Romania , said Manuel Padilla , U.S. Customs and Border Protection 's Border Patrol sector chief for the Rio Grande Valley at Texas ' southernmost point .
A man and woman who Trevino said are Cuban nationals were in charge of the rig and have been detained .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Nina Pruneda said no one has been charged yet in connection with the case but that the agency is working with state and local officials and talking to witnesses .

The discovery comes three weeks after 10 people died in a sweltering rig parked at a Walmart in San Antonio . Immigration officials say survivors estimated 100 people had been packed into the back of the 18-wheeler at one point . Officials said 39 people were inside when rescuers arrived , and the rest either escaped or hitched rides to their next destination . Nearly 20 of those rescued from the rig were hospitalized in dire condition , many suffering from extreme dehydration and heatstroke . The driver of that rig remains in federal custody , charged with illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain , resulting in death .
On Sunday , Edinburg police went to the gas station , a popular stopover for commercial truck drivers travelling through the region , after receiving an anonymous call from someone saying a relative was trapped inside the tractor-trailer . Officers began knocking on the sides of trailers parked at the station and eventually received return knocks from the one holding the immigrants , police said .
The San Antonio incident demonstrated how smugglers regularly use big rigs in an elaborate network of foot guides , safe house operators and drivers . The immigrants discovered in San Antonio had been divided into groups and marked with colour-coded tape . Six black SUVs were waiting at one transit point to take some to their destinations .
Authorities have not said if similar arrangements had been made for the immigrants found in Edinburg , about 230 miles ( 370 kilometres ) south of San Antonio .
Trevino said that they discovered the immigrants after one of the people locked in the tractor-trailer called a relative in Mexico . The relative then called authorities .
COMMENTARY : Now is not the time to crack down on border-hoppers
Padilla declined to say if Sunday 's incident was related to the San Antonio case , citing the ongoing investigation . But he said authorities had stopped more than 30 tractor-trailers since October in the Rio Grande Valley . That does n't include Laredo , the Texas border city where authorities say the driver of the trailer in the San Antonio case said he stopped twice on his journey .
“ You do n't know how many you miss , ” Padilla told The Associated Press on Monday . “ But … the use of tractor-trailers to smuggle people out of this area is higher in South Texas , to include Laredo , than any other area along the border . And it goes right back to a weak border . ”
Most people apprehended crossing the United States ' southern border are caught in the Rio Grande Valley , which includes more than 300 miles ( 480 kilometres ) of the Rio Grande , the river separating the United States and Mexico .
Border apprehensions have risen each month since falling in April to a 17-year low .
Tractor-trailers emerged as a popular smuggling method in the early 1990s amid a surge in U.S. border enforcement in San Diego and El Paso , Texas , which were then the busiest corridors for illegal crossings . Before that , people paid small fees to mom-and-pop operators to get them across a largely unguarded border . As crossing became exponentially more difficult after the 2001 terror strikes in the U.S. , migrants were led through more dangerous terrain and paid thousands of dollars more .
President Donald Trump says Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ( mih-NOO'-shin ) will soon travel to China for talks as the two global economic powers deal with trade tensions .
Trump says during a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron that Mnuchin will be going to China `` in a few days to negotiate on trade . '' Trump says the U.S. and China are `` very serious '' and is reiterating plans to impose tariffs up to $ 100 billion more on Chinese goods .
Trump says the U.S. `` will continue unless we make a trade deal . '' But he adds , `` I think we 've got a very good chance of making a deal . ''
Mnuchin has expressed optimism that the countries could avoid a trade war . He met last week with financial officials from China , Japan and Europe .

In the exhibition , where a contemporary anthology will take place , works of master artists , such as Ali Atmaca , Hakan Ada , İsmail Ateş , Nedret Yaşar , Memduh Kuzay , Rasin Berk , Yiğit Yazıcı and Yurdanur Şentürk , will welcome visitors .
Curated by Bülent Aydın , the exhibition can be seen at Trump Art Gallery , on the B3 floor of Trump Towers Shopping Mall , until June 25 .
U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed six North Korean defectors to the Oval Office on Friday , a high profile and potentially provocative show of support .
The group -- whose stories Trump described as `` incredible and truly inspirational '' -- included a banker with knowledge of the regime 's overseas operations , a former political prisoner and amputee Ji Seong-ho .
Seong-ho escaped from North Korea in 2006 and was given a place of honor just seats away from First Lady Melania Trump at Tuesday 's State of the Union address .
Since coming to office Trump has made a series of bellicose remarks on North Korea and vowed to never let Pyongyang develop nuclear weapons that could hit the continental United States .
But his embrace of North Korean defectors could enrage the regime as much as any verbal barbs .
The meeting comes at a particularly sensitive time , as the Winter Olympics are about to get underway in South Korea .
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un -- who Trump has dismissively dubbed `` rocket man '' -- has so far pressed ahead with weapons programs and shows little sign of backing down .
Trump has pushed for an oil embargo against North Korea , a measure that could significantly dent the country 's military operations and the broader economy .
But , according to diplomats , that effort has run into opposition from Chinese leader Xi Jinping , who believes it could cause the country 's collapse .
Trump addressed the standoff in separate calls with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Friday .
In a call with Japan 's Shinzo Abe , the White House said both leaders agreed to `` intensify the international maximum pressure campaign to denuclearize North Korea . ''
In his call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in , Trump wished `` him and the Korean people a successful Winter Olympic Games . ''
ELMA , N.Y. ( WIVB ) – State Department of Environmental Conservation Officials are investigating a disturbing case of animal abuse that was posted on social media ..
It involves some young adults and a snapping turtle that they reportedly saw on the side of a road . You may have heard about a disturbing Facebook video circulating on social media .
It shows multiple teens attacking and beating a snapping turtle .
According to Facebook viewers the incident happened Monday and is believed to have happened in the Elma area .
The video is graphic in nature and shows at least two teenagers poking the snapping turtle with a stick and throwing a tree branch on top of its shell .
People writing on Facebook claim the teenagers featured here are from Iroquois High School .
We spoke with Iroquois Central Schools Superintendent Douglas Scofield .
He says this incident did not happen on school property or during school hours , but they are conducting their own internal investigation .
Scofield says the DEC has some people they are interested in based on images captured from the Facebook video . Leaders with the DEC , released a statement in part about their investigation saying : “ Wildlife , including snapping turtles , are protected and regulated in New York State under NYS Environmental Conservation Law .

AUCKLAND : Irish flanker Peter O'Mahony will captain an experienced British and Irish Lions team for the match against the Maori All Blacks on Saturday but tour skipper Sam Warburton gets another chance to press his claim for a test spot from the bench .
Warburton arrived on tour under an injury cloud having not played since April due to a knee injury and only returned to action in the opening match against the Provincial Barbarians , a 13-7 victory .
The Welsh flanker scored a try in Tuesday 's loss to the Otago Highlanders but will be hoping for plenty of gametime to impress in Rotorua on Saturday given the back row talent coach Warren Gatland has available to him .
Gatland was expected to select close to his first choice side for the fifth match of the tour with the first test against the All Blacks only a week away .
If that is the case , then the New Zealander will clearly be looking to dominate the hosts physically in midfield after naming Jonathan Davies and Ben Te ' o in the centres .

Jonny Sexton also returned at flyhalf in an all-Irish combination with scrumhalf Connor Murray , while England 's Owen Farrell will be on the bench .
The hulking George North and pacy Anthony Watson will occupy the wings with Leigh Halfpenny named at fullback , a position that might have been taken by Stuart Hogg had the Scot not been ruled out of the tour by injury on Tuesday .
In the pack , England duo George Kruis and Maro Itoje will make up the second row with their international teammate Jamie George getting the nod at hooker .
`` At this stage of the tour it is important to build on the foundations that have been laid in the last few weeks , '' Gatland said in a news release .
`` We were obviously disappointed with the loss against the Highlanders and realise that we need to improve in several areas , including our discipline , but we feel that overall we are building well towards the test matches .
`` Every game is a big challenge , which is what we wanted , and this is an experienced Lions team with eight of the starting 15 involved in the last test in Australia in 2013 . ''
O'Mahony will lead the team from to blindside of the scrum with his Irish teammate Sean O'Brien at openside and Welshman Taulupe Faletau in the number eight jersey .
`` Peter is a proven captain with Munster who never takes a backward step and we believe that those leadership qualities will serve us well on Saturday against a quality and determined Maori All Blacks team , '' Gatland added .
Lions : 15-Leigh Halfpenny , 14-Anthony Watson , 13-Jonathan Davies , 12-Ben Te ' o , 11-George North , 10-Johnny Sexton , 9-Conor Murray , 8-Taulupe Faletau , 7-Sean O'Brien , 6-Peter O'Mahony ( captain ) , 5-George Kruis , 4-Maro Itoje , 3-Tadhg Furlong , 2-Jamie George , 1-Mako Vunipola .

JOHANNESBURG : Indian Shubhankar Sharma completed his maiden European Tour triumph on Monday ( Dec 11 ) in Johannesburg by winning the Joburg Open tournament he almost did not compete in .
He carded a three-under-par last-round 69 to finish three strokes clear of South African Eric van Rooyen in an event that stretched to five days because of bad weather .
The final round was suspended on Sunday due to torrential rain , lightning and hail and resumed on Monday .
Sharma birdied three holes on the outward trek , then parred all the inward-nine holes with immaculate approach shots and putting highlights of his game .
After three bogeys during his opening-round 69 last Thursday , Sharma played 55 holes without dropping a shot and his second-round 61 was the lowest score of the tournament .
Visa delays and tiredness after a long Asian Tour campaign left the 21-year-old Indian contemplating missing the tri-sanctioned European Tour , Asian Tour and South African Sunshine Tour event .

His late decision to visit South Africa for the first time paid rich dividends as he pocketed a 2.6 million rand ( US $ 190,000 ) first prize .
Victory also guaranteed Sharma , along with Van Rooyen and joint third Shaun Norris of South Africa , places at the 2018 British Open in Carnoustie next July .
`` I am thrilled that I came to the Joburg Open , '' said Sharma after adding to five victories on the Indian circuit .
`` It has been a very long Asian Tour season for me so I was considering whether I wanted to visit South Africa . I am really happy that I did . ''
The previous best European Tour finish for the golfer ranked 462 in the world was sharing ninth place at the Maybank Championship in Kuala Lumpur last February .
`` Winning the Joburg Open on my first trip to South Africa is a wonderful feeling , '' Sharma said after receiving the trophy from Johannesburg mayor and golfer Herman Mashaba .
`` I met my caddie for the first time last Monday and we worked so well together . Heeding his advice was a key factor in my success .
`` Saving par on a number of holes thanks to up and downs played a significant role in keeping me at the top of the leaderboard .
`` It has been absolutely fantastic and the people were very welcoming . I do not think I will ever forget this week .
`` This is my first win on the Asian Tour and the European Tour so it means a lot to me , '' said Sharma .
`` On the first day there were 240 players . I was just trying to play two good rounds to make the cut , which was really low .
`` I was playing well and had a great start on the second day which got things going for me . As soon as I reached 13 under after two days , I thought I had a chance to win .
`` The only thing I was telling myself was to stay aggressive . I never wanted to be defensive .
`` Even when I was in front I never thought of defending my lead . I actually set a target of 25 under . ''
Van Rooyen quickly became the only final-round threat to Sharma and five outward-nine birdies narrowed the gap to four shots by the turn .
But he could add only one further birdie , leaving steady Sharma to succeed one week after compatriot Arjun Atwal finished runner-up in the Mauritius Open .
Panaji : A local court has issued a notice to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in connection with a case filed against him for his bribery remarks made during Goa Legislative Assembly elections held last year .
Judicial Magistrate First Class at Mapusa town , nine kilometers from Panaji , issued the notice to the AAP leader on Friday and fixed the next hearing on 8 February .
In January 2017 , the Election Commission had ordered the police to file an FIR against Kejriwal after he publicly appealed to the voters to accept bribe offered by rival parties to vote for them during the Goa elections . The election was held in February last year .
During a series of rallies in Goa between 7-8 January , Kejriwal had appealed to voters to `` accept money from the Congress and BJP candidates , but vote for the AAP '' .
The AAP had contested 39 out of 40 seats with its leader , Elvis Gomes , as the chief ministerial candidate .
A complaint against Kejriwal was lodged by local Election Commission officials with Mapusa police .
The returning officer had approached the judicial magistrate first class in Mapusa in December 2017 with a plea that an offence under section 171 ( B ) ( inducement to voters ) and 171 E ( bribery ) of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC ) be registered against Kejriwal .

For some , a birthday can turn from a one-day observation into a “ birthday week ; ” some may be so bold as to celebrate an entire “ birthday month , ” but the town of Brooksville has been celebrating its 200th birthday all year and the annual Brooksville Day celebration brought the best of Brooksville together for another celebration .
From a craft fair highlighting the beautiful wood pieces of Christina Snow , to sea glass art from Christina Leaf and glass from Bagaduce Art Glass , local artisans shared their wares .
Brooksville 's own Tinder Hearth bakery , Boop 's Lime Fizz and Mia 's Noodle Cart rounded out the food offerings , while parade goers waited for the 11 a.m. start .
Led by members of the Anah Shrine in an assortment of mini lobster boats and trucks , they were followed by the sounds of Atlantic Clarion and the area 's steel drum bands and a dozen or so floats made by Brooksville residents and businesses .
Brooksville Elementary School Principal Cammie Lepper and Hancock County Sheriff Scott Kane—both town residents—took to the dunk tank to raise some money . “ If you have particularly bad aim , I invite you to come up , ” said Lepper as she made her way to the tank platform . The two battled it out , each with an hour in the tank . Lepper raised $ 62 and Kane $ 57.50 .
Ruthie Stevens , AKA the “ Candy Lady ” not only participated in the parade as its Grand Marshall , but made peanut butter balls and Needhams ( yes , a potato candy ) which were served along with birthday cake .

“ I do n't think I 've been through anything as traumatic as [ what ] we 've been through , ” the pop star , 24 , told Coveteur . “ So … [ tour ] can be a lot . ”
As hard as it can be to focus on something like performing in the wake of such a shocking tragedy , the singer also knew it was important to regroup and finish the final leg of the “ Dangerous Woman ” tour .
“ Calling it off and going home was not an option . The message of the show was too important . For the crew and everyone involved , it 's become more than just a show for us , ” she said . “ We are really grateful to be here and really grateful for this show . ”
In June , Grande participated in the “ One Love Manchester ” benefit concert to raise money for the victims of the attack . The city made her an honorary citizen in July .
Could it -- could it be true ?
Nope . After the tease of first glance , it 's business as usual .
Road teams went 6-9 in the first 15 games of Week 14 , with Monday night 's tilt between the Patriots and Dolphins still to be played . New England ca n't bring the visitors ' delegation to .500 this week , but it can bring it to the optimistic 7-9 . I mean , the 2001 Browns finished 7-9 and the next year , they made the playoffs .
They have n't been back since . Let 's hope for better futures for road squads than that .
We begin in New York , where the Giants wore GIANTS on their helmets , but could n't stop a semi-giant ball-carrier from tearing them apart Sunday . These are your greatest on the road from Week 14 .
Greatest on the Road
Rod Smith , Dallas Cowboys
The Dallas Cowboys were a run-first team in 2016 , and they did it very well . But without their star running back , it has n't been the same . Then came Rod Smith , a running back in college who has been used primarily as a fullback in the NFL . Google his 40 time -- you 'll have a hard time finding it , or really anything of note from his time at Ohio State ( except for this touchdown run against Nebraska ) .
Smith 's career-high for rushing yards in a single game in 61 , which he achieved earlier this season in a blowout win over San Francisco . That remains his highwater mark after he rushed six times for 47 yards and a touchdown Sunday , but his contributions in the passing game are what landed him in this space .
The big back racked up 113 yards on five receptions , with the majority of those yards coming on an 81-yard catch over the middle that he deposited in the end zone to take what was a close game and blow it wide open . You can find the score above in Smith 's highlights , but you can also view it below , because I 'm a believer in spreading football-borne joy to the masses .
If you 've ever seen the Fast and Furious movies ( my personal favorite is the eternally corny 2 Fast , 2 Furious , which aged poorly but produced a great Ludacris song ) , you know what it 's like for a driver to hit the nitrous oxide boost . Smith did the football equivalent on that play , which helped the Cowboys avoid a brush with embarrassment and keep them in the postseason hunt .
Also considered ...
Jordan Howard , Chicago Bears
This one 's pretty simple : Chicago dominated Cincinnati on Sunday , especially in the final three quarters , a stretch in which the Bears outscored the Bengals 27-0 . Much of that was due to the play of Jordan Howard .
Howard powered a Bears rushing game that churned up 232 yards on the ground and accounted for three scores as Chicago ground Cincinnati 's defense to a powder before it was all said and done . Howard opened the scoring with a 21-yard sprint through a gaping hole to the front corner of the end zone , and closed the scoring with an 8-yard run up the middle to ice the game for the Bears . Not a bad day .
Davante Adams , Green Bay Packers
The Packers were this close to being the team the Browns beat for their first win of the season .
Davante Adams ensured that would n't happen .
The receiver caught 10 passes on the day for 84 yards and two touchdowns , but his greatest contribution within those numbers came in the final two periods . Adams caught a 1-yard touchdown pass to tie the game up at 21-21 in the final seconds , and one-upped himself in overtime on his short catch and 25-yard run to paydirt and a walk-off win for the Packers . In the final two periods , Adams hauled in six of his 10 receptions . The last was the most important to a Packers team that is , somehow , still alive in the playoff race .
Wesley Kasperski of Allen Park , President and CEO of WESCOMM Technologies , shows a security system control panel similar to one he installed last June at 4055 Fullerton , in the Russell Woods neighborhood of Detroit , to protect the Detroit Land Bank home during renovation while it was featured on This Old House season 37 , episode 18 , Detroit / Ready for Rehab . WESCOMM also installed security systems on other Detroit Land Bank houses under construction . Photo by Sue Suchyta  For The NEws-Herald
The original rehab reality show , This Old House ,  now in its 37th season , features an Allen Park security firm in episode 18 , protecting Detroit Land Bank houses under renovation from scrappers .
Wesley Kasperski , president and CEO of WESCOMM Technologies , appears in a segment filmed last June in the Russell Woods neighborhood , 4055 Fullerton , Detroit , installing a state-of-the-art wireless security system with remote monitoring that works even if a phone line is cut and the security panel is destroyed by an intruder .
The episode , which aired in early April on PBS , can be viewed online at pbs.org/video/2365996308 .
Kasperski said he grew up watching the show with his parents .

That was the thing we did every Saturday morning ,  he said . I would watch that in my diapers with them . If it didnt play in the background , it didnt feel like Saturday.
Kasperski said he has always had a fascination for electronics .
As a little boy , you couldnt leave me at home without someone watching me because they would come home and the TV would be taken apart ,  he said . I was always into that . As time went on , I started inventing little alarm systems , putting the keypad with clay to the wall , pressing the buttons and pretending it worked when I was 8 or 9 years old.
He said security  video and audio  enticed him growing up , and he was always poking holes in walls and installing alarms and cameras in his parents house as a teenager .
His boyhood fascination grew into a career , and he founded WESCOMM 15 years ago .
While his appearance on This Old House focuses on one house , Kasperski said he currently has security systems in 30 Detroit Land Bank houses under renovation . Once renovation is complete , he offers to extend a security system to the new homeowners on a monthly basis .
Kasperski said the Detroit Land Bank leaves the security system in the rehabbed home when they sell it and offer the new homeowners the first three months of the security system fee for free . He said WESCOMMs monthly fee is about $ 40 .
We gave it to the new homeowner as a gift , and all they have to do is maintain the monthly dues that are owed for it ,  he said .
Kasperski said his segment on This Old House ,  which is about four minutes long , took about seven hours to shoot . He said there are many people behind the scenes  a director , producer , camera guy and even a personal assistant  and the mike guy adjusted his personal microphone 25 to 30 times during the shoot .
Overall , it was really exciting ,  he said . You see all these people that youve watched all these years on the show , and now you are seeing them in real life , and they are just normal , nice people.
He said they used one camera for the scene , so they would reshoot it to get a different angle , one that might not match up with the audio , but might be a close up of his hands on a panel . He said they have some talented people editing the segments .
This Old House contacted his business because he already had a strong relationship established with the Detroit Land Bank , having provided security systems at their renovation sites .
Kasperski said the shows producer said they not only wanted an alarm system for the house but also wanted to produce a segment to teach viewers about the available technology and how it works .
Kasperski said there are a lot of differences in alarm systems . His goal is to have alarm systems that are difficult for burglars to defeat .
Any average burglar with half a brain cell who is going to break into your house is going to do one of two things : They are going to go to the back of your house and simply cut the telephone line and internet line ,  he said . And 90 percent of every alarm system out there is either running on your old telephone line or the newer technology is starting to use your internet.
Kasperski said if thieves cut the cable line , homeowners wont get a security alert phone call since the Wi-Fi cant communicate when the line is cut .
He said their system works off a Verizon cellular radio , so there is nothing to be cut . If the intruder tries to cut the electrical power , the system has a 24-hour back-up battery .
If a burglar enters a home and an alarm goes off , he said they follow the noise and destroy the main control panel with a sledge hammer to silence the alarm , and they also know they have 30 seconds to enter a home and disarm the panel by destroying it before an alarm even sounds .
He said WESCOMM has a crash and smash feature . If a code is not entered to disarm the alarm , then it assumes the security system panel was smashed , and it cant communicate . An alert then goes out to the homeowners phone that a potential crash and smash has occurred .
So weve hit all the marks of why a normal alarm system fails ,  Kasperski said .
He said motion detector cameras can capture images of an intruder . On the high end , high definition cameras can capture license plate numbers from 30 feet away so surveillance video that also can capture facial images in conjunction with an alarm system is even better .
Around Halloween , when yard decorations were being stolen , his home system alerted him to a 4 a.m. side yard intruder who was spooked away by the surveillance camera and left without stealing anything but whose facial image was captured , which Kasperski turned into the Allen Park police . The surveillance video also showed a car trunk full of Halloween decorations .

BUFFALO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) - An upcoming change at U.S. ports of entry in western New York is expected to make it more challenging for Canadian travelers seeking U.S. work permits .
“ There are more changes within this short period of time than I 've seen throughout my 14 years as an immigration attorney , ” said lawyer Jamie Fiegel , a partner with Fiegel & Carr .
A recent change at the Customs and Border Protection Buffalo field office will bar attorneys like Fiegel from providing counsel in-person during secondary inspection at the border .
‘ Secondary inspection ' is where travelers go after the drive-thru check-points ; inside the building to answer questions from CBP officers .
It 's here , Fiegel explained , clients need her advice to clear up grey areas that exists in immigration law .
If you 're Canadian and want to work in the U.S. , you can either get approval at the border , or by mail with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) , which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security .
“ In the last week alone , we have had three cases of people who were denied a work permit at a port of entry , came to use , we filled out and completed the application under the regulations the way it is supposed to be , same criteria , same client , same facts , ” Fiegel told News 4 .
Once her office filed that paperwork with USCIS , Fiegel said her clients gained approval .
According to CBP , lawyers have never been technically allowed in secondary inspection for non-criminal cases . However , this national law was rarely enforced .
Management at the Buffalo field office recently made a decision to uniformly follow the federal regulation .
“ The Port of Buffalo has always had a good relationship with the local private bar , and these regulations were not strictly enforced in the past . There have been individual incidents , however , where attorneys have improperly interfered with the inspection process over the years . And after a careful review of the current inspection procedures concerning attorneys , Port of Buffalo management felt it was necessary to uniformly adhere to the federal regulations moving forward , ” said Chief CBP Officer Aaron Bowker .
Fiegel said the process of having to re-apply if you 're denied puts a burden on her clients .
“ The danger of being denied at the border for a work permit , or as a visitor , this happens often as well , if there 's a black mark on your record then , ” she said .
The attorney also noted the high processing fees and rush fees clients often encounter when they need to re-apply via mail or if they 're in a hurry to get their paperwork approved on time after a denial ; these fees add up , sometimes to more than $ 1,200 .
According to CBP , no specific incident prompted this enforcement , but the agency stated it regularly reviews it 's practices .
The goal of this , according to the CBP , is to ensure the traveler represents themselves for inspection .

University of Santo Tomas ( UST ) formally barged into the win column when it smothered University of the East ( UE ) in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines ( UAAP ) Season 79 women 's volleyball tournament Wednesday at the FilOil Flying V Center in San Juan .
The Tigresses made short work of the young , but game , Lady Warriors , 25-9 , 25-22 , 25-23 .
Former best blocker Ria Meneses tallied 13 points while skipper Sisi Rondina and EJ Laure , finished with 12 markers apiece for UST , which had a strong start and an even stronger finish .
The Lady Warriors , however , tried to steal a set away when head coach Francis Vicente fielded his second stringers in Juliet Catindig , Jana Sta . Maria , Laizah Bendong and Angelica Dacaymat , but the Tigresses were simply too strong , too talented to overcome .
Despite the convincing victory , UST head coach Kungfu Reyes remains searching for an important ingredient from his battle-tested wards : leadership
Lack of leadership
Reyes said their battle with the Lady Warriors is closer than what actually reflects on the scoreboard .
“ Actually , yun ang gusto ko sa UE . Hindi ka talaga pwedeng magpabaya otherwise kakain ka niyan ng buong-buo . Habang tumatagal napakalaki ng transformation nila . ”
He said they remain a work in progress as they still lack that strong finishing kick , that deadly blow , in the crucial stretch .
The problem is , nobody wants to stand up to assume the leadership role .
“ In two years ' time ko sa UST , yung ( transformation ) ang pilit kong gustong baguhin . Sabi ko nga sa kanila , individually magaling tayo pero kapag pinagsasama-sama na ‘ yun ang nagiging problema kasi walang gusting mag-take ng leadership. ” “ In two years ' time ko sa UST , yung ( transformation ) ang pilit kong gustong baguhin . Sabi ko nga sa kanila , individually magaling tayo pero kapag pinagsasama-sama na ‘ yun ang nagiging problema kasi walang gusting mag-take ng leadership. ” “ Parang hindi nila kilala ang isa't-isa . Yun ang problem to solve pag equal level of skills regardless kung mas bata o seasoned . Equal ang skills pero sa leadership , doon talaga nagkakatalo . Walang gusto mag-command sa loob . ”
He emphasized that skills and talents are not their problem ; their main weakness is who would land the knockout punch that would send their foes rolling to the canvass .
“ Mas gusto ko pa nga na skills ang maging problema at hindi leadership . Ang skills naayos , ang leadership hindi . ”
Still , Reyes believes that the problem would be solved any time soon .
After all , they wo n't be called Tigresses for nothing .

Yesterday provided a case study of why public regard for the news media has plummeted . The frenzy over whether Secretary of State Tillerson called President Trump a moron became a centerpiece of the day 's news cycle because it enabled what my late mentor M. Stanton Evans called “ ventriloquist journalism ” —reporters finding a way to use a quotation or action of a public figure to back up their favored narrative , and calling it “ news . ”
Tillerson was right to say that he would n't confirm or deny the story , because that is a mug 's game . Because the next question would be , “ Well , did you call him a poopyhead ? ” And “ do you still beat your wife ? ” Tillerson 's quite proper answer was uniformly rendered as a confirmation by most media “ analyses , ” and gleefully reported as such everywhere .
The idea of “ fake news ” is n't really new with Trump ; Daniel Boorstin was onto the essence of what is meant by fake news with his great 1962 book The Image : A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America , which explained that “ pseudo-events ” are manufactured news rather than real events of historic consequence . Yesterday 's “ moron-gate ” is an excellent example of a pseudo-event .
I am certain the media could have—and probably did once in a while—try to make news out of Reagan Administration officials who said Reagan was an inattentive dunce who fell asleep in cabinet meetings , etc . Turns out most of those reports were wrong , but in any case they missed utterly the substance of what was really going on and what Reagan was really doing and thinking himself . And who really cares if Tillerson in a moment of frustration called Trump a “ moron ” ?
The real morons today are our puffed up media grandees . And I wo n't deny saying it every time I turn on the TV news .
HONG KONG : A British banker jailed for life for the horrifying murder of two Indonesian women at his upscale Hong Kong apartment in a cocaine-fuelled rampage appealed against his conviction Tuesday ( Dec 12 ) .
Cambridge University graduate Rurik Jutting tortured Sumarti Ningsih for three days - filming parts of her ordeal on his phone - before slashing her throat with a serrated knife and stuffing her body into a suitcase .
Days later , and with Ningsih 's corpse on his balcony , the former Bank of America worker picked up Seneng Mujiasih , intending to play out the same fantasies . He killed her when she started screaming .
Jutting , now 32 , had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but was found guilty of murder in what the judge at the time described as killings that were `` sickening in the extreme '' .
However , Jutting 's defence team Tuesday argued that judge Michael Stuart-Moore had repeatedly given wrong directions to the jury during the trial last year when explaining how they should determine whether his state of mind had impaired his responsibility for his actions .
Defence lawyer Gerard McCoy argued the judge had wrongly told the jury to look for mental `` disorders '' rather than the broader spectrum of `` abnormality of the mind '' .

`` Abnormality of mind need not be a disorder , '' McCoy told the court Tuesday .
`` The judge has wrongly and prescriptively directed the jury that they should look for disorders because disorders are what is an abnormality of mind , '' he added .
The defence team during the trial had argued that Jutting 's mental responsibility had been substantially affected by heavy alcohol and cocaine use as well as sexual sadism and narcissistic personality disorders .
Not all four experts who testified agreed that Jutting 's behaviour met the criteria for a `` disorder '' in all four areas , said McCoy .
However , they did all find that Jutting was suffering from an abnormality of mind because he had impaired mental functioning , he added .
Jutting was alert and taking notes in court Tuesday , dressed in a blue shirt and wearing dark-rimmed glasses , at one point smiling and talking with the guards in the dock .
In the gruelling 10-day trial last October and November , the jury heard how Jutting became obsessed with slavery , rape and torture - fantasies he acted out on his first victim , Ningsih .
The jury was forced to watch iPhone footage of parts of the attack as well as Jutting 's own self-recorded descriptions of how he had used pliers , sex toys and a belt during the killing .
He then went on to murder his second victim , Mujiasih , slashing her throat in his living room .
At the end of the trial , Stuart-Moore said Jutting had known what he was doing and described him as an `` archetypal sexual predator '' who presented an extreme danger to women .
The hearing continued Tuesday .

SAN FRANCISCO ( AP )  A federal judge in San Francisco granted initial approval Tuesday to a deal worth at least $ 1.2 billion that aims to compensate the owners of roughly 78,000 Volkswagens with 3-liter engines that were rigged to cheat on emissions tests .
The company previously agreed to spend up to $ 10 billion compensating owners of roughly 475,000 Volkswagens and Audi vehicles with 2-liter diesel engines  the bulk of the vehicles caught up in Volkswagen 's emissions cheating scandal .
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer congratulated attorneys for Volkswagen and car owners before granting preliminary approval to the smaller deal involving Volkswagens , Audis and Porsches . He said the settlement was complicated and motivated by economic and environmental concerns .
The deal offers thousands of dollars in compensation to individual car owners on top of buybacks or repairs .

`` This settlement marks an important milestone in Volkswagen 's efforts to make things right in the United States , '' said Robert Giuffra , an attorney representing the company .
Owners of 20,000 3-liter models dating back to 2009-2012 that can not be fixed to meet pollution standards will be offered buybacks or trade-ins . They also will receive compensation ranging from $ 7,755 to $ 13,880 , according to attorneys representing car owners .
People who bought 58,000 newer cars will get compensation of $ 7,039 to $ 16,114 . If VW ca n't fix the newer cars to regulators ' satisfaction , then the owners ' attorneys are expected to go back to court to seek buybacks . That could push the value of the deal for the 3-liter engines up to $ 4 billion .
Preliminary approval allows consumers to weigh in on the deal and learn online whether they have an eligible vehicle and how much compensation to expect . Breyer set May 11 for a hearing on final approval .
Volkswagen has now settled most U.S. consumer claims stemming from the emissions scandal and agreed to pay $ 4.3 billion to settle a U.S. criminal investigation .
The company has acknowledged that the cars were programmed to turn on emissions controls during government lab tests and turn off the controls while on the road .
GENEVA/YANGON : The United Nations braced on Friday for a possible `` further exodus '' of Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar into Bangladesh six weeks after the world 's fastest-developing refugee emergency began , U.N. humanitarian aid chief said .
Some 515,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh from Myanmar 's western state of Rakhine in an unrelenting movement of people that began after Myanmar security forces responded to Rohingya militant attacks with a brutal crackdown .
The United Nations has denounced the Myanmar military offensive as ethnic cleansing but Myanmar insists its forces are fighting `` terrorists '' who have killed civilians and burnt villages .
Right groups say more than half of more than 400 Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine state have been torched in a campaign by the security forces and Buddhist vigilantes to drive out Muslims .
Mark Lowcock , U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs , reiterated an appeal for access to the population in northern Rakhine , saying the situation was `` unacceptable '' .
Buddhist-majority Myanmar has blocked most access to the area , although some agencies have offices open in towns there and the International Committee of the Red Cross is helping the Myanmar Red Cross to deliver aid .

`` This flow of people of Myanmar has n't stopped yet . Obviously there 's into the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya still in Myanmar , and we want to be ready in case there is a further exodus , '' Lowcock told a news briefing in Geneva .
Lowcock said a senior U.N. official was expected to visit Myanmar in the next few days .
An estimated 2,000 Rohingya are arriving in Bangladesh every day , Joel Millman of the International Organization for Migration , told a separate briefing .
Myanmar officials have said they attempted to reassure groups trying to flee to Bangladesh but could not stop people who were not citizens from leaving .
The official Myanmar News Agency said on Friday `` large numbers '' of Muslims were preparing to cross the border . It cited their reasons as `` livelihood difficulties '' , health problems , a `` belief '' of insecurity and fear of becoming a minority .
RAIN-DRENCHED CAMPS
Aid agencies have warned of a malnutrition crisis with about 281,000 people in Bangladesh in urgent need of food , including 145,000 children under five and more than 50,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women .
Cholera is a risk , amid fears of disease spreading in the rain-drenched camps where aid workers are trying to install sanitation systems , a spokesman for the World Health Organisation said .
About 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine are due to arrive this weekend and a vaccination campaign should start on Tuesday .
U.N.-led aid bodies have appealed for US $ 434 million over six months to help up to 1.2 million people - including 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh before the latest crisis and 300,000 Bangladeshi villagers in so-called host communities .
The Rohingya are regarded as illegal immigrants in Myanmar and most are stateless .
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced criticism for not doing more to stop the violence , although a military-drafted constitution gives her no power over the security forces .
She has condemned rights abuses and said Myanmar was ready to start a process agreed with Bangladesh in 1993 by which anyone verified as a refugee would be accepted back .
Lowcock said talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh on a repatriation plan were a useful first step .
`` But there is clearly a long way to go , '' he said .
Both the United States and Britain have warned Myanmar the crisis is putting at risk the progress it has made since the military began to loosen its grip on power .
China , which built close ties with Myanmar while it was under military rule and Western sanctions , has been supportive .
In Washington , U.S. officials said sanctions and the withholding of aid were among the options available to press Myanmar to halt the violence but they had to be careful to avoid worsening the crisis .
`` We do n't want to take actions that exacerbate their suffering . There is that risk in this complicated environment , '' Patrick Murphy , a deputy assistant secretary of state , told a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee .
Murphy said efforts were under way to identify those responsible for rights violations .

WASHINGTON : A US federal judge on Monday ( Dec 11 ) cleared the way for transgender people to join the military from Jan 1 , denying a request from President Donald Trump 's administration to delay the move .
The ruling will be seen as a blow to Trump , who in July sent out three tweets saying that transgender troops could not serve `` in any capacity , '' citing `` tremendous '' medical costs and disruption .
Those messages , later followed by a formal White House memorandum , set off a roar of protest - with several service members and rights groups quick to sue . Already two federal courts have ruled against Trump 's proposed ban .
Under a new policy first announced when Barack Obama was still in power , the Pentagon was supposed to start accepting transgender recruits on Jul 1 this year , but Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis pushed that back by six months to January 1 pending further review .
Then last week , the Justice Department asked a federal court to further delay the January start date while the legal battle plays out .
But US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled on Monday that the government had not shown it would be `` irreparably harmed '' if the military begins to accept transgender men and women on Jan 1 .

Government lawyers cited Lernes Hebert , an acting deputy assistant secretary of defence , as saying that meeting the January deadline would `` impose extraordinary burdens on the department and the military services '' because `` there are considerable requirements associated with implementing this significant and complex policy change . ''
Kollar-Kotelly said she was not convinced .
In her ruling , she wrote that the government had failed `` to acknowledge the considerable amount of time defendants have already had to prepare for the implementation of this particular policy . ''
`` Defendants have had the opportunity to prepare for the accession of transgender individuals into the military for nearly one and a half years , '' the judge wrote .
'PLANNING TO PREPARE '
Pentagon spokesman Major David Eastburn said the military was `` planning to prepare '' for transgender people to enter the military from Jan 1 , in accordance with federal court rulings .
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders referred questions on the matter back to the Pentagon and the Justice Department .
The Palm Centre think tank , which focuses on sexual minorities in the military , said the Pentagon is ready to implement the new policy , noting that it had been doing the ground work for two years .
`` That is longer than the preparation the military had for repeal of 'Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell , ' and accession of openly gay Americans , '' the center 's director Aaron Belkin said in a statement .
The number of transgender troops among America 's 1.3 million active duty service members is small , with estimates topping out at 15,000 .
Trump 's July tweets caught observers and many in the military off guard , coming with little apparent coordination with the Pentagon .
The president 's policy shift meant that transgender troops who were encouraged to come out under one administration suddenly faced getting booted under another -- opening up a legal quagmire for the Pentagon .
Several senior military officials voiced unease over the policy shift , and the head of the Coast Guard said he would not `` break faith '' with transgender personnel .
Trump has said he did the Pentagon a `` great favour '' by banning transgender troops , saying the issue had been `` complicated '' and `` confusing '' for the military .
Train services were severely affected in Mumbai during morning rush hour on Tuesday as hundreds of students demanding railway jobs sat on the rail tracks in the centre of the city.The students , mainly those who have cleared the railway apprentice exams , blocked the rail track at 7 am in the morning , forcing railway to stop the suburban as well as express train in the affected section between Matunga and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus ( CSMT ) stations . `` There has been no recruitment since last four years . We are struggling from pillars to post . Over 10 students have committed suicide . We can not let such things happen , '' a student who was part of the protest said.Currently , there is a quota for 20 per cent apprentices to be taken into service by the railways . For that , the apprentices have to undertake a written exam.Railway officials say rules do n't allow jobs for apprentices as they are trained for a specified period . A fifth of the railway jobs have been reserved for apprentices.The protesting students , though , want the 20 per cent quota limit removed . They want the entire quota to be filled by students who have passed the test .

Hundreds of Amazon workers blew whistles and banged drums on Tuesday to protest against the presentation of a German award to Jeff Bezos , the ecommerce firm 's chief executive .
BERLIN : Hundreds of Amazon workers blew whistles and banged drums on Tuesday to protest against the presentation of a German award to Jeff Bezos , the ecommerce firm 's chief executive .
Police estimated that about 450 members of trade union Verdi gathered outside the headquarters of the media company Axel Springer , where Bezos was to receive an award at a glitzy ceremony attended by German politicians and celebrities .
`` We have an Amazon boss who wants to Americanise work relationships and take us back to the 19th century , '' Verdi leader Frank Bsirske told the crowd of Amazon workers , some carrying placards reading `` Make Amazon pay '' .
Verdi has organized frequent strikes at Amazon in Germany since May 2013 to press demands for the retailer to raise pay for warehouse workers in accordance with collective bargaining agreements in Germany 's mail order and retail industry .
Earlier on Tuesday , Andrea Nahles , the leader of Germany 's Social Democrats , the junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel 's government , also hit out at Amazon , calling it a `` world champion in tax evasion '' and criticizing warehouse working conditions . `` That should not earn a prize , '' Nahles said .
Amazon has repeatedly rejected Verdi 's demands , saying it believes warehouse staff should be paid in line with competitors in the logistics sector , not as retail staff .

An Amazon spokesman said on Tuesday : `` Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace for thousands of people across Germany with competitive pay and benefits from day one . ''
Germany is Amazon 's second-biggest market after the United States and last year launched deliveries of fresh groceries in Berlin and neighboring Potsdam for members of its Prime subscription service .

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort arrives at federal court in Washington , Dec. 11 , 2017 . ( Photo : Susan Walsh / AP )
Washington — A federal judge is warning President Donald Trump 's former campaign chairman that he should n't be trying his case in the press . That includes drafting opinion essays published in other countries .
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Paul Manafort that his editing of an op-ed that appeared in an English-language newspaper in Ukraine is not something she is going to tolerate .
The judge 's warning came after special counsel Robert Mueller 's prosecutors discovered that Manafort edited an op-ed published in the Kyiv Post last week . The article appeared under the name of a former Ukraine official . It discussed Manafort 's consulting work in Ukraine , which is at the heart of the case against him .
The judge has barred Manafort and the prosecution from making public statements about his case .

All quiet on the southern front .
For years , while North Korea blasts propaganda about the joys of communism and the terrors of capitalism , the high-decibel loudspeakers on the South Korean side of the border have been blaring K-pop music into the demilitarized zone . But yesterday , ahead of a summit between the divided nations on Friday , the loudspeakers have fallen silent as South Korea ceases its sonic assault .
“ The Ministry Of National Defense halted the loudspeaker broadcasts against North Korea in the vicinity of the military demarcation line , ” the ministry said in a statement . The move is aimed at “ reducing military tensions between the South and North and creating a mood for peaceful talks ” later this week .
Although South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo did not formally notify North Korea of the decision , USA Today reports that North Korea has also begun silencing its loudspeakers along the border in response .
South Korean President Moon Jae-in is set to meet with North Korea 's Kim Jong-un on Friday on the southern side of the border village Panmunjom . This will be only the third top-level summit between the two countries following meetings in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007 .
In addition to K-pop , South Korea 's loudspeakers broadcast messages denouncing hunger and human rights violations in the North and emphasizing the high standard of living in the South in hopes of convincing soldiers to defect .
It has been a very rough couple of years for celebrity deaths . Back in February , beloved character actor Bill Paxton passed away at the age of 61 due to complications following a heart surgery . Paxton had a massive career , but some of his most beloved and well-known roles came when he worked with director James Cameron . Now , the director has opened up and reflected upon his work and his friendship with the late Bill Paxton .
The director spoke with Yahoo in honor of the upcoming 3D release of Terminator 2 : Judgement Day , which is set to hit theaters on August 25 . During the chat , James Cameron spoke quite a bit about his relationship with Bill Paxton and how he was as an artist and lover of art in general . Here 's some of what he had to say .
`` He was a consummate artist , really . He really , he loved art . And by art I mean , you know , he was a collector of art and he had a deep appreciation for art , culture , literature . He was unique , you know , and he certainly broke the mold . He had a real , it was , he had just a zest for life and for creativity . He was always thinking about the next project and the next project . And he had this amazing ability to just get people to want to do the thing that he wanted to do , the thing that he wanted to make . But when he worked for me as an actor , he also , although he brought so many ideas that enriched the film around his character , he also was there to do his character . He was n't there to try and direct my movie , you know . ''
Bill Paxton first worked with James Cameron on The Terminator . His role was n't big , but Paxton played one of the punks that Arnold Schwarzenegger 's T-800 encounters early on in the movie . He also starred as Simon in the very underrated True Lies and Brock Lovett in the Oscar-winning Titanic , which remains the second highest-grossing movie of all-time . It is probably his work as Private Hudson in Aliens , which spawned the now very famous `` Game over , man '' line that will be his most well-remembered work with Cameron . However , as the director reveals in the interview , they became friends before they ever worked together in an official capacity .
`` And we were just , we became fast friends in 1981 , I think , when we were both working for Roger Corman . And you know , we were friends until the , I do n't want to say the day he died , but the night before he went in for surgery that went wrong , I talked to him that night , you know . So yeah , he 's just a dear , dear friend and a great artist . ''
The friendship between Bill Paxton and James Cameron lasted for nearly four decades and extended far beyond their professional relationship . But their professional relationship was incredibly special and gave movie lovers some truly memorable moments and characters that are going to live on for a very long time . It is clear that Cameron has a lot of love and respect for his late friend and an actor that many of us adored .
At JFK restaurant AeroNuova , server Jose Vasquez asked : “ Going to Savannah ? Why ? ” Answer : “ Because it 's there , and I 've never been there . ”
So I went , and it rained my whole three days .
Do Savannah River 's open-air riverboat cruise in the downpour ? No . Walking the town 's 24 famous park squares while wet ? Naah . Dolphin tours in the downpour ? Nyet . Wading mud puddles to go shopping ? Uh-uh . Get close and personal with wolves , alligators , wildcats , bison , owls and eagles in the damp Wildlife Center ? Please . Stroll open-air walkways ? Yeah , you first .
And , suddenly , tuna with mayo was my idea of deep-sea fishing .
My chauffeur picked me up in his truck . His optometrist wife drove an Uber off-hours . Gangs work a part of town so another lady driver who also hustled homemade gifts was “ carrying . ”
Begun 1733 , after King George sent over a ship , this historic city is where Ben Franklin walked , Gen. Sherman stayed and Andrew Jackson 's Sec ' y of State lived . Where Eli Whitney cranked out the cotton gin . Where SS Savannah , first steamship to cross the Atlantic , was built . Site of Martin Luther King Jr. 's “ I Have a Dream ” speech . Where Paula Deen 's 200 borrowed bucks opened her first sandwich shop . And Robert Louis Stevenson wrote whatever .
It 's where “ Forrest Gump ” filmed , and Miley Cyrus shot 2010 's “ The Last Song. ” Where Justice Clarence Thomas , Johnny Mercer and his grandpa were born . Anciently , it banned lawyers . Nobody knows why , but clearly they knew something .
In '97 , Kevin Spacey filmed Clint Eastwood 's “ Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil ” locally , so guides showed the black-and-white house in which Spacey lived . They do not feel they 'll be expecting him again shortly
A taste of the city
The welcoming city is gracious . Friendly . I admired hotel clerk Jasmine 's hair bow . She gave it to me .
Its River Street 's cobblestones date to the 1700s . It 's comfort food , bakeries , sweet shops . Eating 's gorgeous . Grits in heavy cream , buttermilk biscuits , corn muffins , shrimp , oysters , fish , thick soups , fried green tomatoes , chardonnay butter sauce , fried everything . The nearest anorexic 's in Utah .
Places to go on your visit
One watering hole 's named 22 Square . Another 's Foxy Loxy Cafe . House of Strut . The Vicar 's Wife . Coffee Fox . Flying Monk Noodle Bar . Its superhot Olde Pink House predates the Revolution . Oreo cheesecake is a snack .
Another place advertises 150 flavors of popcorn .
City Market does art galleries . The Historic District and main drag 's Broughton Street hustle antiques , some with shaky parts . Much is under a corner , behind a rotted door or up a rickety stair . It 's either walk carefully or lose one of your own shaky parts .
Into the spirit
The book “ Savannah : A Southern Journey ” describes its scary side . Ghosts , goblins and creepy underground where un-nice pirates did what un-nice pirates do . Supposedly , below ancient wooden floorboards is where bad-boy Bluebeard did his bad-boying in an old tunnel under what 's called the Pirates ' House restaurant .
Arriving Feb. 23 , 1733 , at something called Yamacraw Bluff on the first shipload to pull in , Savannah 's founder Gen. James Oglethorpe negotiated with the area 's Native American chiefs , and it is Jimmy who laid out the town .
When it rains …
Since it rained my whole damn three days , no idea what the city 's like dry . However , few of its citizens look like they ever went dry . I 've seen Siberia , China , the Outback , the Congo , the Sahara , the Galápagos , the Arctic , the Equator — but time now to see America first .
Only , for me , it 's only in New York , kids , only in New York .

The league last month cited an independent study it said found that more than 400 claims had been recommended for denial based on evidence of fraud by attorneys , doctors and former players .
Plaintiffs ' lawyers contend the league is not awarding settlement funds fast enough . So far , $ 227 million in claims have been awarded .
The league says attempts to scam the system are responsible for delays . The NFL has asked that the investigator be granted subpoena power .
League officials say a special investigator would help ensure the integrity of the settlement .
Arguments are scheduled for Wednesday .

Though she has no regrets , Kim Zolciak would have handled certain scenarios differently during her time on “ The Real Housewives of Atlanta . ”
“ I never really felt like I was , I do n't want to say portrayed , because it 's life and it is what it is , because kind of the first two seasons of ‘ Housewives , ' the Big Poppa situation and that foolishness , just the way it was portrayed and the smoking cigarettes , all that foolishness was so extra . I would definitely smoke when I drank a glass of wine and it was like , ‘ Oh my God , does this girl ever not drink and smoke cigarettes ? ' It was kind of a little bit extra , ” the “ Do n't Be Tardy ” star recently told Page Six .
Long before Zolciak , 39 , wed her husband of nearly six years , Kroy Biermann , the mother of six was linked to mystery suitor “ Big Poppa , ” who became a fixture on the early seasons of “ Housewives. ” Though the exes have n't stayed in touch , she 's happy where the road has taken her — which includes another stop on the Atlanta franchise of the reality show .
“ I look back on everything and I really honestly do n't have any regrets because it all has gotten me to where I am today , and filming ‘ Housewives ' and ‘ Do n't Be Tardy ' are two totally different things , ” she added . “ I do n't have any regrets , honestly . Or I wish that I did n't look like I was a chain-smoking , wine-drinking crazy lady . ”
With “ Do n't Be Tardy ” returning for a sixth season , the Biermann clan is still reeling following a frightening incident earlier this year , when 4-year-old son Kash was attacked by a dog .
“ He 's doing fantastic . It 's a healing process , it still is a healing process , believe it or not . He 's doing really great , ” Zolciak shared .
Kash was bitten on the face , requiring surgery . Zolciak confirmed her son 's eye had not been harmed in the attack .
“ He 's definitely a trouper , he 's definitely my tough one out of all of them . ”
“ Do n't Be Tardy ” premieres Friday , Oct. 6 , at 8 p.m. on Bravo .

`` We 're glad that a Russian citizen is alive , '' the ministry said , but added that `` now the true motives are beginning to be revealed for this staging , which is totally obviously yet another anti-Russian provocation . ''
Babchenko , a dissident journalist who was reported murdered in Kiev , dramatically reappeared alive on Wednesday in the middle of a briefing by Ukrainian security officials about his own killing . He said had been part of a special Ukrainian operation to thwart a Russian attempt on his life .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Washington Post is reporting that Special Counsel Robert Mueller ‘ s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election is now examining whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice .
Accusations of obstruction arose when last month when Trump fired FBI Director James Comey . Comey testified in a Senate hearing last week that he believed he was fired “ because of the Russia investigation . ”
Comey also testified he had told Trump he was not under investigation .
Mark Corallo , a spokesman for Trump 's personal lawyer , responded Wednesday evening to the Post report by saying , “ The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous , inexcusable and illegal . ”

Eight-times grand slam champion Andre Agassi is open to a return to coaching despite the challenges he faced in the role while guiding Serbia 's Novak Djokovic last year.Agassi took on his first coaching role last May , when he joined Djokovic 's team as head coach , but the duo split in March as the 12-time grand slam winner struggled to recover after undergoing elbow surgery.The American former world number one , who retired in 2006 , said his first steps into coaching were `` challenging , interesting and educational '' . `` When I played I never felt pressure but a lot of stress . As a coach I never felt stress but a lot of pressure so that was an interesting difference , '' Agassi told Britain 's The Telegraph newspaper . `` As a coach you have to make sure you 're saying the right thing at the right time or not saying the wrong thing at the wrong time - there was a lot of pressure to it . `` The 48-year-old did not rule out working with Djokovic again despite the Serb reuniting with his long-time coach Marian Vajda . `` If there are ways that I could help him ( Novak Djokovic ) , he 'd have to let me know , '' Agassi added.Agassi , a Wimbledon champion in 1992 , expressed his willingness to coach anyone who needed it but was unsure about Australian maverick Nick Kyrgios . `` Would I help someone if I could help someone ? Of course I would , '' Agassi said . `` What I think of him ( Kyrgios ) and his ability and upsides are different to saying you could work with him . You do n't know if somebody wants to be worked with . ''

Edmonton is growing its cargo business thanks to a deal that has an international network increasing its reach .
Nippon Cargo Airlines ( NCA ) has brought Edmonton in as a Canadian destination , thanks to an alignment with Atlas Air . It was first reported in the trade publication The Load Star .
It 's reporting that the Japanese carrier is routing one of its Chicago-Tokyo flights over Edmonton instead of Anchorage to set it up so the airline can pick up cargo for its home market from Alberta .
“ It 's a developing business . We 're at the early stages but it is really exciting to be given the opportunity to work with a carrier of this stature , ” confirmed Alex Lowe , the cargo manager with the Edmonton International Airport ( EIA ) .
“ It presents a nice concept for NCA to get some cargo in a place where they had to get fuel anyway , ” Lowe said .
“ Certainly it allows the shipping community and the freight boarding community another option to get their goods from Edmonton to Asia . ”
A prime product that they ca n't get enough of in Japan , is Alberta pork . But that 's not all , according to Lowe .
“ We also have some fresh fruit and cherries that have been exported to date . They also are interested in some of the local manufactured goods , machine products , oil and gas exports , that type of thing . ”

EIA is concentrating on not only expanding air passenger traffic , which hit 7.5 million in 2016 , but also last year saw the seventh straight year of volume growth in the cargo side of the business .
It 's something Mayors Greg Krischke , John Whaley and Don Iveson talked about when the annexation agreement between Edmonton and Leduc County was finalized .
“ It 's consistent with that strategy and cargo does deliver economic benefits to the entire shipping community in the region and the exporters who are looking to roll their business into international markets , air cargo provides an excellent means to do that , ” Lowe said .

As for potential , Lowe was hesitant to speculate about what might be now that Canada is once again talking about trade talks in the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , but he does see the possibilities .
“ Depending on where this business evolves to , absolutely in the future , but in the moment it would be a little bit premature to link it to TPP . At the moment they [ NCA ] are serving current market needs . But definitely certainly into the future depending on what happens with TPP it could further strengthen the initative . ”
The agreement NCA struck with Atlas Air happened in December . Edmonton became the second North American stopping off point between Chicago and Tokyo . Seattle is the other one .

LONDON : The largest British audience for a live sporting event since the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics watched England 's dramatic penalty shootout with Colombia as Gareth Southgate 's team reached the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2006 .
English commercial broadcaster ITV - who share the live rights with BBC - said 23.6 million viewers tuned in for five minutes of the shootout in Moscow whilst an average of 20.1 million watched the game in its entirety .

According to ITV 's figures , the most-watched single minute of Tuesday 's game was 9.52pm ( 2052 GMT ) , when 24.4 million people tuned in .
At this point roughly four in five people watching TV in the United Kingdom ( 81 per cent ) were tuned to ITV .
The 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony on the BBC drew 26.3 million television viewers .
Tuesday 's match fell some way short of two other World Cup matches involving England , both of which went to penalties with the English losing out on both occasions .

The record average audience in the United Kingdom in the past 30 years is the 26.2 million who watched England 's semi-final against West Germany in 1990 - fractionally higher than the 26 million who turned on for England 's second round match with Argentina in the 1998 World Cup .
However , those figures will come under serious threat when BBC show England 's quarter-final with Sweden on Saturday in Samara with the kick-off at 1400 GMT .
The record audience for a live event of any kind in the past 25 years is the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997 , which attracted 32 million spectators .

SYDNEY : Alastair Cook has `` no idea '' when he will be retiring and is completely focused on beating Australia in his 150th test this week to keep the Ashes series alive , the former England captain said on Tuesday .
Cook , England 's most prolific test run scorer , has made 62 runs in four innings as the tourists have gone 2-0 down in the five-match series and some former players turned pundits have suggested he might be about to call time on his career .
`` I have n't made any decision on anything . All my focus is on this game , the biggest of our lives coming up , '' Cook said in Perth .
Cook captained England on their last Ashes tour Down Under when spinner Graeme Swann retired mid-series with the tourists 3-0 down and headed for a 5-0 whitewash .
Former Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson and England batsman Kevin Pietersen have suggested that Cook had the look of a man who might be ready to hang up his bat .
`` For the people who are saying that , they 've had no contact time with me , '' Cook , who is 33 later this month , said . `` They would n't know the extra nets I 've been doing behind closed doors .

`` I was with ( my batting coach ) yesterday for an hour-and-a-half in the morning , desperate to keep working on my game .
`` That 's probably not a guy who 's given in . To be honest with you , I have no idea ( when I 'll retire ) . And I 've said that since I gave up the captaincy . ''
The opener said retirement might not end up being his own choice if he continued to fail to make runs and said becoming the first England player to play 150 tests was `` quite special '' , especially as the last 147 have been consecutive .
Cook has enjoyed an Ashes triumph in Australia in 2010-11 as well as the 2013-14 debacle and said the current party would not fail for want of trying .
`` I will say this about this England side , I 've never seen a side a work as hard as this side , '' he said .
`` Win , lose or draw , whether we play well or we play rubbish , the effort from the guys is unbelievable . There 's a group of men in there , 16 or 17 of them , desperate to do well . ''

TULA , Russia : A Russian soccer fan leader jailed over clashes with England supporters at the 2016 European Championship said he and other fans had been warned by police against engaging in violence at the upcoming World Cup in Russia .
Sergei Gorbachev spent seven months in a Marseille jail over the clashes before Russia 's match against England at the tournament two years ago in France , where punches were thrown , bottles flung and smoke bombs detonated .

Russian authorities , hoping to expunge memories of the Marseille brawls , have pledged to curb violence at the World Cup , to be held from June 14 to July 15 in 11 Russian cities .
Gorbachev , who heads the supporters ' association of Arsenal Tula , a Russian Premier League club , said police regularly dropped in on fans known to authorities , even though they are not officially banned from attending sporting events .
He said he had also taken part in meetings with police in which fans were told not to engage in stadium violence .
`` The guys who are now in the fan world , they are feeling the effects of what the authorities are doing to ensure the World Cup is held without any trouble , including from the Russian fans , '' said the 35-year-old .

At a bar in Tula , an industrial city about 170 km ( 105 miles ) south of Moscow , Gorbachev is greeted by patrons and called the `` star of Marseille '' by the barman .
Speaking to Reuters , he said English fans travelling to Russia for the World Cup have nothing to fear - if they behaved themselves .
`` If they behave in a civilised way , I will shake their hand , '' added Gorbachev , who said he studied French and read the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky and Mikhail Bulgakov while serving his sentence at Marseille 's Baumettes prison .
`` I would want the same from them . I would n't want to see same attitude and behaviour I encountered in Marseille . ''
'POLICE EVERY 20 METRES '
In the run-up to the World Cup , Russia has increased fines for violent stadium behaviour . In some cases , fans are asked to make a written pledge that they will not organise or participate in fights .
A senior interior ministry official told Reuters there would be `` a policeman every 20 metres '' in host cities to prevent petty crime and drunken fights .
Officers have been told to pay special attention to English fans , who they fear could spark `` mass fights , riots and provocations , '' the official said .
Moscow and London have been exchanging information to prevent another Marseille scenario , with Russian authorities visiting England to watch soccer policing in action and British officials travelling to Russia to discuss tactics .
Gorbachev said he trusted that Russian police would crack down rapidly on any troublemakers . Russian fan groups , he said , would resist provocations and any calls for a Marseille rematch .
When asked if Russian fans could take matters into their own hands if they encountered violent behaviour from other groups , he shrugged .
`` I think our law enforcement will do their jobs , '' he said . `` It 's not just for me to serve a sentence in France under their laws . English ( who misbehave ) should serve time here under ours . ''
Gorbachev has yet to apply for a World Cup fan ID , a document needed to attend matches which proves that a ticket holder has been vetted by Russian authorities . He plans to do so in the coming days .
His name does not appear on an interior ministry blacklist that bars more than 400 people from attending sporting events , including for offences committed in Russia such as lighting flares and public drunkenness .
Reuters found this month that a blacklisted fan had been granted a World Cup fan ID , and that several other blacklisted fans had regularly skirted the ban .

Ash Vs . Evil Dead may have been canceled but the Evil Dead franchise itself is n't totally dead . Fans have been very upset since the series was axed by Starz , but quickly it became clear that the franchise , in some form or another , is going to continue . Unfortunately , it looked like whatever form that continuation takes , it 's going to be without Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams , as he announced his retirement from the character shortly after the cancellation . But now , the actor is teasing some new incarnations of Evil Dead that he may or may not be involved in .
Recently , Bruce Campbell was asked on Twitter if he would be open to possibly doing any motion capture or voice work on an Evil Dead video game . Campbell responded and , while not revealing too much , he made it clear that he knows what is going on with the franchise and did n't rule out the possibility of his involvement . Here 's what he had to say about it .
`` Fans are wonderfully nit-picky . I ca n't talk particulars yet , but I think fans will dig the upcoming incarnations . ''
What this means for sure is that there are new projects being worked on already . He did use the word incarnations , plural , which means we could have more than one thing in the works . Beyond that , the big question mark is whether or not Bruce Campbell will walk back his comments about retiring as Ash . Surely any Evil Dead project would at the very least have him as a consultant and likely a producer , but that does n't mean he has to do any work as Ash . But , this question was specifically addressing him playing Ash in a video game and he did n't say no . That should be just enough to give fans hope we may see at least a little more Ash in the future .
But what might this project be ? We know that an Ash vs . Evil Dead revival is all but off the table entirely without Bruce Campbell 's involvement . Fede Alvarez , who directed the Evil Dead remake , also recently teased his interest in finally doing a sequel via a Twitter poll , so that could finally be happening . We also know that Sam Raimi and producer Rob Tapert have been discussing what a new incarnation might be .
Beyond that , it is entirely possible a video game could happen , and let 's not rule out the possibility of some comic books . Whatever the case may be , it sounds like the franchise wo n't be gone for long and that multiple gears , possibly in multiple different mediums , are turning . It 's a world of possibilities , but do any of them involve Ash Williams ? We can only hope at this point , but there is at the very least a little reason to hold onto that hope . You can check out Bruce Campbell 's Twitter post for yourself below and speculate wildly in regards to what these new Evil Dead incarnations may be .

Attorney General launched legal bid to throw out attempt to haul Blair to court
Tory MP Jeremy Wright , the government 's top law officer , launched intervention
Judge ruled last year ex-Prime Minister had immunity from criminal prosecution
Britain 's top law officer has intervened to try to stop an attempt to haul Tony Blair to court over the Iraq War .
Attorney General Jeremy Wright has formally asked for the bid to prosecute Mr Blair to be rejected .
The private case is being brought by General Abdul-Wahid Shannan ar-Ribat , former chief of staff of the Iraqi army .
He wants the former Labour prime minister to be convicted of the crime of ‘ aggression ' for taking part , alongside the US , in the invasion of his country under the false pretext that Saddam Hussein 's regime harboured weapons of mass destruction .
Mr Ribat , who is now living in exile , also wants then foreign secretary Jack Straw and Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general at the time , to be tried in a British court .
A judge ruled last November that Mr Blair had ‘ immunity ' from criminal prosecution over the 2003 conflict and that any case could ‘ involve details being disclosed under the Official Secrets Act . '
Mr Ribat is now seeking a judicial review of district judge Michael Snow 's decision .
But Attorney General Mr Wright , a Tory MP , has formally asked to join future hearings and for the bid to prosecute to be rejected .

A new report suggests that Tom Cruise is in talks to play a stuntman in Quentin Tarantino 's new movie , which is reportedly about the year 1969 and everything that happened during this span of twelve months . The same report also claims that Tarantino is looking for an actor to portray Roman Polanski . The news comes after it was officially announced that Leonardo DiCaprio is joining the cast as a washed-up actor . In addition to Tom Cruise , Margot Robbie is also reportedly in talks to join the cast as Sharon Tate .
It was previously rumored that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were both in talks to play a prosecutor in Quentin Tarantino 's new movie , but apparently Pitt passed , and Cruise is in talks to join up as the stuntman , who is the friend and former stuntman of Leonardo DiCaprio 's washed-up actor character . The two land right in the middle of the hippy movement in Hollywood as they both try and get into the world of acting . It was first thought that the movie would center on the Manson Family murders , but Tarantino shot the idea down and said that they are a component of the movie .
The same report states that Quentin Tarantino is looking to cast a Polish actor to portray famous director and husband to Sharon Tate at the time of her murder , Roman Polanski . This new report suggests that the Manson Family murders may have more to do with the plot than the director let on . However , this is all speculation at this time since nothing has officially been announced . The Polanski character may not be that big of a part and it has not been confirmed that Tom Cruise has signed on to the project at this time .
Other details surrounding Quentin Tarantino 's newest project are few and far between . But , it does look like the director is up to some of his usual habits , which include stacking his movies with as many A-list actors as he can along with weaving different stories together . As previously noted , Tarantino is trying to get Margot Robbie to play Sharon Tate . Robbie has not worked with Tarantino , but she did work with Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street .
Quentin Tarantino 's new movie reportedly has a release date of August 9th , 2019 , which is the 50th anniversary of the death of Sharon Tate . For now , Leonardo DiCaprio is the only one officially onboard for the movie , but it certainly looks like Tom Cruise is close to joining . It will be interesting to see Tom Cruise playing the `` sidekick '' to DiCaprio 's character . It will also be interesting to see how big of a part that Roman Polanski 's character will have in the movie , since he was married to Tate at the time of her death . You can check out the original report about Tom Cruise 's character and addition of a Roman Polanski character via Justin Kroll 's Twitter account .
Social media juggernaut Facebook has removed the social group that was organized to sabotage Black Panther and it 's Rotten Tomatoes audience score . The group is the same one claiming responsibility for tanking The Last Jedi 's Rotten Tomatoes score , which was pretty successful if we 're to believe them and not Rotten Tomatoes , who claim there was no site tampering . Controversy began to spread when one of the members bragged on another site that they were responsible for the poor user scores for the latest Star Wars movie . The group decided that they were going to do the same with all upcoming Disney releases .
The Down With Disney 's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys group was removed by Facebook today after it gained national attention . The page was reportedly started by a self-proclaimed member of the alt-right , who did not agree with the way the DCEU gets treated in the press when compared to Marvel and Disney projects . The group started an online event for its followers to take over Rotten Tomatoes user score section and flood Black Panther with negative reviews , which gained over 4,000 people .
On the event page , the leader of the group posted a manifesto of sorts and took time to pat himself on the back for the successful attack on The Last Jedi . The statement on the event page says that Disney 's business practices are part of the reason why the DCEU gets such bad press . In addition , the page claims that Disney pays off critics . You can read the statement in full below .
`` Given the massive success of the audience review rigging on the Rotten Tomatoes site for Star Wars : The Last Jedi , and due to the sudden rise in those disgruntled with Disney business practices among other factors especially due to the corporate manipulations which created falsified bad press for the DCEU , I feel that it 's time to strike back at all those under Disney and bring down the house of mouse 's actions for paying off the critics that hurt DC Comics on film and for other parties affected by them . I 'll be making events like this for Infinity War and the Netflix shows etc so we can rally together to truly make a difference . Share this with your friends and all potential sympathizers . ''
Black Panther director Ryan Coogler was asked about the plan to sabotage the user ratings and he revealed that it did n't bother him . Instead , he insisted that he wanted as many people as possible from different backgrounds to see the movie . Additionally , Rotten Tomatoes released a statement saying that they would block any reviews with `` hate speech , '' but there 's really nothing the site can do with people logging on to write negative reviews .
In the end , it does n't matter since the Down With Disney group was taken down by Facebook . However , the group will more than likely be pretty angry that they were shut down and will head over to Reddit or 4chan to continue their campaign to publicly trash anything Disney related . While reviews are n't the deciding factor for everybody when they go see movies , the negative user scores compared to critical praise does begin to add up and add to controversy .

LIEGE , Belgium/BRUSSELS : Belgian authorities faced questions on Wednesday over why a prison inmate , suspected of links to radical Islamists in jail , was let out for a day , enabling him to carry out what police called a `` terrorist attack '' in the city of Liege .
The justice minister , who oversees the prison service , said he felt `` responsible '' for Tuesday 's bloodshed in which two policewomen and a bystander were killed . The attacker was shot dead by police at a nearby school shortly afterward .

Interior Minister Jan Jambon said authorities were still examining the motives of Benjamin Herman , a 31-year-old Belgian drug dealer who had been in jail for years but was let out for two days on Monday to prepare for an eventual release in 2020 .
Herman had shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' , the Muslim affirmation of faith , during his attack and he had had contact with Islamist radicals in jail in 2016 and early 2017 .
He also appeared to have followed online exhortations from Islamic State to stab police officers and use their service weapons to shoot others , prosecutors said .
A school cleaning woman who found herself `` nose to face with the killer '' told public broadcaster RTBF that he spared her because she was Muslim .

While he briefly held her hostage , he told her he wanted the police to `` writhe ; I want to make them stew . ''
Justice Minister Koen Geens told RTBF radio he was having pangs of conscience over whether the man should have been allowed furlough .
Still reeling from the attack , residents of Belgium 's third biggest city lay flowers and candles at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday , and officials held a moment of silence .
`` We had all of the little ones from the high school who were evacuated , '' said an emotional nursery school teacher , Joelle Chalon . `` I walk this way to work every day . ''
Authorities praised the quick-wittedness of the cafe owner outside whose bar Herman had killed the two policewomen , aged 54 and 44 . By the time the killer , wielding two police pistols , came in looking for more victims , the cafe proprietor had got all of his customers into hiding .
Jambon described Herman as a psychologically unstable man who might have been on drugs , pointing to his murder of an acquaintance 50 km ( 30 miles ) away on Monday night .
`` There are signs he was radicalised in prison but is it that radicalisation which drove him to commit these acts ? '' Jambon said , adding that although Herman was flagged up in security reports in 2016 and early 2017 , he had been a fringe figure .
Unlike the aftermath of previous suspected `` lone wolf '' militant attacks in Europe , there has been no claim of responsibility by Islamic State .
JAIL TO JIHAD ?
In and out of jail for a variety of crimes since 2003 , Herman may have found a path to violence that has heightened concerns that Europe 's prisons are incubators for jihadism .
It was the fourteenth time since his detention that he was granted temporary leave , Geens said . `` Everyone in Belgium is asking the same question : how is it possible that someone convicted of such serious acts was allowed to leave prisons ? '' Deputy Prime Minister Alexander de Croo was quoted as saying .
The national crisis centre , on high alert since a Brussels-based Islamic State cell helped kill 130 people in Paris in 2015 , did not raise its alert level , indicating no follow-up attacks were expected .
`` I think it was just one individual who completely snapped , '' said Pieter Van Ostaeyen , a specialist on jihadism . `` I do n't think it was an organised attack . ''
Convicts have been behind several Islamist militant attacks in Europe . In Belgium , around 450 prisoners are deemed radical , including 46 that are seen as a threat of radicalising others , according to lawmaker George Dallemagne , who sits on several Belgian parliamentary security committees .
`` We have a tragic experience in Belgium , with people entering prison as petty criminals and leaving as terrorists , '' he told Reuters .

The waning influence of the newspapers has been exposed for all to see
Here are five thoughts I had while watching the election results last night and this morning .
1 . The Conservative Party 's coronation of Theresa May as their leader last summer looks , with hindsight , to have been a mistake . Mrs May only had to win over her fellow MPs and not party members . She did not have to do any debates or unpredictable public appearances . Had she done so , her weakness in this area may have been exposed . Or , if you prefer , her experience of a months long leadership campaign against Andrea Leadsome might have made her a more confident campaigner in 2017 .
2 . By contrast , the perennial leadership contests faced by Jeremy Corbyn were good for his general election campaign . He and his supporters have been organising rallies and practicising social media mobilisation for the past two summers . And many of the criticisms thrown at him during this recent campaign were aired during the contests in 2015 and 2016 .
3 . The waning influence of the newspapers has been exposed for all to see . I felt this to be the case during the election campaign of 2010 : the newspapers launched an incongruous attack on Nick Clegg , which did not appear to stop the Liberal Democrat surge . In 2017 , the tabloids unleashed pages upon pages of attacks against Mr Corbyn past , policies and personalities . The public appears to have ignored this blatant attempt by the newspaper barons to influence the election in their favour .
One of the important things here is that the disgraceful tabloid newspapers are n't controlling the narrative – a victory in itself # GE2017 — Imogen Tyler ( @ DrImogenTyler ) June 9 , 2017
The British right wing press led a vicious campaign of lies , smears , hatred and bigotry . And millions told them where to stick it — Owen Jones ( @ OwenJones84 ) June 9 , 2017
4 . The terrorists do not appear to have influenced the election . Our country suffered two dispicable terrorist attacks during the course of the election campaign . These attacks were designed to cause chaos , to distract us from the democratic business at hand , and to provoke an illiberal backlash . The party that stooped to this bait—Theresa May 's Conservative's—lost seats .
5 . Our human rights protections look a little more secure . The Conservative Party manifesto sought to tee up an attack on our human rights framework . It suggested that the Human Rights Act would be repealed after Brexit was completed , and that withdrawl from the ECHR could happen in a future parliament . And then , following the London Bridge terror attacks , Theresa May said she was willing to rip up inconvenient human rights laws . Doing this now would require a parliamentary majority and a pile of political capital that Mrs May simply does not hold .

SINGAPORE : Defending SEA Games marathon champion Soh Rui Yong was given a formal warning by the Singapore National Olympic Council ( SNOC ) after `` repeatedly '' breaching a rule that prohibits Team Singapore athletes from promoting their personal sponsors during the Games .
The rule is in effect from Aug 5 to Sep 5 , which covers the duration of the upcoming SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur , and the immediate period before and after .
Soh had apologised after meeting SNOC officials last Thursday over the sponsorship row , which involved posts on his Facebook page alluding to his sponsors . He also edited a post and took down another that infringed the blackout rule .
On Friday , Soh shared a Facebook post by sponsor H-Two-O cheering him on at the SEA Games , and added a comment thanking the company for its well wishes .
On Saturday , he posted a screenshot of a social media comment that called for a `` partial relaxation '' of the blackout rule . `` I 'm not the only one who knows that # WeNeedChange , '' Soh wrote .
In a statement on Monday ( Aug 14 ) , SNOC secretary-general Chris Chan said that Soh had `` reneged on his promises '' to remove Facebook posts that infringed on the rule against promoting sponsors during the blackout period .

Chan added that Soh had `` repeatedly breached the team membership agreement '' .
`` Despite many reminders and our constant guidance offered to him , he has not fully complied . ''
As a result of the breaches , Toh Boon Yi , the co-chairman of the Major Games Preparation Committee - which has been administrating and managing the SEA Games 2017 athletics team since June , met Soh on Monday and issued him a formal warning , advising him to cease the infringements .
`` Failing which , disciplinary proceedings will follow accordingly , '' said Chan .
He added that Soh has agreed to comply from now on .
As of Monday night , the H-Two-O post was no longer visible on Soh 's Facebook timeline .
`` Representing Singapore at the major Games is a privilege which many athletes hope for , but also one that must be treated with utmost respect and responsibility on the part of an athlete , '' Chan said .
`` As representatives and ambassadors of the country , there is a code of conduct which athletes and officials have to abide to . There is no exception to this . ''
Chan added that he hoped Soh would `` focus on his preparations seriously and cooperate with the officials to get ready for the SEA Games '' .
Singles tennis has for long been considered a young player 's sport , especially in the men 's draw . In the Open Era , with the advent of professionals competing at the Grand Slams , the peak age for player performance had hovered between the 24 to 28 year age-mark .
While this would have been true even five years back , a few players have recently made this theory fall flat on its face . Rafael Nadal is the sport 's oldest No 1 , and Roger Federer has won three of the last five Grand Slam titles , and has a very realistic chance of usurping Nadal to become the sport 's oldest No 1 , by a hefty margin .
The `` Big Four '' of Nadal , Federer , Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have dominated the last decade or so and their competitors have shown little signs of slowing them down . While age will eventually catch up , and it 's showing already , the past decade ( 2008-17 ) has been era of daunting oligarchy at the top of the sport .
Women 's tennis , on the other hand , has had a very contrasting past decade . While the sport has historically been loaded at the top , with six players accounting for 50 percent of the Open Era Grand Slam titles ( compared to the top nine winners for men ) , the 10 years gone by have had a sense of anarchy as to how the sport and competition have evolved . With a rush of young blood coupled with late bloomers , Grand Slams , unlike the men 's draw , have typically not had pre-ordained gatekeepers . We evaluate the last decade of competition at the top of the sport across the two genders here .
No 1s , Grand Slam winners and finalists
Only four men have held ATP 's top ranking in this period : Federer , Nadal , Djokovic and Murray . They also account for 35 of the 40 Grand Slam titles in this period . The WTA rankings paint a totally different picture on the other hand . There have been 13 WTA World No 1s in the same period , more than three times the number for men . This , despite Serena Williams having an Open Era record-equaling streak of 186 continuous weeks at the top .
Outside the Big Four of men 's tennis , there have been three other Grand Slam winners , taking the total of men 's singles Grand Slam champions from 2008-17 to seven . The women 's draw has been way more competitive , with more than two times the numbers of winners , at 17 . It 's not just true for the champions though , while there have been 15 male Grand Slam finalists , the number for women 's singles stands even taller at 32 .
The age of the field
While the sport has historically favoured the young and peaking over the mature and waning , the current crop at the top of men 's tennis is an anomaly . The median age of the top-10 men ( as of 29 January ) , is 26.5 with the oldest 1-2 duo ever . This age increases further as you go down to the top-32 ( the typical seeds ) , standing at a median of 29 . Fourteen out of the top-32 players are aged 30 and over .
On the women 's side , the numbers are more coherent with other individual , physically-demanding sports , as the median age for the top 10 is 24.5 and rises to 26 for the top-32 . Compared to the 14 men , only nine women in the top-32 are aged 30 or over .
Grand Slam winners seed distribution
A seeded tournament bracket is designed to have a first vs second seed summit clash , at least theoretically speaking . What this essentially means is that the odds of the eventual winner being a top-two seed are high , thereby implying that the path to victory for lower seeds is that much more difficult . Given the protection the 32 seeds have in the first two rounds of Grand Slams , wherein no two seeded players can clash before the third round , the occurrence of unseeded Grand Slam Champions is almost mythical in nature .
However , there will always be anomalies , especially given the rather surprising nature of women 's tennis over the past decade . We have broken down the winners of the last 40 Grand Slams by their tournament seeds for both men 's and women 's draws , and the results are as contrasting as they can practically be . The brackets are seeds 1 and 2 , seeds 3-5 , 6-10 , 11-32 and unseeded .
While the top two men 's seeds have accounted for 27 of the 40 Grand Slams , the number on the women 's side is much lower , at 17 . The other end of the spectrum is even more contrasting ; only two men not seeded in the top-10 have won a Grand Slam ( one of them being Federer , seeded 17 at last year 's Australian Open ) , while in the women 's draw , there have been seven such occurrences , including three unseeded champions ( including a wildcard entry for Kim Clijsters coming out of temporary retirement ) . Jelena Ostapenko , ranked 45th , and 83rd-ranked Sloane Stephens winning Grand Slams truly epitomises the volatility and the X-factor of women 's tennis : its depth !
The usual result can often be boring and the underdog story is always refreshing , and that has been the contrast in nature of men 's and women 's tennis over the last 10 years . The men 's draw usually presented a question of who among the Big Four would play the final , and the early rounds inherently felt like an official formality . The women 's draw posted more intriguing questions : ‘ who will it be ' ; ‘ will she even make it this far ' ; ‘ how long can this young girl keep streaking ? ' and so on .
Call it whatever you may , after a certain stage , oligarchy is overwhelming and anarchy can be nerve-wrecking and still fun !
The Kootenay Columbia region is receiving $ 625,097 in federal assistance for summer jobs due to advocacy from MP Wayne Sttetski .
The funding , part of the Canada Summer Jobs initiative , contributes the funding to help create jobs for secondary and post-secondary students .
Stetski says the funding helps bolster local economies , and he takes an active role in establishing priorities beneficial to the riding and allocating the funds accordingly , which are supporting 151 projects throughout the region . Stetski also requested additional funds if they become available .
“ I prioritized funding for as many as 210 student jobs in the riding and gave particular consideration to communities with low rates of youth employment , ” said Stetski .
He also emphasized that the program also is about helping young people to acquire valuable experience and workplace skills .
“ I assessed each employer on the quality of the project proposed and the experience offered to the student , not on the values of the organization . I remain hopeful that in 2019 the Liberal government will take this view and drop their controversial requirement for an attestation as to the applicant 's mandate , ” added the MP .

ISLAMABAD - Capt ( r ) Muhammad Safdar , the son-in-law of ousted premier Nawaz Sharif , on Tuesday recorded his statement before the accountability court in the Avenfield reference , saying he was gratuitously dragged into the Panama Papers case “ despite no specific orders were issued by the Supreme Court to implicate him ” .
At the same time , he also expressed his serious reservations over the formation of the Joint Investigation Team ( JIT ) that probed the Panama Papers case against the Sharif family .
He was recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code ( CrPC ) in a case related to London properties , which is one of three references filed by the National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) against the Sharif family . He had been named in the reference along with Nawaz Sharif , wife Maryam Nawaz and his brothers-in-law , Hassan and Hussain Nawaz .
He objected to the induction of two military officers , Brig ( r ) Numan Saeed from the Inter-Services Intelligence and Brig Kamran Khursheed from the Military Intelligence . Terming it inappropriate , he also expressed his concerns over rest of the JIT members , repeating the stance of Sharif and Maryam Nawaz .
“ I and my wife were not one of the respondents who were directed to associate themselves with the investigation by the JIT in the order of Supreme Court , ” he said alleging that the JIT team implicated him and his wife unnecessarily in the case .
He told the court that he was treated like a ‘ prisoner of war ' by the JIT .
During his testimony , Capt ( r ) Safdar avoided to directly answer several questions asked by the court , claiming that they were not related to him .
He also distanced himself from the Gulf Steel Mills , its sales and subsequent investment of the sale proceeds with the Qatari royal family and stated that he was not directly involved in these transactions and agreements .
Responding to a question , he stated that it was a known fact that late Mian Muhammad Sharif had been looking after the whole family and providing for their expenses even on a per-month basis .
When accountability judge Mohammad Bashir inquired if he was present at the time of a speech delivered by Sharif in the National Assembly last year following the release of the Panama Papers , his counsel Amjad Pervaiz said that his presence was not mandatory .
Capt ( r ) Safdar said that he could not remember the contents of each and every speech delivered in the NA . `` I can hardly recollect my own speeches , '' he told the court .
Earlier , when former premier and his daughter left the courtroom , Safdar alone recorded his testimony and no one from the party ranks remained left in the court to show solidarity with him . “ I can not make it possible to stand a few people behind you , ” NAB 's Deputy Prosecutor Afzal Qureshi passed sarcastic remarks about the episode , adding “ How unfortunate , that you are standing alone here ” .
Capt Safdar 's counsel Amjad Pervez intervened and restrained his client from unnecessary wrangling with the prosecution team .
Earlier , former prime minister Sharif once again stressed the need for constituting a ‘ national inquiry commission ' comprising officials and individuals of judiciary , establishment , parliament and civil society to keep everyone in check and hold accountable .
Informally talking to journalists inside the accountability court , he commented on a recently published co-authored book of Gen ( r ) Asad Durrani , saying , “ General Durrani has touched sensitive issues and a similar narrative had also been taken by Pervez Musharraf and Shahid Aziz in the past but no action was taken against them ” . He said that “ in this scenario holding an individual accountable for all misdeeds is not fair , the inquiry should be held against the entire network across the board to end all this mess once and for all ” . He said that holding an individual accountable will be a futile exercise , a mechanism should be devised to hold an inquiry against the entire apparatus and network .
He said an individual could not be held responsible for all the wrongdoings . He said that Gen ( r ) Durrani penned a controversial book , while Gen Musharraf and Shahid Aziz also fanned such controversies in the past . “ But now is the time that all these matters should be dug out once and for all and with consultation of all the stakeholders , the national inquiry commission should be formed to take all this mess to the logical conclusion , ” Sharif said adding that “ we can not sacrifice our people , we have to rescue our homeland for the future ” .
The deposed premier also lauded the selection of Justice ( r ) Nasirul Mulk as the caretaker prime minister . He said that Nasirul Mulk was a matchless personality and being the chief justice , his services were very appreciating . “ He is a respectable and honoured person and no one could raise finger at him and he was being held as respectful and honoured by everyone , ” he said .
Talking about the Punjab caretaker chief minister , Sharif said that Shehbaz Sharif had held consultation with him on the proposed names for the caretaker chief minister . He said that “ politicians are not as biased to drop the name of Nasir Khosa from the proposed list of the caretaker chief minister of Punjab for being the brother of Justice Asif Khosa .
Former “ Baywatch ” star Jeremy Jackson will head to prison as part of a plea deal he 's taken in his stabbing case , TMZ reports . The actor , who played Hobie , reportedly stabbed someone back in 2015 on the streets of Los Angeles .
According to TMZ , Jackson will spend 161 days behind bars . He reportedly agreed to a plea deal that outlined 270 days in the LA County Jail , but the judge gave him 109 days credit .
The star will also be required to take anger management courses , TMZ reports .
He was facing up to seven years behind bars .
The 34-year-old was arrested in 2005 for setting up a meth lab in his home . He has struggled with sobriety for years and in 2011 , appeared on “ Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. ” He was kicked out of “ Celebrity Big Brother UK ” after he exposed his castmate Chloe Goodman 's breasts on TV .
`` Bachelor in Paradise '' cast member Corinne Olympios is calling what happened June 4 during filming for the show in Mexico her `` worst nightmare . ''
A drunken sexual encounter between Olympios and DeMario Jackson shut down production on the summer series for an internal investigation after a producer filed a complaint alleging workplace misconduct .
“ I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened ... , '' Olympios said Wednesday in a statement released by publicist Stan Rosenfield , who also represents the likes of George Clooney and Robert De Niro and , for seven years , worked with Charlie Sheen .
`` Although I have little memory of that night , something bad obviously took place , which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production , '' Olympios ' statement continued .
What Warner Bros. referred to as `` misconduct '' has been described as a drunken encounter in which the two disrobed in the Playa Escondida pool and allegedly engaged in sexual acts that did n't include intercourse . A major issue is whether all parties were capable of granting consent to sexual contact .
Jackson — who was portrayed as a `` villain '' who already had a girlfriend during his recent stint on `` The Bachelorette '' — has been silent so far about what happened during filming except to tell TMZ on Tuesday , before Olympios ' statement came out , that he was `` all good '' with what she might be saying .
But a source close to him told People on Wednesday that he `` certainly is n't the man he 's being portrayed to be . It 's hard for his loved ones to sit and watch most of the slanderous accusations and comments from individuals who do n't know anything about who he is . ''
According to a source close to Olympios , she has not seen footage from the night in question .
`` As a woman , this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality , '' Olympios said . `` As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after , I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life , including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening . ''
Olympios has hired high-profile attorney Martin Singer , according to TMZ . Singer 's clients have included Sheen , Jim Carrey , a dozen A-list actresses whose photos were stolen from their phones and , until 2015 , Bill Cosby .
A veteran TV producer who has not worked on any shows in the `` Bachelor '' franchise spoke to Variety under condition of anonymity about the industry-standard release that is typically signed by reality-show contestants .
`` We 're talking about a document that is thick and weighty , that releases the production company and the network from almost every conceivable possibility . It is encompassing . I ca n't even think of enough words to describe how in-depth that release is .... , '' the producer said .
`` The language in the document basically outlines the fact that you will be presented with every type of environment , people , and compromising situations by volunteering to be on the show , '' the producer continued . `` Now , there is nothing in there that would constitute your willingness to be in an illegal act . ''
On Tuesday , `` Bachelor in Paradise '' host Chris Harrison issued a statement about the controversy .
“ There are a lot of competing details in the various press accounts of the incident . And there 's a lot of misinformation out there too , '' Harrison said . `` We urge everyone to be patient until the investigation is complete . ''

As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley delivered his final full Budget before the 2019 Union elections , the camera panned across the Lok Sabha . One quick glance counted just three women amid a sea of men ; there are only 64 women members of Parliament in the 543-member Lok Sabha . So when Jaitley repeated `` Madam '' , while addressing Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan , it seemed a little jarring .
But similar to the task of looking for women in a crowded Parliament is the task of looking for women in the 2018-19 Budget . There is no separate section or segment addressed at women , like in the 2017 Budget , which had made a separate allocation of Rs 1.86 lakh crore for various schemes for women and children across ministries . Or the 2016 Budget , which set Rs 1.56 lakh crore in 2016 .
This in itself is n't a problem as long as the Budget takes into account women 's needs . But as development economist Dr Jayati Ghosh , professor of Economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University , told The Ladies Finger , `` The government sees regressive roles of women in the society . ''
The Budget too seems to remain status quo-ist in that it assumes that it needs to ease the needs of women as per their current social roles . `` It uses a certain lens , '' says Dr Ratna Sudarshan , trustee and former director of the Institute of Social Studies Trust . `` It 's not a gender-blind Budget statement , but it recognised women in their present role : Women in the household , what can you do to make them better ? 'We want women to work ' is definitely an underlying idea but it does n't look at what prevents them from working and what are the challenges . It 's not looking at changing the pattern of development . It 's assuming that everyone 's ( all genders and demographics ) needs are the same but it 's definitely trying to bring women into the processes of economic growth that are already going on . ''
Despite this baseline criticism , some feminist economists think that overall , this year 's Budget is a positive one for women . The National Health Protection Scheme , the new healthcare insurance scheme announced by Jaitley , aimed at covering 10 crore vulnerable families ( which adds up to about 50 crore beneficiaries ) , stands out as a key step . This was announced as the `` world 's largest healthcare programme '' ; it will provide a health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per annum . The scale of the initiative makes it stand out . This is the new version of the Rashtriya Swasthya Suraksha Yojana ( RSSY ) , the renamed version of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana ( RSBY ) .
`` I think the idea of the insurance cover for the poverty households is a brilliant and meaningful proposal , '' says Padma Bhushan awardee , economist and writer Dr Devaki Jain . `` When women are ill , very often they are not treated as carefully as men in rural India , but with insurance now , they can go to any private hospital and get the best services because they 're covered . That will improve access to health and push for treatment for women even among the rural poor or the urban poor . ''
Dr Sudarshan said , `` The health insurance going up to Rs 5 lakh per household is a huge amount . If implemented properly , they wo n't just be particularly for women , but they 'll also make a huge difference . But I think equally important is the statement that there will be wellness and health centres . Now , the question of implementation is there because we do n't know what it 'll actually look like in practice , but to the extent that we 're recognising the need for distributing health facilities widely and close to the place of residence is a very important point . ''
But not everyone feels so positively about the healthcare scheme .
Dr Reetika Khera , who teaches Economics at IIT Delhi , said , `` If the new healthcare scheme is anything like the RSBY , then it 's hardly anything to cheer about , because studies show that RSBY did not reduce out of pocket expenditures for patients . Furthermore , insurance companies and private providers can inflate the costs of tests or procedures . In any case , what is required is not just tertiary care ; we need a much larger Budget for preventive healthcare as well . ''
However , the most condemning criticism comes from Dr Ghosh . `` Most of the promises made do n't have a budgetary allocation . The sheer audacity of this is alarming . That you can claim that so much will be spent and not put in budgetary allocations . So when you 're talking about health insurance for 50 crore people or this massive increase in SC/ST allocation or the huge increase in money spent on rural areas , most of them are n't backed up by the numbers . Instead , they 're putting most of this in extra-budgetary or non-budgetary sources . ''
According a report carried by the fact-checking website factchecker.in , there has only been a 2.7 percent increase in allocations to the health sector : From Rs 53,198 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 54,667 crore this year . In fact , spending on the health ministry has declined to 2.1 percent of the total Budget : From 2.4 percent in 2017-18 .
According to the National Health Policy , health expenditure should be 2.5 percent of the total GDP by 2025 . Given these numbers , it 's difficult to fathom how an expansion of the government health insurance scheme will take place when overall spending has reduced .
Aside from the scheme , she added , `` They 've cut money on the National Health Mission , which is what employs the ASHAs ( Accredited Social Health Activists , who are community health workers working for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ) . There is also very little increase on the Integrated Child Development Services which is for the anganwadis and so on . ''
There has been a 2.1 percent decline in the allocation for the National Health Mission .
Digging deeper to locate women in the Budget narrative , one wonders how the allocations announced for micro , small and medium industries ( MSMEs ) are likely to affect women . The finance minister allocated Rs 3,794 crore for credit support , capital and interest subsidy to MSMEs . Last year , the Budget had included tax sops to MSMEs to make them more viable . It reduced tax to 25 percent for companies with an annual revenue of up to Rs 50 crore . This year , the Budget proposed the cutting of corporate tax to 25 percent for companies with an annual revenue of up to Rs 250 crore .
`` Now small and medium scale industries , as you go further down the line , are the ones that employ women . It 's the self-employed women , self-help groups . All these people are under great stress as they do n't get enough credit . Ninety percent of India 's GDP and 95 percent of employees in India come from the small industries , and they ( the government ) is normally pampering the rich . So this is an interesting variation from the normal , '' Dr Jain said .
Sanitation is also a huge issue for women , especially in the rural sectors , and as Dr Sudarshan pointed out , `` We do n't know how much the investment into 'Swachh Bharat ' is leading to behaviour change . There is different feedback that one gets from the field , but nonetheless , toilets do make a very huge difference to women 's health . ''
But even as the digging around finds certain potential for positive movement in women 's lives , other not-so-positive developments make themselves known . `` The Budget for maternity entitlements has actually been reduced . I 'm guessing that 's because last year 's Budget was more or less left unutilised . The required commitment from the Centre is Rs 8,000 crore , while the Budget this year is Rs 2,400 crore . So , even if all of last year 's pending funds are added , it 's still only Rs 5,000 crore , which is still too little , '' Dr Khera said .
Dr Ghosh pointed out that some of the schemes have not actually been well thought out . Like the Ujjwala scheme , that provides free LPG connections to families below the poverty line . The scheme was started in May 2016 and 3 crore households have since received access to cooking gas connections . This year 's Budget proposes the expansion of the scheme to include 8 crore poor families .
`` It turns out so many of the women who are taking it are subsequently not using it because they ca n't afford to buy cylinders . And this was not taken into account . And they know this . A large number of the women have not gone back and taken the cylinder because you take the original one and when it runs out , then you do n't have the money to go get another one . And yet they 're expanding the scheme without this basic thing being thought through , '' she added .
The hunt to locate the women in this year 's Budget yielded mixed results . While some saw our needs catered to , others feel the needs of women play no role in the Budget planning at all . And just as the Budget sees a continuation in the existing roles of women , which are , needless to say , socially suppressed , there seems to be a continuation in the Budget 's own proposals as well .
`` A lot of this Budget has to do with continuation . If we look at agriculture , women 's access to programmes does appear to be through self-help groups which has been the case for a long time so it 's not like any new conduit is being created . Apart from health , the other programmes are also already there . I did n't see anything dramatically new in women 's role in the economy . It is as perceived , '' Dr Sudarshan said .

A previously undetected group of Russian-language hackers silently stole nearly US $ 10 million from at least 18 mostly U.S. and Russian banks in recent years by targeting interbank transfer systems , a Moscow-based security firm said on Monday .
FRANKFURT : A previously undetected group of Russian-language hackers silently stole nearly US $ 10 million from at least 18 mostly U.S. and Russian banks in recent years by targeting interbank transfer systems , a Moscow-based security firm said on Monday .
Group-IB warned that the attacks , which began 18 months ago and allow money to be stolen from banks ' automated teller machines ( ATMs ) , appear to be ongoing and that banks in Latin America could be targeted next .
The first attack occurred in the spring of 2016 against banks in First Data 's `` STAR '' network , the largest U.S. bank messaging system connecting ATMs at more than 5,000 organizations , Group-IB researchers said in a 36-page report .
In a statement , First Data said that a number of small financial institutions operating on the STAR network had had their credentials breached for administering debit cards earlier in 2016 , leading First Data to implement new mandatory security controls . It said the STAR network was never itself breached .
The firm said it was continuing to investigate a number of incidents where hackers studied how to make money transfers through the SWIFT banking system , while stopping short of saying whether any such attacks had been carried out successfully .
SWIFT said in October that hackers were still targeting its interbank messaging system , but security controls instituted after last year 's US $ 81 million heist at Bangladesh 's central bank had thwarted many of those attempts . ( http : //reut.rs/2z1b7Bo )

Group-IB has dubbed the hacker group `` MoneyTaker '' after the name of software it used to hijack payment orders to then cash out funds through a network of low-level `` money mules '' who were hired to pick up money from automated teller machines .
The security researchers said they had identified 18 banks who were hit including 15 across 10 states in the United States , two in Russia and one in Britain . Beside banks , financial software firms and one law firm were targeted .
The average amount of money stolen in each of 14 U.S. ATM heists was US $ 500,000 per incident . Losses in Russia averaged US $ 1.2 million per incident , but one bank there managed to catch the attack and return some of the stolen funds , Group-IB said .
Hackers also stole documentation for OceanSystems ' Fed Link transfer system used by 200 banks in Latin America and the United States , it said . In addition , they successfully attacked the Russian interbank messaging system known as AW CRB .

Once hackers penetrated targeted banks and financial organizations , they stole internal bank documentation in order to mount future ATM attacks , Group-IB said . In Russia , the hackers continued to spy on bank networks after break-ins , while at least one U.S. bank had documents robbed twice , it said .
Group-IB said it had notified Interpol and Europol in order to assist in law enforcement investigations .
The unidentified hackers used a mix of constantly changing tools and tactics to bypass anti-virus and other traditional security software while being careful to eliminate traces of their operations , helping them to go largely unnoticed . To disguise their moves , hackers used security certificates from brands such as Bank of America , the Fed , Microsoft and Yahoo .

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has been briefed on a plan to fire missiles near Guam , home to US air and naval bases , Pyongyang 's state media said .
SEOUL : North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has been briefed on a plan to fire missiles near Guam , home to US air and naval bases , Pyongyang 's state media said on Tuesday ( Aug 15 ) .
Kim `` examined the plan for a long time '' and `` discussed it '' with commanding officers on Monday during his inspection of the command of the Strategic Force in charge of the North 's missile units , according to the Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) .
North Korea 's military said last week that it would finalise by mid-August its detailed plan to test-fire four intermediate-range ballistic missiles in an `` enveloping fire '' around Guam and report it to its leader for approval .
Tensions have been mounting since the North tested two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month , which appeared to bring much of the US within range .
Responding to the tests , US President Donald Trump warned Pyongyang of `` fire and fury like the world has never seen '' .
The North in turn threatened to test-fire its missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam .

President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Monday about Chicago 's `` record setting '' violence in 2016 , claiming the city should seek federal help if local authorities ca n't handle the crisis .
As Chicago closed on one of its most violent years in decades , President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Monday the city should seek federal help if local authorities ca n't handle the crisis .
“ Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016 , ” Trump tweeted . “ If Mayor ca n't do it he must ask for Federal help ! ”
Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016 . If Mayor ca n't do it he must ask for Federal help ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 2 , 2017
Data made available by the Chicago Police Department shows 2016 was one of the most violent years in the city since the mid ‘ 90s . While it was n't a record , as Trump stated , Chicago saw 762 murders , 3,550 shooting incidents and 4,331 shooting victims in 2016 .
The mayor 's office did not immediately respond to Ward Room 's request for comment on Trump 's tweet , though Police Supt . Eddie Johnson told reporters Sunday he plans to hire nearly 1,000 more officers by the end of the year to help combat violence .
“ If you give us the tools that we need to hold these individuals accountable , I promise you 2017 will be a much better , and safer , year for the city of Chicago , ” Johnson said .

“ If you give us the tools that we need to hold these individuals accountable , I promise you 2017 will be a much better , and safer , year for the city of Chicago , ” Johnson said .
Over the course of the campaign , Trump repeatedly referenced Chicago 's violent crime .
“ In Chicago , they 've had thousands of shootings — thousands — since January first , ” Trump said during the first presidential debate in September . “ And I 'm saying , ‘ Where is this ? Is this a war-torn country ? What are we doing ? ' ”
The Chicago City Council voted in November to remove honorary “ Trump Plaza ” street signs near the president-elect 's riverfront hotel and condominium tower as a response to the Republican 's incendiary rhetoric about the city .
Johnson made a commitment Sunday to reduce the city 's violence in 2017 . Besides hiring additional officers , the CPD plans to fund economic growth and provide support for young men in violent neighborhoods , police said .
On Sunday , “ 60 Minutes ” aired a segment titled “ Crisis in Chicago , ” bringing renewed attention to the city 's murder rate .
Mayor Rahm Emanuel met with the president-elect last month at Trump Tower in New York City , delivering a letter from mayors across the country calling for protections for young immigrants . However , it 's unclear whether Emanuel and Trump discussed Chicago 's violent crime .
Trump also met with Chicago rapper/producer Kanye West in December . Following the meeting , West tweeted that he discussed the city 's violence with Trump .
Her superstar husband is contemplating his first steps in politics but Latha Rajinikanth is busy addressing a different concern - safety of children . `` This is a very sensitive area today because the kind of issues that we see that are surrounding children , right from infants to school going kids such incidents were not so high like today , and these issues have to be addressed on a daily basis , '' Latha told CNN-News18.The issues she seeks to address include road accidents , the danger of falling into wells and suicides . She said she was inviting everyone in the neighbourhood to be a part of her structured programme to spread awareness among parents and children '' Every street , every home , every neighborhood , every person in society has a role to play in ensuring safety for children , '' Latha , who runs schools in Chennai , said.One of the incidents which urged Latha to pursue this seriously was the suicide of 17-year-old S Anitha who took the extreme step after she lost a legal battle for exemption from NEET , the common medical entrance test . `` For me , an educationalist , education is not just about books , it is about a very strong mental health that grows with self esteem , '' she said adding that such an approach will help children take disappointments in their stride.Latha said for this counselling has to start much earlier in life , and not just at the time of board exams as it was done at present . She is planning to set up systems and centres for instilling inner strength in children.She however was evasive on the expected entry of Rajinikanth into politics , saying that as his partner she should respect his right to say it himself . `` He 's the kind of person who is committed to anything he does and if there 's a call in him and he 's doing it he 'll do an excellent job , that much I can say with great confidence and pride , '' she added .
Former prime minister Stephen Harper has offered an explanation as to why he let former MP Rick Dykstra run in the 2015 federal election despite allegations of sexual misconduct during the campaign .
In a statement posted on Twitter , Harper said that he learned of allegations against Dykstra during the election , but understood that the matter “ had been investigated by the police and closed a year prior .
WATCH : Andrew Scheer orders probe into why Rick Dykstra was allowed to run despite misconduct allegations
“ Given this understanding of the situation , I did not believe that I could justify removing him as a candidate . ”
Harper went on to say that more information has since come to light , “ including information to the effect that the original investigation may not have been complete .
“ In my view , it is essential that criminal allegations , including this one , be fully investigated and prosecuted if warranted . ”

Harper 's statement came five days after Dykstra , the former MP for St. Catharines , stepped down as president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario ( PCs ) after serving in the role since 2016 .
His resignation was announced hours before Maclean 's magazine published allegations that he had been accused of sexually assaulting a Conservative staffer in 2014 .
The incident , which allegedly took place after a post-budget party , was reported to Ottawa police in the same year .
Federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Wednesday that he had asked the party to begin a third-party investigation as to why Dykstra was allowed to run as a candidate in that election .
Dykstra became president of the Ontario PCs after he lost the election .
But Harper 's was n't the only statement that was released after Scheer announced a probe into Dykstra 's 2015 candidacy .
Ray Novak , Harper 's former chief of staff , said the campaign had asked the Conservative Party 's lawyer to investigate further , but “ unfortunately the facts available at the time were few : a closed investigation with no charges and a complainant asking for privacy . ”
My statement on the Dykstra matter . pic.twitter.com/DSAcjpQnTE — Ray Novak ( @ rnovak77 ) February 3 , 2018
“ This matter was not taken lightly by anyone involved , and any suggestion to the contrary is misleading and false , ” Novak said .
“ This was an extremely difficult decision that ultimately turned on whether a closed investigation without charges was sufficient grounds for firing . ”
Facebook and other tech stocks plunge as US indexes skid
Facebook ( FB ) shares fell more than 7 percent in early trading amid controversy over how Cambridge Analytica , which was hired by President Trump 's 2016 campaign , was able to harvest personal data from more than 50 million Facebook users .
The stock opened 5.2 percent lower , then slid to $ 171.27 by noon on Monday , a drop of 7.5 percent .
Facebook alleges that users ' data was taken from its site using an unapproved method . The company said a researcher built an app that provided a personality quiz to Facebook users , but the social media giant claims the researcher then “ lied to us ” and passed the content onto Cambridge Analytica . That firm then used the data to build “ psychographic profiles ” about voters .
Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey wrote on Twitter that her office is launching an investigation into the data usage . Politicians in both the U.S. and the U.K. are demanding that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explain how the data theft occurred and how the company plans to protect consumers .
“ Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica , ” Healey wrote .
Facebook breach : This is a major breach that must be investigated . It 's clear these platforms ca n't police themselves . I 've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads . They say “ trust us. ” Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary . — Amy Klobuchar ( @ amyklobuchar ) March 17 , 2018
Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D-Connecticut , on Monday urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook , in a tweet calling the company 's policies to protect consumer data a “ hollow promise. ” He also urged Congress to examine what he described as links between Cambridge Analytica and “ Russian state interests . ”
Congress should explore links between Cambridge Analytica and Russian state interests . Misuse of Facebook data by Russians attacking us ? — Richard Blumenthal ( @ SenBlumenthal ) March 19 , 2018
Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica over the weekend . The social network said it had removed the app in 2015 when it learned about the violation of its policies .
“ Several days ago , we received reports that , contrary to the certifications we were given , not all data was deleted , ” Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote in a Friday post . “ We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims . ”

A quick moving system will bring us a wintry mix or snow for the morning commute . Not to worry though , it will not have any impact on roads at all , as it will be very light . The back end of the system will bring colder air and the wind . Gusts to 40 mph will be likely for your evening commute with additional flurries . Areas in NW Illinois and north of highway 20 could see up to a dusting of snow . Again , due to the wind I do not foresee any problems with area roads .

President Trump is allowing more employers to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections , issuing new rules Friday that take another step in rolling back President Obama 's signature healthcare law .
The new policy is a long-expected revision to federal rules that require most companies that offer health insurance benefits to cover birth control as preventive care for women at no additional cost . Preventive services are supposed to be free of charge to employees and their dependents under Obama 's Affordable Care Act .
Most women with health insurance no longer pay for birth control , and advocates immediately announced plans to try to block the new rule in court .
Trump 's religious and moral exemption is expected to galvanize both his opponents and religious conservatives who back him , but it 's likely to have a limited effect on the nation 's largely secular workplaces .
Although tens of thousands of women could be affected by Trump 's new policy , the vast majority of companies have no qualms about offering birth control benefits through their health plans . Human resource managers recognize that employers get an economic benefit from helping women space out their pregnancies , since female workers are central to most enterprises .
The administration estimated that some 200 employers who have already voiced objections to the Obama-era policy would qualify for the expanded opt-out , and that 120,000 women would be affected . However , it 's unclear how major religious-affiliated employers such as Catholic hospitals and universities will respond .
Since contraception became a covered preventive benefit , the share of women employees paying their own money for birth control pills has plunged to less than 4 % , from 21 % , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .
The Trump administration 's revision broadens a religious exemption that previously applied to houses of worship , religiously affiliated nonprofit groups and closely held private companies . Administration officials said the new policy defends religious freedom . Privately owned for-profit companies , as well as publicly traded for-profit companies , will be able to seek an exemption .
Officials also said the administration is tightening oversight of how plans sold under the healthcare law cover abortion . With limited exceptions , abortions can be paid for only through a separate premium collected from enrollees . No public subsidies can be used except in cases that involve rape , incest or preserving the life of the mother .
Doctor groups that were key to derailing Republican plans to repeal the healthcare law outright expressed dismay over the administration 's move on birth control .
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the new policy could reverse the recent progress in lowering the nation 's rate of unintended pregnancies .
`` Instead of fulfilling its mission 'to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans , ' HHS leaders under the current administration are focused on turning back the clock on women 's health , '' said the organization 's president , Dr. Haywood Brown .
Women 's groups said they would try to stop the administration from carrying out the changes .
`` The rules give employers a license to discriminate against women , '' said Fatima Goss Graves , president of the National Women 's Law Center . `` We will take immediate legal steps to block these unfair and discriminatory rules . ''
Administration officials said the new policy takes effect right away .

: The Competition Commission has ruled out cartelisation among banks in fixing savings interest rates , after finding the rates are based on independent assessment of market conditions rather than any collusive arrangement.The fair trade watchdog examined the parallel behaviour of banks in offering similar savings bank interest rates ( SBIRs ) and levying similar service charges on a suo motu basis . It also looked at the role , if any , played by the Indian Banks ' Association ( IBA ) in determining these rates and charges.The regulator was `` prima facie satisfied '' that under the aegis of the IBA , a majority of banks were acting in concert in relation to SBIRs and banking charges . Finding this in contravention of the Competition Act , the regulator had passed an order in January 2015 directing its investigation arm , the Director General ( DG ) , to probe the matter and submit its report.In a 20-page order , the Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) said it is of the view that there is no reason to disagree with the findings of the DG as the material on record does not suggest any cartelisation amongst banks and/or IBA , between 2011 to 2016 , to determine SBIRs or service charges.Accordingly , no case of contravention of the provisions of Section 3 of the Competition Act is made out , it added.Section 3 pertains to anti-competitive agreements.Among all the scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) , the conduct of top ten banks whose savings bank account deposits accounted for about 70 per cent of the total market as on March 31 , 2016 was examined.The banks were - State Bank of India including five of its associate banks , ICICI Bank , Punjab National Bank , Union Bank of India , Central Bank of India , HDFC Bank , Bank of Baroda , Bank of India , Canara Bank and Axis Bank.Noting that the in-depth investigation by the DG did not reveal any incriminating material suggesting cartel amongst the banks , the CCI said it is of the view that `` SBIRs offered by the banks are an outcome of their independent assessment of market conditions and not of any collusive arrangement '' . `` The investigation has concluded that reduction in SBIRs by SCBs was based on independent assessment of market conditions , and the main driver for the reduction was excess liquidity position resulting from demonetisation , '' the CCI said.With regard to the issue of similarity in service charges , the regulator noted that rates of SCBs for different types of services varied significantly . `` As similarity of service charges across banks is not observed , Commission is of the view that there has not been any collusion amongst the SCBs for determining service charges as well , '' the order said.Regarding the role of the IBA , the CCI said the investigation could not bring forth any material indicating use of its platform to decide or implement similar SBIRs by banks . `` This is further reinforced by the fact that private SCBs such as Yes Bank , Kotak , IndusInd Bank are offering higher SBIRs despite being members of IBA , '' CCI said.The regulator also said that the Indian banking sector has an `` oligopolistic market structure '' .Out of 70 per cent of the total savings bank account deposits as on March 31 , 2016 , around 15 per cent are held by three private SCBs -- ICICI , HDFC and Axis and the remaining 55 per cent are held by seven public sector banks ( PSBs ) .The `` lopsided structure '' of Indian banking leaves little incentive for banks , especially PSBs to compete for savings bank deposits on the basis of SBIR , the CCI said.The regulator also noted that PSBs have large branch network and therefore , have a deep reach all over India . `` This wide reach is not matched by competitors and thus , these large banks do not seem to face serious threat to their deposit base in the form of competition from smaller banks . `` Therefore , it is not imperative on the part of larger PSBs to try to match the higher SBIRs of smaller competitor banks like Kotak , IndusInd and Yes Bank , which are confined to urban areas , '' the CCI said.As per the order , the unique characteristics give rise to a 'Cozy Oligopoly ' in Indian banking sector where there is little incentive for price competition in savings bank account deposits , asd per the regulator .
Naples man faces child pron charges
A 21-year-old man was arrested Tuesday for the transmission of child pornography , the Collier County Sheriff 's Office said .
Officials were tipped off about Richard Farias ' internet activity on three separate occasions . Two tips were sent to CCSO about a suspect engaging in child exploitation on Omegle . A third tip was reported to the FBI about a suspect on a website called Chaturbate engaging in internet exploitation of children .
Farias used chat rooms to talk about his fantasies with kids , which included him wanting to kidnap a child and “ slice their necks , ” the arrest report said .
According to the arrest report , he would use a special software to display pre-pubescent children performing sex acts while he was talking to someone on Omegle .
Farias also wanted to perform sex acts with children under the age of ten , police said .
All of his internet activity was traced back to Farias ' house on the 4000 block of Acadia Lane , right next to Avalon Elementary School and a park .
Farias was arrested for two counts of transmission of child pornography .
His bond has not been set .

Hop on an airplane and travel to a different climate . Chances are , you 'll get a little sick in the process .
Neither the Eagles nor Patriots drastically changed climates in leaving the Northeast for Minnesota , but one of the teams caught a bug on the way . Many Philadelphia players have dealt with flu-like symptoms this week , with receiver Nelson Agholor receiving intraveneous fluids after feeling sick and weak , NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported .
Do n't fret , Philly fans : Agholor is already feeling better and should be fine for the game , Rapoport added .
NFL Network 's James Palmer added more context on the bug that 's going around the Eagles , including linebacker Mychal Kendricks :
Kendricks told me the other day that in his mind it felt like everyone has been sick at some point this week . Phlegm , cough , congestion , runny nose . Heâs been battling something all week he said . https : //t.co/QY2Os1uq7H â James Palmer ( @ JamesPalmerTV ) February 3 , 2018
Philadelphia 's medical staff has done an impressive job managing the players ' symptoms , Rapoport reported , meaning we should expect the majority , if not all , of the Eagles to be ready for Sunday .
It 's obviously best for the game if everyone is healthy and ready to go . After all , the last time the Eagles were in the Super Bowl , their quarterback ended up vomiting in the huddle in the late stages of the game , and look how that turned out . Here 's to a sickness-free Super Bowl LII .

PART FIVE : OCC has the highest rate of infractions in B.C . and the second-highest rate of contraband violations
This is part five in our series , Okanagan Incorrectional , delving into the first 14 months of operations at B.C . 's newest jail . Click on the image to go to our Okanagan Incorrectional Dashboard for a full index of the series ( also available at the bottom of this article ) and more information about the jail .
Feelings of social isolation at the Okanagan Correctional Centre may play a role in the jail 's high rate of rule infractions , as one researcher points out the importance of relationships between correctional officers and inmates .
In an institution built to hold those who have broken the laws , rule violations are to be expected . Indeed , at OCC the rate was 261 violations per 100 inmates , the highest in all B.C . jails .
By comparison , Penticton 's 2016 crime rate was a little under 0.14 per 100 population . That difference may not be too surprising , but OCC 's rate of rule violations is also 12 per cent higher than any other jail in B.C . The provincial average , on the other hand , is 195 violations per 100 inmates .

Alana Abramson , a Kwantlen Polytechnic University professor who studies corrections , and Dean Purdy , the B.C . Corrections union boss , both point to isolation as a general security issue in B.C . jails .
Purdy has spoken out regularly about the practice of only having one officer in each living unit , which he said can make officers vulnerable and keep fewer eyes on inmates causing trouble . And there have been at least two assaults on staff this year at OCC — the jail was recently put on separate 72- and 48-hour lockdowns to investigate a pair of assaults on staff .
But for Abramson , surveillance and much of the “ static ” security measures are secondary to something more fluid .
“ That 's dynamic security : It 's what the staff can offer by way of relationship building , helping people integrate into prison , helping people prepare for release , ” she said .
That relationship , though at first optimistic in the jail , appears to have deteriorated to some degree , as explored in part two of this series .
Although he spoke in different terms , one inmate , referred to in this series as C.C. , did speak to the issue of relationships between inmates and staff at OCC .

B.C . Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth poses in front of the Okanagan Correctional Centre after a media scrum , which followed his first tour of the jail . The jail opened almost exactly six months before he was named public safety minister . Dustin Godfrey/Western News
“ There are a lot of good guards that get the respect . They give us respect , they get it back , ' ” C.C . said , noting others are neither so respectful nor so respected .
Over the course of the Western News ' interviews with C.C. , often when he referred disparagingly to officers , he also referred back to the ones with whom inmates get along . And he did say that was more of an issue than other jails in his experience .
Part of the issue at OCC is likely the experience levels at a new jail , which was supposed to have 60 per cent internal hires but ultimately only hired under a quarter of its staff internally . C.C . and Purdy have both made mention of potential or real problems with having too few experienced staff .

Depending on what kind of experience is being brought to the jails from those new COs — for instance , someone coming from harm reduction work — Abramson said a fresh take on corrections could be useful .
“ Because we know prison culture is not a healthy culture among staff . We see high rates of alcoholism , high rates of divorce , high rates of trauma when we compare to the general population , ” she said .
However , for COs without experience with marginalized sectors of the community , she noted a lack of experience can diminish their ability to build those relationships .
And an inmate who is able to build and maintain relationships in jail are more likely to build and maintain relationships after jail , which Abramson said can be a major rehabilitative process .

“ Reducing human contact and increasing social isolation has tremendous negative impacts on people in prison . They 're already deprived of their liberty , freedom of movement and privacy , ” she said .
“ So to deprive them further of their social relationships creates anger , resentment , trauma , and those are n't the people we want living next door to us . ”
That 's especially true when it comes to infractions related to drug addiction .
Story continues below
In OCC , infractions within the jail relating to drugs and other types of contraband amount to just over 67 per 100 inmates , the second highest per-capita rate in the province . The provincial average is 42 per 100 inmates .
In October , OCC was one of four centres to get full-body scanners for inmates to watch for drugs coming into the jail , which may have some role in the high rate of contraband infractions at the jail . In fact , October to December had three of the highest rates of contraband infractions .

On a Friday afternoon in January , the lobby at the Okanagan Correctional Centre sits empty , save for the odd staff member wandering through and reception staff . Inmate isolation , including a lack of visits from family or friends , can lead to more unruly behaviour from those inmates , according to one researcher . Dustin Godfrey/Western News
But all of that extra static security comes with its own potential for ill effects .
“ The fact is there will always be drugs in prison and the higher the security measures that you have to keep them out , just the more creative and risky people will be with them , ” she said .
“ There have been many cases of men and women dying by swallowing balloons full of drugs and them exploding in their bodies . That 's a terrible way for someone to go , but that is the pressure to bring drugs in , whether that is because you have a habit of your own , because you have debt , because you 're feeling pressure because you 're a young prisoner that 's being muscled by somebody else and forced to bring in drugs . ”

Abramson said jails can be mindful of drugs coming into the facilities , but to actually tackle the issue , B.C . Corrections should be looking at ways to mitigate the issues beneath the drug use .
“ A lot of people move to opiates to manage emotional pain and trauma , and so we need to have a trauma-informed approach in all aspects of corrections , ” Abramson said .
And that is a sentiment that echoes what is now a commonly held belief among harm reduction workers .

In an email statement , B.C . Corrections pointed to its programming as an effort to rehabilitate inmates .
“ In addition to core programs designed to reduce the risk factors that contribute to crime , B.C . Corrections encourages change in offenders by teaching them the value and importance of work and by helping them gain the skills they need to find it when they are released . ”
The Western News will explore some of those programs in a future instalment of Okanagan Incorrectional .

PARIS : A car smashed into a pizza restaurant east of Paris late on Monday ( Aug 14 ) , killing a girl , but investigators said the young driver had tried to commit suicide and the incident was not terror-related .
The episode came just five days after a terror-linked car attack on soldiers , the latest in a string of assaults in France since early 2015 .
Investigators have `` ruled out the terrorist hypothesis '' behind the latest incident , which took place in the town of Sept-Sorts , 55 kilometres east of Paris , a source close to the inquiry said .
The man , who was arrested , said `` he had tried to kill himself yesterday ( Sunday ) without success and decided to try again this way , '' the source said .
In Paris , interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said the fatality was a girl aged 13 , and not aged eight as initially reported . Four people were seriously hurt , after a preliminary figure had been given of six .
The driver , born in 1985 , `` is not known to the intelligence services and has no criminal record , '' Brandet said .

One of the four was the girl 's younger brother , police said .
Earlier , the public prosecutor 's office in the town of Meaux said investigators believed the act was `` deliberate ... but apparently has no connection with a terrorist act . ''
France is on edge after suffering a string of terror-related attacks , including the use of cars as weapons .
On Aug 9 , six soldiers were injured after they were hit by a rented BMW in the western Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret . A BMW was also involved in Monday 's incident .
The suspect , a 36-year-old Algerian man , was later shot and wounded after a dramatic motorway chase .
The death toll from militant attacks in France has exceeded 230 since January 2015 .
The country has been under a state of emergency since the Islamic State group attacked in Paris in November 2015 , leaving 130 people dead .

Newly installed Premier Doug Ford has suspended a key provision in a popular consumer protection law that was supposed to clamp down on skyrocketing ticket scalper prices . Ontario 's anti-scalping law came into force on Canada Day and originally contained language capping the resale price of tickets to 50 per cent above face value . On Tuesday morning on the Ontario laws website , a short , inconspicuous note said the specific part of the law capping resale prices “ comes into force on a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor . ”

When asked about the change , the premier 's office said it wanted to further review the resale cap and how it would be enforced . “ The previous government attempted to institute a cap on ticket re-sales with no way to enforce that cap , resulting in less consumer protection . We have paused the implementation of this section until we can review this provision in full to make sure it is in the best interest of Ontarians , ” said Ford spokesperson Simon Jefferies in an email . The markup cap suspension seemed to surprise the ticket industry .

Then , after being told about the suspension , StubHub issued a statement welcoming the change . “ StubHub is pleased that the recently elected Ontario government has taken appropriate steps to ensure ticket transactions continue to occur on platforms that provide vital consumer protections for fans of live events , ” company spokesperson Cameron Papp said in a statement .

With the price cap on hold , ticket prices continue to soar .

A Star/CBC analysis shows that thousands of tickets to the city 's hottest concerts are being resold online for prices far above face value — in one case as high as 20,000 per cent . These resale prices would have been illegal under the markup cap that was suspended by Ford 's new government . An analysis of 10 popular , upcoming Toronto concerts — including Bruno Mars , Elton John , Radiohead and Taylor Swift — shows 20 per cent of tickets finds Tuesday morning on websites StubHub , TicketMaster and SeatGeek exceeded a 50-per-cent markup . A $ 69.50 ticket to Florence and the Machine was for resale on SeatGeek for $ 6,741.87 — a markup of 9,600 per cent . A $ 221 ticket to Elton John was available on SeatGeek for $ 1,878 , while a $ 95.50 Foo Fighters ticket was being offered on SeatGeek for $ 9,240 . A $ 325 ticket for Taylor Swift was being offered for $ 66,000 on StubHub— a 20,207-per-cent markup . Aside from emailed statements from StubHub , and one from TicketMaster , the ticket reselling sites declined interviews for this story . Richard Powers , a professor at the University of Toronto 's Rotman School of Management , said scalpers will benefit from the suspension of the price cap . “ This looks to be an attempt by the new government to delay at least part of the new act , providing those in the secondary market a grace period or perhaps a total reprieve depending on what happens next , ” Powers said .
Alan Cross , a radio DJ and music historian , questioned whether the cap on ticket resales ever would have worked . ( CARLOS OSORIO / TORONTO STAR )
Alan Cross , a radio DJ and music historian , questioned whether the cap ever would have worked . “ Scalping was completely illegal for the longest time , yet you could go outside any venue and find people buying and selling tickets , ” he said . There were 27,946 tickets available for the 10 concerts monitored on scalper websites . The Star and CBC identified 5,703 priced higher than 50 per cent above face value . The more scarce the tickets , the higher the resale price . For Radiohead 's two shows at the Scotiabank Arena ( formerly the ACC ) , there were only 410 tickets available on the four scalping websites monitored . But 308 of those tickets were marked up beyond 50 per cent . Cross said even without the cap , the legislation still has some important achievements . “ There are some laudable things about the law : the effort to outlaw ticket-buying software , bots . That 's favourable . It 's a tough fight . It may be an unwinnable fight . But it 's a fight that has to be fought . That 's good. ” Powers agrees : “ They have got rid of the bots . If the legislation accomplished anything , that was a real positive. ” TicketMaster 's website introduced several changes at midnight on Canada Day , the moment the new law came into force . For events in Ontario , TicketMaster 's verified resale tickets now list service fees up front and show buyers the face value of the ticket before they complete their purchase — both requirements of Ontario 's new legislation . StubHub does n't list the face value and declined to comment when asked by the Star and CBC . “ This is a very rational and prudent decision made by the new government , ” said Patti-Anne Tarlton , chief operating officer for TicketMaster Canada . “ This pause will allow them time to effectively evaluate the anticipated impact of this component of the Bill and whether it will have the intended consumer protection the government and industry strive for. ” An ongoing investigation into the ticket resale market by the Star and CBC has revealed how mass scalpers use bots to buy up hundreds of tickets , which makes it far more difficult for fans to get them in the box office . Those scalpers feed tickets to the online resale market , where prices rise far above face value . The world 's biggest online platform , StubHub , gives mass scalpers preferential treatment by providing them with automatic pricing tools and charging them lower fees than those charged to fans . It 's all part of an ongoing revolution in the ticketing industry that blurs the line between the box office and scalpers , and pushing fans to pay even more . In March , the Star and CBC reported the Toronto Blue Jays pocket secret commissions on every seat sold on StubHub — effectively profiting from the scalping of the club 's own seats . On opening day alone , more than 20,000 tickets — 45 per cent of the entire stadium — were posted for resale online .

GRANDVILLE , Mich. ( WOOD ) — The search is on for the source of a big boom that rattled windows and nerves in greater Grand Rapids Saturday night .
24 Hour News 8 received hundreds reports of a loud sound about 8:30 p.m. Saturday , mostly centered around the Grandville and Wyoming areas . Kent County dispatchers said they also handled dozens of calls about the loud explosion-type sound .
Facebook exploded as well , with numerous posts to the WOOD TV8 page . “ Felt like a bomb going off , ” was a common comment .
A day and a half later , we still do n't know what it was , but we do know what it was n't .
Forecasters at the National Weather Service in Grand Rapids said Monday there was nothing within 100 miles weather related that would have caused the noise .
Experts at the Chaffee Planetarium in Grand Rapids also said it probably did n't come from high up in the sky . The sound was more localized than one caused by something like a meteor , they concluded .
So what was it ? Local police are taking tips , but they do n't have much to go on . Anyone with information is asked to call the Kent County Sheriff 's Department at 616.632.6100 or Silent Observer at 616.774.2345 .

Get moving ! New advice on exercise for patients with ICD 's
People born with heart conditions can be treated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators or ICD 's , which send electric shocks to restimulate the heart . For years , these patients were told not to participate in sports . But now , a new study suggests the risk while exercising is very low , triggering some change in advice for patients .
Fifty-six-year-old Bobby Williams has congestive heart failure , and has been treated with an implantable defibrillator and a left ventricular assist device . Not long ago , doctors would have discouraged heavy exercise for this condition . Now , Bobby is encouraged to work out as hard as he wants .
“ I feel like a bionic man sometimes . I feel great , ” Williams told Ivanhoe .
Jay Franklin , MD , Clinical Electrophysiologist , Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital explained , “ It 's safe for patients to participate in vigorous athletics . And so it 's recommended that the physician and the patient work together but then in the majority of cases , individual patients can continue to exercise vigorously and participate in sports , even contact sports with safety , and the patient 's not significantly at risk . ”
Implantable cardiac defibrillators do not prevent a life- threatening rhythm disturbance , but they prevent sudden death by sending an electric shock to correct the disturbance . Heavy exercise does not impede their function .
“ I 've been there since these devices were all we had every step of the way to where we now have incredibly sophisticated devices that come in a platform this size , which is amazing , ” stated Dr. Franklin .
The LVAD , which operates on an external battery and regulates normal blood flow , will be removed if and when Bobby qualifies for a heart transplant , which is part of the reason he works out to get stronger .
“ Stay active and you will win , ” Williams said .
Any patient who has had any type of transplant or implantable device should consult with their doctor before beginning a vigorous exercise program .

BUFFALO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) – Sabres forward Johan Larsson will sit the next two games after being suspended by the league for cross-checking Vincent Trocheck in the face in the final seconds of Buffalo 's 4-2 loss Thursday night .
Although he has no prior history , the NHL Department of Player Safety ruled , that while Larsson did not intend to hit Trocheck in the face , his stick rides up his shoulder and to the face which is not a hockey play .
“ When a player attempts to intentionally use his stick to deliver a blow to an opponent he can not necessarily be excused of responsibility when it lands in an unintended place , ” the league said .
Larsson will miss the Sabres ' game on Saturday against the Blues and Tuesday 's showdown with the Ducks .
What 's an award nominations morning without snubs ? Here are the top five from the 2018 Golden Globes announcement .
- “ The Big Sick , ” the comedy co-written by real-life couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon , was entirely ignored by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn . on Monday . Award season pundits had predicted that the film , based on the pair 's actual experience overcoming a medical emergency , would at least score a Golden Globe nomination for best comedy . It did n't , and its cast — including lead Nanjiani and supporting actress Holly Hunter — also received no nominations .
- Meanwhile , “ Get Out 's ” Jordan Peele was snubbed too . The filmmaker did not earn recognition for directing or writing the horror satire , though the film was n't completely overlooked — its star , Daniel Kaluuya , was nominated for best actor , and the film got a nom for best comedy .
- Also blanked in the directing category ? Greta Gerwig , for her movie “ Lady Bird. ” Gerwig was widely expected to earn a nomination , but in fact no women were recognized as among the best director nominees . “ Lady Bird ” got a lot of love , otherwise : The movie was nominated for best comedy and screenplay , and its mother/daughter duo — Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf — received nods .
- Jake Gyllenhaal , who has earned high praise for his turn as Boston marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman in the drama “ Stronger , ” was also snubbed by the HFPA .
- And it was n't a wonderful morning for “ Wonder Woman , ” which soared at the box office this summer but was n't a Globes favorite : Neither director Patty Jenkins nor star Gal Gadot received nominations .

Maria Sharapova . Image : twitter.com
CAS cut Sharapova 's suspension but said she “ bore some degree of fault ” by relying on agent Max Eisenbud to check the banned list for changes and failing to ensure he had done so .
INTERNATIONAL NEWS - Boris Becker believes Maria Sharapova has paid her dues and deserves a second chance when she returns to tennis in April at the end of her 15-month doping ban.Sharapova , a five-times grand slam champion , failed a dope test for the drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open and was suspended for two years by the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) .The Russian 's ban was then cut by nine months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) last October , meaning the Russian is free to return from 26 April.Becker , a three-times Wimbledon champion , said it was right that Sharapova was allowed to return to the sport and hopes her comeback will not cause problems in the locker room. “ In principal I am all for a second chance , ” Becker told Reuters at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Monaco. “ She ( Sharapova ) paid her dues , she was suspended for quite a long time . I do n't know about the reaction of the other players , it 's up to them. “ Everyone has their own choice . Hopefully the atmosphere ( inside the locker room ) will be good . We can move on and have good women 's champions. ” Sharapova , 29 , had called the ITF 's original ruling “ unfairly harsh ” because she had not intentionally violated anti-doping rules.Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency list of banned substances only at the start of 2016 after mounting evidence it boosted blood flow and enhanced performance .

LAS VEGAS : Five days after the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history , authorities acknowledged on Friday ( Oct 6 ) that they have not uncovered a `` clear motive '' for the gunman .
`` We still do not have a clear motive or reason why , '' Undersheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told reporters .
`` At this time I 'll tell you we have no credible information to report to you as to motivation . ''
Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and left hundreds injured in Las Vegas after raining bullets on a crowd at an open-air country music concert while perched in a 32nd floor hotel room .
The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the massacre , but McMahill said authorities had not uncovered `` no known nexus '' between the militant group and Paddock .
`` In the past , terror attacks or mass murder motive was made very clear by a note that was left , by a social media post , by a telephone call that was made , by investigators mining computer data . Today , in our investigation , we do n't have any of that uncovered , '' he said .

The official pledged that law enforcement would work with `` great tenacity '' to uncover the reasons why Paddock carried out the massacre .
The White House today said there is an opportunity for Saudi Arabia to be a key interlocutor between the US and Pakistan , as President Donald Trump has key interlocutor between the US and Pakistan , as President Donald Trump has expressed dissatisfaction over `` bare minimum '' actions taken by Islamabad against terror groups . `` As you well know the Saudis have a long deeper relationship with Pakistan . There are opportunities within that for the partner to provide , be a key interlocutor , if you will , so that there 's no misunderstanding between the US in Pakistan to convey not just messages , but also to identify opportunities for both parties to help them , '' a senior administration official said.The remarks gain significance on the eve of the White House visit of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for whom the Trump Administration is throwing a red-carpet welcome.During the meetings , the the Trump Administration plans to discuss the new South Asia policy and seek the Kingdom 's help in Pakistan taking action towards elimination of terrorist safe havens inside its territory.Breaking the traditional protocol US President Donald Trump will receive the Crown Prince Salman at the White House.It is slated to have one-o-one meeting at the Oval Office and then host him over a working lunch at the White House . These protocols are normally reserved for the heads of a state of a major country or a top ally and partner of the US.Major topics on discussion between the two leaders will is the current situation in region , Syria and Yemen , Iran 's behaviour and the Middle East Peace process . They will also discuss bilateral issues , including Saudi investment in America 's infrastructure and defence trade , the senior administration official said on condition of anonymity.Noting that Saudi Arabia recognises the importance the Trump Administration 's place on South Asian Strategy , the official said that this is one of such initiatives where they offered to assist for example , funding for the Afghan national security forces.There are some discussions about , could they host a donor 's conference in Kuwait , have the donor 's conference for reconstruction , which would be economically quite beneficial , mutually beneficial in terms of support for the Afghan government or support in the direction US is trying to go in countering extremism in Saudi Arabia , the official said.This is a unique opportunity , the official noted.While countries are saying that this is an American priority , the instability in South Asia has larger implications for the region.Countries can work with the US to address a common security challenges in a way that can be much more efficient but also more effective , and hopefully bringing these conflicts to a resolution , the official said.Noting that Saudi Arabia is a key partner and an all-time friend of the US , the official said for Trump , his visit to the Kingdom was certainly one was of the high points of his first year in office . `` Saudi Arabia , security as a priority for the US . Over the past nine months , Congress has approved USD 54 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia . The department of defence has continued several programmes to build its capacity and capability . We also have close and strong economic relationship with Saudi Arabia , '' the official said . `` We continue to engage with our Saudi partners on their plans for civil nuclear program and possibly the United States supply of nuclear equipment expertise and material , '' the official said . `` We are expanding our cooperation on countering Arabian influence in the region to terrorists in Syria and Yemen and elsewhere and cutting off funding for terrorists and extremists across the region , '' the official said . `` On a regular basis we are engaging directly with senior leadership and we will keep those engagements in the next several weeks on a broad range of issues , increasing our coordination on the Middle East regional issues , advancing shared strategic objectives and developing new channels and capabilities by which we can institutionalize each interact and make them more effective , '' the official added .

Addressing a tribal convention in Madhya Pradesh 's Mandla district on Tuesday , Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon the panchayat office bearers to empower the rural economy to ensure welfare of rural population with a five-year roadmap.PM Modi launched the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan aimed at bringing transparency and honesty in developmental work in rural areas . The Prime Minister also tried striking a chord with tribal voters of the poll-bound state by announcing a museum underlining the contribution of freedom fighters from tribal community in every state. “ When it comes to rural development , budgets are important . But , there is a shift in the discourse in last few years . People are now talking about the need to ensure that money allocated for a project is utilised and done in a transparent manner . The budget of the country today is for the welfare of all , we are continuously working for the development of villages , ” said the PM addressing the Adi Utsav at Ramnagar , in the tribal belt of Mahakaushal region in MP.Hinting at growing chemical farming in the country , the Prime Minister urged farmers to take collective decisions to reduce usage of fertilisers so that soil degradation could be checked . He also referred to Centre 's decision of putting bamboo in the category of grass so that the rural population could earn livelihood without legal troubles . The PM encouraged farmers to grow bamboos on farmland boundaries for earning alternate livelihood. “ Today , the amount of budget is not a worry ; it is about its honest implementation for the right beneficiaries , ” said PM Modi.He also indirectly blamed the Congress rule for not doing enough for the villages . “ Our parents would have been unfortunate to not get enough opportunities for education but we should make sure no kid is left outside schools in our villages . We could see 40-50 years old people affected by polio but our panchayats should make sure no kid is excluded from the pulse polio drive , ” he said.Amid sharp criticism for his government over implementation of MGNREGS , PM Modi called upon panchayats to take upon water conservation works for next three months under this scheme to do away with water scarcity in villages.Amid the raging debate on falling farm prices in India , the PM urged farmers to embrace zero budget agriculture.He underlined importance of Jan Dhan , Van Dhan and Gobar Dhan for rural economy and urged panchayat office bearers to work for empowerment of rural sector till 2022 . “ This period should be remembered as Golden Era of Panchayat Raj , ” said Modi.He further asked panchayat office bearers to take things into their own hands and not wait for government staff to do things for villages . “ It 's time for realising the Gram Swaraj dream of Mahatma Gandhi. ” The PM tried to strike a chord with the tribal voters . Alleging that the tale of Indian freedom struggle only revolves around certain families and personalities , PM Modi underlined the contribution of ethnic people including Rani Durgawati , Avantibai and Birsa Munda . The leader announced that every state , where personalities from tribes contributed to freedom struggle , would get modern museums so that young generation could be apprised about their glorious contribution to the freedom of India.One such museum would come up in MP soon , he added.The Prime Minister also tried connecting to local masses while referring to Centre 's recent ordinance provisioning death for rapists of minor girls . “ The loud cheers from the audience indicate that they are acknowledging the fact that they have a government in New Delhi listens to them and works accordingly , ” he said.Four panchayat office bearers were also felicitated by the Prime Minister . The awards were : Amarwati Vathia sarpanch for ensuing smokeless chulha all Mandla village households , Chulli Baiaga sarpanch for ensuring 100 % vaccination in Shahdo village , Radhabai Dhruve sarpanch for ensuring 100 % electrification in her village in Mandla and Nanhibai Marco was given a Rs 2 lakh sanction letter under Jeevan Jyoti Yojana on her husband 's death.The Prime Minister digitally inaugurated a LPG bottling plant to be built in Maneri village of Mandla for fulfilling LPG requirement in the region under Ujjawala scheme.He felicitated Panchayats of various states for excellence in IT and other endeavours.CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on the occasion lauded PM Modi for his dream project of providing houses to every rural family by 2022 claiming that the Centre would spend Rs two lakh crore in next five years for developing tribal areas .
Connecticut 's average gas price today is $ 2.48 , three cents higher than this time last week . Compared to this time last year , average prices are $ .24 cents higher .
Nationally , average prices have increased for 20 consecutive days with today 's price of $ 2.41 , $ .02 cents higher than this time last week ; and $ .30 cents higher than this time last year .
Average prices typically increase this time of year with the onset of the summer drive season , warmer weather and the conversion to more expensive summer blends . This year contributing to that increase are reports of possible extended production cuts by OPEC and a decline in oil inventories that American motorists have enjoyed over the last year or so .

For years there has been a steady stream of sightings of something large and hairy loping through the wildernesses of North America , variously called names such as Bigfoot , Sasquatch , and Skunk Ape , and for as long as these mysterious beasts have been reported there have been those who have sought to capture them on camera for all the world to see . Some of these have proven to be rather lacking in quality , and indeed it has become almost a running joke within the world of cryptozoology that they are forever doomed to remain blurry , shaky , and indistinct . However , there is no denying that these strange videos can be compelling on some primal level , and with the rise of video sites such as YouTube we have been saturated with such supposed video evidence . Go do a search on “ Bigfoot videos ” on YouTube and see what I mean . With the increase in camera usage ( and sadly the ability to fake ) , we have been faced with more alleged Bigfoot videos than we know what to do with , to the point that it can be exhausting trying to analyze , look through , and vet them all . Some of them are garbage , others enticing , and others still that leave a big question mark hanging . Here I have kept things as basic as I can , and presented for your perusal some of the most debated and oft-discussed alleged pieces of Bigfoot footage ever captured .
We might as well start with the grand daddy of all alleged Bigfoot footage , and by far the most famous , which is what has come to be known as the Patterson/Gimlin footage . In the early 1960s a former rodeo rider from the U.S. state of Washington by the name of Roger Patterson found himself fascinated with the Bigfoot phenomenon after reading an article about it . From 1963 he made his way around the Pacific Northwest investigating sightings reports and looking for the elusive creatures in the wilderness all over Washington , Oregon and Northern California , and one of the places that most intrigued him was a location called Bluff Creek , California .
In October of 1967 , Paterson returned to Bluff Creek , this time with his friend and fellow former rodeo rider Robert Gimlin . The two made their way on horseback to a secluded area where Bigfoot was said to have been sighted on numerous occasions , and with them they carried a 16mm video camera , just in case . The two spent a few weeks searching the area and then on October 20 their patience was seemingly rewarded when they were out riding near the creek and their horses became inexplicably agitated . Then , upon rounding an overturned tree they saw around 100 feet away an immense bipedal hairy creature begin to make its way across the rocky creek bed towards the forest beyond .
Paterson had the presence of mind to start up the camera , and even jumped off his horse to pursue the creature , eventually dropping to one knee in an effort to steady the camera , and at one point the beast turns its head to look over its shoulder to look directly at him before calmly , almost casually continuing its way for the tree line , where it would disappear from view . The footage Paterson managed to capture has gone on to become the most talked about , scrutinized , and famous pieces of Bigfoot footage ever taken , indeed one of the most discussed pieces of mysterious footage period , and shows a large bipedal figure covered with short , smooth hair , with a sloped forehead , pointed head , and most intriguing of all a pair of what seem to be swinging pendulous breasts , suggesting it was a female .
The footage has been picked apart , debated , and discussed for decades , and although many think it is a hoax there are plenty who still believe that this is some of the best photographic evidence for the existence of Bigfoot ever taken . Although widely dismissed as a debunked video , the fact is that it has never been conclusively shown to be fabricated , and is still much talked about even after over 50 years of having every one of its frames intensely scrutinized . Whether you believe it to be a fake or the real deal , there is no doubt that this is the very first clear footage of an alleged Bigfoot ever taken , and it has become iconic , with stills from it recognizable worldwide even by people with no interest in cryptozoology at all . You can see it here .
Almost , but not quite as famous as the Patterson/Gimlin footage is a piece taken in 1994 by US Forest patrolman Paul Freeman near the Blue Mountains of the Washington-Oregon border . Freeman had first sighted a Bigfoot in 1982 near Walla Walla , Washington , which caused him to become obsessed with the mysterious creatures . Over the years he made many expeditions out into the wilds in search of the creatures and was known for putting forward various supposed physical evidence he had been able to find , including tracks , a partial hand print , and even an imprint of a buttock from a purported Bigfoot . The plaster casts made of the tracks in particular are notable for the presence of dermal ridges , skin whorls , and anatomical details upon them , which have convinced experts such as anthropologist Jeff Meldrum of Idaho State University and Grover Krantz of Washington State University , although others were more skeptical and have accused Freeman of fabricating evidence in an effort to seek publicity .
Nevertheless , in 1994 Freeman was finally able to get video footage of what he claimed to be two of the creatures in the Blue Mountain area . It is unfortunate that Freeman had such a mixed reception to the previous evidence he had put forward , because the footage , while admittedly very blurry and shaky , has been seen as being quite possibly authentic by the few who have taken it seriously enough to carefully investigate it . Too many have been quick to dismiss the footage based on the reputation of being a potential hoaxer and publicity hound , but whether this footage is faked or not , it is still one of the more discussed and well-known pieces of Sasquatch footage out there , perhaps second only to the Patterson/Gimlin film . Real or hoax ? Watch the Freeman footage here and decide for yourself .
The following year saw another extensively viewed and talked about supposed Bigfoot video that was taken at the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park , in Del Norte County , California . On August 28 , 1995 , an RV carrying a film crew for Waterland Productions were driving through the area at night , along with Playboy Playmate Anna Marie Goddard , who was a star in the Playboy special they had been working on . As they drove along they happened to have their video camera going and at one point the driver of the vehicle shouted that he could see a bear .
The crew trained their video camera on it and it turned out to appear to not be a bear at all . Instead , they captured on film a bipedal figure standing by the side of the road , which then retreats while swinging its massive arms at its side . In the footage someone shouts “ Let 's go get it ! ” and the driver attempts to give chase as the beast glances back over its shoulder , prompting one of the witnesses to exclaim “ That 's not a bear ! ” At this point the driver stops and the creature steps out in front of the vehicle to stalk off towards the nearby Smith River . At this moment it is clearly visible in the headlights , appearing to be a large , broad figure around 8 feet in height and covered in long , shaggy hair , with a sloping head and flaring nostrils . The driver hits the high beams and the creature throws up its arms in surprise at it lumbers off , eliciting a shout of “ Oh my God … it 's Sasquatch ! ” from one of the witnesses . The seemingly somewhat startled beast then moves off to disappear behind a redwood tree , and further attempts to locate it are unsuccessful .
The video was later released and became a sensation . A return to the location of the sighting and careful analysis of the surroundings was used to come to the conclusion that whatever the creature in the video is is around 2.3 meters high , too tall to be a typical human being . There were also observations made that the subject at one point displays clear movement of musculature that would have been difficult to fake with a gorilla suit , as well as detailed foot and ankle anatomy and even the suggestion of a penis on the creature . With some of the details picked up by researchers , the so-called “ Redwoods Video ” or “ Goddard Bigfoot Video , ” has been praised by many as one of the better , more intriguing pieces of Sasquatch evidence out there , and there has been no evidence of a hoax despite intensive analysis of it . Some of the footage with enhancements can be seen here .
Another heavy hitter in the world of supposed video footage of Sasquatch comes from just 1 year after the Redwoods video . On May 26 , 1996 , on Memorial Day , a Lori Pate was out with her family and friends on a fishing trip at Chopaka Lake , in Okanogan County , north central Washington , and decided to go for a hike with her husband Owen . During the hike Lori claimed that they had heard some strange animalistic noises coming from the woods around them and they decided to try to film whatever it was on an 8mm camera they had with them .
Not long after this , the couple spotted a hairy , bipedal creature run across a grassy area towards the forest on the other side and managed to catch it on camera . The footage shows the creature , whatever it is , run across a hill and disappear behind a slope , only to reappear and then slow to a walk to make its way into the trees . The bizarre detail that it seems to grow larger in height as it walks off has led to speculation that the thing is perhaps carrying an infant on its back which happens to climb up higher at that point in the footage . What has gone on to be known as the “ Memorial Day footage ” has become a very divisive video among cryptozoologists , with around half expounding it as some of the best video evidence of Bigfoot and the other half writing it off as a clear hoax . Whatever it may be , it is one of the more well known Bigfoot videos out there , for better or worse . See it here .
A little more controversial , but much talked about nonetheless was a clip from 2001 , taken at Prince Edward Island , Canada . In this case , a man named Nathan Wiley was out in the wilderness there for the purpose of shooting a video for a school project when they came across something they were perhaps not expecting . In one scene they were filming of a person running , in the background there is the startling sight of a Bigfoot-like creature that runs across the clearing as if spooked by the activity of these human intruders . Wiley himself would say of the footage they caught :
All I know is , it looks huge , black and furry and seems to start out running on all fours and then proceed at the end to get up on it 's back legs and run . There are n't any bears on the island either so we have no idea what is it .
The video generated quite a lot of buzz when it was first released , and it was quickly noted that the subject does not really appear to run on all fours at all , but rather in a series of leaps assisted by propulsion from its arms , very much like a large primate of some sort . Astute observers and Bigfoot researchers were also able to deduce that whatever the thing is appears to be going at a healthy clip , somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 mph . While there are certainly detractors who say this is some sort of stunt , and let 's face it there always are , it is nevertheless a compelling little piece of footage that has caused quite a bit of discussion and debate . You can watch it for yourself here .
A more recent intriguing video comes to us from as recently as 2015 , when a Matt McKamey and friend were canoeing through the swamps of Lettuce Lake Park , Florida and saw what could have been the Florida Skunk Ape , a Bigfoot cousin native to the swamps of the southern United States and so-named because of the horrible stench it purportedly exudes . As the pair made their way through the water , they spied a tall , black shape through the trees which appeared to be moving through the snake and alligator infested muck foraging for food .
The footage itself shows what appears to be a very tall , dark creature with a cone-like head rummaging through the swamp and crawling up over a log before scurrying out of sight . What is interesting about this video is that the thing seems to be very at home in the swampy environment , moving with ease and finesses through the water and mud . Some of the details are interesting too , as many observers have noted that the beast seems to run off with what looks to be a fish in its hand . Also curious is that this is one of the few video clips that seems to show one of these creatures just going about its business , in this case looking for food . What did these guys catch on film ? Watch it here and see what you think .
With the increasing use of cameras and out ever expanding presence into the wildernesses of this world , perhaps it is no surprise that such oddities should be picked up and immortalized on film more often . The problem is that in this day and age of YouTube hoaxers now have a venue to put out their wares and further muddy the waters for those of us honestly trying to look for evidence and answers . There are many , many more potentially worthwhile videos out there where these came from , and this article could have gone on and on , but it has become increasingly difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff , so to speak . No longer can we always trust what we see on film , and we have entered a new age of fakes and video analysis . For better or worse , these are a selection some of the videos that have stood the test of time , and have proven to be amongst the most popular . They will probably never be considered good evidence , or even evidence at all by some , but they do serve to at least make us think , and wonder just what may lie out there in the wildernesses of our world .
Going to the bathroom after giving birth is a special kind of tortuous hell . As a woman who experienced a near fourth degree tear with the labor of her first child , I will tell you that there is no comfortable way to get the job done after that sort of damage . The worst part for me was the wiping . Sure , bowel movements hurt more , but the wiping or lack of ability to do so was just adding insult to injury . But when you can wipe normally after giving birth seems to be dependent upon your own labor situation . Or is there some kind of hard and fast rule about using toilet paper like you usually do ?
According to the website Family Doctor , it 's all blotting and peri bottles for at least the first week or so after giving birth , but after that , it 's all up in the air . Your ability to wipe will depend on whether or not you tore and to what degree . If you had an episiotomy , the pain and healing will be different than if you did n't need one , noted Intermountain Healthcare . It 's important to talk to your healthcare provider or speak with your postpartum nurses to determine what will work best for you .
Because I like precision and parameters , I spoke with retired New York City maternity nurse and postpartum doula , Mary Reid , to find out when women can expect to wipe normally after giving birth . Unfortunately , there are no straight answers . Reid tells Romper , `` It depends . '' Of course .
She says that the damage to your vaginal area will determine your ability to wipe and when . `` If you have a long incision , or if you tore badly , it 's going to take a lot longer . Give your body time . The spray bottle is like your personal bidet , and it does a good job of cleaning you . '' Reid adds that generally , `` if it does n't burn like crazy when you urinate or hurt really bad when you have a bowel movement , you can start to wipe . Your doctor or discharge nurse will give you instructions and care advice before you leave the hospital , and if you 're not sure , ask them . ''
When I gave birth to my son , he came out in what 's known as a `` compound presentation , '' meaning he came out like Superman — fist first . Not only was this dangerous for him , it also meant that even though my doctor did a primo job at stretching my tissues while I was in labor , my son still tore me a new one . I had a tear that went from my vagina upwards towards my clitoris , and a tear that went from my vagina to my rectum . The pain was excruciating , and each trip to the bathroom brought new and interesting spheres of agony .
I was given a peri bottle full of warm water , tucks pads , a cold spray , and narcotics each time I went to the bathroom during my seven day hospital stay . I was told to `` blot with paper '' the next week , and only `` wipe front to back '' when I had a bowel movement . It was n't precise , and it was n't pretty .
Honestly , it took me about three weeks before I could wipe at all . But other moms have different experiences . For instance , Jenn Swartzentruber , 35 , had an uncomplicated vaginal birth at home with no tear or episiotomy . She tells Romper that she felt good enough to wipe after about a week and a half . Meanwhile , Amanda Shelley , 33 , had a similar birth and was able to wipe a few days later . `` Gently , but pretty normally , '' she tells Romper .
Healing is so individual . Take care of your body , listen to your provider , and follow their instructions . And the peri bottle and tucks pads are your very best friends . Keep them close — they really do help .

Rome-based Fendi has long been known for its furs , and has continued to put them forward at a time when many other brands are dropping them from collections , under pressure from changing consumer tastes and animal rights campaigners .
Italy 's Gucci , owned by Kering one of the fastest-growing labels of recent years , is going fur-free as of this year , and independent fashion house Versace recently said it was following suit .
The Fendi show was octogenerian German designer Karl Lagerfeld 's second outing at Haute Couture week in Paris - the season of fashion shows celebrating one-off creations by a select group of houses .
Lagerfeld , who forms a creative duo at Fendi along with the founding family 's scion Silvia Venturini Fendi , also presented his latest turn at France 's Chanel on Wednesday against an elaborate catwalk backdrop that recreated Parisian street scenes .

Meghan Markle is reportedly set to join boyfriend Prince Harry at the reception after Pippa Middleton 's upcoming wedding .
It was previously reported that the Suits actress would not be attending the 20 May nuptials because of Pippa and fiance James Matthews ' “ no ring , no bring ” policy , meaning that as she and Harry were n't engaged , she would be unable to go to the wedding .
However , it has now been reported that while Meghan wo n't be joining Harry at the actual wedding ceremony , to be held at St. Mark 's church in Englefield , England , she will be on his arm for the reception later in the evening , according to People.com .
Britain 's Hello ! magazine were the first to report that Meghan was planning to attend the wedding in some capacity , after requesting a week off from shooting her hit U.S. TV show .
The claims come after Harry missed the royal Easter tradition of the royal family attending a service at Windsor Castle 's St. George 's Chapel alongside Queen Elizabeth II , instead flying to Toronto , Canada , to spend the holiday with Meghan . His decision to miss the annual tradition has also fuelled claims the pair are planning to get engaged , with Meghan 's recent moves such as shutting down her lifestyle website and quitting her ambassadorial role for a skintight leather clothing range suggesting she is attempting to ensure her life is more aligned with the royals .
Pippa 's wedding is sure to be a massive draw for photographers worldwide , especially after the recent confirmation that her sister Catherine , the Duchess of Cambridge 's , two children , Prince George and Princess Charlotte , are in the bridal party .
A representative for Catherine and husband Prince William 's London residence , Kensington Palace , confirmed three-year-old George will serve as a page boy , while little Charlotte , who turns two on 2 May , will be a bridesmaid .
It is not believed the Duchess will be a part of the bridal party , preferring instead to let her kids shine alongside their aunt , who caught the world 's attention by wearing a figure-hugging Alexander McQueen dress as Catherine 's maid of honour at her 2011 wedding to Prince William .
Pippa , 33 , and her 41-year-old fiance , the brother of British reality star Spencer Matthews , became engaged last July during a romantic weekend getaway to the U.K. 's Lake District , where James popped the question with a diamond sparkler reportedly worth over US $ 250,000 .
They had been dating for less than a year , but had previously enjoyed a brief romance back in 2012 .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - Polish judge Malgorzata Gersdorf walked into the Supreme Court building on Wednesday morning , defying new legislation forcing her to retire as court president and putting the judiciary on a collision course with the government .

Hundreds of supporters chanting “ constitution ” and singing the Polish national anthem surrounded her at the entrance as she told reporters : “ My presence here is not about politics , I am here to protect the rule of law . ”
The legislation is at the centre of mounting conflict between Warsaw 's ruling Law and Justice party ( PiS ) and the European Union , which accuses the government of trying to control the judiciary and subvert democratic standards .
Under the new rules , which came into effect at midnight , up to a third of Supreme Court judges including 65-year-old Gersdorf could be forced to retire unless they are granted an extension by President Andrzej Duda , a PiS ally .
The nationalist ruling party argues its legal overhaul is needed to shake up a judicial system it says it steeped in communist-era thinking and power structures .
“ Each EU state has the right to shape their legal system according to their own traditions , ” Prime Minister Morawiecki told the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday .
But Gersdorf , who has been the president of the Supreme Court since 2014 , has said she believes the legislation is unconstitutional and can not be implemented .
After addressing the crowd , she entered the building in central Warsaw . Court officials said she went into a meeting with other judges and would address the media at 12.30 p.m. ( 1030 GMT ) .
Pro-democracy protesters who massed outside the court on Tuesday waving EU and Polish flags said they would stage more rallies across the country on Wednesday .
In Warsaw , people were gathering around the presidential palace . Lech Walesa , the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former president credited with bringing down communism , was expected to join them later in the day .

“ INTERNAL MATTER ”
“ We are moving towards a dictatorship , ” said Joanna Tworog , a 65-year-old webmaster in the crowd outside the court .
“ What if I have a court case against someone from PiS and they will be able to influence judges . These changes affect me personally . ”
Through legislation and personnel changes , PiS has already taken de facto control of much of the judicial system since coming into power in 2015 , including the constitutional tribunal and prosecutors , who now report directly to the justice minister .
Critics at home and abroad say the ruling party 's policies , which also include tighter control of public media , amount to a shift towards authoritarian rule .
The conflict has isolated Poland within the EU , where most governments are critical , while also exposing the bloc 's inability to rein in governments it believes contradict core EU values .
The European Commission opened a fresh legal case against Poland over the Supreme Court changes on Monday , saying that they undermine judicial independence in the largest formerly communist member of the EU .
Warsaw also faces the threat of losing its voting rights in the bloc under a procedure launched late last year in response to the judiciary reforms . Hungary , also facing criticism over democratic standards , has pledged to block such a move .
The eurosceptic PiS government rejects criticism , saying EU treaties do not give Brussels institutions the power to influence national matters such as the judiciary .
“ Let me mention a fundamental issue . The court system ... is an entirely internal matter , ” PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski was quoted as saying by Gazeta Polska newsweekly in an article published on Wednesday .
The party 's standing in polls has held steady at around 40 percent throughout the dispute , well above any single rival party .

REUTERS : Sergio Aguero came off the bench to score as Manchester City made light of playing for an hour with 10 men to beat Burnley 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Monday .
City , needing a quick response after defeat at title rivals Liverpool on Saturday , suffered a blow when Fernandinho was red-carded just past the half hour mark for a wild-looking tackle on Burnley 's Iceland midfielder Johann Berg Gudmundsson .
The hosts dominated after the break , however , and took the lead after 58 minutes when Gael Clichy 's low shot crept past Burnley keeper Tom Heaton and into the far corner .
Aguero , introduced as a second-half substitute , doubled City 's lead with a fine finish from a tight angle four minutes later but Ben Mee halved the deficit to set up a tense finale .
City moved above Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal into third spot in the Premier League with 42 points , seven behind leaders Chelsea who play away at Spurs on Wednesday .

Leicester 's Premier League title defence has gone so badly Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka now considers them “ direct opponents ” in the survival battle .
The Foxes will never forget their incredible triumph in 2016 , but begin the new year just six points above the drop zone and two in front of a Boro side who were not even in the division during their 5000-1 success .
Karanka saw his side beaten late on at Manchester United on Saturday , but believes games against bottom-half rivals are key to the Teesside club 's prospects .
And while Leicester are reigning champions , they fit that profile on current form .
“ Now is the most important game in the season because it is the next one and it is against a direct opponent , ” said Karanka .
“ All this season these are the kind of games we have to win . We are playing at home and always I say if we are playing this way we will win games against our opponents like we did against Swansea , against Hull , against Bournemouth .
“ We won them and that is the way to keep going . We know if we play with less intensity than we did ( against United ) we have problems so we need to play with at least the same intensity .
“ I 'm pleased with the way we competed and we will win games against teams who are playing to stay in the Premier League . ”
When the sides met in the reverse fixture on November 26 , Alvaro Negredo 's double put Boro on course for victory until the Foxes grabbed a last-gasp equaliser from the penalty spot .
Reflecting on that point at the King Power Stadium , Karanka added : “ We forgot they had won the league , we were much better than them in the game and we keep going and play in the same way .
“ We need to analyse Leicester again and their players . They can not play with Jamie Vardy ( suspended ) so they will be different to how they were in Leicester . I do n't have a lot of time but time enough to prepare . ”
Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri , meanwhile , has thrown down the gauntlet to Islam Slimani after the striker 's latest winner .
The forward scored to beat West Ham 1-0 on Saturday and the Foxes go to Boro still searching for their first Premier League away win of the season . Slimani now has six goals for the champions following his record £30m move from Sporting Lisbon in the summer .
Ranieri said : “ We have to find him much better because he has very good quality and also presses a lot and sometimes he can make mistakes because he is very tired , but it is okay . ”
MELBOURNE : Fresh allegations have been made against Vatican finance chief Cardinal George Pell , an Australian court was told Tuesday ( Mar 20 ) during a hearing to determine if he should stand trial on historical sexual offence charges .
The 76-year-old , who is a top adviser to Pope Francis , is on leave and returned to Australia to fight the allegations which relate to incidents that allegedly occurred long ago .
The exact details and nature of the accusations have not been made public , other than they involve `` multiple complainants '' .
The committal hearing at Melbourne Magistrates Court , which kicked off on Mar 5 , was told by Pell 's barrister Robert Richter that a witness due to testify next week had made a second statement to police , The Australian newspaper said .
`` We had no forewarning of this at all , '' Richter told the court , the newspaper reported , adding that the development was `` more than troubling '' .
There were no details about the fresh allegations , but they were understood to be of a criminal nature , Melbourne 's Herald Sun reported .

Richter said his legal team needed time to investigate the new claims , which he had received late Monday , and it was not yet known if they could lead to new charges against his client .
Richter applied for the witness to be removed from the police 's brief of evidence and to be dealt with separately .
Prosecutor Mark Gibson said the witness ' testimony could be part of another proceeding if needed , the Australian reported .
Up to 50 witnesses could be called during the committal hearing , where they will give their accounts and be cross-examined by Pell 's legal team . The hearings are due to last four weeks .
Magistrate Belinda Wallington will then decide if there is sufficient evidence for the case to go to trial .
Pell , a former Sydney and Melbourne archbishop , is the highest-ranking Catholic official to be charged with historical sex offences .
The cleric has not had to enter a plea , although he instructed his lawyer from the outset to make clear he intended to plead not guilty .
STUTTGART , Germany : Maria Sharapova crashed out in the opening round of the Stuttgart Grand Prix on Tuesday ( Apr 24 ) as French sixth seed Caroline Garcia staged a fightback to win 3-6 , 7-6 ( 8/6 ) , 6-4 .
`` This was not the result that I wanted , but I can take a lot out of this match , '' Sharapova said . `` I 've not competed for a few weeks , but I played pretty solid and did all of the right things .
`` I served well in the first set but had a few doubles at the wrong time . Physically , I felt quite strong . ''
The five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova , who turned 31 last week , looked to be in control as she made just two unforced errors in winning the opening set .
But Garcia , who had never beaten the Russian in four previous meetings - they last played in Madrid three years ago - rallied in the second set as she came from 4-2 down and and levelled the contest in a tie-break .
The 41st-ranked Sharapova returned to tennis in Stuttgart exactly a year ago after finishing a 15-month doping ban for meldonium and reached the semi-finals .

She claimed an early break in the third set , but lost it in the third game as Garcia tightened the screws on the crowd favourite .
Sharapova was broken to trail 4-5 and put her opponent under momentary pressure at 0-30 as Garcia tried to serve out the win .
But the world number seven succeeded on her second match point as Sharapova struck a return wide to exit after two and three-quarter hours of battle on the indoor clay court .
Sharapova said her game might have been compromised by weeks of forearm injury recovery after last playing in Indian Wells six weeks ago .
`` Overall I did n't react as well as I could against a server like her , she got the lot of free points , '' Sharapova said .
`` I did n't get enough balls back . We were both playing fast , and aggressive .
`` I need to be smarter in the winning position . ''
Garcia will next take on Ukrainian qualifier Marta Kostyuk who scored a 6-4 , 6-1 defeat of Antonia Lottner .
The youngster , who does n't turn 16 until just before the start of Wimbledon , was joined in round two by Czech fifth seed Karolina Pliskova , who beat Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens 6-2 , 6-2 .
Kostyuk made a breakthrough with a surprise third-round showing at the Australian Open as a qualifier , finally losing to compatriot Elina Svitolina .
World number 158 Kostyuk has since claimed a second-tier title in Burnie , Australia and reached a final in Zhuhai , China in March .
Her defeat of Lottner , ranked 155th , took just under 90 minutes , with the teenager breaking four times while losing serve only once .
Pliskova , who has been on site for a week training , is playing Stuttgart for the third consecutive year , losing to eventual champion Laura Siegemund in the 2017 quarter-finals .
`` I felt the best today and for sure it was not her best match but that was not much to do with me , '' Pliskova said .
`` The serve was good and I got a lot of free points , my shots were working -- there was no problem from my side today . ''
The Czech dominated Bertens , with the winner firing six aces and breaking four times .
No one who 's watched Alberta Premier Rachel Notley in action would ever call her a quitter or even a Debbie Downer . No matter the issue nor how turbulent the political winds , Notley can be counted on to be feisty at the very least . And whether one likes her policies or not , she is usually a combination of cheery , charming and proficient .
But Thursday , when Notley summoned reporters to an impromptu news conference at the Alberta legislature , she sounded , well , defeated . The news this week that her NDP cousins in B.C . were throwing up a new roadblock to the construction of Kinder Morgan 's Trans Mountain pipeline seems to have come as an unwelcome surprise – like a sudden blow to the side of the head while sitting peacefully at a sidewalk café .
But that news alone could n't have been responsible for Notley 's deflated mood .
The announcement by Premier John Horgan 's government that it would permit no additional oilsands bitumen to flow through pipelines across B.C . until after it had conducted an extensive study on spill risk and clean up came Tuesday . For 48 hours after that , Notley was her normal , combative self . If anything , she was even more confrontational than usual .
So why the glum demeanor by Thursday afternoon ?
I suspect it 's because Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in town on Thursday . Notley says she had spoken to him on the phone to encourage him to speak out forcefully against B.C . 's move . Yet Trudeau being Trudeau , all Notley likely got was some vague , wishy-washy assurance that Ottawa will make sure Trans Mountain gets built .
Trudeau never seems able to move from billowy rhetoric and good intentions to practical action . Anyone remembers democratic reform and restored door-to-door mail delivery , or three modest deficits followed by a balanced budget , or lower taxes for the middle class ?
It 's probably not surprising that a man who was a motivational speaker for a living ( but never held an administrative job before becoming P.M. ) , would have trouble moving beyond flowery statements to pragmatic results .
No doubt Notley got the sense there was no backbone on the other end of the line , and no concrete plan to see Trans Mountain gets built .
This is pure speculation , but my guess is Notley was so low-spirited because she 'd been blindsided by her close friends in B.C . and abandoned by Ottawa .
She is on her own to fight for a pipeline Alberta and the country desperately need , but one she is powerless to push through without federal help .
What complicates things even further is that Notley herself does n't believe in pipelines .
As an opposition MLA , she was firmly against them . Even as a candidate for premier in 2015 , she admitted to supporting only Energy East , the pipeline from Alberta to New Brunswick that TransCanada was forced to abandon after Trudeau 's government placed so many regulatory hurdles in the way that it became unviable .
She truly is close with a lot of the senior players in the B.C . government . She worked in B.C . with many of them for nearly a decade before returning to enter Alberta politics . When her government took over in May 2015 , a busload of NDP staffers poured over the Rockies from the Left Coast to help out . Her former chief-of-staff was even Horgan 's chief when he was opposition leader and his business partner at one time , too .
So Notley is fighting for a pipeline she does n't truly believe in , against some of her oldest and dearest friends , backed by a prime minister who makes jellyfish look sturdy . And to make matters even worse , rumours abound under the Dome that Notley 's cabinet and caucus are deeply divided on Trans Mountain .
No wonder she did n't look or sound like herself on Thursday .
Atty . Gen. Jeff Sessions appeared before Congress on Tuesday in what `` Late Show '' host Stephen Colbert called `` America 's favorite new reality TV show , 'So You Think You Can Testify About Russia . ' `` By the evening , inevitably , Sessions was fodder for comedy . The Sessions session had not been a particularly revealing one . If anything , it was characterized by an unwillingness to comment and claims of bad memory . And so there were jokes about his size . Colbert called him `` attorney general and last surviving Little Rascal Jeff Sessions , '' and cracked , `` As soon as Sessions sat down , everyone had the same question , 'Are you now or have you ever hidden any pots of gold ? ' `` `` The Late Late Show '' host James Corden showed a picture of the Keebler Elf . On Comedy Central 's `` The Daily Show , '' host Trevor Noah made the old `` Oh , I did n't realize you were standing '' joke about Sessions ' standing to take the oath . Backed by a graphic picturing the AG as `` The D.C. Hobbit , '' Noah said , `` If there 's one thing we know about magical creatures , if you ask them a question they do n't like , they 'll just make up rules to why they ca n't answer . ''
`` Jimmy Kimmel Live '' improved Sessions ' dull testimony by making it the soundtrack to a Bugs-and-Daffy exchange in an old `` Looney Tunes '' cartoon to produce `` testimony the whole family can enjoy . '' Sessions ' remarks about `` secret innuendo '' regarding his actions — and his declaration that , although he recused himself from any investigation into the presidential campaign , he would not recuse himself from `` defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations '' — brought forth a variety of portrayals of offended Southerness , in an appropriate accent . `` I say , 'Pistols at dawn , sir ! Pistols at dawn ! ' `` said Colbert , adding , `` which is not a great idea because the committee chairman is named Burr . '' ( That would be Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina . ) `` Oh , well , I do declare , '' said Noah , `` Jefferson Beauregard defending his honor . '' He called Sessions ' defense of his self-defense `` a slick line '' and imagined that it was something he said regularly : `` I recuse myself from this investigation , but I will not recuse myself from these nachos . Wait , $ 5 for guacamole ? I recuse myself . '' `` There 's nothing more Southern than scurrilous innuendo , '' said Meyers , offering an example : `` His sister never got married . She prefers to tend to her pussy willow . ''
Later , guest Kate McKinnon described her process for imitating Sessions on `` Saturday Night Live '' and offered an impression of his testimony : `` Now with [ Russian Ambassador ] Sergey Kislyak , I only met him two times . OK , three times . But the third time was in a men 's restroom , and we are just talking about what a trial it is to get soap out of those electric soap dispensers . '' Meanwhile , on the less overtly political talk shows , games were played . `` Tonight Show '' host Jimmy Fallon , who is growing a beard in order to lose the beard and leave the mustache , played `` Dance Battle '' with Heidi Klum . They had to invent `` randomly selected , never-before-seen '' dances on the spot , including `` Invisible Hulu Hoop , '' `` Fork in the Garbage Disposal '' and `` Speed Bowling . '' This is Fallon 's happy place , and Klum , too , proved adept .
LONDON : Newcastle United can focus on their fight for Premier League survival without any more distractions after the close of the January transfer window , manager Rafa Benitez has said .
Newcastle sealed loan deals to bring in midfielder Kenedy from Chelsea , striker Islam Slimani from Leicester City and goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from Sparta Prague in January .
Striker Aleksandar Mitrovic and winger Rolando Aarons were among those who departed on loan and Benitez said the team had to get their priorities in order after a 1-1 draw with Burnley in midweek extended their winless run to three games .
`` From now , there are no distractions , and everybody has to be sure they are ready , '' Benitez told the club 's website .
`` The first message I gave to the players after the transfer window , after the training session on the morning , was , 'Listen , this is the group of players that have to fight for every point until the end of the season ' . ''
Benitez added : `` The players , the team , they have to concentrate on that , because some of them were maybe thinking , ' I could go here , I could go there ' . Now , everybody 's here and everybody has to give their best . ''

FIFA U-17 World Cup Highlights : Ghana vs Colombia - As It Happened
News18 Sports Updated : October 6 , 2017 , 7:41 PM IST
PREVIEW : A face-off befitting the tournament 's stature will kick off the FIFA U-17 World Cup in the capital here tomorrow , as Ghana 's pedigree meets Colombia 's pomp in an unfamiliar territory .
Two-time champions Ghana are seeking to revive their fortunes in the tournament , having last won it way back in 1995 , when they stunned a Brazilian outfit that had the likes of Julio Cesar in its ranks .
Four years before that , the Ghanians shattered Spain 's dream in the summit showdown in 1991 for the African nation 's maiden triumph in the youth tournament .
Though Ghana could not quite conjure up the same magic , which saw them lift two titles , in the following years , they still managed to reach the final on two occasions . This time around , they are entering the tournament on the back of some very impressive performances in the Africa U-17 Cup of Nations .
Ghana 's oponents , Colombia , are normally among the top four South American footballing nations alongside Brazil and Argentina , but they have not made it to the tournament since the 2009 edition when they finished third .
Colombia have so far competed in five editions of the tournament , finishing third on two occasions . They hustled and bustled their way to India with a last-ditch victory over continental rival Paraguay .
Ghana 's head coach Paa Kwesi Fabin said his players are eager to rekindle the glory days of the past . `` In India , we 'll be out to show we 're the best . Our aim is to get to the final and win it , '' Fabin had said .
The 1990s marked a golden era for Ghana 's U-17 national team . The Black Starlets were the undoubted dominant force , reaching the final at four of the decade 's five FIFA U-17 World Cups , including lifting the trophy in 1991 ( Italy ) and 1995 ( Ecuador ) . It also finished on the podium in 1999 ( New Zealand ) .
However , it has been a different story since the turn of the century . Besides a brief revival in 2007 , when it reached the semifinals , Ghana have consistently failed to hit the heights at this level , to the extent that it has only graced two of the last seven installments of the U-17 World Cup .
Following a 10-year absence , the Black Starlets booked their ticket to the U-17 global extravaganza through their performances at this year 's CAF U-17 Africa Cup of Nations . And they are all geared up to once again prove their mettle , starting with the opening Group A encounter against the South Americans .
The first to land in India for the tournament , Colombia would have acclimatised themselves with the conditions by now . Coach Orlando Restrepo exuded confidence that his boys will put up a good show in the marquee junior event .
Platinum Tools has introduced a 5-in-1 Fiber Optic Stripper and Kevlar Scissors .
The 5-in-1 Fiber Optic Stripper features a five cavity design that allows for use with a multitude of fiber optic cables . The pre-set design ensures all cavities are precision set with no adjustments are required . Cushioned grip handles provide positive non-slip , comfortable operation .
The Kevlar Fiber Optic Scissors feature ergonomic handles and full serrated bottom blade for non-slip cutting , company officials report .
The scissors cut Kevlar , re-sharpen , and hold a cutting edge . They are best utilized for Kevlar material , Aramid yarn , soft cables , and electrical tape , according to company officials .
Beijing : India on Tuesday stayed clear of the joint communique by the member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Summit ( SCO ) supporting China 's One Belt , One Road ( OBOR ) project .
This comes ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's crucial informal meet on Friday-Saturday .
India was not mentioned in the paragraph of the joint communique by the SCO member countries expressing support for Beijing 's Belt and Road initiative .
`` The foreign ministers of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Pakistan , Russia , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan reiterated their support for the 'Belt and Road Initiative ' proposed by China .
`` All parties support the use of the potential of the countries , international organizations and multilateral institutions in the region to establish a broad , open , mutually beneficial and equal partnership in the SCO region , '' the statement issued by the SCO foreign ministers said .
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) , which connects China 's Kashgar in Xinjiang with Gwadar port in Pakistan 's Balochistan , is a key artery of the OBOR project and is progressing at a fast pace .
India firmly opposes the over $ 50 billion economic corridor of the Belt and Road project which cuts through the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir . New Delhi lays claim to the region .
President Trump 's administration is planning to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum imports after failing to win concessions from the European Union , a move that could provoke retaliatory tariffs and inflame trans-Atlantic trade tensions .
The tariffs are likely to go into effect on the EU with an announcement by Friday 's deadline , according to two people familiar with the discussions . The administration 's plans could change if the two sides are able to reach a last-minute agreement , said the people , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations .
Trump announced in March the United States would slap a 25 percent tariff on imported steel , and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum , citing national security interests . But he granted an exemption to the EU and other U.S. allies ; that reprieve expires Friday .
Europe has been bracing for the U.S. to place the restrictions even as top European officials have held last-ditch talks in Paris with American trade officials to try to avert the tariffs .
`` Realistically , I do not think we can hope '' to avoid either U.S. tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum , said Cecilia Malmstrom , the European Union 's trade commissioner . Even if the U.S. were to agree to waive the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum , Malmstrom said , `` I expect them nonetheless to want to impose some sort of cap on EU exports . ''
European officials said they expected the U.S. to announce its final decision Thursday . The people familiar with the talks said Trump could make an announcement as early as Thursday .
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross attended meetings at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris on Wednesday , and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer joins discussions in Paris on Thursday .
The U.S. plan has raised the threat of retaliation from Europe and fears of a global trade war — a prospect that is already weighing on investor confidence and could hinder the global economic upturn .
If the U.S. moves forward with its tariffs , the EU has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. orange juice , peanut butter and other goods in return . French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire pledged that the European response would be `` united and firm . ''
Besides the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs , the Trump administration is also investigating possible limits on foreign cars in the name of national security .
`` Unilateral responses and threats over trade war will solve nothing of the serious imbalances in the world trade . Nothing , '' French President Emmanuel Macron said in an impassioned speech at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris .
In a clear reference to Trump , Macron added : `` These solutions might bring symbolic satisfaction in the short term . ... One can think about making voters happy by saying , ' I have a victory , I 'll change the rules , you 'll see . ' ''
But Macron said those `` who waged bilateral trade wars ... saw an increase in prices and an increase in unemployment . ''
Tariffs on steel imports to the U.S. can help local producers of the metal by making foreign products more expensive . But they can also increase costs more broadly for U.S. manufacturers who can not source all their steel locally and need to import the raw material . That hurts the companies and can lead to more expensive consumer prices , economists say .
Ross criticized the EU for its tough negotiating position .
`` There can be negotiations with or without tariffs in place . There are plenty of tariffs the EU has on us . It 's not that we ca n't talk just because there are tariffs , '' he said . He noted that `` China has not used that as an excuse not to negotiate . ''
But German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier insisted the Europeans were being `` constructive '' and were ready to negotiate special trade arrangements , notably for liquefied natural gas and industrial goods , including cars .
Macron also proposed to start negotiations between the U.S. , the EU , China and Japan to reshape the World Trade Organization to better regulate trade . Discussions could then be expanded to include other countries to agree on changes by the end of the year .
Ross expressed concern that the Geneva-based World Trade Organization and other organizations are too rigid and slow to adapt to changes in global business .
`` We would operate within ( multilateral ) frameworks if we were convinced that people would move quickly , '' he said .
Ross and Lighthizer seemed like the odd men out at this week 's gathering at the OECD , an international economic agency that includes the U.S. as a prominent member .
The agency issued a report Wednesday saying `` the threat of trade restrictions has begun to adversely affect confidence '' and tariffs `` would negatively influence investment and jobs . ''

The LCBO in Orono , Ont. , is set to close , again .
Tracy Vyfschaft , an executive board member with Ontario Public Service Employees Union , which represents LCBO workers , said she is feeling “ a little frustrated ” for residents of Orono and surrounding area because of the news .
The community first learned that its LCBO was in jeopardy in late 2017 when managers announced that the outlet would be closed , despite the fact that it regularly generates a profit . Once a new outlet in the town of Newcastle is ready , the Orono location would be shut down .

The union fought back . It rallied the residents of Orono . “ We told the residents to contact their local MPPs , Lou Rinaldi and Granville Anderson , with their concerns , ” Vyfschaft said .
On April 13 , Rinaldi called a news conference and said the store would remain open .
“ It seemed like a huge win , ” Vyfschaft said . “ The community had already lost its grocery store and had just heard that it might be losing its bank , too . ”
Yet recently , Orono residents got a card in the mail informing them that the LCBO would be closing for good at the end of October .
“ Residents were lied to , ” Vyfschaft said . “ Leading into the provincial election , if I were a candidate , I would do everything in my power to keep that store open . ”
Global News reached out to the LCBO for a comment but they did not get back by the time of publication .
There is no exact date on when the store will be closing its doors for good .

Taylor Swift has made a career of writing songs about love and heartbreak , so it 's no surprise that she had some advice for Camila Cabello when she went through her first breakup . After meeting through mutual pal Hailee Steinfeld , Swift and Cabello 's friendship began by bonding over heartache , the `` Havana '' singer told Rolling Stone in a cover story published Wednesday . Cabello said ,
`` She sent me a breakup playlist and said , 'Come over . Let 's talk about it . I think the Haim girls were there . It was , like , a girls-night thing . ''
Cabello — who is currently opening for Swift on her Reputation Stadium Tour , along with `` Boys '' singer Charli XCX — said Swift also provided counsel as she was working on her debut album , Camila , which was released in January , and trying to sort through her emotions , telling the `` Havana '' singer to `` just to write it out . ''
It 's not the first time Cabello has spoken publicly about her relationship with Swift , and when rumors surfaced that the megastar had encouraged Cabello to leave her former group Fifth Harmony , she set the story straight .
`` It annoyed me that people said that she was encouraging me because I know she probably got a lot of flack for that or a lot of negative criticism for that and that annoys me because I 'm really protective over my friends , '' Cabello said during an appearance on The Dan Wootton Interview podcast in March , Us Weekly reported . `` To be honest with you , she 's never , ever had anything to do with that . It 's so funny because when Taylor and I talk , and whenever we hang out , we talk about love and boys and we strategize over it . ''

Cabello also talked to Rolling Stone about leaving Fifth Harmony , which she likened to splitting from a romantic partner . `` It was as painful as a breakup , a five-year breakup , '' Cabello told the magazine .
She also maintained that while some people considered her departure from the group a grasp at greater stardom , that was not her intention and that the move was simply a natural next step . She explained ,
`` I do n't think there was ever a point where I was like , ' I want to leave because I 'm the breakout star . ' We were just really young . If we were in the same situation now , it would probably be fine for everyone to make their own music while being in the group , because I think everyone understands now that you ca n't limit people . That 's why people break free . ''
While Cabello 's choice to leave spawned some drama , with both parties holding fast to somewhat different versions of events , they have since wished each other well and Fifth Harmony recently announced a hiatus so other members of the group could focus on their solo endeavors as well .

Cabello also revealed that `` Havana , '' the song that helped her carve her own path , almost did n't make it to radio . She told Rolling Stone , `` Nobody wanted to make it a single . They said that radio would never play it , that it was too slow , too chill . '' Cabello fought for the song — with its sultry vibe and a chorus that does victory laps in your head long after it ends — to be released , and it went on to become a worldwide success , reaching the number-one in 23 countries .
`` It just taught me a huge lesson : Screw whatever 's ‘ going to work ' — you just have to go with the thing that you feel is the most you , '' Cabello added .
Cabello 's fans can see her perform that song and plenty of others as she continues to open for Swift on her Reputation Stadium Tour through the summer and into the fall . And knowing how close the two are IRL , it makes them take the stage together even sweeter .
Southampton have sacked manager Claude Puel with immediate effect .
The Frenchman took over at St Mary 's last summer and guided Saints to the EFL Cup final , where they lost to Manchester United , and an eighth-placed finish in last season 's Premier League .
But the board has opted to make a change , dismissing the former Lyon and Nice boss . A statement from Southampton said the club had `` terminated the contract of Claude Puel with immediate effect '' .
It continued : `` Everyone at Southampton would like to express our thanks to Claude for his hard work and commitment this year .
`` The highlight of the season was a memorable day at Wembley in the EFL Cup final , a day our fans will always treasure . We wish Claude well for the future .
`` The search for a new management team is under way .
`` We are confident that we will find the right fit in line with the long term vision of the club . ''
After a careful deliberation , the 12-man final roster of the men 's national team that will see action in the 29th Southeast Asian ( SEA ) Games has been formally named .
Team captain Johnvic De Guzman leads the squad that is a mixture of young and seasoned veterans and is highly capable of pulling off a serious run in the very prestigious tourney .
He will be backed by National University 's power hitter Bryan Bagunas as well as seasoned veterans Alnakran Abdilla and Reyson Fuentes of Philippine Air Force .
Cignal 's Mark Alfafara , Bonjomar Castel and Herschel Ramos also made the cut shortly after winning their second title in the Premier Volleyball League ( PVL ) Reinforced Conference .
UAAP standout Greg Dolor of Far Eastern University also made it together with Alden Cabaron , a gem of a talent from Cebu .
The 92nd NCAA Best Libero Jack Kalingking will man the defensive end to perfection while Relan Taneo and Geuel Asia will orchestrate the offense of the national squad .
John Eduard Carascal and Peter John Quiel , on the other hand , were named in the reserve list .
Despite the absence of today 's biggest names including the likes of UAAP four-time Most Valuable Player Marck Espejo and four-time Best Setter Ish Polvorosa , the men 's national team is still eager to prove its worth in the international arena .
The 92nd NCAA Best Setter Taneo said all they need to do is trust the program presented by head coach Sammy Acaylar to attain their goal .
“ Kahit hindi kami kilala , kahit nasa baba kami , nagte-training naman kami eh at saka tiwala naman kami sa mga coaching staff ng national team . ”
Facebook is rolling out a “ Trending News ” section on mobile that includes its own link in the app 's main navigation . This follows the company 's earlier announcement this spring of a redesign for Trending Topics , an increasingly important part of Facebook 's social network , where it tracks the news stories that are buzzing across its service . That redesign is now rolling out to users on iPhone and Android devices in the U.S. , while the added navigational link to Trending News became available on iPhone over the past few weeks , and is in testing on Android , Facebook tells us .
In case you missed Facebook 's announcement in May , the Trending Topics section was redesigned with a focus on making it easier to see how other publications are covering a topic , in addition to what friends and public figures are saying about the matter .
When you click into a Trending Topic following the update , Facebook explained you will see a carousel of stories from other publications that you swipe through horizontally .
The publications linked to in this section are determined by engagement around both the article and publisher in general on Facebook , as well as what other articles are linking to it .
This card-style carousel look-and-feel was inspired in part by Facebook Paper , the company 's long since shuttered standalone news reading app .
This carousel is still in the process of rolling out across the U.S .
Trending News feature in Facebook iOS app . # Facebook pic.twitter.com/uFhsOibwz0 — Jose Gutierrez ( @ fbjag ) August 9 , 2017
However , one aspect to Trending 's makeover that was n't really touched on during Facebook 's earlier announcement was how Facebook was toying with a redesigned list of news stories that focused on headlines , not just “ trending topics . ”
The original look for Facebook 's Trending Topics – which you pull up with a tap into the app 's search box – is a simple list of topics and the beginning of a lede that 's usually cut off . These appear below your own recent Facebook searches in the app .
However , if you access the new Trending News link that 's just popped up in Facebook 's navigation menu , you 'll see an entirely different sort of Trending section .
Above : Old Trending on left vs New Trending on right
Instead of a “ topic ” ( often just a word , person or place , like “ China ” or “ Donald Trump ” ) and squiggly arrow icon , the news stories here include a headline , a photo , the name of a major media outlet that 's reporting it , and how many other sources are available on the topic .
For example , next to the headline , it might say : “ Reuters and 100+ other sources . ”
Plus , by adding the photo next to each item , there 's more room for expanded information – that is , a full headline and sourcing .
The new section also gives stories a rank ( # 1 , # 2 , # 3 , …etc . )
Facebook 's prior announcement in May did n't specifically detail how this Trending News section looked different from Trending Topics .
Frankly , it 's all a bit confusing , because Trending Topics and Trending News do n't seem to be tied directly together at this point . For example , you could have the link to Trending News in your app 's main navigation , but still not have the new look for Trending Topics , which includes the carousel redesign .
However , in that same post , we did get a little peek at Trending News – but it was referenced as being a part of a “ small test . ”
Trending integration in News Feed still a “ small test ”
Facebook said then it was testing adding the top three Trending News stories to users ' News Feeds . In a screenshot of this , you were able to see this list of stories with photos that were ranked by numbers , as well as stories identified by headlines instead of just “ topics . ”
This integration of a “ mini ” Trending News section into News Feed is not broadly available . That remains a “ small test , ” we understand .
But the addition of the Trending News link to Facebook 's navigation is already live on iPhone , and being trialed on Android .
Of course , any changes Facebook makes to Trending are sure to met with a lot of scrutiny . The company last year faced criticism when it removed its human editors who curated this section , to run Trending by way of algorithms instead . ( And those algorithms soon screwed up . ) The social network has more recently made several changes to address the spread of fake news and filter bubbles , as well .
In this case , though , Facebook is not monkeying with how news is selected as “ Trending , ” only how it 's being displayed .
The new Trending News section joins a number of other new additions to Facebook 's main navigation as of late , including the food ordering option , Town Hall , weather , the Explore feed , and more . Not all these additions have stuck around – the new travel-focused City Guides section , for instance , has since disappeared .

PARIS : France and Germany will send two men , including an Iranian diplomat , to Belgium to face accusations they were involved in a plot to bomb an Iranian opposition rally on the outskirts of Paris , judicial sources said on Wednesday .
Belgium is already investigating two Belgians of Iranian origin arrested on Saturday , the day of the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) meeting . Five hundred grams of the homemade explosive TATP and a detonation device were found in their car .

Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot , which it called a `` false flag '' operation staged by figures within the opposition group itself .
The exiled Iranian opposition group 's meeting was attended by Donald Trump 's lawyer Rudy Giuliani , who gave a speech calling for the removal of Iran 's rulers .
In addition to the two people arrested in Belgium , an Austria-based Iranian diplomat was held in Germany , and a man of Iranian origin was held in France . Judicial authorities in France and Germany told Reuters Belgium had requested they be extradited .
`` It 's extremely sensitive and the Belgians are taking the lead , '' said one European intelligence source .

During a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to Vienna on Wednesday , Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to reporters that Rouhani had assured him that he would work to clarify the case .
French officials have declined to comment on the matter saying the nature of the incident is unclear .
Highlighting the political sensitivities , Iran summoned France 's ambassador to protest against the staging of the opposition meeting . Tehran `` strongly protested against the French support of activities of the terrorist organisation , '' referring to an exiled opposition group .
France 's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Since the United States withdrew in May from a deal to lift sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to Tehran 's nuclear programme , the deal 's European signatories Britain , France and Germany have said they want to save the accord . Iran has called on the European countries to offer economic benefits to make up for the damage caused by new U.S. sanctions .
Any suggestion that Iranian authorities were behind the plot in France could make it politically difficult for leaders , especially French President Emmanuel Macron , to continue to back the nuclear deal .
The Austrian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it was stripping the diplomatic status of the diplomat arrested in Germany . Iran 's foreign ministry has rejected as baseless the allegations against the diplomat .

University of the Visayas ( UV ) Baby Lancers point guard Beirn Laurente is raring to introduce himself to the national stage and will be bringing his fearless mentality to Manila after he was invited to take part in the tryouts for the National Basketball Training Center 's ( NBTC ) National All Star Game .
The 16-year old beamed with excitement upon learning of his selection to the prestigious tryouts . Joining him there is Jancork Cabahug , his stud teammate at UV , and Ateneo de Cebu standouts Errol Pastor and Andrew Velasco .
A relentless pitbull on the basketball court , Laurente is coming off an impressive showing in the recently concluded Cebu NBTC finals . In the deciding Game Three , with Cabahug hounded by Ateneo de Cebu 's swarming defense , the Baybay , Leyte-native stepped up and scored 22 points in the narrow loss .

And with the tryouts slated Feb. 25 and 26 at the San Beda campus in Mendiola looming on the horizon , Laurente vowed to play with the same relentless mentality that has helped him earn his lofty reputation in the high school ranks here in Cebu .
“ I feel very confident regardless of who I will be going up against at the tryouts . I do n't fear anyone regardless of who they are and how famous they are . I just have confidence in myself , ” said Laurente .
When asked where he got his aggressiveness from , Laurente said that he just learned to have it playing in different leagues and basketball games since he was taught the game at age of four .
The stocky 5-foot-7 guard expressed his gratitude for the opportunity he has been given to play for UV after he was discovered by the school 's lead scout , Van Halen Parmis , in a basketball clinic in his hometown .
“ There was a clinic in my hometown and coach Van ( Parmis ) was there . So he brought me over to Cebu where I tried out . And luckily , I got a spot on the team , ” Laurente stated .
Now , he will be looking to earn one of the 30 spots at stake for the much-anticipated all star game which will be played under the bright lights of the SM Mall of Asia Arena .
Chandigarh : Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh 's counsel has deposited Rs 30 lakh as fine with the special CBI court in Panchkula which had imposed the fine on the sect head convicted in two rape cases .
`` A sum of Rs 30 lakh has been deposited with the special CBI court on Saturday , '' Dera chief 's counsel , Vishal Garg Narwana , told PTI over the phone on Monday .
The fine was paid in the shape of a demand draft , he said .
In October , the Punjab and Haryana High Court had admitted the plea filed by the Dera chief challenging his 20-year sentence in two rape cases .
The HC had directed Ram Rahim 's counsel to deposit Rs 30 lakh as fine , which was imposed by the special CBI court on Ram Rahim , within two months .
The jailed Dera chief had moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 25 September , challenging the order of the special CBI Court of Panchkula which had sentenced him to 20-year-imprisonment for raping two disciples .
Ram Rahim was convicted by the special CBI court on 25 August , after which violence and arson erupted in Panchkula and Sirsa districts which left 41 people dead and scores injured .
Ram Rahim is currently lodged in Sunaria jail in Rohtak district .
A birthday celebration turned into a nightmare for a family who lost three members who drowned after strong waves caused their motorized boat to capsize and sink in the waters off Alegria town , 115.8 kilometers southwest of Cebu City , on Wednesday afternoon .
The fatalities , identified as Rosalyn Peligro , 31 ; Albert Lopez , 24 ; and Ruby Peligro , 27 , were heading home together with 12 other passengers when the boat 's engine suddenly died and was subsequently battered by rough waves .
Rechelle Torsiende , head of the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office in Alegria town , said the boat was overloaded since it was supposed to carry not more than 10 people .
The town police said the boat , with the marking “ PhilThai , ” was owned by Alberto Lendio Lopez , 51 , and a resident of Barangay Sta . Filomena , Alegria , where most of the victims were from .
The police said they learned of the incident at about 3:35 p.m. from a concerned citizen who informed them through cellular phone call regarding a motorboat that overturned at the sea off Barangay Madridejos , Alegria .
At least seven adults , including boat operator Jazreel Velonta Bendulo , 23 , and eight minors went island hopping before the incident happened at past 3 p.m .
All eight minors and four adults — most of whom were residents of Barangay Santa Filomena in Alegria town — were rescued .
“ Unfortunately , three of their companions died because they reportedly did n't know how to swim , ” Torsiende said .
The three casualties were rushed to the Reinhard Wirtgen Memorial Hospital in Alegria but were declared dead on arrival by the attending physician .
Torsiende said members of the family who knew how to swim and the boat operator first saved the children .
“ Kadtong nalumos , dili gyud kuno makamao molangoy ( Those who drowned really did n't know how to swim ) , ” said Torsiende .
Torsiende said it was not raining in Alegria when the boat capsized although the wind was strong .
Survivors
The survivors were identified as Daniel Togon , 23 ; Mary Grace Lopez , 21 ; Marites Salva , 20 ; Richelle Velonta , 17 ; Arnel Velonta , 9 ; Aldrid Dave Orot , 8 ; Kent Bernard Cabigas , 7 ; Reynard Velonta , 5 ; Daniel Dave Togon , 2 ; El Shane Ruby Lopez , 2 ; Isiah Andrey Lopez , 1 ; and boat operator Bendulo .
Baltazar Tribunalo Jr. , chief of the Cebu Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office ( PDRRMO ) head , said the victims ' family first celebrated the birthday of one of the minors in a beach resort in Barangay Madridejos , Alegria town on Wednesday morning .
They decided to go island hopping in the afternoon .
“ Padulong na ni sila og pauli sa dihang napalong ang ilahang bangka . Nikusog ang bawod mao tong nitikyaob ( They were on their way home when their boat 's engine conked out . It was then when the waves caused the vessel to capsize ) , ” said Tribunalo .
He said they will conduct an investigation to find out why the boat 's engine malfunctioned .
Joey Figuracion , weather specialist of the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( Pagasa ) -Mactan bureau , said isolated rainshowers and thunderstorms are expected in Algeria town in the next three days .
“ When there 's a thunderstorm advisory , we can anticipate strong winds . So we have to be really careful when we 're at sea or in an open area , ” he said .
“ I urge the public to take the precautionary measures , ” he added . /WITH REPORTS FROM MOREXETTE MARIE B. ERRAM

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain 's data protection authority plans to seek a warrant to search the offices on Tuesday of London-based political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica , UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told Channel 4 News on Monday .
Channel 4 broadcast secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with a menu of digital manipulation and traditional political trickery .
“ I think we should all be shocked by this , ” Denham told Channel 4 .
The Information Commissioner 's Office is conducting a broad probe into the use of personal data in British political campaigns , which Denham said concerned both Cambridge Analytica , Facebook and 30 different organisations and political parties .
The New York Times and the British Observer newspaper reported on Saturday that the political analytics firm had harvested private data on more than 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump 's 2016 presidential election campaign .
Cambridge Analytica and its executives did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment .
Chip and Tony Kinman are among the West Coast 's most infamous rock & roll provocateurs , a formidable twosome whose influential series of successive bandstand iterations — '77 punk originators Dils , '80s Americana architects Rank & File , electro-brutalists Blackbird and the frontier-philosophizing Cowboy Nation — represent some of the Golden State 's most insidiously creative stylistic insurgencies .
While elder sibling Tony serves today mainly as producer/co-writer , their wild , new Chip-fronted punk blues band Ford Madox Ford are vintage Kinman iconoclasm . The just-lensed video “ Dark American Night , ” a stabbing , hissing , steam-heated rumble of shadowy metaphor and high-voltage riff-torturing , ably represents the brothers ' ongoing safari through the American pop vernacular and upholds their long-standing tradition of shredding convention while reaching for a fresh , farther flung artistic standard .

Zane Najdawi scored 28 points , grabbed 10 rebounds and Frankie Johnson drove for one layup to force overtime and another to give The Citadel the lead for good in the extra period on Saturday and the Bulldogs defeated Furman 100-92 to cap an intense three-win home stand .
Languishing near the bottom of the Southern Conference standings four games ago , The Citadel ( 9-14 , 4-7 ) took undefeated conference leader ETSU to overtime , losing by two on the road when a last-second 3 rimmed out . Once home , the Bulldogs defeated Mercer for the first time in 91 years a week ago , rallied to bump off Wofford , one of the conference leaders , on Thursday , and did it again to Furman ( 16-8 , 7-4 ) Saturday .
The Paladins held a 17-point lead with 9:13 remaining when Devin Sibley hit a 3-pointer . The Citadel marched back , making its last seven field-goal attempts with Johnson driving to the hoop to tie 88-88 with 4.8 seconds remaining .
The rally continued into the overtime as Johnson drove for the go-ahead and kissed it off the glass for a 90-88 lead , the Bulldogs first since 25-24 of the first half , and they never let Furman come back , making 10 of 11 free throws .
Kaelon Harris scored 11 of his 18 points as The Citadel shot 12 of 15 during the pivotal game-ending run . Matt Frierson scored 21 points , Johnson finished with nine points and nine assists .
Furman was 4 of 11 with three turnovers in the late-game Citadel rally . John Davis and Sibley each scored 18 .
GRAND RAPIDS , Mich. ( WOOD ) — Imagine opening a package from the IRS and finding someone else 's tax return inside .
That 's exactly what happened to an Allegan County man . He turned to Target 8 when he could n't contact the IRS to make it right .
“ I 'm really kind of befuddled by the whole thing , ” Kevin Irwin said .
Irwin helps care for his father and ordered a copy of his father 's 2016 tax return as part of estate planning . A return came this week in the mail , but it was n't the one he was expecting .
“ I opened it up and found we had someone else 's tax return , ” Irwin said . “ The numbers are completely different than they should have been . I then looked up to the top to find out its a joint tax return for a couple in Minnesota . ”
The return of more than 20 pages was n't for Irwin 's father , but rather for a couple who live in Dennison , Minnesota . It included not only the couple 's Social Security numbers , but also the numbers for their children as well , along with income , investments and even the couple 's bank account and routing number .
Irwin called the number for the Grand Rapids IRS office . He contacted Target 8 after having trouble getting an appointment .
“ You have to have a form to make an appointment . Well , they do n't have a form for their screwup , so how do I make an appointment ? ” Irwin asked . “ They do n't have a form for their screwup . They do for ours , but they do n't for theirs , because apparently they do n't make them . Well , I have a big one here . ”
On top of his concern about getting someone else 's tax return , Irwin wonders if his father 's was sent to the wrong place , too .
“ Did they actually get a copy of theirs and we got a copy of theirs ? Or do they have my dad 's ? Or do they have Joe Smith 's ? I mean , how many people did this happen to on that particular day that these were sent out ? ” Irwin asked .
Target 8 tracked down the Minnesota couple and spoke to one of them by phone .
“ I never called and asked for a copy of my tax return , ” the taxpayer , who Target 8 is not identifying , said . “ I 'm definitely shocked and upset . ”
The man said he has no idea why the IRS would mail out a copy of his tax return .
“ I 'm very upset and hurt because that 's powerful information , ” he said .
Target 8 reached out to the IRS , which is taking a look into the situation . It 's still not clear why the wrong return was mailed to the Irwins . It 's not yet known if the elder Irwin 's tax return was mailed to the wrong address or not mailed out at all . His family is concerned about possible identity theft as a result of the mistake .
“ Where 's his , who 's got it ? ” the younger Irwin wondered . “ Do we really need to be monitoring everything or what do we need to do to stop anything from going wrong — have somebody clean out his accounts ? ”
Irwin also wonders how the IRS will be able to make this right .
“ The IRS is really quick to come after us for mistakes , but how do we reverse the process when they foul up ? ” he said .
The Minnesota taxpayer said he spent nearly an hour on hold Friday afternoon trying to speak with someone from the IRS , only to be eventually hung up on . He has spoken to Irwin about his return and what they will do with it to make sure the family 's information remains private .

China 's Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.41 per cent.The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.07 per cent higher in Friday 's trade .
Kings general manager Rob Blake notices it the most away from the ice .
It could be between periods or at practice . Blake will pick up on the mood when he makes his way through the hallway or passes through the Kings ' locker room . There , in those closed-door moments of preparation or rest , Blake sees where Jonathan Quick truly makes a difference .
“ I think we missed him in the room , his leadership , his voice , his demeanor between periods , all the stuff that fans never see , ” Blake said . “ This team missed that direly last year . We understand what he does on the ice . We see it every night , but I think the whole package of what he brings to this team , we missed that last year . The team missed it for sure . ”
Quick 's steadying presence is back in all forms . More than a year after an opening-night groin injury sent him to the sidelines and the Kings spiraling toward another playoff-less spring , Quick has morphed back into elite status and made an early case for his first Vezina Trophy , given to the goaltender judged to be the best at his position . Through Sunday , Quick was third in the NHL with a 2.18 goals-against average and .930 save percentage . He takes a personal six-game winning streak into Tuesday , with a 1.46 goals-against average in that run .
Deeper than the statistics is the way Quick has stolen games . He 's consistently kept the Kings upright while they 've worked through parts of a newer offensive approach that sometimes results in more defensive lapses . Quick 's athleticism and ability to cover the bottom of the net still impresses . Rookie Alex Iafallo marvels at some of Quick 's saves .
“ I have friends back home texting me , saying , ‘ Oh , wow . How cool was Quickie 's save in person ? ' ” Iafallo said . “ It gives us energy on the bench seeing that . It gives us momentum . It 's a huge factor in some of our wins . ”
Quick and the Kings like to talk about last season as much as they like finding a thumb tack in their skate . But Quick concedes that being able to play in the final portion of last season was a fine starting point for a rebound .
“ Injuries happen , ” Quick said . “ I think I was fortunate to be able to play a month and a half , two months of last year . We were still kind of in the mix . You kind of think about that … You try to learn from what we did wrong , the mistakes that we made and try to get better . ”
Quick also said there is an underlying drive behind him and teammates that stems from their recent early summers . Those failures came to a head when former coach Darryl Sutter was fired . Quick says the aftermath carried over to the players .
“ It 's on us , ” Quick said . “ We knew we had to be better . ”
Quick has more than held up his end following the second major groin injury of his career . He 's on pace to play in about 70 games , perhaps fewer if Darcy Kuemper continues to provide excellent backup work . With more than 500 games played , Quick knows how to manage his body more than ever . And it helps that goaltender coach Bill Ranford has been there throughout Quick 's career .
“ I 've been lucky having Billy all 10 years I 've been with the team , ” Quick said . “ He knows me really well — when to push me , when to cut back a little and get my legs back under me . It 's good . ”
If Quick perceives any slights , he wo n't let on . But his statement games suggest otherwise . Quick has beaten Vezina winners Carey Price , Sergei Bobrovsky and Braden Holtby in head-to-head matchups this season .
Ducks goalie Ryan Miller , who played on two U.S. Olympic teams with Quick , said the competitive part of Quick 's personality snaps into place with his position .
“ He found the right outlet for him — to be a goalie , ” said Miller , second behind Quick for the most shutouts among U.S.-born goalies .
“ It just seems like his battle level is high , and I think that 's the difference between a lot of goalies in this league : Are you able to work through ? Are you able to keep pushing ?
“ It 's not always going to be a clean play or work out in your favor . It seems like Quickie just kind of keeps going . If he gets frustrated , it turns toward the puck and not his teammates ; sometimes the other team here and there . ”
That 's a nod toward Quick 's well-known simmer . He 's also known as a consummate teammate , one who invited rookie Iafallo to his house for a Thanksgiving dinner .
“ He 's a nice guy , ” Miller said . “ He 's not a complete animal . ”
On this day , Quick was at his most relaxed . It was a morning skate for a game he would n't start , a rare time to reflect on this stage of his career . He 's 31 , a father of two and playing some of his best hockey in his 10th NHL season .
He 's a long way from where he started beside teammates Dustin Brown and Anze Kopitar .
“ We all still feel young some days , ” Quick said . “ Some days , you feel a little older . ”
Quick unstrapped his pads and glanced toward their lockers . They were gone , but Quick 's words and presence easily filled the empty room .

So the new liberal marijuana laws legalizing the drug will protect our “ youth , ” say Liberal cabinet ministers , noting their proposed increased penalties for providing pot to minors . Could they not have just increased and enforced these laws , anyway ?
Also , now that we will be able to have three plants in the homes , the kids will be able to pick off a leaf or two instead of finding it outside . How convenient !

Fight port development
It is time to bring things to a head and get the B.C . Liberal caucus involved in the issue of water protection , as discussed in a recent opinion piece by David Suzuki and Maude Barlow .
The Port of Vancouver 's Roberts Bank T-2 development project poses the risk of catastrophic effects on the Fraser River and a dramatic loss of Agricultural Land Reserve farmland to industrial status . There is no exact science to estimate the scope of the negative effects on the fishery , bird populations and wildlife habitat .
Let us try to save and protect the Fraser River and the estuary from this ludicrous master plan by the port and their cronies , who stand to make big bucks on this development .

Lock up the addicts
Recent Province articles reported on addicts overdosing as many as three times a day . Besides the harm and risk the addicts are doing to themselves , their behaviour also places great strain on our emergency response and emergency medical systems .
One solution would be to lock them up for a period of about 30 days on either legal or mental-health grounds . It would give them a chance to dry out and for social workers to work with them to try to cure their addiction .
I know this would n't be cheap to implement , but if all the current costs are added up , the status quo is n't cheap either .

Why did n't Liberals act ?
I have one question for the Green party and the NDP : What do you promise to do if you form government next month ?
I have three questions for the Liberals : What did you accomplish in your 16 years in power ? What do you promise to do if you form government again ? Why did n't you do all of those things you are now promising while you were in power ?

Do n't waste your vote
While I have no issue with furthering a legitimate , environmentally friendly agenda , those who are planning on voting for the Green party need to give that some serious thought . Voting Green will accomplish nothing in the current political climate other than to almost guarantee another four years of suffering under Christy Clark and the Liberals .
A change in government is far past due . The Liberals clearly think they rule this province by divine right . Their attitudes and actions have proven that repeatedly as they campaign with our tax dollars and laugh off all fact-based criticism .
Think twice and vote strategically . It is the only hope we have of sending the Liberals packing after 16 years .

The smell of bull
I was driving through Brookwood in Langley last week with my window down , enjoying the beautiful spring sunshine , when I smelled someone barbecuing steak ! I was astonished until I realized that the writ had dropped for the provincial election .
Aha ! That explains the smell of bull and blowing smoke !

Uber Technologies Inc is talking with Alphabet Inc 's autonomous driving unit Waymo about using its technology on Uber 's ride-hailing app , Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday , signaling a possible thaw in relations between the firms .
RANCHO PALOS VERDES , Calif. : Uber Technologies Inc is talking with Alphabet Inc 's autonomous driving unit Waymo about using its technology on Uber 's ride-hailing app , Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday , signaling a possible thaw in relations between the firms .
Khosrowshahi said on stage at the Code Conference that Uber 's relationship with Waymo was `` getting better '' since Uber in February agreed to pay Waymo US $ 245 million in shares to settle a legal dispute over trade secrets .

`` We 're having discussions with Waymo . If something happens , great . If not , we can live with that , too , '' Khosrowshahi said .
Waymo is an `` incredible technology provider '' and having it on Uber 's network would be a good thing , he added .
Waymo declined to comment . It has , though , proceeded with plans to operate without Uber 's help , developing a fleet of cars that it said has self-driven 6 million miles on public roads .
In a lawsuit filed last year , Waymo said that one of its former engineers who became chief of Uber 's self-driving car project took with him thousands of confidential documents . The lawsuit cost Uber both time and money in its self-driving car development .

Khosrowshahi said he believes the technology behind autonomous driving will be shared , and that any company such as Waymo that wants to lead the sector will need to partner with Uber because of Uber 's network of smartphone users .
Waymo plans to roll out an app-based service this year offering rides to passengers in a fully self-driving Waymo car with no driver . It also has a partnership with Lyft Inc , a rival of Uber .
Uber plans to restart its own self-driving car operation in the coming months , Khosrowshahi said . The company shut down testing in Arizona this month after a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles .
`` We will get back on the road over the summer , '' he said , adding that the fatal episode eventually `` is going to make us a better company '' .

A Hong Kong-based activist investor in Toshiba Corp has told the embattled conglomerate that the US $ 18 billion sale of its chip unit to a Bain Capital-led group is no longer necessary after its recent capital injection , according to a letter seen by Reuters .
TOKYO : A Hong Kong-based activist investor in Toshiba Corp has told the embattled conglomerate that the US $ 18 billion sale of its chip unit to a Bain Capital-led group is no longer necessary after its recent capital injection , according to a letter seen by Reuters .
Argyle Street Management Ltd , a hedge fund with US $ 1.2 billion under management , sent the letter to Toshiba 's board late on Monday , the fund 's chief investment officer , Kin Chan , told Reuters . The fund declined to say how many Toshiba shares it owns .
The first activist shareholder to openly voice opposition to the sale , Argyle is inviting the 30-plus overseas investors who participated in Toshiba 's recent 600 billion yen ( US $ 5.3 billion ) new share issue to team up and is already in talks with at least three funds who share the same view , Chan said .
Toshiba agreed to sell Toshiba Memory - the world 's no . 2 producer of NAND chips - to the Bain consortium to cover billions of dollars in liabilities arising from its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear power unit Westinghouse .
In order to ensure its listing status , however , Toshiba also secured a US $ 5.4 billion cash injection from overseas funds this month , which with tax write-offs gives it sufficient funds to cover its liabilities .
Argyle believes `` there no longer is any urgency to undertake a sale of Toshiba Memory , '' it said in the letter , which proposed a meeting with Toshiba 's board in either December or January .

The US $ 18 billion price tag for the chip unit `` significantly undervalues the business , '' the letter said , adding that the board should consider instead an IPO for Toshiba Memory .
Representatives for Toshiba and Bain were not immediately available for comment .
While the potential for activist funds to hinder or even scupper the deal with the Bain-led consortium will depend on how many join forces in opposition , Argyle 's letter underscores some fears that Toshiba had opened a potential can of worms by tapping activist shareholders in its new share issue .

TORONTO -
Ontario 's fiscal watchdog says the Liberal government will run a deficit this fiscal year , despite claims it has balanced the budget .
In a new report Monday , the Financial Accountability Office said the Liberals will run a $ 4 billion deficit in 2017-2018 , and will continue to be in the red over the next few years .
More moderate growth in revenues and the increasing fiscal impact of the province 's Fair Hydro Plan , which cuts electricity rates by 25 per cent , will take their toll on Ontario 's books the report notes . It also says a long-simmering accounting dispute between the Liberal government and Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk over how to count two public sector pension plans on the ledger is contributing to uncertainty .
“ We 've been very consistent that because of a number of factors we think the deficit will re-emerge , ” said FAO chief economist David West . “ Now , with this accounting debate it will become more significant . ”
The Liberals presented a balanced budget in the spring , a year ahead of the provincial election , and have promised to keep the books in balance through the next couple of years.The FAO , however , projects the government 's budget deficit will grow to $ 9.8 billion in 2021-2022 .
“ The government is out borrowing this money , ” West said . “ This current year they 're going to borrow $ 23 billion in the markets . That 's going to rise to $ 45 billion in the coming years . ”
The FAO also said the government 's new hydro plan will add $ 3.2 billion to the budget deficit by 2021-2022 .
Last year Lysyk questioned the province 's decision to include a pair of public pensions — the Ontario Public Service Employee 's Union Pension Plan and the Ontario Teacher 's Pension Plan — as assets on its balance sheet .
The FAO said in its report that since the government has not adopted the auditor 's recommended accounting for both the pension assets , and with the addition of the Fair Hydro Plan , it is becoming more difficult for legislators and the public to assess the government 's fiscal projections .

North Korea 's leader has delayed a decision on firing missiles towards Guam while he watches U.S. actions a little longer , the North 's state media said on Tuesday , as South Korea 's president said Seoul would seek to prevent war by all means .
SEOUL/WASHINGTON : North Korea 's leader has delayed a decision on firing missiles towards Guam while he watches U.S. actions a little longer , the North 's state media said on Tuesday , as South Korea 's president said Seoul would seek to prevent war by all means .
In his first public appearance in about two weeks , Kim Jong-un inspected the command of the North 's army on Monday , examining a plan to land four missiles near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam , the official KCNA said in a report .
`` He said that if the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity , testing the self-restraint of the DPRK , the latter will make an important decision as it already declared , '' the report said .
The DPRK stands for North Korea 's official name , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .
Pyongyang 's plans to fire missiles near Guam prompted a surge in tensions in the region last week , with U.S. President Donald saying the U.S. military was `` locked and loaded '' if North Korea acted unwisely .
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday there would be no military action without Seoul 's consent and his government would prevent war by all means .

`` Military action on the Korean peninsula can only be decided by South Korea and no one else can decide to take military action without the consent of South Korea , '' Moon said in a speech to commemorate the anniversary of the nation 's liberation from Japanese military rule in 1945 .
`` The government , putting everything on the line , will block war by all means , '' Moon said .
MILITARY DRILLS
The Liberation day holiday , a rare one celebrated by both North and South , will be followed next week by joint U.S.-South Korean military drills sure to anger Pyongyang .
China , North Korea 's main ally and trading partner , has repeatedly urged Pyongyang to halt its weapons programme and South Korea and the United States to stop military drills to lower tensions .
The state-run Global Times said on Tuesday that Seoul should play a buffer between the United States and North Korea to prevent a head-on confrontation .
`` The drill will definitely provoke Pyongyang more , and Pyongyang is expected to make a more radical response , '' the paper said in an editorial . `` If South Korea really wants no war on the Korean Peninsula , it should try to stop this military exercise . ''
The United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce , not a peace treaty .
Asian shares rose for a second day on Tuesday and the dollar firmed after Kim 's comments further eased tensions and prompted investors to move back into riskier assets .
Kim Dong-yub , a professor and a military expert at Kyungnam University 's Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul urged caution in assuming North Korea was bluffing with its missile threats .
`` There is no stepping back for North Korea . Those who do n't know the North very well fall into this trap every time ( thinking they are easing threats ) but we 've seen this before . ''
TAKE IT DOWN
U.S. officials have in recent days played down the risk of an imminent conflict while stressing their preparedness to respond militarily to any attack from North Korea .
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday the U.S. military would know the trajectory of a missile fired from North Korea within moments and would `` take it out '' if it looked like it would hit the U.S. Pacific territory .
`` The bottom line is , we will defend the country from an attack ; for us ( U.S. military ) that is war , '' Mattis said .
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praised a commitment by Trump that the United States would stand with its allies in the region to counter threats from North Korea .
In a telephone call on Tuesday , Abe also agree with Trump that their top priority regarding North Korea was to do what they could to halt missile launches by the regime .
Japan , which would be under the flight path of any missile fired towards Guam , will be seeking further reassurance from Washington in meetings between Japan 's defence chief and foreign minister and their U.S. counterparts on Thursday .
`` The strategic environment is becoming harsher and we need to discuss how we will respond to that , '' a Japanese foreign ministry official said in a briefing in Tokyo . `` We will look for the U.S. to reaffirm it defence commitment , including the nuclear deterrent , '' he added .

Nyesom Wike , Governor of Rivers State , has denied insinuations that he insulted people of the South East in the Peoples Democratic Party , PDP .
Wike said this in Abuja while dismissing claims that he tried to hijack the weekend 's National Convention of the party .
The governor urged party Chieftains to be good winners and losers .
He said , “ When people want something , you hear all sorts of stories . Someone comes to you that he wants your support and you do not give him because you have someone else you are supporting , then he will say you are imposing and all that .
“ If you had supported him , it would not be imposition . What we have here is not a case of imposition ; if it had been imposition , the party would have come out to say only aspirant A or B should be chairman . It has never happened in the history of the national convention in PDP , where many aspirants are jostling for the same position . So where is the imposition ?

“ We must learn to be good winners and good losers ; you can not expect that because you have gone to delegates to convince them , then they must all support you . They will listen to everybody and at the end of the day , they will make up their minds .
“ What did I say about the Yoruba ? They told me that the South-West region has never produced the national chairman of the party and that giving it to them would change the fortune of the party in the region and I told them that the South-West too has never produced the national chairman .
“ I also asked them that when the South-West produced the president , what was the fortune of the party and how would national chairman of the party change the fortune of the party in the region . That was what I said . So , how did I insult anybody ? ”
Cameroon has transferred six schools affiliated with the Gülenist Terror Group ( FETÖ ) , the terrorist organization behind the 2016 defeated coup in Turkey , to a special Turkish foundation . `` Cameroon authorities told us that those who dared to commit such a betrayal are a threat to Cameroon too , '' Hüsnü Murat Ülkü , Turkey 's ambassador to Cameroon , told Anadolu Agency ( AA ) yesterday , referring to the defeated July 15 coup attempt , which took 251 lives and injured 2,200 .
Cameroon showed great solidarity with Turkey by transferring the FETÖ schools to the Turkish Maarif Foundation , he added .
Turkey established the Maarif Foundation in 2016 to take over the administration of overseas schools linked to FETÖ . It also establishes schools and education centers abroad . Dozens of African countries have handed over FETÖ schools to Maarif or closed them down at Ankara 's request .
Ülkü explained that Cameroonian authorities waited until the end of the school year so as to minimize the disruption for students .
Relations between Turkey and Cameroon are excellent , he said .
`` The transfer of the schools is a development which confirms strong bonds and solid friendship , '' Ülkü added .
Birol Akgün , Maarif 's head , thanked the Cameroonian government and stressed Maarif will do a better job educating its young students .
`` We will continue to take over FETÖ-affiliated schools in Africa and in various parts of the world , '' he explained .
Turkey has asked several countries to shut down dozens of schools , colleges and businesses linked to the FETÖ network in the wake of the July 15 coup attempt.Ankara says FETÖ is behind a long-running campaign to overthrow the Turkish state by infiltrating Turkish institutions , particularly the military , police and judiciary .
The terrorist group is also known to operate hundreds of schools under the auspices of its network around the world . For decades , it disguised itself as a charity movement with religious undertones , opening schools , charities and companies in numerous countries where the children of the elite are enrolled , thus extending its international clout , said prosecutors investigating the international network .
FETÖ members enjoyed safe haven in most countries they operated in before the 2016 coup attempt , but Turkey 's diplomatic efforts after the putsch bid have paid off with most countries agreeing to cooperate with Ankara in the crackdown on the terrorists .
Artists from Green Fools Theatre are spending time with a group of Calgary children from a variety of backgrounds to teach them some unusual but useful skills .

“ I usually like the aerials and stuff , ” said Mimi Sakr . “ I love gymnastics so that 's why . ”
Green Fools Theatre has run the program for 17 years and it is funded by a number of sponsors including Cirque de Soleil
The program ends with A Circus of Unity at the Jubilee Auditorium on August 29th and the show is open to the public .

Referees at this year 's Confederations Cup in Russia will have the power to abandon games over discriminatory behaviour by fans as part of a three-step procedure to promote fair-play during the tournament , governing body FIFA has said .
REUTERS : Referees at this year 's Confederations Cup in Russia will have the power to abandon games over discriminatory behaviour by fans as part of a three-step procedure to promote fair-play during the tournament , governing body FIFA has said .
The procedure allows referees to halt the match and make a public announcement over discriminatory fan behaviour , temporarily suspend the game if the problem persists and completely stop the match if the behaviour does not stop .
The governing body also introduced an initiative to deploy anti-discrimination officials into the crowd to detect and report abusive behaviour .
`` These are ground-breaking changes in the global fight against discrimination that will mark the 2017 edition of the FIFA Confederations Cup , '' FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement .
`` Both initiatives are extra tools for the referees and match officials to prevent discriminatory attitudes and ensure that the atmosphere in the stadium is one of fair play and respect . ''

The absence of prosecution witness on Monday stalled the continuation of trial in the alleged murder case filed against Maryam Sanda , and three others before Justice Yusuf Halilu of the FCT High Court , Jabi .
The other defendants are : Mrs Maimuna Aliyu , Maryam 's mother , Aliyu Sanda , the brother and Sadiya Aminu , the housemaid .
The other three defendants were accused of aiding Maryam in carrying out the alleged murder of Bilyaminu Bello , the son of a former PDP Chairman , Mr Haliru Bello , on Nov. 19 , 2017 .
Justice Halilu adjourned for continuation of trial until April 19 and April 20 , at the instance of the prosecution counsel , Mr James Idachaba .
Idachaba informed the court that the witness he intended to present could no longer be sighted .
Idachaba said that the prosecution came to court with two witnesses , and that the witness he intended to start with was nowhere to be found .
He urged the court to disregard the submission of the defence counsel , Mr Joseph Daudu ( SAN ) , urging the court to dismiss the murder charge against the defendants .
“ We are in total opposition of the application to dismiss the charge against the defendants , we have filed a 22-paragraph affidavit , the application by the defence counsel to dismiss the charge against the defendants should be dismissed .
“ The submission that the charge against the defendants is incompetent is totally misconceived .
“ Plea had already been taken , we urge the court to dismiss that relief and refuse granting the prayers , '' Idachaba said .
Daudu had prayed the court to quash the charges against the defendants , adding that the prosecution did not follow the right process before filling the charges .
According to Daudu , the matter should have been transmitted to the Attorney-General immediately the police finished their investigation .
He said that the police do not have the power to prosecute such murder case and that the power was only vested with the Attorney-General of the Federation .
Daudu had urged the court to dismiss the suit as the police failed to do the proper thing .
“ The originating process is defective ; the prosecution did not follow the normal procedure before it filed the matter , the prosecution has denied the intervention of the Attorney-General in this matter .
“ There are steps that ought to be taken before the prosecution could institute the matter , which it failed to do , '' he said .
Daudu urged the court to grant all the prayers of the defendants and dismiss the charge in its entirety .
The Trump administration said Friday that it will limit an Obama-era rule that employers must provide women with contraceptives as part of their health plans , giving a broad exemption for executives or owners who have religious or moral objections to doing so .
The Obama administration treated birth control as preventive care that must be covered by health insurance and gave female employees access to the full range of contraceptives at no cost .
That rule has been under constant attack from conservative religious groups even though it exempted churches and houses of worship . The Obama administration also gave a partial exemption to religious nonprofit groups , including schools and charities , so they did not have to directly pay for the contraceptives . Instead , their insurers paid for the coverage .
The Supreme Court in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case extended the exemption to those corporate employers who said they had a sincere religious objection to certain forms of birth control . The decision rested on the federal law that protects religious freedom , but the court 's majority opinion assumed female employees would still receive contraceptive coverage through an insurer .
Government lawyers argued in that case that providing free contraceptives saved insurers money over the long term because it reduced costs associated with pregnancies .
But objections continued from religious-liberty advocates who argued that faith-based employers would be “ complicit in sin ” if their insurance policies paid for “ morning after ” pills and certain other contraceptives that they believe are a form of abortion .
In early May , President Trump issued an executive order calling on then-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to revise the contraceptive regulation “ to address conscience-based objections . ”
A few weeks later , the department issued a lengthy draft that proposed to shield employers if they “ have religious beliefs or moral convictions objecting to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptives or sterilization. ” Moreover , these employers would not be required to assure that their insurers would still provide the coverage .
“ This would be a huge change . It would leave countless women without the coverage they need , ” said Gretchen Borchelt , vice president for reproductive rights at the National Women 's Law Center . “ We are exploring a number of potential legal challenges . ”
The contraceptive mandate has broad popular support , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . It cited a 2015 poll that found respondents said , by 71 % to 25 % , that they supported requiring health insurance plans “ to cover the full cost of birth control . ”
A change in the federal rules may have less impact in states including California , Illinois and Maryland , which all recently strengthened their laws requiring health insurers to cover the cost of contraceptives .

The Oodua Peoples Congress , OPC , has condemned some northern elders for backing out on regionalisation of the country as agreed upon at the 2014 National Conference organised by the administration of former president Goodluck Jonathan , stressing that their about-face was an affront to the collective psyche of Nigerians .
Rising from an emergency meeting on Sunday , the OPC accused northern elite of acting like they own Nigeria , insisting that regionalism was the minimum option for a united Nigeria , failure of which the country would be heading towards the path of disintegration .
Northern leaders , who were members of the 2014 National Conference , had last week under the auspices of the Northern Delegates ' Forum , NDF , rejected calls in some parts of the country for Nigeria to be restructured .
They complained that the North was not given fair representation in the conference with 189 delegates despite its landmass of 70 per cent and 55 per cent of the country 's population .
NDF dissociated itself “ from any attempt by any group to seek to implement or force the federal government or any of its institutions to use the report of the conference , under any guise for the purpose of restructuring Nigeria ” .
But in a statment signed by its national coordinator , Otunba Gani Adams , OPC decried the pronouncement of the Arewa elders , saying it was a call for anarchy in a country that is in dire need for actions .
He stated that the declaration of the northern elders is mere figment of their own imagination that can not represent the stance of the majority of northerners , nay the generality of the citizens of the country , particularly at this point of palpable lop-sidedness and leadership inequalities .

“ We view the recent back out of some northern elders on the resolution for regionalisation of the country as panacea for a stronger Nigeria as a gross display of irresponsibility , reckless approach to sensitive matter bothering on national security cum unity and an affront on the collective psyche of Nigerians .
“ The agreement to the regionalisation of the country after failed attempts to unite the country in the past was a collective one at a rare seating where every ethnic nationalities that make up the country had the rare chance to sit together to discuss the future of the country .
“ To now make a detour at this time that the country is almost approaching a brick wall on the path of national cohesion is simply unpatriotic .
“ We are not unaware of the desperate moves going on underground by a cabal that have all the while constituted the tail wagging the dog of unity in Nigeria , that are so comfortable with the lingering lopsided presidential system that is deliberately skewed to favour indolence and evil manipulations that allows a few to benefit at the expense of others .
“ Let it be known to those supporting the continuation of the current locust regime that the only alternative to regionalisation of Nigeria is self-determination .
“ Nigeria started with a system that allowed each region to develop at its own space and the Yoruba benefitted a lot from the system which promoted hard work and rapid development across the country .
“ We built our nation to be the pride of the world under that system and as such tip it as the minimum condition for our unity in diversity , as a country .
“ Let the message be sounded in the ears of those scheming to promote laziness and stampede the entire populace in their desperate bid to continue to hold the country back on the path of development and accelerated pace in the march towards global advancements , that they will not succeed , ” OPC asserted .

White supremacist site the Daily Stormer needs to find another domain provider after getting the boot from GoDaddy . In a tweet , the company said “ We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider , as they have violated our terms of service . ”
We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider , as they have violated our terms of service . — GoDaddy ( @ GoDaddy ) August 14 , 2017
The tweet was made in response to one by The New Agenda founder Amy Suskind calling on GoDaddy to ban Daily Stormer for posting a obscene article about Heather Heyer , who was killed in Charlottesville on Saturday after being hit by a car allegedly driven by James Alex Fields Jr. into a crowd . Fields has been charged with second-degree murder .
Heyer was among a group protesting to Unite the Right white supremacist rally this weekend , which the Daily Stormer helped organize and promote .
In an email to TechCrunch , a GoDaddy spokesperson said “ We have informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider , as they have violated our terms of service . If no action is taken after 24 hours , we will cancel the service . Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act , we believe this type of article could incite additional violence , which violates our terms of service . ”
GoDaddy only provides the domain for Daily Stormer and does not host the site , which calls itself “ The World 's Most Genocidal Republican Website. ” While GoDaddy 's action is laudable , it 's also important to note that activists , including the Southern Poverty Law Center , began calling on GoDaddy to stop providing Daily Stormer 's domain several months ago .
GoDaddy joins Airbnb and Twilio as tech companies taking action aimed at combatting hate speech in reaction to to Unite the Right rally . Airbnb deactivated the accounts of several users who were planning to attend the event , while cloud communications platform Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson said it will add “ an explicit prohibition of hate speech ” in the company 's acceptable use policy this week .
Wheatland , Missouri ( April 24 , 2018 ) – Following a Friday night venture to the Thunderbird Speedway in Muskogee , OK the Lucas Oil MLRA Late Model Series will look to wrap up their 3rd weekend swing of the season on Saturday night April 28th , at the Legit Speedway Park in West Plains , MO .
This highly anticipated event will be a reunion of sorts for the MLRA , as they have not held an event on the 3/8-mile red clay facility since the end of the 2011 season . Both events in what was the season finale for the series were won by veteran Billy Moyer .
Making this weekend 's finale at West Plains even more exciting will be the fact that for the first time this season the stars of the MLRA will go head-to-head with the drivers of the Comp Cams Super Dirt Series Presented by Lucas Oil , in a co-sanctioned event .
Both regional touring series will bring their own line-up of stars to the stage in what should present a large field of super late models , all seeking the $ 3,000 top prize . The event presented by West Plains Resaw & Missouri Hardwoods , expects to showcase drivers from as far away as Iowa and Wisconsin as well as more local drivers from Missouri , Oklahoma , and Arkansas to name a few .
Heading into Saturday night 's clash on a high note with the MLRA is Mason Oberkramer . The driver of the XR1 Rocket Chassis from Broseley , MO current sits in a tie for 8th in the series standings after four events , impressive to say the least for a driver that actually missed qualifying for the season opening event at LaSalle Speedway .
Oberkramer was the 2010 track champion at Legit Speedway Park in their Crate Late Model class , and is excited to get back to his home track this Saturday . Mason said , “ We have a pretty good notebook there so I am pretty confident going back there this weekend . Having the experience at a track and the notes is always something good to have in your back pocket . ”
This weekend 's event will be Oberkramer 's 2nd visit to the speedway this season following an early season practice session . “ We went there and tested earlier this year before LaSalle , and we actually felt like we found some things to get us up towards the front instead of mid-pack . I think we have something that will be competitive . ”
Oberkramer 's family driven race team , who receives support from Scott Bailey Racing Engines , is making their first attempt in 2018 at following the MLRA Series . “ We had no intention on running for points to start the year , but having done well the first couple nights out , it 's now in the works . ”
“ We are better now than where we finished last year . We finished 6th at the Fall Nationals at Wheatland and set fast time . It all just started clicking right there at the end of last year and we have just kind of carried that momentum over into this season . ”
MLRA fans and officials should have a better idea following this weekend 's action as to who will go all-in for chasing the 2018 series championship , as the points battle starts to take shape . Chris Simpson comes into the weekend as the series overall points leader while Payton Looney leads a deep field of drivers gunning for Sunoco Rookie honors .
Saturday 's support class action will include IMCA Modifieds , Super Stocks , Hobby Stocks , USRA B Modifieds , and Bone Stocks .

MULTAN - PTI Vice Chairman Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that more important personalities will defect from PML-N and PPP to Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf ( PTI ) , and both the parties would hardly find even a single candidate in the coming 2018 election .
Speaking at a public gathering in NA-157 on Tuesday , he added that the wave of change had started blowing in the country and Imran Khan 's caravan had started moving towards its destination . He said that both the PML-N and PPP were afraid of PTI 's popularity as their prominent leaders had joined PTI . He said that the people of Pakistan would lay foundation of a new Pakistan on July 25 where there would be rule of law .
Commenting on caretaker set-up , he welcomed the nomination of Justice ( retd ) Nasirul Mulk as caretaker prime minister , and said that the PTI hoped that he would nominate such administrative officers and members of cabinet who would hold free , fair and transparent elections in the country . He said that the leader and opposition leader of the house discharged their national obligations and nominated Justice Nasirul Mulk . He said that the PTI welcomed the nomination . He said that the PTI had one-point stance on caretaker set-up that they should hold free , fair and transparent election .
He said that Justice Nasirul Mulk led the commission which was formed by the Chief Justice during the sit-in of PTI . He added that the ruling given by Justice Nasirul Mulk regarding sit-in was before the nation while he also knew all the facts about 2013 elections . He hoped that the caretaker prime minister would play a strong role in elections .
Earlier , he said that South Punjab province is not an election stunt rather it is a long-standing demand of the local people .
He added that it was a good omen that both PPP and PML-N had expressed their willingness to create South Punjab province which was reflective of the fact that national consensus was developing on the issue . “ If it had been an election stunt , why it would have Prime Minister Abbasi promised that next N Government would create the province , ” he noted .
He said that the past governments kept the region backward and handed just deprivations to the residents of South Punjab . He maintained that the South Punjab region was given under the supervision of Takht-e-Lahore but now the time had come to elimination the deprivations of South Punjab .
“ Both the PPP and PML-N have been in the government in the past . If both the parties had been willing , new province would have been created but both the parties befooled the residents of the region in the name of province and got votes , ” he alleged . He maintained that the PPP and PML-N leaders attained high offices with the help of votes of residents of South Punjab and then disappeared , forgetting the poor people of the region .
He asserted that the practice would not continue anymore as new province was part of PTI 's manifesto and it would fulfill the long-standing demand of residents of South Punjab after coming to government . He said that the province was part of first 100-day agenda of PTI but the people would have to get the PTI clear majority first so that it could implement its agenda after coming to power .
He said that the election schedule had been announced by the Election Commission and now it was his request to the PTI workers to spend all of their energies on election process . “ Take Imran Khan 's message door to door , convince men , women and elderly citizens to vote for PTI so as to ensure their bright future , ” he added . He said that he could predict confidently that the future was PTI 's and Imran Khan would be the next prime minister of Pakistan . Earlier , former UC Nazim Rana Sher Afgan announced to join PTI along with his entire group .

SOFIA/BERLIN/BRUSSELS : China meets central and eastern European leaders on Saturday for a summit where Beijing 's promises of big infrastructure deals will come under greater scrutiny with some participants saying the annual gatherings yield little .
States from the Baltics to the Balkans will meet China 's Premier Li Keqiang at the seventh `` 16+1 '' summit in the Bulgarian capital , hoping for fresh money from Chinese companies backed by state banks .

More than 250 Chinese companies and 700 business people from central and eastern Europe are expected to attend a special economic forum alongside the summit .
`` Our main goal is to increase Chinese business presence in Bulgaria and in the whole region of central and eastern Europe , '' Bulgaria 's Deputy Foreign Minister Georg Georgiev told Reuters .
The gathering , less than two weeks before the European Union 's annual summit with China in Beijing , is unpopular in Brussels , which sees it as an attempt to divide the European Union . The EU is also resisting Chinese pressure to agree a joint stance against U.S. trade policies at the Beijing meeting .
China denies it is seeking to undermine the EU .

Li , who arrives in Sofia on Thursday in the first official visit by a Chinese prime minister to Bulgaria in almost two decades , published an article in two Bulgarian newspapers on Wednesday headlined : `` New beginning , new hope , new journey '' .
`` China , now and in the future , supports European integration and welcomes a united , stable , open and prosperous Europe and a strong euro , '' Li said .
MODEST EXPECTATIONS
Besides China , the 16 countries that participate in the summits include EU members Bulgaria , Croatia , Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia , as well as non-EU states Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Macedonia , Montenegro and Serbia .
First held in Warsaw in 2012 , the format was initially embraced , as China promised billions of dollars in loans and investments for countries reliant on EU development funds , or in the case of the poorer Western Balkans , desperate for outside money to build railways , roads , airports and power stations .
But some countries have started to grumble about a lack of results , sometimes involving the use of Chinese labour and materials , finance and contractual terms , and difficulties with EU standards .
The summit agenda is more modest this time around , in part because it takes place only seven months after the last meeting in Hungary in November .
Earlier this year , European officials told Reuters that China was considering moving to bi-annual summits , in part because it was worried that the format was hurting its image in western European capitals .
But Beijing abruptly reversed course after the negative press , setting a much earlier date than expected , just before Premier Li is due to attend German-Chinese government consultations in Berlin .
`` The Chinese saw an opportunity , '' said a German diplomat . `` Now Li can swoop into Berlin from the 16+1 summit in Sofia . They want to send a message to us . ''
China and hosts Bulgaria are struggling to find a main theme for the final summit communique , European diplomats said , as individual governments seek to negotiate language to reflect their own interests . The EU will have observer status at the summit . Greece , not part of 16+1 , has also been invited .
At a preparatory meeting in Sofia in early June , Poland expressed frustration with the way the summits were organised and the final communique put together , according to participants . It is one of several eastern European countries that have come to view the summits with scepticism after years of unfulfilled investment pledges .
Warsaw says Chinese firms abandoned several construction sites in Poland before the Euro 2012 soccer championships .
Slovakian officials also say there are no major Chinese investments in the country at present , while in Romania , a 2015 agreement with China to build two more nuclear reactors worth some 6 billion euros ( £5.30 billion ) has not progressed .
Hungary and Serbia , however , remain enthusiastic . A delegation of German and French diplomats travelled to Budapest this year to convince Hungary to distance itself from China , but were rebuffed , according to officials in Berlin .
INVESTMENT SHORTFALL
Many of the funding offers for infrastructure are part of Beijing 's `` Belt and Road '' plan to build transport and trade links from Asia to Europe , as China looks to increase influence .
Last month , Hungary finalised the construction timetable with China for the Budapest-Belgrade rail link , one of the biggest Chinese-backed infrastructure projects in the region .
Outside of Hungary , Chinese investments have not met expectations , even if the exact amounts are unclear .
China 's commerce ministry said last year that China 's cumulative investment in central and eastern European countries had risen to more than US $ 8 billion by 2016 .
Another estimate by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank said Chinese pledged around US $ 15 billion in investments between 2012 and 2016 .

LONDON : European stock markets mostly fell on Monday ( Dec 11 ) , with investors treading water ahead of key central bank policy meetings later this week , traders said .
On the other side of the Atlantic , Wall Street stocks edged higher as investors shrugged off an explosion near Times Square that resulted in a handful of injuries , none of them life-threatening .
`` It 's been another quiet start to trading in what is otherwise going to be a very busy week in financial markets , with a number of central banks scheduled to make interest rate announcements , '' said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam .
AxiTrader analyst James Hughes also noted the `` subdued '' start to the week , when `` the big headline act ... is undoubtedly the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday night '' .
There was likely to be `` a degree of caution ahead with traders not willing to take on too many large positions ahead of what is believed to be a 25 basis-point hike in rates in the US , '' the expert said .
European bourses were lower at the close of the session , with Frankfurt and Paris both slipping by around 0.2 per cent , while London bucked the trend , showing a gain of around 0.8 per cent .

Eyes are now on the Fed 's last monetary policy meeting of the year , which winds down on Wednesday .
Most analysts expect the central bank 's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to lift interest rates again , but they will be even more interested in what boss Janet Yellen has to say about the timetable for future increases .
`` The Fed will no doubt provide markets with a central focus this week , where the FOMC are expected to come good on their promise of three rate hikes for 2017 , '' said IG analyst Joshua Mahony .
`` With market expectations for 2018 somewhat up in the air , there is a feeling that investors are hungry for clues as to where things will stand in 12-months ' time . ''

The latest season of ABC 's The Bachelorette kicked off on Monday , with dozens of men vying for the heart of Becca Kufrin . A publicist currently living in Minneapolis , Kufrin is a Prior Lake native whose debut on the franchise came during this year 's season of The Bachelor , when she was first proposed to and then dumped by wishy-washy race car driver Arie Luyendyk Jr .
Most of the show will be set in L.A. 's `` Bachelor Mansion '' and other far-flung locales , but Monday gave us a little scene-setting in the Gopher State , and we can expect to return to Minnesota when Becca brings her final few favorites back for `` hometown dates '' later this season .
Things did n't get off to the greatest start when Becca and three former Bachelorettes lit a bushel of sage and conducted a ceremony intended to purge her body of `` bad juju '' ( the smoke detector went off ) , but the world did get at least a glimpse of Becca 's home state . What did viewers learn , and what did we learn about ourselves ?
Minnesota is gorgeous ... and frigid
Franchise veterans knew that the most glamorous Minnesota shots would come during the season 's early scenes , when stars are typically depicted wandering their local haunts looking sexy , available , and reflective . After a predictably painful flashback , we got some glimpses of Becca strolling through a barren and snowy Minnehaha Park , the falls coursing through the ice . It was like Game of Thrones , except without any dragons ... or living things at all , other than the Bachelorette .
Becca looked similarly solo during a visit to the Marjorie McNeely Conservatory , seemingly the one place where a lonely lady might find warmth and hope out here on the tundra . Like little Karen in Frosty the Snowman , Becca huddled in the greenhouse ; it was easy to imagine her dreaming of a suitor who would whisk her away to a habitable climate . The irony of Minnesota actually buckling under a record-breaking heat wave as the episode aired was lost on no one ( except for everyone ) .
Minnesota really hates Arie
The first evidence that anyone other than Becca and her family live here came during a montage with scenes including a stroll across the Stone Arch Bridge , where the Bachelorette was greeted by a University of Minnesota track team . We also got a shot of Becca standing on the steps of the State Capitol , being presented with a very official-looking document as a very white-looking crowd cheered wildly .
Becca 's voiceover narration suggested that Arie has been `` banned '' from Minnesota `` for life , '' although the truth is that an Arie ban was simply proposed by state Rep. Drew Christensen ( R-Savage ) . The document Christensen was seen presenting Becca with was a copy of the bill , which the lawmaker did in fact introduce in the state legislature .
It did n't pass , because it was just a big publicity stunt ... and also because we 've basically stopped passing laws in this state . Our conservative legislature apparently does n't hate Arie quite as much as it hates public transit , but the people have spoken . `` Proud to be from Minnesota ! '' declared the winter-coated Bachelorette .
Everyone in Minnesota has met everyone else ... several times
As Bachelorette premieres go , Becca 's was relatively low-drama , but there were a couple of speed bumps along Kufrin 's road to wedded bliss . One came in the form of a text supposedly suggesting that a would-be Becca bae was not there for the right reasons . That led to a confusing conversation , but the only contestant who was straight-up booted before the inaugural rose ceremony even began was Jake Enyeart , a guy from Minnesota . Whaaaaat ?
Here 's the story . Becca — of course — knew Jake . The Bachelorette likes to throw little curveballs like this : Becca 's predecessor Rachel Lindsay actually had a suitor she 'd been a counselor for at summer camp .
In this case , Enyeart swore he only remembered meeting Becca at a Christmas party , and that he was completely ready to explore a relationship with her , having experienced `` a very transformative year '' and being `` a new Jake . ''
Kufrin corrected him , though : `` We 've met many times before , '' she pointed out , and on those occasions she 'd picked up a vibe suggesting that he was n't into her . So what was he doing on her season ? Looking for Instagram followers , she seemed to suspect . Bye now !
So basically , what the world learned is that if you put two potentially compatible people from Minnesota in a room together , chances are that they 've met repeatedly , experienced little to no sexual tension , and never really want to see each other again unless there 's a free trip to California involved . Yep , seems about right .

The police in Lagos State on Tuesday arraigned a 44-year-old woman , Fatima Solomon , in an Ikeja Magistrates ' Court , accused of impersonating a registered nurse .
The accused was arraigned before Magistrate Mrs O.A Akokhia , on a two-count of impersonation and forgery .
According to the Prosecutor , Inspector Clement Okuoimose , the accused committed the offence in August 2000 at Ijaiye , Lagos .
He said that the accused impersonated a qualified nurse and midwife .
“ The accused presented a forged certificate from the University Teaching Hospital School of Nursing and Midwifery dated August 12 , 2000 .
“ She presented a forged notification of registration as a general nurse dated December 19 , 2003 .
“ She also forged license of the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria dated December 2009 , ” he alleged .
Okuoimose said that the forged certificates were later uncovered when the Lagos State Ministry of Health was on routine check in hospitals and clinics within Lagos .
“ During the exercise of the check and screening , it was discovered that the accused , who works in a matenity home forged all her certificates .
“ She was handed over to the police , ” the prosecutor said .
The offences , he said , contravened Sections 384 and 365 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State , 2015 ( Revised ) .
After the charges were read to Solomon , who resides at Meiran Road , Agege area of Lagos , she pleaded not guilty .
Magistrate Akokhia admitted the accused to bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum
Akokhia ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government .
Section 365 attracts three years jail term for forgery while section 384 prescribes two for impersonation .
The case was adjourned until May 9 for mention .
TORONTO – The Progressive Conservatives are asking the Ontario Provincial Police to investigate millions in ineligible expenses – including scuba gear and raccoon traps – filed by nine power generators in the province .
Auditor general Bonnie Lysyk reported last week that the generators claimed up to $ 260 million in ineligible costs between 2006 and 2015 , though the Independent Electricity System Operator says it 's closer to $ 200 million .

The expenses were claimed under a program designed to pay power generators for fuel , maintenance and operating costs when the IESO puts them on standby to supply energy .
The IESO has recovered $ 168 million of those billings that were deemed inappropriate .
Progressive Conservative Todd Smith has now written to the OPP to ask them to investigate , saying the abuses were so egregious that a second look by law enforcement is prudent .

The trial of abduction kingpin , Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike , alias Evans for alleged illegal possession of firearms was stalled at an Ikeja High Court on Wednesday .
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the stalling of the trial was due to the change of Evans ' defence counsel .
Evans has hired one Noel Brown as his new defence counsel after Mr Olukoya Ogungbeje , his former defence counsel , withdrew his legal services on June 13 , alleging threat to life .
During proceedings , which was a continuation of trial-within-trial , Brown requested an adjournment from the court to enable him to study the case file .
“ I humbly ask for time to study the documents in the file , ” Brown said .
The lead state prosecuting counsel , Mr Adebayo Haroun , however , did not raise an objection to Brown 's request .
Acceding Brown 's request , Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo , adjourned the case until October 5 and October 19 for the continuation of trial .
Evans , a native of Nnewi in Anambra , and his co-defendant , Victor Aduba , who is a dismissed soldier , are facing a four-count of kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms .
During the last court proceedings on June 8 , Inspector Idowu Haruna , a member of the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team , narrated how Evans , used Aduba as a decoy during his alleged high-profile criminal activities in Lagos .
During the trial , the defence , however , claimed that Evans was coerced to confess to the authorities .
Taiwo , therefore , ordered that a trial-within-trial should commence immediately to ascertain the validity of the alleged confessional statements .
Brantford city council has given Mayor Chris Friel a leave of absence while he deals with medical and family issues .
Council unanimously approved in a special meeting Tuesday a recommendation granting Friel permission to be absent from council meetings to the end of March , if required .
Friel was unable to attend the last two regular council meetings due to illness and requested permission for the leave .
`` Due to family and medical reasons , I will be limiting my public engagements over the next two months , '' Friel said in a written statement released after the vote .
`` While I may be absent from council meetings , I intend to stay engaged with council activities and city staff as much as possible . I also want to express my sincere appreciation for all the support my family and I have received during this difficult time . ''
Friel has battled medical ailments from time to time throughout his tenure as mayor , sometimes requiring him to get leaves of absence or accept a reduced workload .
He was forced to miss several meetings in October , but returned to regular attendance in November .
In a committee of the whole meeting in early December , he issued a statement in which he explained he was dealing with a bout of prostatitis , which he said began with a virus that started in his lower bowel and spread to his prostate .
Friel is also mourning the death of his mother , Judith , from a heart attack on Jan. 31 .
SINGAPORE : The manual balloting currently conducted in schools during the Primary 1 registration exercise will be replaced by computerised balloting conducted centrally at the Ministry of Education 's ( MOE ) headquarters .
The change will take effect from this year 's P1 registration exercise , the ministry announced in a news release on Tuesday ( Mar 20 ) .
P1 places are allocated by ballot when the number of applications exceeds the vacancies at a school during a particular registration phase and the home-school distance category . Currently , the balloting process is done manually at individual schools .
Like manual balloting , computerised balloting ensures an equal chance of admission for applicants , MOE said .
`` This helps to streamline the P1 registration processes and makes ( it ) more convenient for parents , since they no longer need to make arrangements to physically attend the balloting in schools , '' it added .
Computerised balloting is currently used for the Secondary 1 posting and Joint Admissions Exercise .

Parents will be notified of the ballot outcome via SMS on the day the registration result is announced . A letter will also be sent to them at the end of each phase of the registration exercise .
The registration of children for admission to P1 classes in 2019 will start on Jun 28 and end on Oct 31 .

FOREIGN STUDENTS TO UNDERGO TWO-STEP PROCESS
Starting this year , foreign students applying for a P1 place will be required to undergo a two-step process . This is because of the increasing number of applications and the increased time needed to process these applications , MOE said .
These students will first have to submit an `` indication of interest '' form at the MOE P1 website between Jun 5 and 11 .
Those who have been deemed eligible for a place will be notified in October . They must then register in-person at designated schools during Phase 3 of the registration exercise .

The victim asked Mia politely not to touch her hair . Mia then went behind the victim and put his hands on her chest . The victim was unable to push him away as she was carrying groceries in both hands , the court heard .
The victim decided to squat down to evade Mia 's touch .
“ The victim was shocked and outraged by the accused 's act and reported the incident to her employer who advised her to lodge a police report , ” according to court documents .
Mia was also charged with molesting the same victim a second time , about a month later . This was taken into consideration in his sentencing .
For molest , he could have been jailed for up to two years , fined , received strokes of the cane , or faced any combination of such punishments .

MANAUS , Brazil : Rioting inmates in Brazil decapitated and brutally assaulted their rivals , killing at least 60 , when fighting erupted between two gangs at a prison in the Amazon region , officials said on Monday ( Jan 2 ) .
The 17-hour riot broke out Sunday afternoon and lasted through the night at a prison on the outskirts of Manaus , the capital of Amazonas state , said state public security secretary Sergio Fontes .
He called it `` the biggest massacre '' ever committed at a prison in the state .
Bloodied and burned bodies were stacked in a concrete prison yard and piled in carts , an AFP photographer at the scene said .
Outside , heavily armed police hunted for inmates feared to have escaped through a series of tunnels discovered at the Anisio Jobim penitentiary complex .
Fontes said 16 tunnels were discovered in all . He told journalists that authorities were still trying to determine whether any inmates had escaped . Brazilian news site G1 reported that more than 130 had escaped .
Police were only able to restore order at the prison on Monday morning , freeing 12 guards who had been taken hostage , Fontes said .
They found a horrific scene inside . `` Many ( victims ) were decapitated , and they all suffered a lot of violence , '' Fontes told a press conference .
He said the gruesome scene appeared aimed at sending a message from the Family of the North ( FDN ) , a powerful local gang , to rivals from the First Capital Command ( PCC ) , one of Brazil 's largest gangs , whose base is in São Paulo , some 2,700 kilometres to the southeast .
`` During the negotiations ( to end the riot ) , the prisoners had almost no demands , '' Fontes told local radio network Tiradentes . `` We think they had already done what they wanted : kill members of the rival organisation . ''
Authorities have counted 60 bodies so far , all of them inmates , the head of the state 's prisons administration , Pedro Florencio , told journalists .
'SILENT WAR '
It was the latest eruption of horrific violence to hit Brazil 's underfunded and overcrowded prisons .
In October , deadly riots broke out at three separate prisons blamed on fighting between members of the country 's two largest gangs , the PCC and the Red Command ( CV ) .
During that episode , rioting inmates took visitors hostage , beheaded rivals and burned others alive , killing 33 people in all , authorities said .
Brazil 's prisons are often under the de facto control of drug gangs , whose turf wars on the outside are also fought out among inmates .
`` There is a silent war of drug trafficking , and the state needs to intervene , '' Fontes said . `` What did we see in this case ? One faction fighting another , because each wants more money . The fight is for money and space . ''
Brazil has struggled for years against a lucrative and violent drug trade .
But jailing drug traffickers has done little to solve the problem . It may even fuel it , critics say .
Human rights groups have long complained about the conditions in Brazilian prisons .
Some 622,000 people were imprisoned in Brazil as of the end of 2014 , most of them black males , according to a justice ministry report .
That makes it the world 's fourth-largest prison population , the report said , after the United States , China and Russia .
Brazil 's prisons need 50 percent more capacity to handle the current number of inmates , the justice ministry report found .
There were 1.67 prisoners for every available space , it said . In Amazonas state , the figure was 2.59 prisoners for every space .

LONDON - Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Najam Sethi has revealed that he has asked Britain 's Prime Minister Theresa May to consider sending the England team to tour Pakistan .
Sethi , who is in England to watch Pakistan 's two-Test series against the Three Lions , expressed those views in a meeting with May .
“ I told [ her ] that Pakistan awaits a visit by the England team [ and that ] we need your help , ” said Sethi as per CricTracker .
The 70-year-old added that he assured May that Pakistan was safe for a visit by the England team .
“ I reminded the British PM that the Pakistan Army has done a great job in ending terrorism and made big sacrifices , ” he said . “ As a result , the conditions at our home are better ; hence , we are inviting foreigners to come and visit us . We have made Pakistan safe . ”
Sethi has played an instrumental role in reviving international cricket in Pakistan since the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus in 2009 in Lahore .
Since then the return of international cricket has been slow but teams have toured the country after different displays of fool-proof security by the PCB , with the help of the security forces and Pakistan Army .
Zimbabwe , in 2015 , became the first full-member team to visit Pakistan for a limited-overs series . Later , the final of the Pakistan Super League 's ( PSL ) second edition in Lahore opened the gates of more international cricket in the country .
A World XI team led by South African Faf du Plessis then helped to revive the spirit of the game in the country all thanks to ICC 's Pakistan task force head Giles Clarke , where the team composed of international stars played three-T20Is series against Pakistan in Lahore .
The 2009 event then came full circle when a Sri Lanka side visited Lahore for a one-off T20 to ensure the world the Pakistan for safe for cricket .
The next task in Sethi 's to-do list was to bring cricket back to the Karachi , after Lahore had seen its fair share of it . The third edition of the PSL served as the mean for this purpose . After playing two play-offs in Lahore , the final of the league was organised in Karachi 's National Stadium .
To further consolidate Karachi as the second safe venue in Pakistan for international cricket , a depleted West Indies side visited the city to play a three-T20I series .

HANOI : The drilling ship at the centre of a row between Vietnam and China over oil prospecting in disputed waters in the South China Sea has arrived in waters off the Malaysian port of Labuan , shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed on Monday .
Drilling by the Deepsea Metro I ship was suspended in Vietnam 's Block 136/3 last month after pressure from China , which says the concession operated by Spain 's Repsol overlaps the vast majority of the waterway that it claims as its own .
The ship , used by Norway 's Odfjell Drilling Ltd. , was reported to be in Labuan at 9.17 a.m. ( 0117 GMT ) , according to shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon . It was last recorded at the drilling site on July 30 .
Odfjell Drilling did not respond immediately to a request for comment .
The row over the drilling inflamed tensions between Vietnam and China , whose claims in the South China Sea are disputed by five Southeast Asian countries .
Repsol said last month that drilling had been suspended after the company spent US $ 27 million on the well . Co-owners of the block are Vietnam 's state oil firm and Mubadala Development Co of the United Arab Emirates .

The block lies inside the U-shaped `` nine-dash line '' that marks the area that China claims in the sea .
China had urged a halt to the exploration work and a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the situation said that the decision to suspend drilling was taken after a Vietnamese delegation visited Beijing .
Vietnam has never confirmed that drilling started or that it was suspended , but last month defended its right to explore in the area .
Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of Chinese claims in the South China Sea , where more than US $ 3 trillion in cargo passes every year , and China was also angered by Vietnam 's stand at a regional meeting last week .
Vietnam held out for language that noted concern about island-building and criticised militarisation in South China Sea in the communique from foreign ministers of the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) .

Lyon could be banned from all European competition after UEFA on Monday charged the French club over incidents at last week 's Europa League match against CSKA Moscow .
UEFA said the charges centre on racist behaviour and crowd disturbances . The club already have a suspended two-year ban hanging over them from incidents at a previous Europa League game with Turkish side Besiktas in April 2017 .
Last Thursday 's trouble started outside Parc OL , which will host the Europa League final in May , before the last-16 second leg against CSKA .
Police said that at least eight officers were hurt as 100-150 hooded fans attacked an anti-terrorist unit .
Problems continued inside the stadium and UEFA 's Control , Ethics and Disciplinary Body has charged Lyon over the throwing of objects and the setting off of fireworks , crowd disturbances , racist behaviour and blocking stairways .
Lyon police said there were three arrests .
French sports daily L'Equipe quoted a source within UEFA as saying that the racism charge relates to Nazi symbols displayed inside the stadium , Nazi salutes and an attack on a non-white spectator .
CSKA won 3-2 on the night to progress to the quarter-finals on away goals , where they meet English club Arsenal .
The case will be decided on May 31 . Under UEFA guidelines , the two-year suspended sentence will be automatically enforced if Lyon are found guilty .
Last April , at the quarter-final against Besiktas in Lyon , there were confrontations between the two sets of fans outside the stadium , fighting in the stands and a pitch invasion by dozens of Lyon supporters which forced the kick-off to be delayed by 45 minutes .
The latest incidents raise questions about security at the Europa League final on May 16 , although Parc OL , built for Euro 2016 , has already hosted several major matches with no notable incidents .
Marseille have also been charged by UEFA over “ crowd disturbances ” and “ use of fireworks ” in their home victory over Athletic Bilbao .
BRYOND tacos , burritos , chimichangas , the authentic Mexican cuisine is as complex as other ancient cuisines such as Chinese and Japanese .
Its techniques and skills were developed over a thousand years . Mexican cuisine actually began 9000 years ago when agricultural communities like the Maya , domesticated the maize ( corn ) . In addition to its staples , corn and chili , avocados , cocoa , vanilla , traditional vegetables as well as ingredients not generally used in other cuisines such as huazontle ( similar to broccoli ) , nopalitos ( cactus leaves ) , huitlacoche ( corn fungus ) to name a few .

I have always been curious about Mexican cuisine . So when my daughter Patricia decided to celebrate her son Silvian 's 16th birthday in the much-talked about Michelin-starred restaurant Casa Enrique , which serves the best Mexican cuisine in New York City , my excitement to know more about the intricacies of this complex cuisine was aroused .
Casa Enrique , located in a redeveloped industrial area of Long Island City along the East River in Queens , was given a Michelin star for three consecutive years , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 . Simply put , the prestigious Michelin Star must use top quality ingredients , must have distinct flavors and prepared to a consistently high standard .
Executive Chef Cosme Aguilar and his brother Luis who hail from Chiapas , in Southernmost Mexico , opened Casa Enrique in 2012 . Just like closely knit Mexican families ; their mother and sisters traditional Chiapas dishes inspired their love for cooking .
Chef Cosme is educated in the classic French cuisine and worked with various chefs to hone his skills .
They both wanted to serve the traditional Mexican dishes but with the refined French touch .
I always trust the menu choices of Patricia and her husband George . A chilled bottle of Casa Bernasal Rosé from Valencia Spain was poured into our wine glasses , light colored , fruity with refreshing tangerine , grapefruit and berry scents .
For appetizer , chunky Guacamole served in stone pestle served with homemade Totopos ( baked tortillas ) teased our palates with its piquant lime-cilantro flavors in mashed avocados . The Aztecs developed guacamole . From Antojitos or Cravings , we were wondering what Rajas con Crema was , which turned out to be mild-flavored green Poblano peppers , roasted , peeled and sliced , and sautéed in onions and simmered in cream . Rajas mean strips or slices .
George also added Ceviche de Pescado and Cocktail Camarones . From the Taqueria , Silvian had Chorizo Tacos . Pa Rematar or Entrees were all interestingly complex to me . George and Sabrina had the De Pollo con Mole de Piaxtla or Chicken Breast rolled in corn tortilla with Mole Sauce , black beans , crema fresca , queso fresco and avocado .
Mole sauce is the generic name for number of sauces used in Mexican cuisine referred to as national dish of Mexico .
Every region has its version . Piaxtla is a town in Southern Mexico . Silvian , as usual , had his red meat dish–Carne Asada or skirt steak marinated in tequila , roasted poblanos and beans . Patricia enjoyed the Chamorro de al Huaxamole–lamb shank braised in chili pulla ( or puya with fruity flavors ) , huajes ( long flat green pod with garlicky , woody flavors ) , epazote ( aromatic herb with pungent flavor ) with rice and beans .
My choice was simple , a dish I easily understood –Pescado con Elote or pan seared sea bass on a bed of corn esquite , epazote and chili de arbol ( bird 's beak chili ) . Tres Leches Sponge Cake with a candle for Silvian to make a wish and blow was exquisite–made with three kinds of milk and goat milk caramel .
Chef Aguilar has truly elevated the Southern Mexican Cuisine to Michelin standards !
Nairobi : The world 's last male northern white rhino , Sudan , has died after `` age-related complications , '' researchers announced on Tuesday , saying he `` stole the heart of many with his dignity and strength . ''
A statement from the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya said the 45-year-old rhino was euthanized on Monday after his condition `` worsened significantly '' and he was no longer able to stand . His muscles and bones had degenerated and his skin had extensive wounds , with a deep infection on his back right leg .
The rhino had been part of an ambitious effort to save the subspecies from extinction after decades of decimation by poachers , with the help of the two surviving females . One is his daughter , Najin , and the other is her daughter , Fatu .
`` He was a great ambassador for his species and will be remembered for the work he did to raise awareness globally of the plight facing not only rhinos , but also the many thousands of other species facing extinction as a result of unsustainable human activity , '' said the conservancy 's CEO , Richard Vigne .
Sudan was something of a celebrity , attracting thousands of visitors . Last year he was listed as `` The Most Eligible Bachelor in the World '' on the Tinder dating app in a fundraising effort .
The last male northern white rhino had been born in Sudan , the last of his kind to be born in the wild .
He was taken to a Czech zoo and then transferred to Kenya in 2009 with the three other remaining fertile northern white rhinos at the time . They were placed under 24-hour armed guard and fed a special diet . `` However , despite the fact that they were seen mating , there were no successful pregnancies , '' the conservancy said .
Rangers caring for Sudan described him as gentle and , as his condition worsened in recent weeks , expressed sadness over his imminent death .
The rhino `` significantly contributed to survival of his species as he sired two females , '' the conservancy said . `` Additionally , his genetic material was collected yesterday and provides a hope for future attempts at reproduction of northern white rhinos through advanced cellular technologies . ''
The only hope for preserving the subspecies `` now lies in developing in vitro fertilization techniques using eggs from the two remaining females , stored northern white rhino semen from males and surrogate southern white rhino females , '' the statement said .
Sudan 's death `` is a cruel symbol of human disregard for nature and it saddened everyone who knew him . But , we should not give up , '' said Jan Stejskal , director of international projects at Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic . `` It may sound unbelievable , but thanks to the newly developed techniques , even Sudan could still have an offspring . ''
Northern white rhinos once roamed parts of Chad , Sudan , Uganda , Congo and Central African Republic , and were particularly vulnerable because of the armed conflicts that have swept the region over decades .
Other rhinos , the southern white rhino and another species , the black rhino , are under heavy pressure from poachers who kill them for their horns to supply illegal markets in parts of Asia .
Roughly 20,000 southern white rhinos remain in Africa . Their numbers dipped below 100 around a century ago , but an intense effort initiated by South African conservationist Ian Player in the mid-20th century turned things around .
WASHINGTON : Crude oil prices are expected to jump 23 per cent this year amid strong economic growth , while metals prices are rising , hit by ongoing trade tensions , the World Bank said on Tuesday ( Apr 24 ) .
The World Bank raised its forecast for oil prices to an average of US $ 65 a barrel this year and next , up from US $ 53 last year , partly due to `` mounting geopolitical risk . ''
Metals prices are expected to increase nine per cent in 2018 and while agricultural prices are expected to gain two percent in both cases impacted by the US-China trade dispute , the report said .
The World Bank cautioned that `` policy actions currently under discussion , such as additional tariffs , production cuts , and sanctions , present risks to the short-term outlook . ''
The continued global economic recovery , with growth increasing to 3.1 per cent last year and expected to go higher this year , has fuelled oil prices , which surged 10 per cent in the first quarter .
Rising geopolitical concerns , especially about prospects for renewed sanctions on Iran , and tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Yemen , also bolstered prices in March . They rose to US $ 74 per barrel in April , the report noted .

`` Oil prices have more than doubled since bottoming in early 2016 , as the large overhang of inventories has been reduced significantly , '' said John Baffes , World Bank senior economist and lead author of the report .
Production has been held back as well , which also boosts prices , including output curbs by OPEC and non-OPEC exporters as well as steps by China to reduce polluting metals and energy production .
`` Strong oil demand and greater compliance by the OPEC and non-OPEC producers with their agreed output pledges helped tip the market into deficit , '' Baffes said .
The trade tensions between the United States and China - ignited when US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports last month - weighed on all metals prices .

Aluminium prices subsequently surged to a seven-year high following US sanctions on the largest Russian aluminium producer which accounts for more than six percent of global supply , the report said .
Nickel prices also rose amid fears that sanctions could be extended to other Russian producers since the country produces nine per cent of global nickel stocks .
SEATTLE -- Ichiro Suzuki received a rousing ovation Monday for his first at-bat in Safeco Field as a member of the 3,000-hit club .

“ Negotiations are going good . I think we 're close to locking something in . They 're stuck at 30 per cent ( of the split ) , we 're stuck at 35 so it 's just finding the middle ground .
“ We 'll take 35 percent which means Joshua will take 65 , which is nearly double me , so I think that 's a fair deal because he 's the bigger draw card and he 's has two belts , and I have one .
“ I think that 's reasonable and fair .
“ I think we 're very close . I 'm excited as it 's a chance to showcase my skills in the UK more . ”
Parker and his camp are confident that they can cause a huge upset against the undefeated English golden boy once they finally get inside the ring .
Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel defended his decision to substitute misfiring striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in his side 's surprising Champions League loss at Benfica .
Dortmund went down 1-0 in the last-16 first leg at Estadio da Luz after Kostas Mitroglou grabbed the only goal of the game from a corner early in the second half .
Aubameyang wasted a handful of chances to get the Bundesliga side into the game in open play and when his dreadful penalty was easily saved , Tuchel responded by withdrawing his top-scorer from the pitch almost half-an-hour early .
The decision raised eyebrows given Aubameyang 's importance to the side , not to mention his 21 goals in all competitions this season .
But Tuchel told UEFA.com : `` Aubameyang is not fully fit after the African Nations Cup and his body language did not suggest that he would do better after giving away the penalty .
`` I do n't think he had a problem with the substitution . ''
Tuchel could hardly believe his side drew a blank in Portugal , having racked up 12 goal attempts to the home side 's two .
Ousmane Dembele , Marco Reus and Christian Pulisic were among those who had chances to drag Dortmund back into the match but they will have to wait for Benfica to visit the Westfalenstadion to put things right .
`` It is an extremely complicated result , but I am very proud of how we played , '' said Tuchel .
`` Even though I am very disappointed , I am proud of how we presented ourselves . I do n't think we played well , I think we played outstandingly . It 's only possible in football to play this well and to still lose . Luckily , there 's a return leg for such games . ''
Benfica boss Rui Vitoria agreed his side may have been outplayed but had a more nuanced take on proceedings .
He saw much to praise in his team 's plucky rearguard , not least the stout performance of goalkeeper Ederson , who did as much as Aubameyang to keep Dortmund off the scoresheet .
`` It was a tasty victory for sure , speaking of justice after a game like this is tricky , '' he told UEFA .
`` I agree that Dortmund is a strong opponent and that they had the best of this game . We lacked something in the defensive process during the first half , but changed at half-time . Besides that , we analysed that set pieces could be a way of hurting Dortmund and it worked .
`` We fought , gave our best , and victories are also made of that . Congratulations to Ederson too , a keeper who showed his quality once again , this time against a team that scored so many goals in the group stage . ''
On the evening of April 11 , 100 volunteers will go out to speak to the homeless to gather data .
The point-in-time survey was previously done in 2013 and 2016 .
Bhavana Varma , the head of the United Way in Kingston , says the information gathered allows them to measure progress being made , better tailor programming in the community and identify issues they might not have been aware of .
“ We 've seen a high percentage of females who are homeless , 50 per cent plus of those who are absolutely homeless are female and that 's higher than the average across the country based on our research . ”
The 2016 count found 91 people experiencing absolute homelessness either sleeping outside or in shelters . At that point in time , an additional 46 were staying in transitional housing .

Many of the homeless population are also dealing with issues beyond not having a roof over their heads , according to Addiction & Mental Health Services CEO Don Seymour .
The not-for-profit serves Kingston , Frontenac , Lennox and Addington .
“ When you look at our homeless population , probably 80 per cent of them are dealing with addiction or mental-health issues . ”
Home Base Housing specializes in getting the homeless into permanent housing and operates a shelter for up to 29 men and women .
The organization is often the first point of contact for a vulnerable population that needs a vast array of services to help turn their lives around .
Executive director Tom Greening says people just trying to find shelter from the elements do n't have time for much else .
“ Often , the people that we 're meeting with have been beaten down and discouraged by their search for a place that 's affordable so sometimes , it does take a little bit of extra work to engage with them and show them that there are options available . ”

Addiction and Mental Health Services is trying to increase the amount of affordable housing available to people in the region .
They built one building in 2011 with over 40 units and are now building another 44 one-bedroom-unit apartment complex next to the first one on Lyons Street in Kingston .
Along with the housing , Seymour says they provide the services necessary for their clients .
“ Could be psychiatry , it could be nursing , social work definitely , residential support workers who have some sort of training in social work or social services . Sometimes , depending on the size of the program , you might add a recreational therapist . ”
The new building is set to open this fall and demand for those apartments is expected to be high .
Kingston 's 2017 vacancy rate was at a 30-year low coming in at 0.7 per cent .
( DAN FENNER - For The Oakland Press ) Clarkston senior Paige Blevins stands in the batters box against Lake Orion on Tuesday , April 24 , 2018 .
LAKE ORION > > In one of the true tests on its regular season schedule , Clarkston validated its No . 1 ranking in the state Tuesday with a doubleheader sweep of Lake Orion , 12-2 and 13-3 .
The Wolves ( 8-0 ) remained unbeaten on the young season by earning a pair of five-inning victories over the Dragons in a key Oakland Activities Association Red Division matchup .
I was pleased with the really solid defense , good pitching and our two-strike hitting ,  Clarkston coach Don Peters said . They work really hard to be good hitters and it shows.

Locked in offensively , Clarkston scored multiple runs in eight of the 10 innings it played Friday and showed no weak spots in its vaunted lineup .
In the pitchers circle , Wolves junior Olivia Warrington threw two complete games and held Lake Orion down to prevent any big innings .
She mixed it up pretty good . Shed pitch up and down with some changeups in there ,  Peters said of Warrington . Shes very confident in herself.
In Game 1 , Clarkston jumped out to a 10-0 lead  including a five-run second inning  before Lake Orion got on the board . The Dragons Tessa Nuss rounded the bases for an inside the park home run that scored two in the bottom of the third .
The Wolves received RBI hits from Anna Skvarce and Hannah Cady to reestablish a 10-run spread in the fourth .
Game 2 saw more of the same with Clarkston racing out to a sizable early lead . Continuing her big day , Cady launched a two-run home run to centerfield in the second inning to make it 6-0 .
Shes so much fun to watch ,  Peters said of Cady . Shes only a sophomore and we have two freshmen catchers behind her . I tell them what a great role model they have . Theyre good athletes themselves , but I say if you can watch how ( Cady ) handles herself behind the plate , how she handles the pitcher , frames the pitch , and her focus at the plate , to put that in your memory bank.
Lake Orions Paytin Shadaia and Hailey Melchert recorded RBI hits in the top of the fifth for the Dragons ( 8-2 ) , but the Wolves finished off the game when Hannah Chadwell knocked home the clinching run in the bottom of the frame .
 ( Lake Orion ) was a good test . Every one of their kids came up to hit . We just keep battling and trying to get better and enjoying the game ,  Peters said .
A year ago , with nearly all of the same players , the Wolves reached the Division 1 semifinals before losing a heart-breaker to Grandville , 2-1 . Last seasons team featured five freshmen starters and two sophomores in the lineup , which has led to elevated expectations in 2018 and beyond .
I think theyre having better at-bats and showing better understanding of the defensive strategy and positioning ,  Peters said of his young players progression a year later . Obviously their confidence is growing.
Authorities say a man whose body was found in a Burlington basement died from a fall while repairing the basement steps .
The body of 53-year-old Ricky Wixom was discovered Jan. 12 . Iowa Department of Public Safety agent Richard Rahn said Friday that Wixom occasionally stayed with a friend who lived in the home .
It 's believed Wixom fell in September while working on the steps . Relatives reported him missing Oct. 10 . Rahn says the resident rarely went into the old basement and did n't notice any smell from the decomposing body , which was found by a plumber called in to check possible water problems .
An autopsy showed Wixom suffered blunt force injuries consistent with a fall . Rahn says the death has been ruled an accident .
The Parkland Twins AAA team may have gotten off to a rocky start in the 2018 season , but they 've quickly found solid ground as they cruised to third place in the league standings with an 8-2 win-loss ratio .
The Twins started off the summer with three losses during their April appearance at the Prairie Baseball Academy 's tournament in Lethbridge , losing 17-0 against the Saskatoon Cubs , 12-11 against the PBA JV Dawgs and 13-3 against the Calgary Babe Ruth . However , as the team broke into their regular season in May , however , the Twins quickly upped their performance with a 7-5 home game win against the Red Deer Braves and shutout 9-0 win over the Calgary Dinos Yellow .
The following day , on May 6 , the Twins took two losses while playing in Red Deer against the Northern Lights Academy ( 9-3 ) and the Calgary Dinos Black ( 8-7 ) . The Twins quickly rebounded , and have won the last eight games in a row , including a 9-0 win over St. Albert on May 9 , a 5-0 victory against the East Central Bulls and a 10-0 win over the Foothills Dawgs on May 26 followed quickly by a 18-5 victory over the Calgary Cubs .
That accelerated performance has pushed the Twins back into the top three in the league , sitting just under the St. Albert Red who are in second place and the Northern Lights who have snagged the top spot .
Head coach Dustin Northcott said that the recent success has been a result of the team coming together over the course of the season .
“ I think we 've figured each other out as a team and as a whole , ” he said . “ We 've started to gel and mesh and I think we 've found some success in our lineup where guys are hitting . I think we 've progressively gotten better . ”
Northcott said he attributes the success to a strong foundation in the team , that does n't just rely on any one player above any other .
“ It 's been a team effort . I think everyone in every capacity has contributed and that 's been nice to see . We have n't had to rely on one particular pitcher , or one particular guy in the lineup and that 's a sign of a very strong team , ” he said .
Los Angeles County pressed forward with an effort to strengthen the safety net for its most vulnerable residents Monday with a budget plan that carves out significant allotments for social services , healthcare and other support for the poor .
The proposed budget is a slight increase from last year , and officials said they are trying to channel some of that money toward helping those who rely on county government for critical services .
The total recommended budget for fiscal year 2017-2018 , which begins July 1 , is $ 30.02 billion , an increase of $ 137 million , or 0.5 % , over last year 's budget . More than $ 600 million will go toward reducing and preventing homelessness , hiring new social workers , improving foster care , treating the county 's sickest patients and diverting individuals with mental illness from jail .
“ It is the business of county government , more than any other aspect of government , to be specifically concerned with the safety net , ” said County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas by phone Monday afternoon . “ These are ongoing commitments , and they are priorities that attach to the safety net . ”
County Chief Executive Sachi Hamai said at a news conference Monday that this year was “ unusual ” partly because of newly available revenue sources , such as Measure H , which voters approved in March . The measure calls for a quarter-cent sales tax to fund homelessness reduction and prevention services countywide .
The measure will provide an estimated $ 355 million annually to reduce and prevent homelessness . The money is projected to assist 45,000 homeless families and individuals and prevent 30,000 more from becoming homeless in the measure 's first five years . A separate panel has been convened to decide how to divide up the money among 21 strategies approved by the Board of Supervisors .
The county also plans to spend $ 45 million on 220 new social workers and 100-plus new support staff at the Department of Children and Family Services . This money will help bring social workers ' caseloads down , said Hamai . The budget allocates additional funds for foster care and mental health in the child welfare system .
For criminal justice , the proposed budget includes $ 4.2 million for defending indigent youth and $ 90 million for a wide array of jail diversion and re-entry programs , particularly targeting individuals with mental illness and/or substance abuse issues .
In addition , the county will launch Whole Person Care , a five-year initiative to provide coordinated , comprehensive services to L.A. County 's sickest Medi-Cal patients . Funding for the $ 90-million initiative comes from Medi-Cal 2020 , a pool of money for the state 's Medicaid program approved by the federal government in 2015 and lasting through 2020 .
The proposed budget includes a slight decrease , from $ 38.2 to $ 38.1 million , in funding for the county medical examiner-coroner 's office , which has been struggling with heavy backlogs in autopsies and toxicology tests . That office will see a net decrease of three positions .
Hamai said later in an email that the county had already made “ significant strides ” to improving operations in the coroner 's office , including budgeting 24 new positions last year . “ Our plan now is to assess the impact of these and other personnel changes and then determine how best to move forward , ” she said .
The County Board of Supervisors will discuss the budget at a meeting Tuesday and hold public hearings on it in May , before adopting it in late June .
The budget does not currently take into account any proposed cuts at the state and federal levels . “ I think there are too many uncertainties at this time , ” Hamai said .
In February Hamai directed all county departments to prepare budget reduction scenarios in case of funding cuts , but she said Monday that the county would not revise its budget until the final state and federal budgets are enacted . Those changes would take place as part of the county 's supplemental budget phase in September .
Ridley-Thomas said he is concerned about proposals to eliminate state and federal funding for key county services . “ The most immediate concern we have is the In-Home Supportive Services proposal , ” he said . “ That 's the most concrete . ”
In January Governor Jerry Brown released his proposed 2017-2018 budget , which , among other items , would force counties to shoulder a greater share of the cost of In-Home Supportive Services , a program that pays for low-income elderly , blind or disabled people to receive services at their homes .
More than 216,000 people in L.A. County currently receive these services , according to Ridley-Thomas ' office . The county estimates that the state proposal will result in $ 220 million in additional costs to the county , effective July 1 , and is currently working to oppose the change and mitigate its effects if it is ultimately enacted .
Policy changes proposed by President Trump could also affect L.A. County .
Trump 's “ America First ” budget blueprint , released in March , would reduce funding for the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Housing and Urban Development , major sources of the county 's discretionary funding . It would also eliminate funding for several programs through which the county receives money , including the Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnerships Program , which helps provide affordable housing to low-income Americans .
Trump has also promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare . California currently receives $ 15 billion annually in federal dollars to fund the state 's Medicaid expansion under the act — funding that would be in jeopardy if the law were to be repealed . However , the act 's future remains in question after Republicans failed last month to garner the support needed to bring a repeal and replace bill to a vote in the House .

Babalola , represented by his deputy , Mr Johnson Oshodi , said that the fight against corruption was an all-involving fight , where the commission needed the assistance of other stakeholders and members of the public .
“ We want Nigerians to blow the whistle through feeding the commission with timely and prompt information to nip corruption in the bud and punish its perpetrators anywhere in the country , '' he said .
Babalola described corruption as a global phenomenon , adding that its impact and endemic nature had been far-reaching in the country .
He said that corruption had been crippling the nation 's economy and development .
“ The worst is that it is already stealing what should be left for our future , our children and our children-children and making many young Nigerians to lose hope in the economic system .
“ Every right-thinking Nigerian must stand up and join hands actively with the commission to check this monster and cankerworm , '' he said .

In his speech , the EFCC Head of Media , Mr Chris Oluka , lauded the massive turnout of people for the walk , especially corporate organisations that had been identifying with the commission and making its investigative work easy .
“ We are overwhelmed by this show of solidarity , especially the organisations that had been partnering with us in this fight before now , '' he said .
Also , Mr Hassan Mohammed , the Zonal Commissioner , Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission ( ICPC ) , assured the commission of ICPC 's continuous close working relationship and synergy in information sharing .
“ We will remain committed to the bond between our organisation and EFCC , and we will work together in more aspects of fighting corruption in the country , '' Mohammed said .
The Sector Commander of FRSC in Enugu State , Mr Edward Zamber , said that the agency would check all forms of corruption , especially on the highways .
“ In a bid to keep Nigerians safe on the roads , FRSC will ensure exemplary conduct always and shun all forms of inducement in the course of our duty , '' Zamber , who was represented by Mr Hassan Lawal , said .
The representative of Diamond Bank Plc , Mr Felix Ezimora , said that the bank would continue to follow the commission 's guidelines in its banking operations .
“ Diamond Bank is known for transparency and excellence ; we assure you that we will keep to our good working relationship as well as openness to the commission , '' Ezimora said .
A pro-labor , pro-immigrant march in May Brian Feinzimer
It was a big week for immigrants ' rights in California . Saying the Legislature 's sanctuary state proposal `` ensures hard-working people who contribute to our state are respected , '' Gov . Jerry Brown yesterday signed it into law .
It was hailed by pro-immigrant groups such as CHIRLA ( the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights ) , whose spokesman , Jorge Mario-Cabrera , said via email that it 's `` a firewall against ICE [ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ] and the hateful Trump rhetoric . '' But the signing casts a shadow over Los Angeles City Hall , which has long prided itself on being a bastion of pro-immigrant and progressive values .
Following the election of Donald Trump as president and the enactment of his crackdown against those here illegally , advocates have been pushing the City Council to pass the city 's own sanctuary bill . Mayor Eric Garcetti has been reluctant to declare L.A. a true place of sanctuary for the undocumented . In February , speaking about the need for the Trump administration 's cooperation with infrastructure funding and the city 's successful Olympics bid , the mayor said , `` We 've never declared ourself a sanctuary city ; I 'm still not sure what one is . ''
In a city government that rarely defies the mayor , that speaks volumes about why Los Angeles is not among the state 's 35 or so cities that have declared themselves places of sanctuary for undocumented immigrants . Alex Comisar , a spokesman for the mayor , said via email that Garcetti `` is proud of California 's commitment to protecting the rights , safety and dignity of all people '' and that `` the mayor will always be committed to building on and preserving that trust . ''
`` Few mayors have done more to bring other mayors together around this concept , '' says councilmember Gil Cedillo , who has twice introduced sanctuary city resolutions in the council , the most recent yesterday following the singing of the state bill .
Asked why L.A. is lagging behind the massive state lawmaking bureaucracy in coming up with a sanctuary law , Cedillo said the Legislature is bound by strict deadlines , while the council has open-ended deliberations . `` We need to make this as broad a movement as possible so we can move our agenda forward , '' he says .
In June , critics called on the City Council to speed things up . Four months later , they 're still waiting . `` I think it is embarrassing that Los Angeles has n't yet codified its protections for its residents , '' says Tessie Borden of pro-immigrant group Indivisible Highland Park , which has advised the council on an ongoing sanctuary proposal .
The group last night hosted a town hall meeting `` to show City Council member Gil Cedillo the wide and deep support in Los Angeles for a strong sanctuary ordinance that will truly disentangle local police from federal immigration enforcement , '' according to a statement .
Cedillo 's latest proposal , also backed by council president Herb Wesson , is a resolution that would officially declare L.A. a sanctuary city . `` A motion will follow , incorporating recommendations made by the [ city 's ] Immigrant Advocate Peter Schey , to further protect Dreamers and other immigrant populations in Los Angeles , '' according to a statement from his office .
Pro-immigrant leaders say it 's an opportunity to go further than the state 's sanctuary law , known as the California Values Act . According to the office of the state bill 's author , Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De León of L.A. , it `` prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies , including school police and security departments , from using resources to investigate , interrogate , detain , detect , or arrest people for immigration enforcement purposes . ''
It goes into effect in January — that is , if the Trump administration does n't successfully block it in court .
Borden of Indivisible Highland Park wants the city to prohibit arrest database sharing with the feds and to knock `` quality-of-life '' crimes such as street vending and loitering down to ticket-worthy offenses that would n't put immigrants under the microscope of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents .
`` What the state did was build a floor , '' she says . `` Cities can go higher . ''
Shania Twain is moving on from the sound created by her ex-husband and former producer Robert John 'Mutt ' Lange .
The country star , 51 , has not released a studio record since 2002 , a delay that in part is down to the turmoil in her professional and personal life caused by her break-up from her husband Robert John ‘ Mutt ' Lange , who doubled as the producer of all her albums .
The couple 's 2010 divorce came after Robert admitted an affair with Shania 's best friend Marie-Anne Thiebaud . Shania ended up getting close with Marie-Anne 's betrayed husband Frederic Thiebaud , and the pair wed in 2011 .
She is planning to release a new album this spring , and says she told those working on her record , including One Direction producer Jake Gosling and Bruce Springsteen collaborator Ron Aniello , to erase all her previous work from their minds .
“ I told anyone getting involved musically to forget about my other records , ” the musician tells Rolling Stone . “ I did n't want it to be related to Mutt 's productions at all . I wanted a more organic approach . ”
When Robert was her producer Shania sold 85 million records and became country music 's biggest pop crossover star , but she now wants to move away from her pop roots .
“ Most of them started off quite melancholy and a lot darker , ” she explains of her new songs .
However she 's philosophical about how her split from the man she shared her life and music with has affected her .
“ I 'm a different singer now , ” she shares . “ There was a lot of coming to terms with that . It 's been one of the obstacles in my life I 've just had to learn to live with . ”
The country veteran 's new album is yet to receive an official title , but tracks include Swinging With My Eyes Closed , and Who 's Gon na Be Your Girl ? , a ballad about the breakdown of her marriage .
Aim of the week :
Clear the idea and content
Using software to animate human perspective by using projection technology
History :
As for enjoyment of music , on the one hand , publicly , people tend to go to concert , big music festival ;
However , on the other hand , people want to listen music more and more privately , from before 18th the chamber music . Then in 19th , phonautograph was invented , which gave human the ability to record sound . After that , phonograph and gramophone came to the world that people can enjoy music at home . Time goes to 20th , electric record players were introduced , from transistor radio to Walkman , Discman , miniDisc and MP3 . Finally , it comes to iPod , smaller mp3 . Until nowadays , we can enjoy whatever music whenever and wherever we want to just need the internet .
With in the private music enjoyment process , producers always want to fill in the visual immersive feeling which private music lacks , compared with the public music events . From the cover of vinyl to CD cover . After the electronic screen was invented , the video is the most important part of a album ( started from The Beatles 1964 's A Hard Day 's Night , which could be considered one of the first visual albums . However , after the technology become smaller and smaller , the purpose of immersive visual feeling is generally missing , and till now , we only hear the song and hardly click the link of MVs .
With the new technologies nowadays , the immersive feeling of public musical enjoyment has been continuously enlarging . Such as big LED screen , interactive lighting design and projection . So , what we can do for the private musical immersive feeling ?
Concept :
Compared with public musical events , which gather a large number of people to make them feel excited in most time , private musical enjoyment some time can be more relaxed . Think about when you feel stressed and want to go back home , close the light but leave a candle , enjoy the music with a glass of wine . Such condition has been written in lyrics lots of time , but why is that , what is the candle for ?
In my opinion , people do n't want to see the whole outside world , but need to focus on a tiny space that only candle can enlighten . This is escaping from the real world , find another peaceful in somewhere else . But , where is the place ? I think it is a place only has music to make people immerse inside of it . However , it is not a visual replacement ( such as the virtual reality world ) . It is a world between . Where people can immerse to the musical world , meanwhile doing some leisure thing such as drinking , cooking or taking a shower .
So , what it an musical album can contain a visual space of each song , to revive the visual immersive feeling of private music and to bring inside of each song , by changing the visual perception of human 's eyes , using illusion to create another space in his or her “ chamber ” .
Idea & Content :
If each song has a world inside , what it looks like ?
Start from the general cognition of a song in your play list .
The spatial container is the timeline of the song , and it is linear and two-dimensional . However , as for the song , it might contain a path a story which might about how a love , mood changing , nice journey go with the time 's tick tack . To open the path in 3D . It might look a continuous changing terrain . Inside of the path beats , vocal and instrument can be the creature goes inside and outside of the path . And human can walk on the path , fall in a vertical path , or fly over and overwatch the path .
Technical Progress :
To open the path in the “ chamber ” without any wearable intervention , I did some projection-generate illusion this week . Basically , human head location can be detected in the chamber and the image from projector would be update frame to frame according to the position of human .
By doing so , the human perspective can be updated time to time , and the images projects in the chamber can shift the chamber to another space .
WASHINGTON : US President Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed the idea of any `` Russian connection '' in a tweet that came amid a New York Times report that said members of his presidential campaign had contacts with Russian intelligence officials .
`` This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton 's losing campaign , '' he said in a post on Twitter , citing his former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential contest .
This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton 's losing campaign . — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 15 , 2017
US intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia had intervened in the US electoral process at least in part to help Republican property tycoon Trump win the Nov 8 election .
In a barrage of tweets , Trump took fresh aim at some of the media Wednesday , while praising the conservative Fox television network .
`` The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred . @ MSNBC & @ CNN are unwatchable . @ foxandfriends is great ! '' he tweeted .
Trump also accused the US intelligence services of having leaked information , directly pointing the finger at the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
`` Information is being illegally given to the failing @ nytimes & @ washington post by the intelligence community ( NSA and FBI ? ) Just like Russia , '' Trump wrote .
He lobbed a hardball at his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama , writing `` Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration . Was Obama too soft on Russia ? ''
Pakistan 's progress in the Champions Trophy so far looks ominously similar to their journey in the 1992 World Cup .
Back then , Pakistan had stumbled into the final after being rescued by a washed-out game against England , disastrous gambits of rival captains -- New Zealand 's Martin Crowe rested himself in the semi-final -- and some other results that went their way , like the unexpected exit of Australia in the league stages .
But , when it came to the crunch games , Pakistan morphed from scared kittens to roaring tigers , ending in their famous victory in the finals against England .
Pakistan are riding a similar cycle this Champions Trophy . Starting as the underdogs -- they are ranked at the bottom of the heap -- with a team that has faces that many wo n't recognise outside Islamabad , they have suddenly turned into a formidable bowling unit .
Their spinners are enticing rival batsmen into their web of leg and off-cutters and the pacers are generating a lot of reverse swings in the middle overs , choking the run flow and thus putting pressure on the rival batsmen . No wonder , except for India , every team has struggled to score against Pakistan .
There are two distinct similarities between Pakistan of 2017 and Pakistan of 1992 . One , it is relying on rookies , who , like Inzamam ul Haq back then , are gathering the day for them . Two , their bowlers are going flat out to get the opponents bowled out , reminding fans of Imran Khan 's famous advice to his bowlers to not worry about no-balls and go for the jugular .
Like in 1992 , when Inzamam 's induction revived the comatose batting lineup , Fakhar Zaman has suddenly made the top order look dangerous .
Any other team would have been wary of throwing a 27-year-old debutant at the deep end of the pool in a tournament like the Champions Trophy . But , faced with a sink-or-swim scenario , Zaman was given his first game at the international level against South Africa . Since then , Zaman has played as if he is in a hurry to make up for the delayed debut , scoring almost as an opener against some of the top bowlers of the world .
Unexpectedly , Pakistan 's bowling that looked club-class against India , has suddenly matured into a sharp , stingy group of spinners and reverse-swingers . On Wednesday , when they beat England , Pakistan were without Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz , whose fiery spell against Shane Watson in the 2015 World Cup looks like a distant memory . But , Rumman Raees -- another rookie -- and Hasan Ali stepped up to stifle England .
Cricket is a strange game . It takes just an inspirational innings or a dramatic performance to turn around the fortunes of a team . Sarfaraz Ahmed 's gritty knock against Sri Lanka has apparently done that to Pakistan , making them believe in their ability and luck . They now have the momentum and the opportunity to win the tournament .
Pakistan has always relied on individual brilliance for victories . It has always benefitted from the sudden and unexpected arrival of a hero , created specifically for a particular game or a tournament . That is why they are the most unpredictable team in world cricket .
There is however one final frontier to cross for Pakistan . And it is called India .
India toyed with Pakistan in their first game , making their bowlers first spray the ball around and then hobble back to the dressing room with injured bodies and battered egos . And though India lost to Sri Lanka , its batting lineup has always looked formidable . The Indian batsmen have made 300-plus scores look child 's play so far .
India have never lost to Pakistan in the final -- or a knock-out game -- of a major tournament . The Men in Blue have always been the final slayers of Pakistan 's ambitions in World Cups and other ICC tournament .
If the Champions Trophy resembles the 1992 World Cup for Pakistan , India could be reminded of the 1985 Benson & Hedges Cup in Australia , where they first knocked out Pakistan in the group stages and then dismantled them again in the finals .
But , before that , it is over to India vs Bangladesh .

ISLAMABAD - Senior Pakistani and Indian military officials have agreed to ensure ceasefire along the borders in line with 2003 ceasefire agreement .
The understanding was reached between the two director generals of military operations who made a “ special ” hotline contact on Tuesday to review the prevailing situation along the Line of Control in Kashmir and the Working Boundary .
“ Both DGMOs ( director generals of military operations ) reviewed the prevailing situation along the LoC and the Working Boundary and mutually agreed to undertake sincere measures to improve the existing situation ensuring peace and avoidance of hardships to the civilians along the borders , ” a statement from Pakistan army 's media wing said .
The two officials , the ISPR statement added , agreed to “ fully implement the ceasefire understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit forthwith and to ensure that henceforth the ceasefire will not be violated by both sides . ”
The two sides also agreed that in case of any issue , restraint would be exercised and the matter would be resolved through utilisation of existing mechanisms of hotline contacts and border flag meetings at local commander 's level .
Tensions between the two nuclear neighbours have failed to ease in recent months . Over 150 civilians and troops from both sides have been killed in border clashes .
According to the Indian army , the two commanders reviewed the prevailing situation during a conversation over the hotline at 6 PM . The special hotline contact was initiated by the Pakistani DGMO .
Following the conversation between Indian DGMO Lt Gen Anil Chauhan and Pakistan 's Maj Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza , the two armies issued identical statements saying both sides agreed to fully implement the 15-year-old ceasefire understanding .
The latest round of discussion came a month after similar discussions were held between the two countries . The unscheduled DGMO-level talks were held on April 27 , on a request by Pakistan , wherein the Pakistani DGMO accused Indian security forces of resorting to unprovoked firing along LoC , the Indian Army had said in a statement .
Quoting Indian Ministry of Defence sources , Indian media reported that the idea to restore the 2003 agreement along the border had been in the works for some time . “ Ceasefire had already been dead . There was no ceasefire along the LoC for quite some time now . So there were some talks to ease pressure on civilians , on either side of the border , and stop the constant shelling , ” said a top retired army officer , who was privy to the consultation on the issue .
Last couple of years have seen an unprecedented spike in the number of ceasefire violations which had made the current situation untenable . In 2010 , the official number of ceasefire violations by India were 70 and those by Pakistan were 113 .

Maria Sharapova 's claycourt season got off to a poor start on Tuesday as she lost in three sets to Caroline Garcia in the first round of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart .
REUTERS : Maria Sharapova 's claycourt season got off to a poor start on Tuesday as she lost in three sets to Caroline Garcia in the first round of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart .
France 's Garcia staged a strong fightback to prevail 3-6 7-6 ( 6 ) 6-4 in two hours and 44 minutes for her first victory over the former world number one in her fifth attempt .
`` It was a very close match . I know she is a fighter and it would be difficult until the end , '' sixth seed Garcia , who saved two match points in the second set , said .
Sharapova , who came back from a 15-month doping ban at this tournament last April , won the first set with ease but the 31-year-old could not prevent a determined Garcia from dragging herself back into the contest through a tiebreak .
A 10th double fault by Sharapova at 4-4 handed Garcia the crucial break in the decider and the world number seven clinched the contest on her serve in the next game .
`` I was a little more aggressive today and I returned a bit better . Finally I can say that after seven years I have beaten her ... it 's an important win , '' Garcia added .

Up next for Garcia is Ukrainian teenager Marta Kostyuk who beat Antonia Lottner 6-4 6-1 . The 15-year-old qualified for the main draw by overcoming France 's Alize Cornet on Monday .
`` I ca n't say I 'm super surprised , because that 's what I work for , and I know I can play at this level , '' Kostyuk said .
World number six Karolina Pliskova also advanced with a 6-2 6-2 win over Kiki Bertens while Magdalena Rybarikova dumped out Russia 's Daria Kasatkina 6-2 6-2 .

A 'black money bonhomie ' has come under the scanner involving builders , brokers and Bollywood entities as a multi-agency probe gets underway to pierce the corporate veil of hundreds of suspected shell companies.Sebi has begun shooting off show-cause notices to 331 listed entities , suspected to have acted as 'shell companies ' for those with illicit funds , while action has also begun against more than 100 unlisted entities that could have traded in stocks with laundered money , top regulatory and government sources said.While the capital market regulator Sebi 's decision to restrict share trading has been reversed in case of some firms after they approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal , it has been permitted to go ahead with its probe against them and others who could have violated securities laws.While many of these companies have gone public to deny any wrongdoing and have said they are not 'shell companies ' , a top official said a wrong perception has got created about this nomenclature and even established and well-known firms can act as 'shell companies ' by providing a platform for money laundering and converting black money into white.While several small brokers are already in the list of 'suspected shell firms ' , their links to bigger brokerage groups are being probed by Sebi , another official said.Also under the scanner is the role of some brokers in creating a 'panic-like situation ' in the stock market after Sebi 's action to restrict trading in shares of 331 firms , he said , while adding that the move would have safeguarded the interest of minority shareholders but the brokers with their 'skin in the game ' wanted to get their money out.As Sebi ( Securities and Exchange Board of India ) continues its probe , affairs of these companies are also being looked into by agencies such as I-T Department , ED and SFIO ( Serious Fraud Investigation Office ) to unravel what one top regulatory official described as a `` big black money bonhomie '' .Several of these firms are also suspected to have indulged in huge cash dealings post-demonetisation.Marking coordinated efforts on their parts , the regulatory and investigative agencies are sharing their investigation reports with each other , the official said.Citing official documents and preliminary probe findings , multiple regulatory and government officials said nearly 500 entities ( including listed and unlisted ones ) are currently being probed but some of the names have not been made public yet due to the sensitivity of the matter and to safeguard the investigation process.Any action against such 'big names ' would take place after the investigation has reached some conclusive stage , they added.A large number of companies having acted as 'shell firms ' are linked to businesses like real estate , commodities and stock broking , films and television ( including those on digital platforms ) , plantation and non-banking financial services , the officials said . `` Another worrying trend is that several of these companies , including listed ones , could have helped launder money collected illegally by unlawful money-pooling schemes by groups already barred by one or other regulator , '' said one of the officials who did n't want to be named as investigations are underway.Also under the scanner is funds shown as foreign or domestic 'private equity investment ' by suspected 'shell firms'.The suspected firms are being asked to explain these links and all suspicious dealings.Some of these firms have shown on their books contracts that are not related to any actual work and could have been mentioned just to inflate turnover , while a few of them are already barred by various authorities across the country.The last week 's action on suspected 331 listed firms has already been followed up with Sebi asking exchanges and brokers to verify credentials of 107 unlisted entities and bar them from trading if results are found unsatisfactory.This list also mostly includes entities supposed to be engaged in real estate , plantation , trading and finance related businesses.These lists were shared with Sebi by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and are based on ongoing investigations by various agencies including the income tax department and SFIO.These companies need to provide auditor certificates , annual income tax return filings , status of any pending disputes with the income tax department , and status of compliance with all the requirements of the Companies Act .

BANGKOK : A minivan and a pickup truck both packed with passengers collided in eastern Thailand on Monday ( Jan 2 ) , killing 25 people in a harrowing reminder of the country 's notoriously dangerous roads .
Police said the minivan driver lost control and ploughed through a central reservation into oncoming traffic in the eastern province of Chonburi . Both vehicles burst into flames .
`` Twenty-five people were killed in the road accident , '' Police Lieutenant Colonel Wiroj Jamjamras at Ban Bueng provincial police station told AFP , adding two toddlers were among the dead .
`` The victims were killed by fire or the impact , '' he added .
Wiroj said 15 people were inside the minivan while 12 passengers were packed into the pickup truck . Two were injured but are expected to survive , he added .
Footage broadcast on Channel 3 showed firefighters tackling the burning , twisted wreckage of the two vehicles .
Despite relatively good infrastructure , Thailand has the world 's second most dangerous roads in terms of per capita deaths , according to data collected by the World Health Organization in a 2015 report .
Fatalities tend to rise in the New Year week and during Songkran , a religious festival in April , when millions of low-paid workers return to the countryside from their city jobs to see family .
Both weeks are dubbed the `` Seven Deadly Days '' in Thai media , with the government keeping a daily death tally during those two periods to try to encourage better road safety .
As of Sunday - the fourth day of the country 's New Year holiday week - 280 people had died on Thailand 's roads , a 10 per cent increase on last year .
Some 43 per cent of the recorded smashes involved drink-driving and 82 per cent involved motorbikes .

The Melbourne-born 30-year-old won a sprint bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London but missed out on selection for last year 's Games in Rio de Janeiro .
`` The Russian Cycling Federation has given me another opportunity to chase my dreams of Olympic representation in Tokyo 2020 which has special significance to me as my father ( Darryl Perkins ) raced the Olympics in Tokyo 1964 , '' he said in a post on his Facebook page on Wednesday .
`` I 've spoken to Cycling Australia 's High Performance Program and staff and they have been supportive . ''

New guidelines released Wednesday recommend U.S. adults start colon cancer screening earlier , at age 45 instead of 50 .
Contrast Adjusted Photo : A Healthier Michigan / Flickr / CC BY-SA 2.0
The American Cancer Society 's advice puts it out of sync with guidelines from an influential government advisory group , which kept the age at 50 in an update two years ago .
Cancer society officials acknowledge the shift to 45 could cause confusion for doctors and patients but felt strongly that they needed to act now . The advocacy group was influenced by its study , published last year , that found rising rates of colon cancer and deaths in people younger than 50 . Experts are n't sure why there has been a 50 percent increase in cases since 1994 .
The guidelines are for men and women ages 45 to 75 of average risk for colon cancer ; recommendations are different for people with certain conditions , like Crohn 's disease , or a family history of colon cancer . The group endorses six kinds of screening exams , from inexpensive take-home stool tests performed every year to colonoscopies done every 10 .
`` All of these tests are good tests , and the choice should be offered to patients , '' said the cancer society 's Dr. Rich Wender . `` The best test is the test that gets done . ''
The same tests are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , a panel that reviews evidence and issues advice for a variety of screenings and treatments . It updated its colon cancer guidelines in 2016 and its next review is n't expected until around 2021 .
That panel 's recommendations drive what screening is covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act , although 20 states have laws that link coverage to the cancer society guidelines . It 's not uncommon for groups to have slightly different guidelines although those for colon cancer have been about the same for decades .
Most colon cancer occurs in adults 55 and older , and the good news is rates of cases and deaths have been falling for decades . Colon cancer , combined with rectal cancer , is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S . This year , more than 140,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with it , and about 50,000 will die from it .
Doctors will probably look to specialty medical societies to sort out the different guidelines , said Dr. Marcus Plescia , of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials . But it may take a little while before they offer clear advice .
Some experts have worried about pre-50 risks of colon cancer in some racial and ethnic groups , and at least one specialty society for gastroenterologists has urged screening of black adults starting at age 45 .
Others argue that instead of lowering the age for routine screening , more effort should be put into getting more people tested . Only about two-thirds of people 50 and older have been following screening guidelines .
`` It 's hard enough to get people to do it at all , '' Plescia noted .
Dr. Andrew Wolf , the lead author of the latest guidelines , said they considered and rejected that reasoning .
`` We should be able to do both , '' said Wolf , a University of Virginia internist .

The Federal Road Safety Corps says plans by the Federal Government to introduce speed cameras in the country 's highways will not duplicate its speed limiter policy .
The spokesman of the Corps , Bisi Kazeem , gave the clarification in a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja on Tuesday .
Kazeem explained that the speed cameras would complement the FRSC 's speed limiter policy , which currently applies to only commercial vehicles .
Kazeem said : “ One is for enforcement by FRSC , while the government , as infrastructure to make sure that people behave well on the road , is providing the other one .

“ You should realise that anywhere in the world there are offenders . Not all commercial drivers , in the next ten years , will install the speed-limiting device ; some will be dodging .
“ As at now we are starting with commercial vehicles alone . So , if you are a private car owner , you can be caught with speed camera .
“ In essence , if one is not catching you , the other can catch you . So , they are different . ”
The Minister of Power Works and Housing , Babatunde Fashola , on Sunday said the ministry would introduce the speed cameras to help the FRSC check excessive speeding by motorists .
This has been a fun week so far . Having the weather clear from cold and stormy to warmer and sunny opened the door to the fun . My good buddy from Platte City , Mo. , ol ' Canby Handy , drove down on Tuesday and got here in time for he and I to go on a mini-Old Boar 's tour of parts of southern Morris County on gravel/muddy roads .
We took some sparsely graveled and sparsely traveled roads north and made our way to Council Grove for lunch . Then we drove north of Council Grove Reservoir and turned west into unknown territory for either of us .
As we wended our way west and south on gravel or low-maintenance , travel-at-your-own-risk roads , we stumbled onto what was left of a defunct old rural community by the name of Kelso . The only thing left of Kelso is the still-in-use Methodist Church — a square , two-story , frame and lap-sided building with a sign out front stating it wuz founded in 1861 .
From Kelso , we skirted the west side of the Council Grove City Lake and proceeded on south and west as the roads allowed . A couple of times we ended up on dead-end roads — one of which ended at an abandoned farmstead and the other ended up at a remote set of cattle pens .
While driving down one nondescript Morris County road , Canby and I stumbled upon a simple metal sign in the fence row that stated right there were the remnant ruts from thousands of freighter wagons traversing the old 1840s Santa Fe Trail from St. Joseph , Mo. , to Santa Fe , N.M. A grassed-over dip and swale clearly showed where the ruts remained . Sure made my imagination run wild .
From there we kept heading south and west and I wanted to find the homes of two old friends that I seldom ever see . I knew they used to have homes south of Council Grove somewhere close to the Four Mile Road and west of Highway 177 .

So , we headed back east along a gravel road and eventually came to a location I recognized and from it we found Four Mile Road . From my recollection of long-ago directions , we eventually found my friend Don 's farmstead , only to find that it is now occupied by Don 's son and family and that Don has moved to the east of Council Grove .
Then we stopped to visit with a very nice lady rancher who was out walking her German Shepherd dog . As it turned out , we have several mutual friends but had never met each other . When I asked if I was close to my other friend Bill 's farmstead , she said I had just passed it .
When we bade the nice rancher lady adieu , Canby and I took one more excursion along the county road that runs through a portion of the unfenced , open-range of the Mashed O Ranch on the south border of Morris County . That road ran a big U , past several remote ranch homes and eventually ended up back on the 177 highway south of Council Grove .
By then , Canby and I had enuf driving and riding , his pickup wuz coated in mud from bumper to bumper , so he headed back to Damphewmore Acres cross-country on gravel roads .
During that afternoon , Canby and I planned another Old Boars ' Tour for this April or May on the gravel roads of Wabaunsee County , which is north of Morris County . We 'll be trying to identify any unusual geographic or historic sites that we can visit . If any reader has an idea of what we should visit in Wabaunsee County , e-mail me at htcsac @ gmail.com .
Canby overnighted with us and Wednesday morning we helped cook breakfast at the Saffordville Old Boars ' weekly Gentle Men 's Club get-together . We had 19 old geezers and two younger `` pups '' meet , greet and eat that morning .
Wednesday afternoon , Canby and I , and our mutual friend Mocephus , went to ol ' Lon G. Horner 's home and played cards until Canby and I had about all their money . Lon 's been laid up for about a month convalescing from ankle surgery .

During the Gentle Men 's Breakfast , the in-resident historian , ol ' R. E. Vealitt , brought a list he 'd uncovered from 1913-1914 of all the school districts and the names of the teachers in Chase County . The county population in those early days wuz more than 9,000 . Today , it 's around 2,000 . The list of schools back in those days totaled an eye-popping 66 . The number of school districts in the county today is `` district . '' Yep , only one !

Speaking of one-room schoolhouses , I got a nice email from faithful reader Peggy from Greeley , Colo. She wrote : `` Your 'Getting Even ' article sure brought back memories .

I rode my Shetland pony to school and then turned her lose and she would go back home . One morning we were on the way to school and a bad storm was in progress , lightning struck right near us ! Of course Ole Babe jumped sidewise and I fell off in the mud ! I went on to school and Ole Babe went back home . Your column really brought back that memory of years ago . But the rest of the story was humorous , letting the horses loose to go back home without the kids ! My story was back in the early 40s and the school was a little one-room school house I went to up through my eighth grade , then we went and moved into Norton where I went to high school . I love your Kansas stories . You can take a Kansas girl out of Kansas but you can never take Kansas out of that girl ! ''

The federal government has commenced disbursement of interest-free loans to the latest accredited beneficiaries of Market Moni , the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme ( GEEP ) targeting market women , traders , artisans , youth and farmers .
MarketMoni is one of four schemes under the social intervention programme of the federal government , and is being executed by the Bank of Industry .
As part of the efforts of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to stimulate economic activities and deepen financial inclusion for the under-banked and unbanked , over 24,000 Nigerians – including market women and traders , artisans , and youth – have so far benefited from the special intervention programme since its roll-out in December , 2016 .
The Office of the Vice-President , in a statement , revealed that the federal government has commenced the disbursements in 13 states and the Federal Capital Territory , through the Bank of Industry ( BOI ) , and will be expanding across all states over the next two months .
The areas of current disbursement include Abuja , Adamawa , Akwa Ibom , Delta , Ekiti , Kogi , Kwara , Niger , Lagos , Ogun , Ondo , Osun , Oyo and Rivers .

BOI acting Managing Director , Mr. Waheed Olagunju , recently reiterated that MarketMoni was a demonstration of the government 's resolve to accelerate development of Nigeria 's microenterprises .
He urged beneficiaries to be judicious in the use of the funds and to pay back , as it enables the programme to remain sustainable and expand its reach to millions of Nigerians and stimulate economic activity at the base of the pyramid .
According to Olagunju , “ This federal government programme aligns with BOI 's goal of inclusive growth and expanding economic opportunity . Access to affordable funds is a primary challenge of micro , small and medium enterprises .
“ MarketMoni is a direct response to this challenge – granting loans at unprecedented rates that can not be accessed anywhere else . The government identifies with Nigerians working hard to keep their businesses afloat , and will continue to extend its assistance through initiatives of this nature . ”
MarketMoni seeks to expand access to credit for 1.6 million microenterprises annually , with over 50 per cent targeted at women-owned enterprises .

Matthew Kukah , bishop of Sokoto diocese of the Catholic Church , says President Muhammadu Buhari was not brought into power by angels .
Speaking in an interview with Abang Mercy on GatefieldTV , Kukah said though he knows Buhari quite well , he can not claim to be close to him .
The cleric said some of the president 's new friends in the Progressives Congress ( APC ) were among those he sent to jail while serving as the military head of state in 1984 .
He said it was worrisome that the president probably still thinks that corruption is all about stealing money .
“ I have known Buhari for a while but I do n't want to claim I am close to him but he is a man I have tremendous respect for , ” Kukah said .
“ What I said about Buhari 's corruption fight was that what you are fighting is called the symptom , it is not the disease .
“ My worry is that President Buhari thought and probably still thinks corruption is stealing money , and the people stealing money are largely bureaucrats or government officials , which was what happened in 1984 .
“ Buhari simply went around and arrested all the people who were holding government offices . The only thing we feel very sad about Nigeria is our collective amnesia . There are people who are key kingpins in APC today who were sentenced to various years of imprisonment by Buhari in 1984 , some up to 100 years .
- Advertisement -
“ But since this is Nigeria , many of them have finished serving their 100-year jail term . They have come back , joined APC and are active members of the party .
“ Buhari was not brought into power by angels . We know the nature of the vehicle that would bring anybody to the presidency of Nigeria . ”
Asked to access the Buhari-led administration , Kukah said he was not in the position to do so .
He added that Buhari still had the time to make right his wrongs .
“ I am not the one to measure Buhari 's competence . It will take us four years to decide if Buhari is the man for the job or not . Or we have the national assembly ; if they are serious and up to their job , they can stop an incompetent president mid-way , ” he said .
“ Buhari is going to be president for four years . We are just gone past the first half . And like the game of soccer , until the final whistle is blown , you ca n't say who has won .
“ It is quite conceivable that he might probably do something quite spectacular . For example , he is going to the south-east , which I think is quite unfortunate because it came so many years too late .
“ But notwithstanding that , I think with a certain kind of smartness , and if the president has the ability to look back and say what could we have done differently , and if he can take his attention away from some of the hypocrites around him , I think Buhari is free to step forward and say he wants to run for the 2019 election . ”
ecobee4
See at Amazon
The $ 240 ecobee4 is a smart thermostat with an incredibly smart twist : It includes small remote sensors that independently measure temperature and sense motion . You can use these sensors to give your thermostat a better idea of the temperature in your home ( averaged out across the various sensors ) as well as whether or not anyone is home and in what rooms they might be located .
The ecobee4 comes with Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant built in , thanks to embedded microphones that feature far-field voice recognition ( the same technology that makes the Amazon Echo hear you from across the room ) and a speaker that makes Alexa sound loud and clear , despite coming from a thermostat fastened to your wall . That means , on top of having all the same great features as the ecobee3 ( HomeKit-enabled , satellite room sensors , energy-saving benefits ) , you can use the ecobee4 in the same way you 'd use an Echo , Echo Dot , or Tap . Ask Alexa to set a timer , adjust the lighting , give you the steps to a recipe , play some jazz — you can do it all right from your smart thermostat .
You can probably guess how a smart thermostat will help you conserve energy . The ecobee4 lets you set up schedules , control — and keep track of — your heating and cooling while you 're away from home , and monitor your overall energy usage . And thanks to those remote sensors , you can set the thermostat to automatically turn on less often when they do n't detect motion for a period of time . It 's the thermostats way of determining that you 're either asleep or away from home .
The Baltimore Ravens ' mercurial 2017 season left them outside the playoffs and on the cusp of what could have been the end of an era in Charm City .
Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti revealed Friday that he considered firing head coach John Harbaugh after the season ended .
`` It was certainly a consideration , but not one that I was inclined to make this year , '' Bisciotti told reporters .
The revelation , which came minutes after Bisciotti announced Ozzie Newsome would step down as general manager after the 2018 season , shows how close the Ravens got to parting ways with Harbaugh . The Ravens have failed to reach the postseason the last three years , and Bisciotti 's comments underscore how important it will be for them to make the playoffs next season .
`` He 's under as much pressure than probably he 's ever been in his life , and I expect him to keep his chin up and take his positivity and his talents and make the most of the season , '' Bisciotti said . `` I may as well replace him now if I tell him to make the playoffs or you 're out of town next year . That 's not the way we run business here . ''
Since guiding the Ravens to five straight playoff berths that culminated in a Super Bowl victory over the San Francisco 49ers during the 2012 season , Harbaugh ( 94-66 ) , who 's under contract through 2019 , has just one playoff win over the last five seasons . Injuries have played a significant role in the Ravens ' recent struggles , but the team 's playoff-barring loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in the regular-season finale certainly stung hard .
Ultimately , the Ravens ' 9-7 finish ( following a 3-4 start ) might have been enough for Bisciotti to keep Harbaugh around .
`` I was very proud of the way John kept fighting , held the team together when we were losing in the middle of the year . Joe [ Flacco ] was obviously producing at substandard with his back injury and after the first couple of weeks , obviously , we were very encouraged by our defense and thought that could hold us together . We did n't perform very well in the middle of the year . I was proud of the way we fought back as a team . ''
On Monday , lawmakers continued their assault on women 's rights , with Mississippi passing the nation 's strictest abortion law yet . Effective immediately , as CNN reported , the new law bans most procedures after 15 weeks . So if you 're outraged , scared , and ready for action , here 's how to help women in Mississippi who may be affected by the state 's new restrictions .
As expected , Mississippi Gov . Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1510 , according to CBS News , which states that women can not obtain abortions after 15 gestational weeks except in rare occasions where the woman 's life or health is majorly threatened by the pregnancy , or the fetus has an abnormality that makes it `` incompatible with life '' outside the womb . It does not make exceptions for pregnancies in the case of rape or incest , according to CNN . Other states have restrictive laws , yes , but this is a new level of limitation . Still , it 's not entirely surprising that this is happening in Mississippi , which only has one abortion clinic left in the entire state , as The Cut reported .
That clinic , by the way , is planning to mount a legal challenge to the new law , and it has a solid argument . Roe v. Wade , the landmark case that made abortion legal in the United States , said that states were only allowed to restrict abortion after the fetus had a chance of viability outside the womb . According to Think Progress , even at 22 weeks , babies can very rarely survive outside the womb , so it seems clear that 16 weeks is not even close to meeting the viability cut-off .
So , if you want to help fight this new law , or help protect women who may be affected starting now , here are some ways to do it .
Offer Help To Mississippi 's Only Abortion Clinic
Jackson Women 's Health Organization is the only remaining abortion clinic in the state , and especially as the people running it dive into a legal battle over this new law , it seems clear that they 'll be happy to welcome all the help they can get . Now is a great time to learn about the clinic on its website . You can donate , or reach out to ask if there are other ways that you lend a hand .
Get Involved With The National Network Of Abortion Funds
This organization connects women who need abortions but can not afford them with the funds to get the procedure . This kind of help can be especially useful in places like Mississippi , where women might have to travel elsewhere , potentially across state lines , to obtain the procedure they need . The funds gathered here can be used to cover travel , child care , and lodging to ensure that women have the necessary access .
You can donate on the National Network of Abortion Funds website , and even sign up to lead fundraisers of your own . And if you really want to put the `` fun '' in fundraising , you can help support women 's abortion needs with a Bowl-A-Thon .
Support Planned Parenthood
There 's a reason that abortion opponents spend so much time targeting Planned Parenthood — the organization is really , really good at helping women . Planned Parenthood is always on the front lines when it comes to protecting freedom of choice , so now is a great time to donate or volunteer .
In The 2018 Elections , Support Candidates Who Support Women
Mississippi has a big election coming up this fall , and both Senate seats have the potential to be flipped . And sure , the national Senate is very different from the state legislature that just passed this restrictive abortion bill , but Mississippi could really use more pro-women representatives at every level . The state currently has the highest infant mortality rate in the country , according to Newsweek . It 's time for some new faces who are devoted to helping women and not regulating their bodies . Keep your eyes peeled on the candidates , because any liberal contenders will need all the phone banking and donations they can get to compete in this very red state .
Raise Your Voice To Stop The Stigma
Even if the new Mississippi ban gets knocked down in court , it will have accomplished one of its purposes — increasing the stigma around abortion . Oftentimes women who want and need the procedure do not get it because of the shame surrounding it , and this bill continues to send a harmful message about something that 's a deeply personal medical decision that might be necessary for a woman 's well-being or a choice they 've made for themselves and their families .
That 's why many women online have started speaking up and sharing their abortion stories , particularly using the viral campaign # ShoutYourAbortion . It 's so important for women who are considering making this decision to see others who do not regret it having done it , so that they can have all the information . Consider sharing your own story , or amplifying the voices of other women who have .
This new bill is extremely scary , and does not bode well for the future of reproductive rights . That 's why it 's so important to stand up and fight , and to help the women who will be most affected , starting now .
CHICAGO ( AP ) — Children 's injuries and deaths from window blinds have not stalled despite decades of safety concerns , according to a new U.S. study that recommends a complete ban on blinds with cords .
Nearly 17,000 young children were hurt by window blinds between 1990 and 2015 , and though most injuries were minor , almost 300 died , the study shows . Most deaths occurred when children became entangled or strangled by the cords .
Injuries continued even after manufacturers adopted voluntary safety standards including warning labels . The industry now has a plan in the works to make cordless blinds the only option at retail stores and online .
The study “ should be a huge wake-up call to the public , to the retailers , to the manufacturers and to parent all over the nation to really see how hazardous the cords on the blinds are , ” said Linda Kaiser of St Louis . Her 1-year-old daughter died in 2002 from strangulation when she pulled a looped hidden cord from a blind and put it around her neck . Kaiser later formed the advocacy group Parents for Window Blind Safety .
While study 's data analysis does n't show an up or downtrend in injuries and deaths , the fact that they 're still occurring shows that safety standards have been inadequate , said lead author , Dr. Gary Smith , who directs injuries research at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio .
Paul Nathanson , spokesman for the Window Covering Manufacturers Association , said a soon-to-be adopted industry standard drafted with input from the Consumer Product Safety Commission will make corded blinds unavailable in stores and online , although consumers could buy them through custom orders .
The safety commission says windows and window blinds are among the top five hidden hazards in U.S. homes and in a statement , it called the draft standard “ a major step forward in protecting children . ”
That standard is awaiting approval by the American National Standards Institute and is expected to take effect by late 2018 , Nathanson said .
Smith said 20 percent are custom blinds and a total ban on corded blinds is needed .
The study was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics .
His research team analyzed 26 years of U.S. government data on emergency room treatment and fatal injuries . The study notes that the dangers have been addressed in medical journal articles as far back as a 1945 report on two accidental hangings in children who survived .
“ Seventy years ago we recognized that this was a product that was killing kids , ” Smith said . “ We should put child safety first . ”

Women Friendly Initiative ( WFI ) , an NGO , has called for more sensitisation and education of the public , especially parents on importance of immunisation of children against polio .
Dr Francis Eremutha , the Chief Executive Officer of the organisation made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN ) in Gwagwalada on Monday .
Eremutha also appealed to religious bodies and other organisations to sensitize the people to ensure that children between ages zero to five years were immunised .
According to him , immunisation of children will prevent them from having polio as well as prevent the spread by those who already have it .
He also advised that cases of polio be reported early so that treatment would be administered to prevent the spread of the disease .
“ There is no need to wait until polio is discovered before it will be reported . Parents should report such case early enough , ‘ 'he said .
The CEO said that doing this would help eradicate polio in the community and the nation at large .

“ Polio is a communicable disease and it will be terrible if children who have it transfer it to those who do not have .
“ We want to make sure that only those children within the range of ages one to five are vaccinated .
“ We want to make sure that they are vaccinated properly , polio is more deadly than AIDS .
“ We can not afford to see this communicable disease go round our country and the society when we can prevent it . ''
He said that the NGO had embarked on sensitisation programme in some communities to let people know how the disease could be communicated as well as how to prevent it .
“ We want to see a country free from polio and we are working to ensure that there is no such case in all communities in FCT .
“ So I want to reassure parents that health programmes are for the development and progress of the people .
“ It is an act of preventing these diseases and not an act of humiliating individuals , so parents should be rest assured of health programmes . ”
Rams coach Sean McVay was not constantly smiling Sunday .
That , McVay said , should have been the telltale sign that no deal had been struck with star defensive lineman Aaron Donald .
Donald has been a holdout through two weeks of training camp and a preseason game .
“ We 're hoping that we can figure this out because Aaron 's a very important part of what we want to do , ” McVay said .
Donald , a three-time Pro Bowl selection , is entering his fourth season and the Rams have picked up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract .
Donald wants a renegotiated contract that would make him among the highest-paid players in the NFL . He is scheduled to make $ 1.8 million this season and $ 6.9 million in 2018 .
Lineman Michael Brockers said Donald 's absence was felt Saturday in a 13-10 victory over the Dallas Cowboys . Brockers , Ethan Westbrooks and Louis Trinca-Pasat started on the line in defensive coordinator Wade Phillips ' 3-4 scheme .
“ He 's probably working somewhere , working out , and he 's probably sick to his stomach , he wants to be out here with us , ” Brockers said about Donald . “ You 're missing that dynamic element in his defensive front .
“ But you know he 's going to be there sometime soon . ”
That , at least , is the Rams ' hope .

A male cyclist was taken to hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a tractor-trailer in Mississauga .
Peel Regional Police said the incident happened around 3 a.m. on Wednesday in the area of Dixie Road and Mid-Way Boulevard .
Peel Paramedics said the victim was rushed to a trauma centre in life-threatening condition .

Police said the tractor-trailer remained at the scene .
There 's no word yet on who was at fault and the investigation is ongoing .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - All of the almost 3,000 athletes competing at the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics are set to get perks including the latest $ 1,100 Samsung ( 005930.KS ) smartphones , top of the range new equipment to take home and sleek Nike ( NKE.N ) uniforms .
All except perhaps the 22 athletes from North Korea .
Tough international sanctions including travel restrictions and a ban on the sale of luxury goods and sports gear have complicated South Korean Olympic organizers ' efforts to provide their northern neighbors with the same benefits available to other Olympians .
For months , South Korean President Moon Jae-in has sought North Korea 's participation in the hopes it will ease tensions between the still officially warring nations and prevent the kind of violent incidents which have plagued previous major events hosted by the South .
Officials have rolled out the red carpet and are keen to make sure the visits go off without a hitch .
North Korean female ice hockey players and their South Korean teammates , who will compete as one nation in the Games for the first time , have been living and training together this week , even sharing a birthday cake .
Other members of the North Korean delegation , such as the cheer squad , will be housed in luxury hotels .
Overshadowing those efforts , however , are a host of U.S. and U.N. Security Council sanctions on Pyongyang over its efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States .
At almost every turn , South Korea has had to go great lengths to make sure its hospitalities do n't run afoul of sanctions or other laws , according to several South Korean officials .
Just raising the North Korean flag alongside other national banners in the Olympic Villages required an exemption from South Korean laws banning praise of the North Korea regime , a Pyeongchang organizing committee official told Reuters .
The officials all declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter .
NO GALAXY NOTE 8 , NO NIKE ?
Samsung Electronics , an official sponsor of the Winter Games , is offering 4,000 Galaxy Note 8 smartphones specially designed for the Olympics to “ all ” of the participating athletes .
The International Olympic Committee will distribute them , a Samsung Electronics spokesman told Reuters .
But South Korea is not sure if North Korean athletes will be eligible for the treats because of U.N. Security Council sanctions , an Olympics organizer told Reuters .
The official declined to elaborate , but experts say providing the $ 1,100 Samsung phone could violate U.N. sanctions that ban the sale of luxury items and electronics with a potential “ dual ” commercial and military use .
Meanwhile , the joint women 's hockey team will wear uniforms made by a Finnish company instead of official sponsor Nike , because of concerns about U.S. sanctions , another South Korean government official told Reuters .
Unilateral U.S. sanctions go far beyond the U.N. sanctions , effectively banning U.S. companies and individuals from trading with North Korea .
“ We are trying to figure out ways to live up to the sanctions , ” the official said .

Nike said it would comply with U.S. sanctions .
“ The Korean women 's hockey team will not compete in Nike uniforms , ” a company spokeswoman told Reuters .
North Korean athletes will also have to return Finnish hockey sticks , skates and other equipment the IIHF has “ rented ” for them when they leave South Korea , the official said .
The federation was not immediately available for comments .
FLIGHT RISK
South Korea 's unification ministry said it had sought and received temporary permission from the United States to fly an airliner to North Korea this week .
The flight took South Korean athletes for training in a ski resort in the North on Wednesday , and brought North Korean athletes to the South on Thursday .
Any aircraft or ship visiting North Korea is banned for 180 days from entering the United States . The exemption granted this week only applies to the latest flight , meaning U.S. approval is needed any time North Korean officials visit during the Olympics by airplane or ferry .
A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said Washington was in “ close contact with the Republic of Korea on our unified response to North Korea . ”
A U.S. Treasury official said the department evaluates applications “ for certain prohibited transactions and activities , which can include those related to the upcoming Olympics ” , without giving more detail .
For this week 's flight , an Airbus ( AIR.PA ) aircraft was used rather than one made by U.S. Boeing ( BA.N ) due to stricter U.S. sanctions , South Korean broadcaster Channel A reported . Asiana Airlines ( 020560.KS ) , who operated the plane , declined to comment .
To comply with South Korean military rules , the airliner had to fly some distance out to sea to avoid flying over the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone , the unification ministry said .
FIVE-STAR HOTEL
The North Korean Olympians are staying at the athletes ' village in Gangneung with athletes from other countries . The Olympics organizing committee was unable to say whether they are being given any special treatment , such as beefed up protection .
North Korea 's 230-member cheering squad is expected to stay at Inje Speedium , according to a unification ministry official , a four-star hotel surrounded by forest . Rooms there cost 242,000 won ( $ 226 ) to 715,000 won per night .
Its taekwondo performance team will stay at the five-star Grand Walkerhill in Seoul , which overlooks the Han River and previously hosted American stars such as Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton .
The spending is not unprecedented . When North Koreans visited the South for the Asian Games in 2002 , the Seoul government spent 1.3 billion won hosting them .
But now , even paying for routine things such as medical treatment or providing souvenirs can run into problems , said Yoo Ho-yeol , a professor at Korea University in Seoul .
“ Benefits provided to North Korean delegation , which were in the past were not subject to sanctions , can now become a controversy , since sanctions have become much more comprehensive in recent years , ” he said .
SINGAPORE : A 44-year-old man was arrested on Friday ( Oct 6 ) for his suspected involvement in a prayer scam , the police said in a news release .
The man had told his victim that someone had cast a black magic spell on her and offered to conduct prayers for her in exchange for payment .
He then managed to collect S $ 52,250 from the victim via a series of payments before he became uncontactable .
The victim made a police report on May 8 and the man was arrested on Friday after further investigations .
The man will be charged for cheating on Saturday . If found guilty , he may be punished with up to 10 years ' jail and be liable to a fine .
Twin girls who were conjoined at the stomach have been separated by a team of Zambian surgeons in a historic operation in Lusaka .
Eight-month-old Mapalo and Bupe underwent a seven-hour surgery at the Women and New Born hospital on Friday .
A team of 35 specialists lead by Dr Bruce Vulani operated on the girls who were joined at the abdomen and shared two livers .
“ The babies are stable and have been transferred to the intensive care unit , ” Dr Maureen Chisembele , the senior medical superintendent at the hospital told the media after surgery .
Following the news of their separation , social media was awash with praise for the doctors .
“ Awesome ! It 's historic . Who would have thought that skills synonymous with the famed Dr Ben Carson are locally available ? Checkmate… no need to fly out . Let us upgrade our equipment and invest in developing manpower , ” posted Mwembe Kaona .
“ A great achievement indeed , ” posted Namucana Musiwa , with Bwalya Tembo adding “ …it should bring joy and pride to our doctors . ”
The twins ' parents , Lydia and Moses Mwape , from Kawambwa in northern Luapula province , thanked the government and Zambians for their “ moral and physical support ” .
In 1997 , American neurosurgeon Dr Carson led a team of 50 Zambian and South African specialists to separate 11-month-old twin boys , Joseph and Luka Banda , who were joined at the back of the skull and faced in opposite directions . The 22-hour surgery on the Zambian twins was carried out at a hospital in South Africa .

Review : Morgan
( MA ) Kate Mara , Anya Taylor-Joy
Lee Weathers ( Kate Mara ) is a corporate trouble shooter who has been given a unique case . The corporation she represents has significant interest in a secluded group of scientists . Their research has implications that will have a far-reaching impact on the future of the corporation and they have a problem . In their seven years of work , this speciality trained group has worked to create a humanoid from genetically manipulated DNA . After several trials , they successfully bring Morgan ( Anya Taylor-Joy ) to life . The ambiguous humanoid has the capacity to develop faster physically and has accelerated cognitive skills , as well as super-human strength . In the five years since Morgan was brought into the world , it seems to be responsive to the team and has adapted well to the surrounding environment . Then one day this synthetic life form attacks one of the members of the scientists without known cause , but is kept alive for assessment by the team and the corporate office . Ms Weathers must quickly evaluate the situation , determine the mindset of this insular group and decide on the fate of Morgan .
What could possibly go wrong ?
From Frankenstein to 2015 's Ex-Machina , artificial life forms have been a fascination of filmmakers through the decades . Luke Scott ( Son of Bladerunner 's Ridley Scott ) attempts to deliver something new with his creation , Morgan .
The characters will seem familiar to fans of the sci-fi horror , but with some fresh twists : The caring scientist-creator , the over-zealous behaviourist , the misogynist psychologist , the unemotional corporate investigator and the misunderstood created being .
The opening sequences deliver promise , due to the superb performances from the cast . Their protective nature , parental defensiveness of Morgan and the pride they have in their work does get in the way of the investigation and builds the necessary tension of this thriller . The intensity escalates throughout the first half of the film , but fizzles out in the second half . Given a relatively inventive set up , it was disappointing that it turns into a less than satisfactory conclusion .
It is an injustice that Luke Scott has gathered this stellar cast and leaves them with such lifeless direction . With actors like Toby Jones , Paul Giamatti , Jennifer Jason-Leigh , and Michelle Yeoh , the assumption would be that he would merely have to dip a finger into this amazing talent pool and pull out a winning result .
Mara and Taylor-Joy are excused for delivering plasticine performances , but Giamatti and Jones are left with nothing to do within the storyline and the rest of the cast turn into predictable caricatures we 've seen in many other films .
Morgan begins with promise , but loses its way toward its conclusion and leaves this creation comatose on the table .
What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film ?
Why are we fascinated with creating new life ? For some it is a means of proving their intelligence , for others it might be exerting their power and for many it is merely a curiosity that must be explored .
One of the answers to this question can be found in the study of the Bible . Based on the premise of the creator God who made all mankind in his image , it is no wonder that God 's creation would want to create . This desire manifests itself in art , food , clothing , housing and even into the sciences . There are a multitude of moral juxtapositions to wrestle through in this consideration of creating new life , but the very nature to create is ingrained in humanity .
The only challenge is that God continues to prove that he is the only one to get it right when it comes to the creation of humanity . So , is the desire to create new life merely a lesson in futility or too hard to deny ? Discuss .
Questions
What does it mean to be human ? ( Genesis 1:27 , 2:5-25 ) As a creator , what was God 's purpose in creating mankind ? ( Isaiah 43:7 , Colossians 1:16 ) Is God a perfect and flawless creator ? ( Genesis 3 )

Invasive weed season 2018 is upon us . If you get on them now , you can stop Knapweed , Burdock , Blue Bur , Sow Thistle , Oxeye Daisy and other bad weeds from flowering and spreading more seeds throughout the East Kootenay region .
My thanks to the Cranbrook Lions Club for inviting me to join their roadside litter cleanup along Highway 3 , past the SPCA turnoff east of Cranbrook , May 16 .
The Lions Club senior citizens picked up a total of 42 large , orange garbage bags full of litter along both sides of a three-kilometre stretch of road , during a two-hour work party . In that time , I harvested one garbage bag of Canada Thistle and dug out one bag of knapweed rosettes along 30 metres of highway , one side only near Fraggle Rock , leaving 2,970 metres of road shoulder on the north side , plus three kilometres on the south side where knapweed is still growing .
Seeing weeds coming , and stopping their spread , is much less work than trying to control them after they have built a seed bank throughout the region . EKISC ( the East Kootenay Invasive Species Council ) knows this full well , as two thirds of their time and budget are spent trying to roll back the spread of knapweed that was allowed to get established , locally , generations ago .
At the other end of the Weed Warrior age range , a special thanks to Jessie Paloposki , Katie Grady , and Serena MacKay from the East Kootenay Invasive Species Council ( EKISC ) . They assisted me during my slide show presentation and weed pulling field trip , involving two classes of Gordon Terrace Elementary School students , on May 17 .
Jennifer Doll 's Grade 2 and Lauren Logan 's Grade 3 students were enthusiastic participants during the classroom discussion and slide show on detecting and evaluating a number of weeds — many of which are sliding under the “ official radar ” and boldly establishing themselves locally .
On the “ alley prowl ” from Gordon Terrace Elementary to the south side of Parkland Middle School , these eight- and nine-year-old Apprentice Weed Warriors , assisted by their teachers , parent volunteers and the EKISC team , gleefully identified , then assaulted , patches of Dandelion , knapweed , Blue Burr , Oxeye Daisy , Sowthistle , Burdock and Goats Beard , coming away with five garbage bags of weeds for the transfer station , after an hour long epic battle .
My humble apologies to the moms whose kids sacrificed their pant legs to demonstrate why you should not let your puppy walk through a patch of Blue Burr , not even a year later . A pinch of Corn Starch will help you ease burrs from your pet , but good luck with the pant legs , moms .
Yes , adult groups and other schools in the RDEK , this is an official challenge . If you think you can outperform an eight-year-old Weed Warrior , contact Jessie Paloposki at jessie @ ekisc.com and arrange a date to demonstrate your skills .

THE HAGUE : Convicted criminal Radovan Karadzic on Tuesday ( Apr 24 ) accused Bosnian Muslims of `` declaring war '' on Serbs , insisting at his appeal before a UN tribunal that he had worked for peace in the Balkans .
The prosecution 's case against him was `` upside down , the wrong way up , '' Karadzic insisted , on the second and final day of his appeal in The Hague .
The once-feared Bosnian Serb leader is urging the judges to throw out his 2016 conviction for war crimes and genocide , and either acquit him or order a new trial .
`` Nothing in these proceedings that was alleged is true , '' he said in an animated personal address to the judges , saying it meant `` that the conflict between us will persist '' .
In March 2016 , Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in jail for his role in the bloodshed during the Bosnian war which left 100,000 people dead and 2.2 million others homeless , amid the ethnic conflict which tore the former Yugoslavia apart .
He was found guilty of 10 charges , including genocide in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre - Europe 's worst bloodshed since World War II , when some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were separated from their families , shot and killed , their bodies dumped in mass graves .

'NOTHING AGAINST MUSLIMS '
Karadzic was also convicted of orchestrating the 44-month siege of Sarajevo in which some 10,000 people died under relentless sniping and shelling .
But Karadzic , 72 , insisted the city had been a stronghold of the Bosnian Muslim army `` whose aim was to take over all of the city '' and expel the Bosnian Serbs .
`` We were the ones on whom war was declared , defence is legitimate , '' he added .
`` We never had anything against Muslims , we considered them Serbs with a Muslim religion , '' he said , adding : `` Serbs , Muslims , Croats , we are one people , we have one identity '' .
`` Our main wish was for the Muslims to remain with us in Yugoslavia , '' he said , adding it was the Bosnian Muslims who wanted to secede .
`` How is it possible not to see that Serbs in Sarajevo and in Bosnia-Hercegovina were in favour of peace ? They made desperate concessions , '' he said .
The former strongman has lodged 50 grounds of appeal after he was convicted by trial judges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) .
BLOOD OF INNOCENTS
But prosecutors insist Karadzic `` abused his immense power to spill the blood of innocent civilians , '' and urged the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals ( MICT ) - which has taken over from the ICTY - to impose `` the highest possible sentence , a life sentence '' .
The prosecution is also urging judges to reverse his acquittal on a second charge of genocide in Bosnian municipalities and find him guilty instead .
`` Karadzic and his associates knew they would need to spill rivers of blood to carve out the ethnically homogenous territory and they sought and they embraced this bloody path , '' said prosecutor Katrina Gustafson .
He `` threatened non-Serbs with extinction and annihilation ... and incited inter-ethnic fear and hatred , '' she said .
`` He set the stage for a criminal campaign of a genocidal nature , aimed at destroying the targeted community , '' Gustafson added . Once it got underway , `` Karadzic oversaw it from the apex of power . ''
Presiding judge Theodor Meron closed the hearing saying he and the four other judges would hand down their ruling `` in due course '' .
After years on the run , Karadzic was caught in 2008 on a Belgrade bus , disguised as a faith healer . He was handed over to The Hague and his trial opened in October 2009 , lasting until October 2014 .
He is the highest-ranked person to be convicted and sentenced at the ICTY , after Serbian ex-president Slobodan Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial .
Documents released on Tuesday showed the court has freed on health grounds Bosnian Croat policeman Berislav Pusic , who was a member of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat state of Herceg-Bosna .
Pusic 's 10-year sentence imposed for atrocities against Bosnian Muslims was upheld on appeal in December , but Meron approved his release after serving almost two-thirds of his term , saying `` his health condition is a factor generally weighing in favour of his early release . ''
Harvey Weinstein after turning himself to authorities following allegations of sexual misconduct , May 25 , 2018 , in New York .
Julio Cortez/ AP
Harvey Weinstein was indicted on rape and criminal sex-act charges by a New York grand jury , prosecutors announced Wednesday .
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said the indictment , which follows Weinstein being charged with the felonies on Friday , `` brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which he is now charged . ''
Vance vowed to try the case in the courtroom , not the press , in a statement emailed to USA TODAY .
`` The defendant 's recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable , '' his statement said . `` We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence , it will reject these attacks out of hand . ''
He added that the grand jury investigation of Weinstein `` remains active and ongoing , '' and he appealed for additional accusers of the disgraced movie mogul to come forward if they have relevant information .
Defense attorney Ben Brafman said the indictment is `` not a surprise , '' that it merely `` mirrors '' the same charges already filed against Weinstein and `` does not add anything to the case we did not already know . ''
`` We remind everyone that an Indictment is merely a formal accusation , '' Brafman said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY . `` Mr Weinstein intends to enter a plea of Not Guilty and vigorously defend against these unsupported allegations that he strongly denies . We will soon formally move to dismiss the indictment and if this case actually proceeds to trial , we expect Mr Weinstein to be acquitted . ''
Earlier Wednesday , Brafman said Weinstein would not appear before the grand jury to testify . Brafman issued a statement saying he advised Weinstein to skip the grand jury hearing because of a lack of time to prepare .
`` After being unfairly denied access to critical information about this case that was needed to defend him before the Grand Jury , Mr. Weinstein 's attorneys decided that there was not sufficient time to properly prepare Mr. Weinstein , '' said the statement .
`` The identities of the accusers and the specific charges were provided to Mr. Weinstein last Friday on the eve of the Memorial Day Weekend and a deadline for his appearance set for Wednesday ( at ) 2 p.m .
`` Our request for a postponement of his appearance before the Grand Jury was denied . Accordingly , Mr. Brafman will inform the District Attorney today that Mr. Weinstein intends to follow the advice of his attorneys and not testify before the Grand Jury . ''
Weinstein turned himself in to New York police on Friday and was charged with felony sex crimes , including first- and third-degree rape and a first-degree criminal sex act , stemming from encounters in New York with two women , including one who was unidentified . Those are the crimes listed in the grand jury indictment .
On Tuesday , following a closed-door meeting with Manhattan prosecutors and a judge to discuss the case , Brafman told reporters the unidentified accuser was in a decade-long relationship with Weinstein that continued after the alleged attack on her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 .
`` Not having access to these materials is particularly troubling in this case , where one of the unsupported allegations is more than 14 years old and the Rape allegation involves a woman with whom Mr. Weinstein shared a 10-year consensual sexual relationship that continued for years after the alleged incident in 2013 , '' Brafman 's statement Wednesday said .

Although Weinstein 's personal testimony before the grand jury could be `` compelling , '' Brafman 's statement said `` an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Vance to secure a conviction of Mr . Weinstein . ''
Vance has been criticized by New York police detectives , by New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo and by the New York state attorney general 's office in connection with accusations against Weinstein , both current and dating to 2015 .
Back then , Vance 's office decided there was n't enough evidence to press charges against Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her , despite an audio tape of him seeming to acknowledge her accusations .
With the grand jury investigation continuing , further charges involving other accusers could be forthcoming . Weinstein , like any defendant , has the right to testify before a grand jury ; such proceedings are secret .
Weinstein , 66 , surrendered Friday and was led into court in handcuffs to face rape and criminal sex-crimes charges involving the two accusers . The fallen Hollywood mogul , who is free on $ 1 million bail and is confined to New York and Connecticut , has consistently denied having non-consensual sex with anyone .
Brafman 's legal advice to Weinstein came a day after a 90-minute conference Tuesday with prosecutors in the chambers of Judge James Burke . A transcript of the conference was sealed and Brafman was limited in what he could say about the meeting .
But he told reporters he was worried about the impact of bad publicity about his client could have on the grand jury .
Still , he said Weinstein expects to be exonerated if the case goes to trial .
`` You can only imagine what your state of mind would be if you were accused of a very serious crime that you maintain you did n't commit , '' he said Tuesday . `` So it 's a terrible state of mind in that regard , but he 's confident he 's going to clear his name . ''

The Accord Party ( AP ) , one of the 46 political parties taking part in the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State has denied adopting the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) , Prof. Kola Olusola .
In a statement issued Wednesday by the National Chairman of the party , Muhammad Lawal Nalado , the party said the purported rejection of the party 's governorship candidate , Jacob Aluko , by some persons who claim to be elders of the party in the state is false and unfounded .
Some members of AP in the state had at a press conference alleged that the party 's candidate had stepped down for the PDP candidate .
AP while dismissing its reported alliance with Governor Ayodele Fayose and the PDP , emphasised that it is solidly backing AP 's candidate in the election , noting that he has a widespread acceptability across the state that will give the party victory .
The party urged its supporters in the state to come out en mass and vote for its candidate in the election , adding that Aluko has the manifesto to address the economic challenges facing the people of Ekiti .
The party also denied any alleged agreement between it and PDP for the party 's candidate to step down for the PDP 's candidate .
The statement maintained that the candidate of the party is still very much in the race and heading for a victory .
It lamented the anti-party activities that was carried out by those who were sabotaging the candidate of the party ahead of the election , saying the party 's leadership will certainly take disciplinary action against those involved irrespective of how highly placed they are in the party .
The statement further warned that AP can not “ condone any form of irresponsibility by any member ” , adding that : “ the leadership of the part has over the past years worked heard to build discipline in party . ”
It urged members to avoid shortchanging the overall interest of the party for personal benefits .
It said the party in Ekiti State will embark on a massive campaign at the grassroots to project and sell the candidature of Aluko as the governor who will transform the fortunes of the state .

Stating that the state government must bring in amendment to the Land Revenue Code in order to protect agricultural land in Goa , former union minister Ramakant Khalap expressed unhappiness over failure of the government as regards the Goa Agricultural Tenancy Act , which has deprived the tenants of ownership of land .
Participating in a panel discussion on 31st anniversary of Goa Statehood Day , organised by Goa Legislative Assembly on Wednesday , Khalap said that the statehood was demanded to protect unique identity of the state which includes culture , language and agricultural land .
“ Even after 30 years of statehood , the state has not succeeded in maintaining its unique identity as expected , ” he pointed out .
Former speaker Rajendra Arlekar emphasised that there is a need to bring a change in mentality to protect and preserve Goa 's identity .
He also stated that the time has come where the state of Goa must lay more thrust on agriculture and focus on setting up of industries to generate employment without destroying environment .
Senior journalist Sandesh Prabhudesai said that with mining ban Goa should now focus on developing eco-tourism and boosting agricultural production in mining belt .
He further pointed out that the ‘ intellectual wealth ' of Goa was going out of the state as people were migrating for better prospects . He also lamented that people were migrating from villages to urban areas .
Another journalist Suhas Belekar said that the right , which the people of Goa got through statehood , was not used to protect the identity of the state by the politicians .
Senior journalist , Pandurang Gaonkar moderated the panel discussion .
Earlier , delivering keynote speech on the occasion , former chief minister Pratapsingh Rane said that though Goa has made tremendous progress in last five decades , it is well short in terms of overall development of the state .
Speaker Pramod Sawant said that Goa Legislative assembly has organised statehood day event for the first time and assured that it will be held every year in future .
Italy 's central bank chief warned on Tuesday that the state was `` only ever a few short steps '' from losing investors ' trust as markets dumped stocks and bonds , fearing repeat elections will become a de facto referendum on the country 's euro membership .
ROME : Italy 's two main anti-establishment parties could yet form a government , after the man nominated as interim prime minister said politicians , rather than technocrats like himself , might be able to steer the country out of deadlock .
Wednesday 's development came as financial markets calmed after a rout a day earlier , when investor concerns about Italy 's finances prompted the biggest one-day rise since 1992 in Italian two-year bond yields and dented the euro 's exchange rate .

The crisis started when the 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League abandoned their plan to form a coalition after the head of state vetoed their choice of 81-year-old eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona as finance minister .
On Wednesday , Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli said possibilities had emerged `` for the birth of a political government , '' and that financial market turmoil and other circumstances , `` have caused me to wait for further developments '' .
A source close to President Sergio Mattarella , who vetoed Savona as finance minister and appointed Cottarelli to form a government to oversee fresh elections around the end of the year , said the two men had `` decided together not to rush things , ( to favour ) a possible political government '' .
Luigi Di Maio , head of the 5-Star Movement which emerged from inconclusive elections in March as the biggest party in parliament , appealed to the League to drop its insistence on Savona as economy minister , so that the two parties could resurrect their bid to govern together .

`` Let 's find someone of the same calibre as Savona , who would still remain in the government in another ministry , '' Di Maio said on Facebook after meeting with Mattarella .
Mattarella welcomed the proposal , according to his staff . League leader Matteo Salvini , who is surging in opinion polls , seemed cool on the idea but did not rule it out .
`` I hope we can launch a government , we 'll see in the coming hours , '' he told party supporters .
However , in an apparent reference to Di Maio 's plan he added an analogy between ministers and footballers : `` If someone is a goalkeeper he has to play as goalkeeper , if someone is a striker he has to play as a striker . ''
Earlier in the day he had called for a snap election as `` the best way to get out of this quagmire and confusion '' .

On Tuesday , the prospect of a quick return to the polls - likely to lead to a eurosceptic government that could put Italy 's euro zone membership in question - hit Italian bonds and shares and pushed the euro to multi-month lows .
A surprise breakthrough between the president and 5-Star/League would ease uncertainty but still usher in a coalition planning to ramp up spending in the heavily indebted nation and push for changes to European Union and euro zone fiscal rules .
But even with uncertainty remaining , Italy 's government bond yields fell from multi-year highs on Wednesday and a smooth bond auction brought a degree of calm to a battered market .
`` We are not yet at the point where investors refuse to lend money to Italy , '' said Roberto Coronado of PineBridge Investments .
In Germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , Finance Minister Olaf Scholz played down the risk of the Italian crisis engulfing the currency area .
`` One can say that Europe is better prepared for difficult situations than before . What is more , I am firmly convinced that the majority of Italians have a very pro-European stance . It is a European nation , '' he told Reuters .
Three officials at the European Central Bank told Reuters the ECB was not considering any intervention as indicators were not yet showing signs of stress among banks and the central bank did not have the tools or mandate to solve what they said was being treated as essentially a political crisis .

BROOMFIELD , Colo. — The Colorado Department of Agriculture 's State Veterinarian 's Office has seen a steady decrease in Bovine Trichomoniasis cases in the last three years . Bovine Trichomoniasis , commonly referred to as “ trich , ” is an infectious sexually transmitted disease in cattle , resulting in abortions and infertility .
“ Ranchers who co-mingle their herds have a state requirement to test their bulls for trichomoniasis because there is a higher risk of transferring the disease . Testing and monitoring herds for ‘ trich ' is the best method of controlling this infection . Cattle owners should talk to their veterinarian to determine the best management practices for their herd , ” said State Veterinarian Keith Roehr .
“ Trich ” is a costly , yet preventable , infection that can affect dairy and beef cattle . If bulls become infected , the percentage of open cows can increase from 5 to 30 percent . Trich is a venereal disease of cattle caused by Trichomonas foetus ( T. Foetus ) . The T. foetus infection causes fertility problems , such as early embryonic death or abortion of the calf , and is asymptomatic in bulls .
Colorado trich regulations require that all bulls changing ownership or being transported into Colorado be tested for T. foetus unless the animal is going to slaughter . Bulls on public land grazing permits or with grazing associations must also be tested prior to turn-out .
Several diagnostic laboratories across the state offer trich testing ; samples must be collected by an accredited veterinarian and results are typically available between 4 to 6 days .

Police alarmed at number of teens filming themselves naked and posting online
SIMON MAUDE/STUFF Teens are putting nude images of themselves online at an alarming rate .
Teenagers are filming themselves naked and posting footage on internet sites or sending it to others in Hawke 's Bay at a rate that is alarming police and shocking parents .
Detective Sergeant Heath Jones said police in the region had seen a sharp rise with incidents where a teen has created such images or videos , or their parents have discovered the material .
`` The idea of sending images like this is difficult for many of us to understand . However our youth are bombarded with sexualised images and violence through various media via advertising , movies , music videos and video games . '' Jones said .
`` There is an acceptance amongst many of our youth that it 's okay to send nude selfies intended for their own age group , but if the images are shared it can be devastating for them , '' he said .

`` They do n't understand or care about the consequences their actions will have later in life '' .
Jones said it was important for parents to discuss the consequences of this .
He said the internet had bought paedophiles closer together and enabled them to share images and movies they obtain from unsuspecting youth .
`` The popular social websites are where the paedophile lives and poses as a young person trying to gain your child 's trust , '' he said .
`` In Hawke 's Bay we know of children as young as 11 who are filming themselves whilst nude or semi-nude . Parents are shocked at what they have discovered . Often they wo n't hear about it until their child is upset , or they stumble across it , '' he said .
An investigation discovered a 20 year old male living in London had a semi-nude image of a 12-year-old girl living in Hawke 's Bay which was obtained off the internet .
He threatened to expose the girl , the intention being that she send him more images .
`` Thankfully the family discovered what was happening and contacted Police , '' Jones said .
Jones said just as concerning to police were various websites that encouraged people to interact with strangers and film themselves , and these were also being used by local children .
`` What often occurs here is that , unknown to the teen , the person at the other end is recording the whole thing and will then go and post it on other sites or send to whomever he wants , '' he said .
Jones said police had become aware of gaming website where gamers could communicate with other users and change their voice .
`` We were told about this site by a child sex offender who had used it . This site has a feature that allows a user to change their voice so it sounds more childlike . The intention being that a dialogue is started that leads to the sending of photos or footage , '' Jones said .
Many incidents where someone has sent an image to a school friend who has shared it can be managed without the involvement of Police . ​
Jones encouraged parents to become involved in their children 's use of devices , ensuring security settings were switched on , and not to be afraid of enforcing restrictions .
`` Prevention is critical , '' he said .
Police would advise anyone who is concerned for their child 's safety or believes they are a victim of crime , in person or online , to report the matter to Police .
Further prevention advice is available on the NZ Police website and also at https : //www.netsafe.org.nz/ .
SAFETY TIPS :
* As a parent talk to your child early and often about e-safety . Just like any other life lesson , clear and simple communication is key with young children . Check that your children understand the dangers of posting personal information on social networking sites .
* Take an interest in what your child does online . Young children enjoy the attention of their parents and teachers , no matter what activity they undertake . This is also true of their participation in the online world .
* Let your child show you how to participate in their online world . As with gaining attention and approval , young children enjoy the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and experiences to teachers and parents .
* Ask your young child to help you in the online environment . What better way of discovering how your child thinks and behaves online than asking them to help you .
* Learn who your child talks to online . With so many people intentionally misrepresenting themselves online , it 's vital to keep tabs on who your child communicates with in the digital world . If you or your child becomes suspicious about a person online , stop contact immediately . If necessary , delete the app .
* Check online what dangers exist with social media apps that your child is using particularly ones that disclose their location .
* If appropriate , set boundaries and agree rules . Setting internet usage rules and boundaries can only be determined by each individual child 's age , experience and attitude to online safety . Do not allow your children to use the computer in private areas of your home .
* Does your child really need to have an internet capable device in their bedroom at night ? Is it crucial for children at a young age to have a snap chat or Instagram account or similar app ?
* Do not participate in online disputes between your child and their friend by sending messages . If required contact the school or the other parent and engage in conversation to resolve the issue .

Drake and his friends set out to make more power in the Mustang which they named Thunderstang . They started by rebuilding the V6 with Wiseco forged pistons , K1 Technologies forged crank , and a set of ported and polished heads from a 1998 Mustang . Switching to the pre-1999 heads allow the team to finish the engine build with an Eaton M90 supercharger and intake manifold from a 1995 Thunderbird . The combination made 557 horsepower and 497 lb-ft of torque to the wheels on 93 octane with 21 psi of boost . Drake is looking into converting the Mustang to E85 for even more power .

( Reuters Health ) - Health clinics where low-income people in the U.S. obtain medical care do n't always offer help with quitting smoking - and availability of that assistance may vary by patients ' ethnicity and insurance , a recent study suggests .
So-called safety net clinics exist to reduce barriers to healthcare . Patients at these clinics have higher-than-average rates of smoking , so it 's particularly important to address these disparities , said Dr. Steffani Bailey , a family medicine researcher at Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine in Portland .

`` We need to ensure that all patients , particularly in these settings , are getting access to the assistance that they need to help them to quit smoking , '' she said in an email .
Bailey and her team examined electronic health record data from 136,314 smokers at 143 clinics in 12 states between 2014 and 2016 . The researchers analyzed the type of smoking cessation assistance these patients received - whether it was no assistance , counseling only , medication only or counseling and medication together .
They also looked at whether age , gender , race , income level , insurance status and the presence of medical and psychiatric conditions influenced who received cessation help .
The odds of getting both counseling and medication - which is considered best practice - were lower among patients of all ethnicities combined than they were among non-Hispanic whites , the researchers found .

Patients with Medicaid , the government insurance for low-income recipients , had 17 percent higher odds of receiving counseling and medication compared with commercially-insured patients , but uninsured people had the lowest odds , the study team reports in the American Journal of Public Health .
With few exceptions , the study found , women , older people and those with co-existing medical conditions were the most likely to receive assistance with quitting smoking .
While other studies have used electronic health record data , Bailey said , hers is the first to examine predictors of smoking cessation assistance from such a large sample . The study was limited by the fact that researchers do not know the reasons for some patients not receiving smoking cessation medication . They also did n't have data on patients who purchased nicotine replacement therapy over the counter .
Bailey said her team plans to interview patients and providers and observe clinic visits to better understand why smoking is , or is not , being addressed in these visits .
Dr. Andy Tan , an assistant professor at the Harvard University T.H . Chan School of Public Health in Boston who was n't involved in the study , said researchers ' access to electronic health records provides previously unavailable data on service delivery for a large number of patients .
`` This is important because this will accelerate the identification of gaps in delivery of smoking cessation among subgroups of patients who smoke , to target training , patient education , and system change that ultimately eliminates disparities in providing this service , '' he said in an email .
The U.S. Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline recommends that clinicians offer brief smoking cessation interventions at nearly all encounters , Bailey said .
They recommend the `` 5 A 's model '' ( Ask about smoking , Advise to quit smoking , Assess willingness/readiness to quit smoking , Assist patient in quitting smoking , and Arrange follow-up ) . The clinician should discuss medication with the patient and should offer it unless there is a reason , such as pregnancy , that it should not be prescribed , Bailey said .
Offering medication and behavioral counseling together is considered the most effective way to help people quit smoking , said Dr. Kristine Browning of The Ohio State University College of Nursing and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center-James Cancer Hospital in Columbus , who was n't involved in the study .
`` To continue to close the disparity gaps that exist in healthcare , it is essential that behavioral researchers and healthcare providers continue to illuminate healthcare disparities where they exist , and work toward multifactorial solutions to eliminate disparity and improve patient outcomes . '' she said in an email . `` All patients deserve that highest evidenced-based treatment . ''

( Updates with final IPO price )
MADRID , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Spanish property developer Metrovacesa on Friday set the final price for its stock market listing at 16.5 euros per share , the bottom end of its indicative range , valuing the company at 2.5 billion euros ( $ 3.11 billion ) , down from a previous estimate of up to 2.95 billion euros .
The pricing at the bottom end of the range and a one day delay in the listing , which will be on Tuesday , is a negative sign for the first new listing this year in the property sector which has attracted a large part of Spain 's foreign investment in the past few years .
The company was forced to cut its indicative price range after it struggled to find investor demand for the listing , which is the first since Catalonia 's political crisis came to a head when the regional government declared independence .
Around a fifth of Metrovacesa 's assets are in Catalonia .
The final price sat at the bottom of the adjusted range of between 16.5 and 17 euros , which itself was cut on Thursday from an initial range of 18 to 19.5 euros .
Residential construction in Spain is thriving with foreign investment pouring into developments in cities and coastal resorts , a decade after a property bubble burst leaving banks laden with developers ' bad loans .
House builder Neinor Homes listed last year , the first flotation by a Spanish residential builder in a decade .
Metrovacesa was taken over by creditors Santander and BBVA in 2009 . The banks are selling stock in the company as part of the listing although they will remain majority shareholders .
BBVA , Santander , Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are acting as the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the offer , while Goldman Sachs and Société Générale are acting as additional joint bookrunners .

MANAUS , Brazil : Rioting inmates in Brazil decapitated and brutally assaulted their rivals , killing at least 60 , when fighting erupted between two gangs at a prison in the Amazon region , officials said on Monday ( Jan 2 ) .
The 17-hour riot broke out Sunday afternoon and lasted through the night at a prison on the outskirts of Manaus , the capital of Amazonas state , said state public security secretary Sergio Fontes .
He called it `` the biggest massacre '' ever committed at a prison in the state - and it ranks among the most deadly of numerous prison riots across Latin America in the past decade .
Bloodied and burned bodies were stacked in a concrete prison yard and piled in carts , an AFP photographer at the scene said .
Outside , heavily armed police hunted for dozens of inmates who escaped through a series of tunnels discovered at the Anisio Jobim penitentiary complex .
Fontes said 16 tunnels were discovered . In all , 87 inmates escaped , authorities said . Forty have been recaptured so far , the state security secretariat told AFP .
Anguished relatives of inmates meanwhile waited outside the prison for news of their family members . Authorities have not yet released the names of those killed .
Police finally restored order at the prison on Monday morning , freeing 12 guards who had been taken hostage , Fontes said .
They found a horrific scene inside . `` Many ( victims ) were decapitated , and they all suffered a lot of violence , '' Fontes told a press conference .
He said the gruesome scene appeared aimed at sending a message from the Family of the North ( FDN ) , a powerful local gang , to rivals from the First Capital Command ( PCC ) , one of Brazil 's largest gangs , whose base is in São Paulo , some 2,700 kilometres to the southeast .
`` During the negotiations ( to end the riot ) , the prisoners had almost no demands , '' Fontes told local radio network Tiradentes . `` We think they had already done what they wanted : kill members of the rival organisation . ''
'SILENT WAR '
Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes flew to Manaus to meet with local officials , his office said .
It was the latest eruption of horrific violence to hit Brazil 's underfunded and overcrowded prisons .
In October , deadly riots broke out at three separate prisons blamed on fighting between members of the country 's two largest gangs , the PCC and the Red Command ( CV ) .
During that episode , rioting inmates took visitors hostage , beheaded rivals and burned others alive , killing 33 people in all , authorities said .
Brazil 's prisons are often under the de facto control of drug gangs , whose turf wars on the outside are also fought out among inmates .
`` There is a silent war of drug trafficking , and the state needs to intervene , '' Fontes said . `` What did we see in this case ? One faction fighting another , because each wants more money . The fight is for money and space . ''
Brazil has struggled for years against a lucrative and violent drug trade .
But jailing drug traffickers has done little to solve the problem . It may even fuel it , critics say .
Human rights groups have long complained about the conditions in Brazilian prisons .
`` The problem starts with overcrowding , '' said Marcos Fuchs , a human rights activist . `` When you put inmates from rival factions in the same prison unit , the state has no control over what happens inside , '' he told AFP .
Some 622,000 people were imprisoned in Brazil as of the end of 2014 , most of them black males , according to a justice ministry report .
That makes it the world 's fourth-largest prison population , the report said , after the United States , China and Russia .
Brazil 's prisons need 50 percent more capacity to handle the current number of inmates , the justice ministry report found .
There were 1.67 prisoners for every available space , it said . In Amazonas state , the figure was 2.59 prisoners for every space .
ATHENS : Firefighters battled more than 90 forest fires across Greece on Monday , an outbreak fed by dry winds and hot weather that saw blazes burning near Athens , in the Peloponnese , and on the Ionian islands of Zakynthos and Kefalonia .
The fire near Athens was burning unchecked for a second day , damaging dozens of homes . It had started in Kalamos , a coastal holiday spot some 45 km ( 30 miles ) northeast of the capital , and spread overnight to three more towns . A state of emergency was declared in the area .
On Zakynthos , an island popular with foreign tourists , several fires continued to burn for a fourth day and authorities declared a state of emergency . One minister said those fires had been set deliberately .
`` It 's arson according to an organised plan , '' Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis , who is the MP for Zakythnos , told state TV when asked to comment on the dozen fires burning on the island . `` There is no doubt about it . ''
It is not clear what caused the fires , and no investigation has begun into possible arson . Late July and August often see a outbreak of forest and brush fires in Greece , where high temperatures help create tinder-box conditions .
Near Athens , authorities ordered a precautionary evacuation of two summer camps and homes in the area and evacuated a monastery after flames reached its fence on Monday . Hundreds of Kalamos residents fled , heading to the beach to spend the night .

`` It was a terrible mess , that 's what it was . You could see homes on fire , people running , people desperate , it was chaos and the fire was very big , '' a resident told Reuters TV .
Andreas Theodorou , a local councillor , said the blaze had damaged `` several dozens of homes . ''
`` Help did not arrive fast enough , and if you do n't stop a forest fire so large as soon as it breaks out , it 's very hard to put it out , '' he said .
The fire brigade said rugged terrain dotted with small communities made the fire fighting difficult .
In the Peloponnese region of Ilia , the site of Greece 's worst fires in 2007 , which killed more than 70 people , blazes broke out in three areas on Monday , prompting the evacuation of a village .

Police in Yarmouth said Nero , the K-9 partner of slain Police Sgt . Sean Gannon , is getting stronger by the day and continues to recover .
The department updated Nero 's progress in a Facebook post Tuesday after receiving several inquiries about the police dog 's health .
`` Nero is getting stronger by the day . He is being well cared for by K9 handlers and friends , '' Yarmouth police wrote . `` He still is not fully recovered but his future is bright . ''
Gannon and Nero were shot on April 12 while police served a warrant at a Marstons Mills home in Cape Cod .
Thomas Latanowich , 29 , shot Gannon in the head and Nero in the face and neck , authorities said . Latanowich , the man to whom Yarmouth Police are referring to only as 125 -- for the number of prior criminal charges he has on his Board of Probation criminal record in Massachusetts - pleaded not guilty to a murder charge in court .
Nero underwent surgery after the shooting . On the day Gannon 's body was brought from Pope Piux X Catholic Church in Yarmouth to the cemetery , Nero rode to a temporary new home .
Retired Yarmouth K-9 handler Peter McClelland entered the home where Gannon and Nero were shot and stayed with the dog .
He then stayed with Nero for 144 hours straight at the local veterinary hospital .
Police said Nero will return to Gannon 's family when everyone is ready . Gannon , 32 , leaves behind his wife , Dara , his parents and a brother and sister .
Job shadowing , internships and apprenticeships are just a few of the career connections that will become available to 29,000 students thanks to $ 6.4 million in new Career Connect Washington grant funding .
The awardees expect to create 29,000 new career connected learning experiences in 11 communities from now through September 2019 . These include STEM ( science , technology , engineering and math ) learning experiences , job shadows at local employers , career planning , and over 4,800 new internships , pre-apprenticeships , and registered apprenticeships .
“ A four-year degree is n't the only path to a fulfilling career , ” Gov . Jay Inslee said . “ Business leaders have told us they are looking for talent in everything from information technology to health care . And that 's what this initiative is all about : connecting students to great employers and high-quality job training . ”
The initiative expands registered apprenticeship programs and puts a new focus on youth registered apprenticeships . The awardees expect to move over 1,400 young people , plus more than 400 adults , into new apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships in fields such as advanced manufacturing , health care , agricultural irrigation systems , building trades , IT and maritime manufacturing .
“ This is the most critical commitment to apprenticeships for young people and adults the state has made in almost a decade , and we hope to see more in the future , ” said Lynn Strickland , Executive Director of the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee ( AJAC ) .
Local workforce development councils and STEM networks led local application teams , which brought businesses together with schools , apprenticeships , community and technical colleges , and local youth organizations to connect youth with local employers .
The grants support the Career Connect Washington initiative Inslee launchedMay 31 at the Governor 's Summit on Career Connected Learning , which attracted more than 1,200 participants from 27 sites around the state . The initiative 's goal is to connect 100,000 students during the next five years with employer internships , registered apprenticeships , and other career connected learning to prepare them for high-demand jobs .
“ It 's all about jobs , and Career Connect Washington means thousands of young people getting good jobs , living rewarding lives , and not going through the difficulties of unemployment , ” said Tim Probst , Director of Workforce Initiatives for the Washington State Employment Security Department .
Inslee 's Career Connect Washington Task Force includes representation from employers , labor , and the public sector . It is co-chaired by Brad Smith , president of Microsoft , and Perry England , chair of the Workforce Board and a vice president at MacDonald-Miller Facility Solutions . Several task force members were part of Inslee 's recent apprenticeship study mission to Switzerland .
“ Washington is committed to expanding career connected learning and youth registered apprenticeships .

LONDON : Taxi app Uber will improve conditions for its British drivers with changes including in-app tipping , after criticism from lawmakers and unions for not giving them more rights .
Drivers for Uber , food courier Deliveroo and other apps tend to work for a number of firms without a fixed contract in what has become known as the `` gig economy '' .
Uber said on Monday it had held meetings and spoken to thousands of them as part of its attempts to improve conditions for its more than 50,000 drivers .
The company promised improvements in July after a government review said those working for such apps , who are mainly self-employed , deserved more rights .
`` While drivers have told us they love the freedom of being their own boss , we 've also clearly heard that we need to make improvements , '' Uber 's UK General Manager Jo Bertram said .
Users will be able to tip drivers via the app rather than just in cash , have to pay 20 pence ( US $ 0.26 ) per minute for making drivers wait after an initial two-minute period and the free cancellation period will be cut from five to two minutes .

Uber said it will make its ratings system fairer and allow drivers to turn down riders they do not wish to take more quickly , which will make it faster for them find a new ride .

Speaker of House of Representatives , Mr Yakubu Dogara , has warned lawmakers against forming support groups in the parliament for public officers , describing it as violation of their oath of office .
Dogara said this at plenary on Tuesday , while reacting to the April 18 attack at the Senate during which thugs suspected to have been sponsored by a suspended senator made away with the mace .
He also declared that the action of the perpetrators of the act was an attack on the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari , not only the National Assembly .
He said there was nowhere in the world where lawmakers formed ‘ clubs ' to drum up support for public officers in other arms of government , maintaining that it amounted to violation of their oath of office .
The speaker warned that the House leadership would not tolerate any act of terrorism from any member .
According to him , there is no club anywhere in the world dedicated to defending or protecting someone 's interest .
“ So , when lawmakers , having groups to support public officers , we are violating the very essence of the mandate we have been given by the people .
“ This is not a place for anarchist , monsters or terrorists .
“ We ca n't allow anyone to terrorise this parliament . We are democrats and anybody that calls himself a democrat ca n't be defended by thugs ; a democrat is defended by the law , ” he said .
To lawmakers who belong to support groups , Dogara said “ this slant of psychophancy operating in the National Assembly , I have a message for them .
“ We were attacked in the 7th Assembly and those who collaborated with outsiders to attack us , where are they today ?
“ There is need for us to add our voice so that the public will know where we stand .
“ First of all , I have listened to debates on the social media on the attack on the senate and even enlightened people have tried to justify the morality of the invasion of the chambers .
“ There is no amount of anger that would make a member of National Assembly to procure the services of thugs to come and carry out acts of treason on the parliament .
“ And , if this can happen here , nothing stops them from invading the Supreme Court , because this place is more secured than the court .
“ So , any attack on the National Assembly is attack on Buhari ; any attack on the judiciary is an attack on Buhari and any attack on the executive is an attack on Buhari 's government , ” he said .
SUZUKA , Japan : Lewis Hamilton struck a huge psychological blow in the Formula One title race on Saturday ( Oct 7 ) with a sizzling qualifying drive to take pole position for the Japanese Grand Prix .
The Briton , who leads Ferrari 's Sebastian Vettel by 34 points with five races left , steered his Mercedes to a track record of one minute , 27.319 seconds with Valtteri Bottas second fastest .
However , Vettel will join Hamilton on the front row after Bottas incurred a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change on Friday .
`` The car is crazy here , '' said Hamilton after his 71st career pole , and first at Suzuka .
`` Every lap was fantastic . I 'm running out of opportunities to get this pole so I made sure I made it stick today . ''
A three-time race winner in Japan , Hamilton 's dominant qualifying performance dented Vettel 's fading title hopes after the German set the early pace in Friday 's rain-hit practice .

`` I tried everything on that last lap as I knew I had to take a bit more risks , '' said the German .
`` I knew that we 'd be on front row because of Valtteri 's penalty so I 'm pretty happy . ''
Red Bull 's Daniel Ricciardo was fourth fastest , ahead of teammate Max Verstappen , who won in Malaysia last week .
Ferrari 's Kimi Raikkonen qualified sixth quickest , but will also be demoted five places after switching his gearbox following a shunt in Saturday 's practice .
SINGAPORE : A new Zika cluster was confirmed at Block 143 Serangoon North Avenue 1 and Serangoon Ville , the National Environment Agency ( NEA ) said on Monday ( Aug 14 ) .
The cluster comprises two locally transmitted cases of the virus , both involving residents of the area .
This is the third cluster to have been identified at Serangoon North Avenue 1 in less than a month . The first cluster , at blocks 125 , 126 and 127 , has since been closed .
The second cluster , at blocks 109 , 115 , 116 and 117 , remains open . As of Monday , there have been five cases of Zika in the cluster , two of which were in the last two weeks , data on the NEA website showed .
Ongoing vector control operations in the area have been extended to the new cluster , NEA said .
The agency added that its officials were already conducting inspections in the vicinity even before the latest cluster was identified . So far , 11 mosquito breeding habitats have been found and destroyed , seven of which were in homes and four in common areas or other premises , NEA said .

It also urged residents to maintain vigilance and prevent mosquitoes from breeding .
Iowa City police say a body found in the Iowa River is a woman who had been missing since March .
A news release from the police department says an autopsy has confirmed the body found in the Iowa River near Hills Friday is 37-year-old Katherine “ Katie ” Brooker . Police had requested help in finding Brooker — who had last been seen on March 10th — saying she had health issues .
Police say they investigated several leads and were unable to find Brooker until the body was discovered in the river . Investigators are still trying to determine the circumstances surrounding Brooker 's disappearance and death , but say they do not believe there was any foul play .
CHITTAGONG : Emergency workers in Bangladesh on Thursday ( Jun 15 ) stepped up the search for victims of the country 's worst ever landslides , with mounting claims that the disaster was made worse by unchecked development .
Rescuers found two more bodies , including that of a woman apparently washed away , taking the death toll from floods and landslides across southeast Bangladesh to 154 .
`` We think she was washed away by strong currents during Tuesday 's landslides , '' local fire chief Didarul Alam told AFP .
`` We have stepped up our rescue work in the five worst affected spots . But it 's a huge struggle to dig through four feet ( 1.2 metres ) of mud . Also villagers were not sure where the bodies were buried . ''
Emergency workers also found the body of a soldier missing since Tuesday , army spokesman Rashidul Hasan told AFP .

The landslides were the deadliest in the country 's history , eclipsing the previous highest death toll of 127 a decade ago .
Bijoy Giri Chakma , an elected tribal leader in the hardest-hit district of Rangamati , told AFP the landslides were the worst he had ever seen , and blamed unplanned construction and the large-scale cutting of trees for the scale of the disaster .
`` Trees have been felled indiscriminately , which loosens the soil . A lot of these hills are now completely barren , '' said Chakma .
His views chimed with those of local rights activists .
`` The disaster is man-made . But there is a tendency to blame nature for this , '' said Sheepa Hafiza , head of the rights group Ain o Salish Kendra , at a news briefing on Wednesday .
Authorities say hundreds of homes were buried by mud and rubble sent cascading down hillsides after monsoon rains dumped 343 millimetres ( 13.5 inches ) of water on the southeast of the country in just 24 hours .
Disaster Management Department chief Reaz Ahmed said teams had begun to assess the full extent of the damage left by two days of incessant rains in the Chittagong hills , which cover one tenth of the country 's landmass .
Authorities have opened 18 shelters in the worst-hit hill districts , where 4,500 people have been evacuated .
The monsoon rains came two weeks after Cyclone Mora smashed into Bangladesh 's southeast , killing at least eight people and damaging tens of thousands of homes .
South Asia is frequently hit by flooding and landslides in the summer with the arrival of the annual monsoon rains .
More than 200 people were killed in Sri Lanka last month when the monsoon triggered landslides and the worst flooding the island has seen in well over a decade .
Premier League clubs are pushing for the transfer window to be shut before the start of the season , according to reports .
National newspapers say the issue is set to be discussed at a shareholders ' meeting in September with a majority of clubs in favour of shortening the window , which this year closes on August 31 .
The move comes amid uncertainty over the future of a number of players , including Liverpool 's Philippe Coutinho , Everton 's Ross Barkley and Swansea striker Gylfi Sigurdsson .
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp appeared to lend his support to the idea at a press conference ahead of his side 's UEFA Champions League match in Hoffenheim .
Klopp said : `` It would have helped us this year ( if the window had shut early ) . It makes sense that when the season is starting , planning for the team is over . ''
His Swansea counterpart Paul Clement , who faces losing Sigurdsson to Everton , has also indicated that Premier League bosses broadly back the change .
`` At our managers ' meeting at the Premier League last week , we spoke about it , ' Clement said over the weekend .
`` The majority of clubs are in favour but maybe all have to be for it to go through . It could happen next year . ''
Southampton 's Virgil van Dijk is another player whose future remains in doubt with a number of rival Premier League clubs still interested in signing him .
Officials at the Premier League were not immediately available to comment on the reports .
A Benton man recently received a sentence of 10 years ' probation for setting a house on fire earlier this year .
Joseph Ioup , 45 , pleaded guilty to an arson charge in connection with the incident . The charge was entered in Saline County Circuit Court .
According to a Saline County Sheriff 's Office report , shortly after 7 p.m. on Feb. 22 , deputies were notified that a wanted man was possibly inside a home in the 4800 block of Arkansas 5 .
When deputies arrived , Ioup , who was named in an active warrant for failure to appear , refused to open the door and began cursing , said Jeff Silk , spokesperson for the Saline County Sheriff 's Office .
For more than 40 minutes , the patrol division sergeant attempted to speak with Ioup , but he allegedly refused to exit the home and began throwing items through the window toward deputies .
At one point during the incident , Ioup allegedly threatened to burn the house down , Silk said .
Following the threat , a fire department was notified , they observed smoke and flames . When the dwelling was fully engulfed in flames , the Crows Station and Salem Fire Department firefighters stepped in to extinguish the blaze .
Ioup dropped a dog out of the rear window of the home and then exited the home through the window . He was treated for minor injuries at the scene and transported to Saline Memorial Hospital . After being released from the hospital , he was
transported to the Saline County Detention Center .
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Carrie Robertson represented the state during the case . Toney Brasuell served as legal counsel for Ioup .
Just about every day , a solitary guitarist plugs into her portable practice amp and begins rehearsing at one of several secret outdoor locations around Silver Lake Reservoir . Most of the passers-by , joggers and dog walkers circling the reservoir do n't pay any attention or have any idea who the performer is .
But Margaret Garrett , half of the garage-blues duo Mr . Airplane Man , is not a typical meek folkie strumming airy songs in the park . Collaborating with drummer-keyboardist Tara McManus , Garrett is best known for creating stomping , hard-driving original songs that combine elements of blues , punk , garage rock and psychedelic pop into an unusually compelling and distinctively haunting mixture .
In the late 1990s , Mr . Airplane Man were based in Boston and went on tour and worked with their mentors , Morphine , and played on bills with The White Stripes , The Blues Explosion , Yeah Yeah Yeahs and The Reigning Sound . Because of their stripped-down guitar-and-drums instrumentation , they often were compared to The White Stripes , but Mr . Airplane Man crafted a stubbornly non-retro , distinctly feminine version of the blues that felt more deeply personal and soulfully entrancing than the more mannered and self-conscious blues affectations of Jack White .
The duo were fairly popular on the East Coast and in Europe , and released a series of prized recordings on Sympathy for the Record Industry and other underground labels in the early 2000s before Mr . Airplane Man mysteriously disappeared for the better part of a decade . McManus and Garrett moved away from each other and began raising their kids , and the group was seemingly forgotten until December 2014 , when The Lost Tapes , a collection of unreleased 1999 recordings was released out of the blue .
“ We 're both single moms . We had a lot to juggle , ” Garrett says in an interview at a picnic table on a sunny , breezy day in the park at the south end of the reservoir . “ We had different bands , but we both missed playing together . We re-met in Boston and played a couple shows , and it felt amazing . ”
Newly reinvigorated , Garrett and McManus flew to Europe and began recording the songs that would end up being released in 2016 as Geneva Session by Swiss tastemaker Robin Girod . Mr . Airplane Man also started working again with a former producer , Reigning Sound/Oblivions mastermind Greg Cartwright , and recorded an EP that will be released sometime this year .
EXPAND Mr . Airplane Man Galen Palmer
However , Garrett and McManus were n't totally satisfied with these recordings . “ I remember having a dream . There were mountains in the background , a lot of pollen — or maybe it was dream dust , ” Garrett explains . “ We had just recorded with some engineer whose face I could n't see .
“ We were trying to find a label , but no one wanted to put it out , ” she continues . “ We raised the money on [ crowd-funding site ] Indiegogo to rent out Panoramic House , ” a recording studio in Marin County , north of San Francisco . “ It was a magical place on a cliff that overlooks the ocean at Stinson Beach . They had the best 2-inch tape , insane boards . … As we were driving through winding hills to the studio , it was just like my dream . The universe felt it had to be so that we should be there . ”
McManus and Garrett rerecorded a few songs from the previous sessions , but they were so inspired by their surroundings that they wrote several new tunes that ended up on Jacaranda Blue , Mr . Airplane Man 's eighth album , which was released in March by Sympathy for the Record Industry , a seemingly dormant label whose recent revival echoes Mr . Airplane Man 's return .
Championed again by producer Girod , the two benefited from working with engineer James Finch . “ Having just drums and guitar is a really great limitation , ” Garrett says , but on Jacaranda Blue she and McManus found themselves “ experimenting with making it sound fuller . ”
Mr . Airplane Man 's stark early recordings occasionally had a bass guitar here or there , but on the new album multi-instrumentalist Girod fleshed out the duo 's songs with a lot more bass — as well as percussion , vibraphone , acoustic guitar and theremin . The new songs also have more of a psychedelic dimension , with Finch manipulating a space echo from under the control board to heighten Garrett 's vocals .
“ James was down there with the echo flipping out while I was singing , ” Garrett says . “ We 've always had a weirder side ; we 've never been a straight blues or straight garage band . … We like to get weird and psychedelic because it 's dreamy and cool . ‘ I 'm in Love ' has a John Lee Hooker feel , but when I sang it , I 'd be thinking of Suicide 's Alan Vega , who had just died . Maybe he was visiting me . ”
Discussing the new album 's title , Garrett says , “ Colors reflect moods and can bring you into moods . Our practice space was on a street lined with jacaranda trees . We 'd come out of practice and feel high looking at this amazing color . … It makes me feel so happy , that color — and there is more than one shade of jacaranda — and that tree . It 's so ecstatic and happy to be alive . Just being here physically [ in California ] is this amazing experience . Yes , you 're running out of money and there are these difficult things to deal with , but there 's also this explosion of colors and life . ”
The plan was for the duo to relocate together to Los Angeles , but McManus , 48 , remains in Rhode Island and flies out for occasional shows to join Garrett , who now lives in Silver Lake . When they were living in separate cities over the past decade , Garrett was a member of Jack Oblivion & the Tearjerkers , while McManus played with Turpentine Brothers and Far Corners and now performs with Heavy Connection .
“ It 's like being inside of a pinball machine , ” Garrett , who was born in Cambridge and raised in Massachusetts , marvels about life in L.A. “ I feel like it 's amazing to get anything accomplished here. ” But she also feels energized by her new home . “ In L.A. , you can set up and play outside year round . I really like looking at trees and sunlight . It kind of gets me into a trance state , ” she adds , pointing to her favorite tree — a tall , looming pine tree that 's leaning toward the reservoir . “ People can hear me . That bothers me more than it does the people — I do n't like to insert myself into other people 's eardrums .
“ I 'm a loner . I sort of go off on my own and do my own thing , ” says Garrett , who is so inspired by living in Silver Lake that she 's begun work on a solo album . Her new songs are less bluesy , ranging from sun-dappled pop reveries to trance-like Gnawa-style incantations . “ I have to please myself . That 's how I 'm doing my solo album . I have to sell my car , and with that money I 'm going to put it out — that 's my soul . … Just to mend my broken heart , I come to the park . I come out here to play songs , and I do n't have to worry about what people think . I 'm pleasing myself — I 'll play one song for an hour .
EXPAND Mr . Airplane Man Galen Palmer
“ The sun is working with me , ” Garrett continues . “ The birds are my audience ; they totally land near me and make a lot of noise while I 'm playing . You have to follow your bliss in each moment — somewhere , the universe meets you . … The solo album is going to be called ‘ Something Silver Lake , ' like The Birds of Silver Lake or Sirens of Silver Lake or Sunbeams & Daydreams of Silver Lake . ”
Garrett likely will preview some of her new solo songs as well as selections from Jacaranda Blue when she appears Friday night at Alex 's Bar as part of a benefit for beloved local scenester Sean Barger , who 's battling cancer . “ Sean 's a friend through the music , ” Garrett says . “ I 'm always asking Facebook friends for help — I 'm one of those people — and Sean bonded with me and helped me when I moved out here . He 's like a kindred spirit ; he 's from the heart . … Cancer is the ultimate thing you ca n't control , and I 'm a control freak .
“ I really appreciate Sean 's spirit , ” Garrett confides . “ He 's been really brave . I 'm inspired by him . His support has helped me through my own hard times . ”
Margaret Garrett performs at the benefit for Sean Barger , along with punk mainstays Shattered Faith , His Eyes Have Fangs , The Mormons and Portions , at Alex 's Bar , 2913 E. Anaheim St. , Long Beach ; Fri. , June 1 , 8 p.m. ; $ 10 . ( 562 ) 434-8292 .

Recently , the credit rating agency Fitch lowered Ontario 's credit rating outlook . Specifically , while maintaining the provincial government 's “ AA ” rating , our outlook was changed from “ stable ” to “ negative , ” meaning a downgrade in the future is more likely .
If such a downgrade is issued , higher borrowing costs could result .
This development underscores the fiscal challenges facing the new Ford government . Indeed , while Premier Doug Ford and his cabinet face many challenges , the government 's huge debt and substantial deficit are among the most daunting .
Let 's review the numbers . The province 's debt load has more than doubled in nominal terms since 2007 and will reach $ 325 billion this year . What 's more , the recently defeated Liberal government tabled a spending plan in the spring forecasting a return to operating deficits and more than $ 10 billion in new debt annually for the foreseeable future .
How should the new government address these challenges ?
First , it must recognize why Ontario is in so much fiscal trouble — unsustainable growth in government spending .
Consider that from 2003-04 to 2015-16 , program spending ( all spending other than debt interest ) grew at an average annual rate of 4.7 % — far more than needed to keep pace with inflation and population growth ( 2.8 % ) . It was also faster than the rate of nominal economic growth ( 3.2 % ) .
If the government had increased spending more prudently — with spending growth aligned with economic growth , for example — the explosion of new debt in Ontario would n't have happened . Since spending is the problem , the solution must focus on the expenditures side of the ledger . A look at Canadian history shows even substantial deficit and debt problems can be successfully addressed in this manner .
For example , when former prime minister Jean Chretien 's Liberal government faced deficits and credit downgrades in the 1990s , it conducted a comprehensive spending review and tackled the deficit aggressively by focusing on the spending side of the ledger . That government reduced spending by approximately 10 % , eliminated the deficit quickly , and repaired federal finances .
Our history shows that this type of fast-moving deficit reduction is often more successful than “ slow and steady ” approaches based on the notion of holding spending growth relatively low without ever actually making reductions and hoping for revenue to catch up .
Indeed , that 's how the Wynne government tried to address Ontario 's deficit over the past half-decade . It slowed spending growth following the 2008-09 recession in an attempt to deal with the deficit . The deficit did slowly shrink — but the province was still in the red year after year , so debt piled up .
What 's more , the government was n't willing to stick with spending restraint over the long-haul , and cranked up spending growth again in 2017-18 as an election drew near . So the problem never actually got solved .
Clearly , Ford would better serve Ontarians by studying the deficit-reduction efforts of Chretien 's government in the 1990s rather than the failed fiscal strategy of Wynne .
For Ford and his new finance minister , Victor Fedeli , the task is clear . To address Ontario 's fiscal problems , they must start with a strong understanding of the source of the province 's problems . Addressing Ontario 's spending problem , directly and quickly , is the surest way for the new government to reverse the long-running deterioration of Ontario 's finances .

DHAKA : Bangladesh police Tuesday ( Dec 12 ) were scrambling for details about New York subway bomber Akayed Ullah , but uncovered little about the extremist sympathiser who detonated a homemade pipe bomb in the underground .
The 27-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh set off a crude bomb strapped to his body in a crowded New York subway passage on Monday but the device failed to detonate properly , leaving him the only one seriously harmed .
Ullah told police investigators he wanted to avenge US airstrikes on the Islamic State group and was also inspired by Christmas terror plots in Europe .
Bangladesh police are investigating whether Ullah was radicalised in his Muslim-majority homeland , where foreigners have been among those targeted in deadly assaults claimed by the Islamic State group and Al Qaeda .
But a probe into his background has revealed little apart from the fact Ullah did not have a criminal record and was not on a watchlist of extremist suspects .
`` So far , his name is not on our wide-range list of radicalised persons or members of terror groups , both from Bangladesh and outside , '' senior counterterrorism police officer Sanwar Hossain told AFP .

`` We are trying to gather more details , '' he said .
Ullah arrived in the United States seven years ago as the member of a family already living there under what is known as `` chain immigration '' .
Bangladesh police said Ullah 's family hailed from Sandwip , an island off the coast of the southern port city of Chittagong , but his father had migrated to the capital Dhaka some 30 years ago .
Police could provide little else at this stage about Ullah 's early life in Bangladesh .
The impoverished riverine nation of 160 million has been waging a war against homegrown extremism in the wake of numerous attacks by radical groups in recent years .
In July last year militants stormed a Dhaka cafe and massacred 22 hostages , including 18 foreigners , in an assault claimed by the Islamic State group .
Bangladesh last month arrested an alleged militant from Ansarullah Bangla Team , a homegrown extremist group with links to Al-Qaeda , over the 2015 stabbing murder of a prominent US blogger in Dhaka .
The secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has vowed to root out extremism but says international radical groups do not operate inside Bangladesh .
Security forces have killed more than 70 alleged militants in a fierce crackdown since the high-profile cafe siege last year .
CHITTAGONG , Bangladesh : Thousands of Islamist hardliners marched in Bangladesh 's port city of Chittagong Friday ( Oct 6 ) calling for the government to arm Rohingya Muslim refugees fleeing a crackdown in Myanmar 's troubled Rakhine state .
More than half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since attacks by militants belonging to the Muslim minority on Myanmar police posts sparked brutal reprisals by security forces .
The refugees accuse Myanmar 's army - flanked by mobs of ethnic Rakhine - of slaughtering them and burning their villages in a campaign which the United Nations says amounts to `` ethnic cleansing '' .
Myanmar 's military have blamed the unrest on the Rohingya .
Up to 15,000 people joined the demonstrations in Bangladesh 's second largest city , police said , organised by hardline Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam to protest against the killings of the Rohingya .
`` We demanded a halt to the genocide of the Rohingya , '' Hefazat spokesman Azizul Hoque Islamabad told AFP .

`` We have also asked the government to train and arm the Rohingya so that they can liberate their homeland , '' he said .
Communities in Chittagong share close cultural , religious and linguistic ties with the Rohingya , and images on social media purportedly showing abuses against the Muslim minority in mainly Buddhist Myanmar have aroused strong sympathy in Bangladesh .
Islamist parties , including Hefazat , have staged several demonstrations over the issue in recent weeks and some firebrand leaders have called on the government to go to war with Myanmar to liberate Rakhine for the persecuted Rohingya .
Experts said Bangladeshi Islamist extremist groups could exploit the situation and forge closer ties with Rohingya militants .
The plight of the Rohingya , a Muslim minority who are reviled and denied citizenship in Myanmar , has roused anger across the Islamic world , with protests held in Pakistan , Malaysia and Indonesia .
The influx has also put Bangladesh under immense strain , with the South Asian country already hosting at least 300,000 Rohingya refugees in squalid camps along its border with Myanmar before the latest surge in arrivals .

The Lagos State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps , Hyginus Omeje , has warned articulated vehicle drivers against loading their vehicles above bridge heads and electrical installations .
Omeje gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Monday in Lagos .
He said some trucks in the city centre usually took the risk of carrying containers or loads that were higher than electrical cables , foot and flyover bridges .
The FRSC boss said such truck drivers use long poles or sticks to lift electrical cables , adding that they risked being electrocuted .
Omeje advised truck drivers to stop the dangerous habits , saying their action was capable of destroying pedestrian bridges and other installations .
He said : “ We have always cautioned those engaged in carrying too much load within streets , it can not occur on the major highways except around Badagry .
“ On the Badagry axis , we have had some cases where they will cross the Nigerian border and add excess load when they get to the trade fair area .
“ It resulted in one or two crashes in the past but ever since then , we have put eagle eyes on them , articulated vehicles , along with other security agencies .

“ When we see such kind of load , we stop them and make sure they reduce it . Some of them carry out such acts mostly at night .
“ The height of the vehicles is usually not the problem because the manufacturers built them to specifications which considered the bridges but the excess load is what causes the problems .
“ It is an offence , it is not negotiable , if we get to see such drivers carrying loads higher than bridges , we impound the vehicle . ”
The sector commander said some of the offenders use the cover of the night to overload the vehicles .
Omeje said the command was presently implementing a policy that discouraged articulated vehicles from using bridges .
According to him , such vehicles are being encouraged to use service lanes to reduce incidences of fallen containers .
Omeje added that the FRSC was collaborating with Lagos State Mobile Courts to prosecute offenders and force drivers to latch their containers .
He explained : “ Under the Lagos State Traffic Law , 2012 , the fine for unlatched containers is N250,000 .
“ We have been slamming the fine on them and it has got to the brim for them that they are now taking precaution . ”

The Government is facing increasing demands to publish a report into the running of Southern Railway amid speculation that it has highlighted an urgent need for safety improvements at one of the country 's busiest stations .
The report by Chris Gibb , a non-executive Network Rail director with 35 years ' experience in the industry , was handed to the Department for Transport last year .
Unions , passenger groups and politicians have been calling for the report to be published amid continuing problems on Southern , including the threat of further industrial action over staffing and driver-only trains .
The report is expected to highlight problems of passenger congestion at Victoria station in London , where many of Southern 's services start or finish , according to sources .
It is understood that senior managers told Mr Gibb about the issue when he visited the station as part of his inquiry .
It is believed he was told there were not enough ticket gates for passengers using some of the busiest platforms , with long queues at peak times , and travellers complaining of chaotic scenes .
It is also understood that Mr Gibb was told that platforms dedicated for Gatwick Express trains were being routinely used by passengers from other busy trains .
For tourists travelling from Gatwick Airport , one of the first sights of London is of packed platforms and a wait to get through ticket barriers , Mr Gibb was reportedly told .
Mick Cash , general secretary of the Rail , Maritime and Transport union , said : `` It is scandalous that the Gibb report remains under lock and key in a vault at the Department for Transport .
`` RMT is demanding its immediate publication as the stench of the Southern Rail fiasco hangs like a cloud over this rotten Government and reminds passengers that the alternative option of public ownership is now right up the agenda .
`` We were told that the report would be published 'after the election ' . Well , the election has been and gone and the Tories took a hammering along the length of the Southern routes as the electorate sent out the clearest possible message about their failing transport services .
`` Not only does RMT want to see the Gibb report but the union is also stepping up the campaign to reverse the attack on the guards and to end the privatised rip-off that blights Britain 's railways . ''
A spokesman for the Association of British Commuters said : `` We are convinced that the Gibb report is extremely critical of the Department for Transport 's role in a rail crisis that has always been about far more than just the strikes .
`` There can be no other explanation for withholding such a vital report for almost six months , when its contents are so clearly in the public interest . ''
KINGSTON : Usain Bolt and his former Jamaica teammates are set to learn whether their 4x100 metres relay gold medals from the 2008 Beijing Olympics will be restored , with a ruling over the Nesta Carter doping case expected to land on Thursday ( May 31 ) .
Carter retroactively tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine at Beijing and was stripped of the gold along with Bolt , Asafa Powell , Michael Frater and Dwight Thomas .

Carter appeared at the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport in November to appeal against the sanction and the tribunal 's Secretary General Matthieu Reeb said a decision was imminent .
`` I am confident that the Carter case can be finalised on or before Thursday this week , '' Reeb told the Inside the Games website .
The Jamaican team were ordered by the International Olympic Committee to return their medals in January 2017 .
Carter , the first-leg relay specialist , has been a vital member of Jamaica 's dominant squad , helping the Caribbeans win golds at the 2012 London Olympics and three successive world championships from 2011 to 2015 .

Anyone who 's ever asked their toddler where they put their shoes probably knows that they are n't exactly known for their memories . However , if you have an important occasion coming up , like a wedding or a family vacation , it 's natural to wonder if there are ways to help your toddler remember special moments . Like , is it possible to create memories that last a lifetime with your child , even when they are as young as 1- or 2-years-old ? Or are better off waiting to take a family trip when they are old enough to actually remember it ?
It turns out , there are things you can do to absolutely help boost your child 's memory , to a point . According to a study published in the journal Developmental Psychology , children suffer from a condition called childhood amnesia , or the inability to form memories as children that last until adulthood , until they reach the age of 3 . But this age might not be set in stone . As psychologist Nora Newcombe told Fatherly.com , kids are better able to remember feelings than events . So , if you want to help your toddler retain memories of a specific time or place , it might be best to remind them how it made them feel .
Other memory-boosters include repetition , so if you can repeat the experience year after year or look at pictures from your trip , it can help your toddler form childhood memories that lost well into adulthood . So with that in mind , here are a few ways to help your little one remember all the fun you 've been having :
Talk About Them As early childhood expert Jill Uhlenberg , Ph.D. explained to Parents.com , repetition is the best way to remember things as an adult , and the same is true for kids . So if you want your child to remember a special moment , the key might be to keep talking about that event often , and as they grow , to remind them about what happened .
Focus On Feelings Giphy As Nora Newcombe , a professor of Psychology at Temple University , told Fatherly.com , children store different kind of memories than adults . While adults can recall specific events — or explicit memories — kids remember how those events made them feel — or implicit memories . So , if you want your child to remember a trip , you should try focusing on how it felt , rather than what happened , to help them remember .
Take Pictures According to Parents.com , taking lots of pictures during a special event and looking at them with your child can help them recount what happened .
Repeat The Experience Giphy While it might not always be possible , the best way to boost your child 's memory of a special trip might be to repeat the experience . As psychologist Susan Newman told Yahoo Lifestyle , making a trip an annual affair can help your child form lasting memories .
Get Keepsakes Another idea Newman suggests is bringing back mementos or keepsakes from your trip or event , that your child can hold or look at to better remember what happened .
Tell Stories About It Giphy As Slate reported , young kids are way more likely to remember events that their parents continue to tell them about . Turns out , remembering a story is way easier than remembering a person , place , or thing . So if you want your child to continue to remember an event long after it happens , the key might be telling them about it in narrative form , or even better , asking them to tell you a story about it .
Make Sure They Get Enough Sleep While it 's easier said than done , especially on a vacation or trip , one study published in the Journal of Sleep Research showed that getting enough sleep can actually help both children and adults form memories .

The Yobe State Governor , Ibrahim Gaidam , has approved the suspension of the Chairman of Potiskum Local Government , Alhaji Moh 'd Musa , over alleged misappropriation of Hajj fund .
According to a statement issued by the Press Secretary in the governor 's office , Shuaibu Abdullah , the governor acted after the recommendations of an investigative committee set up by the House of Assembly .
He said , “ an investigative committee was constituted by the Assembly following a report by the Pilgrims Commission , which indicted the embattled chairman and some council officials to have misappropriated N38.9 million 2017 Hajj fare paid to the local government by 33 intending pilgrims .

“ His suspension was as a result of the report from the Pilgrims Commission , which confirmed that 33 potential pilgrims from Potiskum Local government , who paid to perform the 2017 Hajj could not do so because the fund deposited with the council was misappropriated by the chairman and other persons . ”
Others indicted by the report and the house committee included the Hajj collector for the local government and the council 's former treasurer and director of personnel management .
WASHINGTON : U.S. President Donald Trump will welcome the chief executive officers of Target Corp , Best Buy Co Inc and six other major retailers to the White House on Wednesday morning to discuss tax reform and infrastructure .
Best Buy and Target have been fighting a proposal to impose a border tax on imported goods , among sweeping changes presented by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives . Convincing Trump to oppose the measure would probably bring an end to it .
Trump plans to announce his own tax plan in the coming weeks .
The meeting will include Target 's Brian Cornell , Best Buy 's Hubert Joly , Gap Inc 's Art Peck , Autozone Inc 's William Rhodes , Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc 's Stefano Pessina , J.C. Penney Co Inc 's Marvin Ellison , Jo-Ann Stores ' Jill Soltau and Tractor Supply Co 's Gregory Sandfort .
The group will also meet on Wednesday with the heads of the two tax-writing congressional committees , Kevin Brady , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , and Senator Orrin Hatch , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .
Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan are leading the push to overhaul the tax code by cutting the corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent , imposing a 20 percent tax on imports and excluding export revenue from taxable income .
Companies that rely heavily on imports , such as retailers , automakers and refiners , say a border tax would outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax .
Trump has voiced some concern about the House tax proposal , calling it `` too complicated . '' But the White House also has said a border tax on goods from Mexico is one option under review to pay for a wall along the nation 's southern border .
The prospect of a big import tax is also pitting some of the largest U.S. companies against one another . A group of major exporters , including Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc , have formed their own coalition to support the import tax .

Activist investor Elliott Management Corp said on Monday that NXP Semiconductors NV is worth US $ 135 per share on an intrinsic standalone basis , more than the US $ 110 Qualcomm Inc has offered to buy the company .
REUTERS : Activist investor Elliott Management Corp said on Monday NXP Semiconductors NV is worth about 23 percent more than Qualcomm Inc 's US $ 38-billion offer to buy the chipmaker .
Elliott , which has a stake of about 6 percent in NXP , said NXP was worth US $ 135 per share on an intrinsic standalone basis , compared with Qualcomm 's offer of US $ 110 made in October 2016 .
NXP shares were up 0.6 percent at US $ 116 in morning trading , while Qualcomm 's shares were up about 1 percent at US $ 64.87 .
Elliott , a New York-based hedge fund , said Qualcomm 's offer had taken advantage of NXP 's depressed stock price last year and has acted as a ceiling on its valuation .
`` We believe NXP 's prospects are bright . Approximately half of NXP 's revenue is exposed to exciting growth engines of the semiconductor market – automotive and industrial , '' Elliott said in a letter to other NXP shareholders .
Qualcomm replied saying it believed the agreed-upon price of US $ 110 is full and fair , and that it remained fully committed to closing the acquisition .

`` Elliott 's value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda , '' Qualcomm said in a statement .
Elliott said it has retained UBS to conduct a financial analysis on NXP and that it would share the report with other shareholders .
NXP 's shares have been trading above Qualcomm 's offer price since Aug. 4 when Elliott indicated it was pushing for a higher price .
Besides trying to convince NXP investors of the planned acquisition , Qualcomm has also toiled to win regulatory approval and has offered certain concessions to address concerns the deal would hamper competition in the market .
Since it offered to buy NXP , Qualcomm itself has been the target of an acquisition approach from Broadcom Ltd , but it rejected the US $ 103-billion offer last month .
Broadcom had indicated it was willing to acquire Qualcomm , for US $ 70 per share , irrespective of whether it closed the NXP deal .
Acquiring NXP would make Qualcomm the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market .

U.S. stock index futures rose on Tuesday as bond yields eased , while strong earnings from industrial heavyweights Caterpillar and United Technologies helped reinforce optimism about a first-quarter earnings season now in full swing .
REUTERS : U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as strong earnings from Caterpillar , Verizon and a host of other big names boosted optimism about corporate America 's health , but the gains were curbed by rising bond yields .
The yield on the 10-year U.S Treasury notes hit 3 percent for the first time since 2014 , due to a growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as commodity prices gained .
Caterpillar , which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity jumped 4 percent , while Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines-maker United Tech rose 1.3 percent . Both companies topped quarterly profit estimates and raised their full-year earnings forecasts .
The results also run contrary to a 0.4 percent fall in the S & P industrials index this year due to fears of a tit-for-tat trade war with China .
`` Two big-cap companies , industrials and global in nature , beating estimates , and the takeaway being that fundamentals remain strong for corporate America , '' said Mark Luschini , chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia .
About 18 percent of the S & P 500 companies had reported results as of Monday , with 78 percent topping profit estimates , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .

That has pushed up analysts ' estimates for earnings growth in the quarter to nearly 20 percent , from 18.6 percent just over than a week back , making it the strongest in seven years .
One dampener was Google-parent Alphabet , which dipped 2.5 percent as investors focused on rising costs rather than the profit beat .
`` On balance , the numbers were pretty good and some of the issues related to spending are idiosyncratic to the business . I do n't think its going to indict the entire sector , '' said Luschini .
At 10:01 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 65.45 points , or 0.27 percent , at 24,514.14 , the S & P 500 was up 7.14 points , or 0.27 percent , at 2,677.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 20.42 points , or 0.29 percent , at 7,149.02 .

Coca-Cola gained 2 percent after its revenue beat estimates , helped by higher demand for Coke Zero Sugar and new flavors of Diet Coke . Verizon jumped 1.3 percent after its profit beat expectations .
3M fell 6.1 percent after it managed to only match profit estimates .
A drop in sales for the screen glass unit of telecoms parts producer Corning Inc may also add to growing market nerves about demand for high-end smartphones .
Oil rose above US $ 75 a barrel to its highest since November 2014 , supported by OPEC-led production cuts , strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran .
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.09-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.07-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq .
The S & P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows , while the Nasdaq recorded 42 new highs and 23 new lows .

WASHINGTON : The special counsel overseeing the probe into Russia 's alleged meddling in the US election is looking at whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice , the Washington Post reported Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) , citing unnamed officials .
In a pivotal shift in the investigation that has riveted Americans like no other for decades , senior intelligence officials have agreed to be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel , Robert Mueller , the Post said .
It quoted five people briefed on the requests and said those who have agreed to be interviewed are Daniel Coats , the director of national intelligence , Admiral Mike Rogers , head of the National Security Agency , and his recently departed deputy , Richard Ledgett .
The interviews could come as early as this week , the Post said .
The newspaper 's story was met with a furious reaction from Trump 's personal lawyer .

The shift toward investigating the US president began days after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director on May 9 , the Post said .
The stated focus has been Russia 's alleged efforts to tilt last November 's presidential election Trump 's way and whether the winner 's campaign was involved in any way .
Trump vehemently denies any collusion between himself or any of his associates and Russia .
Mueller , himself a widely respected former head of the FBI , has now taken up the angle of possible efforts by Trump to obstruct justice in the investigation , the Post said .
Quoting officials , the newspaper said one event of interest to Mueller is an exchange on March 22 , when Coats told associates that Trump had asked him to intervene with Comey to get him to back off the focus on Trump 's former national security advisor Mike Flynn as part of the FBI probe of the Russia affair .
A few days after the March 22 meeting , Trump spoke separately with Coats and Rogers and asked them to issue public statements to the effect that there was no evidence of coordination between his campaign and Russia . The Post said both men refused the president 's request .
Trump 's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz issued a statement saying the FBI was behind the Post story and called the leak `` outrageous , inexcusable and illegal . '' The lawyer did not deny the story , however .
Mueller briefed Senators Wednesday on his work .
`` I 'm going to acknowledge we had a meeting with the special counsel Mueller , but I 'm not going to get into the contests , '' Mark Warner , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee , told reporters later .

Publicity Secretary of the party in the state , Samuel Nwanosike , stated this , on Monday , at the official reception of defected members of the Progressives Congress ( APC ) to PDP , through the Grassroots Development Initiatives ( GDI ) , in Buguma , Asari-Toru Local Government Area of the state .
Nwanosike said Governor Wike achieved the feat through numerous ongoing and completed projects spread across the state .
His words , “ We have a leader and that is Barr . Nyesom Wike , the Governor of Rivers State . He is making us proud . He has changed the face of the Rivers people . He has managed our economy very well ; he has given us good roads .
“ Today , you can not differentiate between the riverine and the upland , because everywhere is connected by roads , credit to Nyesom Wike . And nobody can change that vision .
“ As the spokesperson of PDP , Governor Nyesom Wike has completed every arrangement to complete the internal roads for Kalabari people before he leaves office .
“ Governor Nyesom Wike had come to wipe away the tears of the Kalabaris people . He belongs to all the ethnic groups in the state ; that is why his developmental strides spread across the 23 local government areas ” , Nwanosike noted .
The PDP spokesman stressed : “ We , in PDP , are proud of the governor for proving that he is ‘ Mr . Project ' . He is a pride of Rivers people ; he is a pride of Nigeria ” .
He , however , called on Nigerians to join forces with the state governor and PDP , to sack the APC-led Federal Government in 2019 , adding that restructuring is the panacea for the nation 's crisis .
“ If anybody wants to campaign for the President of Nigeria , if you do not tell us that you will allow us manage our resources , we will not vote you . There is only one thing in 2019 presidential election , that is restructuring . Total restructuring is what we need ” .

Moi Girls High School rape case has taken a new twist with new reports emerging that the victim might have been assaulted by lesbian colleagues .
In house investigations and another one by a teachers union found glaring inconsistencies in reports about the incident wit Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers ( Kuppet ) posing queries about the version of events following interviews with the victim , fellow students and workers , concluding the probe could not place a man at the scene on the night of June 1
This report appears to corroborate an account of the school 's internal investigations that concluded the student was molested by her colleagues for resisting their sexual advances .
“ If you enter the school you have to pass two dormitories before getting to Elgon , the hostel where the girl was . Why would a rapist pass two hostels and specifically go to Elgon ? ” posed a school official who requested to remain anonymous .
The school official said security cameras positioned outside the hostel were working , contradicting initial reports that they were not operational at the time the incident happened . The footage , according to the official , did n't show any outsider entering the hostel that night .
“ When the girl woke up some minutes past 5am on Saturday , she panicked on realizing she had slept on another girl 's bed , ” recounted the school official .
The school regulations forbid students from sharing beds or sleeping away from their assigned beds . According to the source , once the girl woke up , she reported feeling pain in her genitalia . Confused , she started crying .
“ The other girls wanted to teach her a lesson for rejecting them . There is crop of lesbians in the school known to many of the students , ” said the official .
According to the Standard , sources admit that lesbianism was rife in the school , but only confined to a group of students .
According to sources in the school , some girls may have violated the affected student by inserting an object in her genitals against her will and perhaps , without her knowledge .
Both sources indicate that the girl failed to name her violators , a move they suspect was out of fear or because she does not recall their identities . Claims of lesbianism are not new in the school .
Last year , parents of a girl suspected to have set a hostel on fire claimed their daughter had been set up for rejecting sexual advances from older girls and for highlighting the prevalence of lesbianism in the school .
According to the parents , the alleged arsonist claimed that some masked girls often came to her bed at night and touched her inappropriately .
The Kuppet report notes that apart from the main entrance , there are three possible places that a stranger could use to gain access to girls ' dormitories .
“ The first entrance is through the roof which lands you on first floor of Elgon hostel where the girl was allegedly raped . The victim however resides in a cubicle on the ground floor , where the toilets are also located , ” reads Kuppet 's report .
“ This begs the question , why the rapist after landing on first floor , left 100 girls and headed down to ground floor where he met his victim , ” states the report . Second entrance The second possible entrance , the report noted , was through a lowered fence near a construction site outside the school .
The officials also questioned the three girls from cubicals E2 , E5 and E7 , who claimed to have seen the reported rapist .
They noted that two of them said they went back to bed and slept after ‘ escaping ' from the rapist “ E2 victim said she saw someone at around 2am who led her to the toilet . She said she pleaded with the intruder to let her go , and that when the rapist let her go , she silently , went back to sleep , without informing any of the five girl 's she shared the room with , ” stated Kuppet in its report .
“ E5 victim said she negotiated with the rapist , telling him that she was a Muslim , was observing the holy month of Ramadhan and was not allowed to engage in any sexual activities . She said the the rapist then let her free and just like the first victim , she did not raise alarm or tell anyone. ” The teachers , in their report , questioned how student E7 pulled out of the toilet in the furthest bathroom in the same location , taken to another bathroom closer to the entrance and raped .
“ It is not clear why the rapist would move the girl from the furthest and most convenient bathroom to one closer to the entrance , ” questioned Kuppet . The report further noted that there was no blood or liquid in either of the two toilets where the girl was reported to have been sexually assaulted .
“ The victim claimed to have laid in a pool of blood from around 3 am to the time she was found . However , there was no blood in any of the bathroom or on her clothes. ” Kuppet also questioned the time taken to report and the way an alarm was raised on the incident .
“ Opposite E2 , is an alarm which the students ring in case of an emergency . However , on the said night , the girls moved from bed to bed waking each other up , before they decided to inform the matron at 5Aam. ” According Kuppet who said they visited the school twice to interview the students and teachers , the matron said she called the boarding mistress who upon arrival , found another girl sitting on the victim 's bed .
According to Kuppet , when the student was taken to Nairobi Women 's Hospital , the first test for rape by a clinical officer tested negative . A second test by a specialist indicated that there was penetration .
“ Presented with this discrepancy , the girl 's parents were asked to pick another hospital for a tie-breaker test and they picked Kenyatta National Hospital . Results from KNH which the media never reported were negative , ” states the report . Kuppet officials urged the government to present its findings and DNA results to settle the case on Moi Girls School .
One school official told The Standard : “ There is a lot happening in this school—so much tension and antagonism . There are a group of parents and students who wanted the principal out of the school , so they escalated the saga to force her out . ”
For now , the school personnel worries that its worst days may not be behind it , citing rising student indiscipline including blatant impunity and sneaking in drugs .
“ Many of the parents in this school are rich and powerful individuals . They are extremely domineering and disrespectful to staff and their children emulate them , ” said one of the workers .
For whatever reason , the Windows world has found it virtually impossible to steal the Ultrabook crown from Apple . There have been several valiant attempts , but it 's only in these last few years that we 've seen some of those attempts bear fruit , offering worthwhile competitors to Apple 's MacBooks .
I 'm certainly not saying that Apple 's Ultrabooks are better than anything else out there , far from it . However , the fact remains that Apple 's MacBooks have managed to define the Ultrabook in the same way that its iPhone defines the smartphone .
There are a few notable challengers though , and chief among them is Dell with its brilliant XPS 13 . It 's always been a great laptop and a no-brainer for anyone wanting a Windows-based Ultrabook , but these last couple of years have seen competition really ramp up . The likes of the Lenovo Yoga 920 , HP Spectre 13 , LG Gram and even the Razer Blade have proven to be formidable opponents .
Where the XPS 13 once led the pack , it was now fighting neck-and-neck with the rest of the crowd . It 's possible for this reason that Dell decided to take things up several notches with the 2018 Dell XPS 13 .
Build and Design : 9/10
More than anything , the standout feature on the XPS 13 is its size . It 's tiny . Almost indescribably so . Yes , it has a 13-inch screen , but it could easily hide behind most 12-inch devices . Hell , I could place a 12.9-inch iPad Pro on top of it and you 'd wonder where the laptop went . The super-slim bezels are the reason this laptop is so small . I suspect that the device 's screen-to-body ratio would rival that of most smartphones .
Despite its form factor , though , the XPS 13 is noticeably thicker than similarly priced devices , including the gorgeous Lenovo Yoga 920 Vibes Edition laptop . The large “ legs ” at the bottom of the device contribute to this . While it may not look as slim as other laptops in its class , do bear in mind that the laptop is slim enough that you wo n't care .
The XPS 13 model I received for testing came in a combination of Rose Gold and Alpine White , and while I 'm definitely NOT a fan of Rose Gold , the fibreglass Alpine White interior certainly won me over . There is a more traditional black and silver option for those who prefer it .
Unlike traditional laptops , the Alpine White interior surfaces of the device are n't made from metal , plastic or carbon fibre . They are , in fact , made from titanium oxide-coated fibre-glass . This is a very unusual material to find on any laptop but is quite clearly a contributor to the laptop 's low weight ( about 1.2 kg ) .
That titanium oxide I mentioned earlier ? It 's for keeping that pristine Alpine White , well , pristine . It 's a stain resistant coating that is surprisingly effective . Dell claims that you can write on the surface with a ball-point pen and you 'd see no stain . The outer metal surface and the interior fibre-glass work together to create a laptop that is as light as it is solid . My one complaint and a very tiny one at that is that the XPS 13 fails the raise-the-display-with-one-finger test . You need two hands to open the device .
Another issue is the webcam placement . It 's still at the bottom of the display and it 's still pointed up your nose . I get that there was no other place to put it , but as you 'll see later on in the performance section , the placement causes several issues .
Keyboard , Trackpad and Touch : 8/10
The keyboard and trackpad were great , as expected . The keyboard uses chiclet-style keys with low travel . The keys are very responsive and I had no complaints in the 10 days or so that I spent with the device .
After getting used to the MacBook 's massive trackpad , any Windows laptop trackpad feels tiny , and the XPS 13 's is no exception . That being said , it 's adequate for the device , and being a Precision Trackpad , is more than up to the task . Touch input was great on the 4K display that I reviewed .
Features : 9/10
Normally with a laptop , I 'd only list off the specs here . It 's usually a boring list of hardware that only the geekier among us would be interested in . The short version is that the XPS 13 is running the very best hardware in its class —Intel Core i7-8550U , 16 GB RAM , 512 GB SSD — and as long you 're not gaming , you 'll be fine . With the 2018 model of the XPS 13 , however , things are a little more interesting .
First , there 's that fibreglass finish on the Rose Gold model . It 's an unusual finish that gives the laptop an interesting texture when using . It feels warmer and more welcoming than the plain metal if that makes sense .
Second , Dell says they 're using 'Gore Thermal Insulation ' to insulate the internals of the device . Normally , Ultrabooks end up getting so hot that they 're uncomfortable to use on my lap . On poorly designed devices , even the palm rest gets hot . With the 'Gore Thermal Insulation ' , Dell is able to insulate the base and the palm rest from much of the heat generated by the laptop 's internals , and as a result , the device is more comfortable to use for extended periods of time .
The port selection is the only place where I have some complaints . Dell , like Apple , has opted for a USB-C-only design . This is a frustrating and user-hostile decision that literally makes no sense on any laptop . Just about every device and cable in the market uses USB-A ports and I can not fathom why manufacturers insist on using only USB-C. Quite simply , my pen drives , hard drives , ethernet adapters , memory card readers and my phones can not connect to the XPS 13 without a dongle . The XPS 13 's saving grace lies in the fact that at the very least , a USB-C to USB-A dongle is included in the package .
In total , you get 3x USB-C ports , 1x 3.5 mm combo jack and 1x microSD card reader .
And that 's another thing . Why a microSD card reader ? The whole point of an SD card reader is that people with cameras can slot in their SD cards without carrying a dongle . I know of no one who would insist on having a microSD card reader over an SD card reader . If you 're not putting an SD card reader , why even bother ? It 's a very strange design decision .
Windows Hello is supported via a Hello-compatible webcam and a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button .
Display : 9/10
I love the display on the XPS 13 . It 's not as colour-accurate and precise as the MacBook Pro 13 's P3-certified panel , but it 's bright , vibrant and very sharp . Consuming content on that screen was a pleasure , and the HDR-mode ( which is n't true HDR , if you 're wondering ) , did noticeably boost image quality when viewing HDR content . As far as Windows-based laptops go , the XPS 13 's display is by far the best I 've tested .
For the more technically-minded though , I 'd like to point out that the MacBook Pro 's display is still a class apart .
My review unit came with a UHD HDR display that 's claimed to offer 400 nits of brightness and a contrast ratio of 1,500:1 .
UHD refers to a widescreen 4K resolution . This is fast becoming the norm for premium laptop displays and it ensures that content looks great on those tiny screens . HDR refers to High-Dynamic Range . Traditional displays are 8-bit displays . In total , an 8-bit display is capable of displaying 16.7 million colours . A true HDR display is a 10-bit display and is capable of displaying 1.07 billion colours . The Dell XPS 13 's display is n't a true HDR display , but then again , neither are the bulk of the HDR-rated displays on the market . This includes phones , TVs and laptops .
The Dell XPS 13 complies with Windows ' HDR specs . A Dell engineer explained to me that to be rated as HDR-ready , a laptop needs to comply with the following specs :
Processors : 7th Gen Intel Core processor ( KBL ) & beyond
Graphics card : minimum Integrated graphics card that supports PlayReady hardware digital rights management
Display technology : minimum of 300 nits + 72 percent gamut + 8-bit colors ( or 6+2 )
Resolution : FHD or higher resolution
This is interesting because these specs are pretty average . Pick up any decently-priced laptop from eBay or Amazon , and it 'd be sure to comply with these specs .
On the XPS 13 , I found that the laptop delivered a brightness of 413 nits and a contrast ratio of about 777:1 . The brightness is at least 30 percent higher than average and the contrast ratio , while very good , is nowhere near Dell 's claimed contrast ratio and still a far cry from the highest we 've ever measured ( 1,100:1 ) . The display colour gamut also measured 90 percent sRGB , which is good , but not great . For reference , a MacBook Pro 13 is rated at 100 percent DCI-P3 , which is about 140 percent sRGB . In other words , a MacBook Pro can show off a wider range of colours .
Again , the XPS 13 still has the best overall display quality that I 've seen on a Windows device so far , so do n't take that display lightly .
Performance : 9.5/10
If there 's one area where the XPS 13 well and truly shines , it has to be on the performance front . In our benchmarks , the XPS 13 routinely scored significantly higher than its rivals . Intelligently designed insulation and cooling ensure this . In several of the tests , the laptop was a full 30 percent faster than its competition .
In real-world use , this translates to a device that responds instantly . The onboard storage was a bit confusing . With a 3,000 Mbps read speed and 480 Mbps write speed , the XPS 13 's SSD is fast , but it 's not as fast as that of the competition . Still , a 480 Mbps write speed is very fast and you 'll have no complaints on the performance front .
The side-firing speakers were quite loud and I could easily watch videos without straining to hear the sounds . As mentioned earlier , do n't think about gaming on the device . It does n't have a graphics card .
Windows Hello—biometric login for Windows 10—works great most of the time . While the fingerprint sensor was always reliable , the odd placement of the webcam meant that I 'd have to keep tilting the laptop at odd angles to let it detect my face . When it worked , Face Detection was flawless and fast .
Battery Life : 8/10
Our standardised battery life test rated the XPS 13 at 4 hours and 10 minutes . This is very good by our standards and is the second-highest battery life we 've measured yet . The winner pipped the XPS 13 by 20 minutes , but that winner was an under-powered Surface Pro 5 running a lower resolution screen on last year 's best hardware .
In my daily usage , I found that the XPS 13 could easily last me a full workday ( about 8 hours ) , which involves two email accounts on sync ( via Mail ) , heavy Slack and Telegram usage ( desktop apps ) and Chrome as the primary app ( with several dozen tabs open at any given time ) . Throw in some light Photoshop and Word usage and you have a picture of my daily usage . This is certainly commendable for such a powerful device .
Verdict and Price in India
If you 're looking for the best Ultrabook in India , you only have one option , and that 's the Dell XPS 13 . This 2018 model raises the bar yet again , providing exceptional performance in a premium package that 's worth every rupee you 'll spend on it . These devices truly is a compact powerhouse .
Personally , I 'd rather opt for the slightly larger Lenovo Yoga 920 Vibes Edition laptop over the XPS 13 , but that 's only because I prefer the latter 's larger screen . However , the XPS 13 is , without question , the better laptop , and one I 'd heartily recommend to all .

CHARLOTTE , Michigan : The enraged father of three daughters who were sexually abused by Larry Nassar lunged at the former USA Gymnastics national team doctor and tried to attack him during a sentencing hearing in a Michigan courtroom on Friday .
The father , Randall Margraves , was nearly within striking distance of Nassar before officers tackled him to the floor in front of shocked spectators including his daughters . The judge later accepted Margraves ' explanation that he `` lost control '' of his emotions and said she would not punish him .
The chaotic scene began minutes after sisters Lauren and Madison Margraves had concluded tearful victim statements on the second day of a sentencing hearing in Eaton County , following similar presentations by scores of other women through previous court sessions .
Nassar has already been sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for his guilty plea in neighbouring Ingham County to molesting young women under the guise of medical treatment . He is scheduled to receive an additional sentence on Monday for his guilty plea to related charges in Eaton County .
At a news conference with his family and attorney hours after the outburst , Margraves , apologised for his behaviour , saying he was `` remorseful '' and `` embarrassed '' for losing his composure .

`` I am no hero . My daughters are heroes , and all the victims and survivors of this terrible atrocity , '' he said , adding that he became enraged when `` I had to hear what was said in those ( victim ) statements , and I had to look over at Larry Nassar shaking his head . ''
Margraves said he had never heard the explicit details of what his daughters endured at the hands of Nassar until he listened to their accounts in court .
A tall , burly man with thick grey hair , Margraves said his relationship with his daughters had long been `` strained , distant and difficult . Now I know the main reason . The reason was Larry Nassar '' .
`` Now I have to deal with the fact that I failed to protect my daughters , '' he added .
The courtroom disturbance came after Margraves , standing alongside his daughters and wife , asked if Judge Janice Cunningham , as part of sentencing , would `` grant me five minutes in a locked room '' with Nassar .
The judge replied that was not an option and rebuked Margraves for his vulgar language in calling Nassar `` a son of a bitch '' in court . Margraves then asked for one minute alone instead . The judge demurred again as some in the courtroom laughed uncomfortably .
The father then bolted towards Nassar , seated in an orange jumpsuit behind a nearby table . Margraves ' daughters ' hands flew to their mouths , and one of Nassar 's lawyers moved to shield his client .
`` WHAT IF THIS HAPPENED TO YOU ? ''
Gasps , cries and shouts filled the courtroom as Margraves was wrestled to the floor , knocking items off a desk on the way down before he was handcuffed , while Nassar was whisked to safety .
`` One minute ! '' Margraves demanded repeatedly , his head pinned down . As uniformed officers pulled him from the courtroom , he implored them , `` What if this happened to you guys ? ''
The judge then ordered a recess .
Eaton County Sheriffs restrain Randall Margraves after he lunged at Larry Nassar , during victim statements of his sentencing in the Eaton County Circuit Court in Charlotte
The attempted attack underscored the anguish Nassar 's abuse has caused his victims ' parents , some of whom were present in the doctor 's exam room even as Nassar , unbeknownst to them , was molesting their children . Several have spoken in court about the guilt they feel for exposing their children to a sexual predator .
`` I failed my own daughter , '' Lynn Erickson said tearfully in court on Friday , as her daughter Ashley , one of Nassar 's victims , wiped away tears .
Margraves ' daughters had also described the impact on their parents . At Nassar 's first sentencing hearing last month , his oldest daughter Morgan said her father `` went out driving to look for him around East Lansing '' after news of his abuse broke .
`` I 'm not exactly sure what he would have done if he saw him , '' she said . `` However , he felt he still had to protect us in the way fathers do for their daughters . ''
The county sheriff said his office would decide by next week whether to seek criminal charges against Margraves for his conduct . An online fundraising page at the website GoFundMe had collected more than US $ 18,000 for the father 's potential legal fees by early evening .
Following the recess in Friday 's proceedings , the judge declined to cite Margraves for contempt of court .
`` There is no way that this court is going to issue any type of punishment , given the circumstances of this case , '' Cunningham said . `` My heart does go out to you and your family for what has happened to you . ''
Social media users expressed near universal support for Margraves .
`` We all understand this father 's action , '' said actor and pro-wrestler Dwayne `` The Rock '' Johnson . `` Nassar 's punishment will go far beyond sentencing . Behind bars , he 'll soon know what hell means . '' Mariah McClain , who testified about how Nassar abused her , said she had to leave the courtroom when Margraves erupted .
`` It was just too much for me , '' she said .
The case against Nassar , who is also serving a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions , has sparked investigations into how U.S. Olympic officials , USA Gymnastics , the sport 's governing body , and Michigan State University , where Nassar also worked , failed to investigate complaints about him going back years .

LAS VEGAS ( AP ) — After just one game , it 's already clear this Stanley Cup Final is on thin ice . Thin , patchy , slushy , rut-riddled ice .
The Vegas Golden Knights have shocked the sporting world by playing for a championship in their inaugural season . But their incredible playoff run has taken them straight into summer in the Mojave Desert , where temperatures routinely soar past 100 degrees from May to October .
With sizzling heat outside and a frenzied sellout crowd inside , T-Mobile Arena 's ice melted into an inconsistent playing surface for the Golden Knights and the Washington Capitals in the series opener .
Despite constant sprucing from attendants during timeouts , both teams chased the puck through dozens of weird bounces and unpredictable slides while Vegas rallied for a 6-4 victory .
“ It was pretty bad , ” Washington forward Jay Beagle said . “ It 's so hot outside , so it 's not like it 's a surprise . ”
And it 's about to get worse : The mercury on the Strip could hit triple digits Wednesday for Game 2 , when the league is likely to see its hottest outdoor temperature ever recorded at a Final game .
But before any Canadians develop heatstroke at the prospect of their national game being played in a Nevada swimming pool , players on both teams were eager to make it clear the Vegas ice is absolutely playable .
“ It 's the same for both teams , which is why it does n't matter , ” Vegas forward James Neal said . “ It 's still the same game for everybody . Of course , everybody would like to play on perfect ice , but that does n't happen at this time of year . ”
Middling ice quality can be a fact of life year-round in NHL rinks , particularly for the Sun Belt teams from Anaheim to Miami , yet their players still thrive . It 's common to see ice deterioration in rinks at various latitudes when temperatures rise while the NHL playoffs roll through spring .
The Capitals are well aware they wo n't skate onto a pristine Nordic pond when they return to Capital One Arena for Game 3 on Saturday — not with 85-degree temperatures and 70-percent humidity in the Washington forecast .
“ It 's probably the time of the year where it 's pretty hard to keep the ice fresh , ” Washington forward Evgeny Kuznetsov said . “ But both teams play on the same ice . ”
Both coaches used the Vegas ice quality to emphasize points in their game plan that would probably be important on any surface . Washington 's Barry Trotz and Vegas ' Gerard Gallant want a north-south approach with crisp passes , minimal puck-handling and no turnovers .
It 's all easier said than done when the puck refuses to behave .
“ The pucks were bouncing pretty good , ” Trotz said . “ Unfortunately , the ice was n't great . There was a lot of chaos . ”
Dan Craig , the NHL official responsible for masterminding and maintaining the temporary ice sheets at outdoor games across the continent , has been working on the Vegas ice with the in-house crew . The sheet only went down one day before the series opener because T-Mobile had a Pink concert booked Saturday night — again , something that happens in playoff rinks all the time .
Gallant hopes the ice will be more consistent after two more days to set up . Most of the Capitals reported better conditions during practice at T-Mobile on Tuesday — although the arena also was n't filled with more than 18,575 screaming , sweating people .
“ I do n't know if it was the empty building or — just like everything — it needs to cure a bit , but I thought it was really good ( at practice ) , ” Trotz said . “ So hopefully , that will help both teams . ”

SINGAPORE : Resources will be expanded to support caregivers , as Singapore hurtles towards an ageing population , said Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor on Saturday ( Feb 3 ) .
These include increasing the capacity of day care and home care spaces from 5,000 and 8,000 , to 6,200 and 10,000 in 2020 .
This would ease the workload of caregivers , from a few hours up to a month – especially if they have career commitments .
`` For those who care for their loved ones at home , at times you need to take a break and you need to access respite care services . These services are available at selected day care centres and nursing homes and to date , over 1,600 people have tapped on them , ” said Dr Khor .
She added that so far , more than 1,200 seniors have been supported through these arrangements and usage of these respite services has increased by at least 50 per cent between 2015 and 2017 .
Apart from respite care services , the Agency for Integrated Care ( AIC ) and the National Council for Social Service ( NCSS ) have developed caregiver support groups to allow caregivers to share their experiences with each other .

Dr Khor was speaking at the inaugural Caregiver Symposium at the Lifelong Learning Institute . Organised by the AIC and NCSS to drive home the message of the importance of psychological wellness for caregivers , the symposium was attended by about 800 caregivers and professionals .
CAREGIVER TRAINING
AIC and NCSS said in a press release that those who urgently need to hire foreign domestic workers ( FDWs ) with caregiving skills now have more than 40 employment agencies to choose from , up from eight in 2016 .
These agencies send their FDWs for eldercare training courses under the Eldercarer FDW Scheme where they undergo comprehensive lessons .
Centre for Seniors senior trainer Lo Chue Har said the training covers care for recipients who are still mobile as well as those who are bed-bound .
“ These could include topics such as developing conversational skills and observational skills . We teach them to pick up warning signs for emergencies , some hands-on practical skills like transferring , feeding , even to tube-feeding , ” she said .
There are more than 240 caregiver training courses available here and caregivers can tap on the Caregivers Training Grant to offset costs .
About 8,000 caregivers , both FDWs and family members sign up for it annually .
But Ms Lo told Channel NewsAsia that while more caregivers are seeking help , some families still find it hard to accept that their loved ones may require assistance in the future .
“ Because of this , they do n't find it necessary to undergo training . ”
OVERCOMING FRUSTRATIONS
Since his elder brother Tan Tiaw Keng was diagnosed with schizophrenia more than 30 years ago , 55-year-old Elvin Tan became his main caregiver .
While other siblings do help out , dealing with mental illness is n't easy , and Mr Tan often doubted his ability to offer support , he said .
Acknowledging that caregivers do need to seek help , Mr Tan shares the responsibility of caregiving with his sisters . He also signed up for training to understand how to manage his brother 's condition better . ( Photo : Deborah Wong )
Some days , the elder Mr Tan would also wake him up in the middle of the night complaining of voices in his head .
`` I tried to do my best , but no matter what I do , I feel that it 's not enough to meet his needs . No matter how I try to please him , I find that he 's not responding . At times I feel very frustrated when he does n't want to listen . ''
When things get too overwhelming , he would snap in frustration .
Recognising the need to seek help , Mr Tan enrolled for a home-based caregiver course , where he got to know his brother 's condition better .
`` I learnt about what he needed and how we should help him . I also picked up skills like how to make him comfortable , ” he said .
A medical social worker at the Institute of Mental Health also referred the elder Mr Tan to All Saints Home day care centre in Tampines where he gets to interact and take part in community activities along with other beneficiaries .
This has somewhat eased Mr Tan 's responsibilities and he now gets to focus on his work without worrying about his brother .
He acknowledged that many caregivers eventually neglect their mental health in the process of caregiving .
“ Sometimes you do feel tired , anxious , helpless and angry . This is a mix of feelings that people like us encounter .
“ But as a caregiver , if you 're not going to resolve all these internally , how can you provide good support to your loved ones ?
“ Now I also understand how to manage my frustrations , because caregiving is about giving care recipients comfort , and meeting their needs , not our expectations , ” he said .
The concept of being `` fit but fat '' is a myth , researchers have said .
The comments come after a new study found that even if people have healthy blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol levels , being overweight or obese still carries a higher risk of coronary heart disease , experts found .
Researchers , led by experts at Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge , examined data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study of half a million people .
Over more than 12 years of follow up , 7,637 participants across eight European countries suffered coronary heart disease incidents including heart attacks .
The researchers examined participants ' body mass index ( BMI ) and whether they were metabolically `` healthy '' or `` unhealthy '' - people were classed as unhealthy if they had three or more of a number of metabolic markers , including ; high blood pressure , high blood sugar , low levels of HDL cholesterol or an `` elevated '' waist circumference .
After adjusting for a number of factors , the researchers found that compared to the healthy normal weight group , those classed as unhealthy had more than double the risk of coronary heart disease whether they were normal weight , overweight or obese .
And even overweight and obese people who were deemed `` healthy '' by their metabolic markers carried a higher risk .
When compared to those who are of a healthy weight , being classed as healthy but overweight carries a 26 % increased risk of coronary heart disease and being obese carries a 28 % increased risk , according to the new study published in European Heart Journal .
Lead author Dr Camille Lassale said : `` Our findings suggest that if a patient is overweight or obese , all efforts should be made to help them get back to a healthy weight , regardless of other factors .
`` Even if their blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol appear within the normal range , excess weight is still a risk factor .
`` Overall , our findings challenge the concept of the 'healthy obese ' . The research shows that those overweight individuals who appear to be otherwise healthy are still at increased risk of heart disease . ''
Dr Ioanna Tzoulaki , from Imperial 's School of Public Health , added : `` I think there is no longer this concept of healthy obese .
`` If anything , our study shows that people with excess weight who might be classed as 'healthy ' have n't yet developed an unhealthy metabolic profile . That comes later in the timeline , then they have an event , such as a heart attack . ''
Commenting on the study Professor Metin Avkiran , associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation which part-funded the research , said : `` Coronary heart disease - the cause of heart attacks and angina - is the UK 's single biggest killer . But there are steps you can take to lower your risk .
`` The take-home message here is that maintaining a healthy body weight is a key step towards maintaining a healthy heart . ''
Coronary heart disease occurs when the coronary arteries become narrowed by a gradual build-up of fatty material .
The main symptoms of coronary heart disease include angina , heart attacks and heart failure .
Last week , local research house , Ratepop , issued a media release claiming to have conducted the country 's “ first social media technology-driven political sentiment ” survey .
In it , a number of claims are made about support for the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) by party faithfuls .
Some of the results include : that 59.2 % of ANC supporters should vote “ as they see fit ” and not tow the party line in the Motion of No Confidence in President Jacob Zuma ( which was held ) on August 8 , 2017 ; and should President Zuma remain at the helm until 2019 , ANC support in the general elections would suffer .
Other results of the survey include :
Current deputy president Cyril Ramphosa is most likely to succeed President Zuma after the 2019 elections with 49.5 % support , compared to just 17.9 % for his closest rival , Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma ;
Issues such as unemployment , housing , service delivery , Black economic empowerment , crime and corruption remain the most pertinent ills that would motivate ANC partisans vote choice in the 2019 polls .
Details about the survey
Many questions have since been raised about the survey 's results , notably the methodology adopted by Ratepop .
In his communications with SABC Digital News Head , Izak Minnaar , company CEO Socratis Avgitidis confidently defended his organisation 's first-of-its-kind survey .
“ We are the first company to use a Facebook messenger bot to conduct extensive political polling research . Voters were randomly sent SMS messages asking them to participate in a political survey without reward . More than 6 000 voters across the spectrum of South African political affiliation agreed to participate and the results have been astonishing , ” Ratepop CEO , Socratis Avgitidis affirmed .
Avgitidis further asserted that the views of the approximately 2000 “ randomly selected ANC voters ” or “ members of the electorate who voted for the ANC in the 2016 municipal elections ” were solicited , lending more credibility to the survey .
A case of flawed sampling
Despite the reassurances from Avgitidis , several questions have since been raised about the survey 's sampling methods .
Firstly , results were obtained using Facebook messenger through handheld mobile phones , implying that respondents needed to have web-enabled Smart Phones , in addition to the requisite technological access and technological literacy .
More worrying is , of the 2000 respondents surveyed , 704 or 35.5 % were sourced from the highly-urbanised Gauteng .
In a 2013 Ipsos survey , ANC partisans were found to be concentrated in KwaZulu-Natal ( 22 % ) , Gauteng ( 19 % ) , Eastern Cape ( 16 % ) and Limpopo ( 13 % ) .
These figures immediately set alarm bells ringing : the provincial weightages are flawed from the onset . In the Ratepop methodology , one sees Gauteng is over-represented ( 35 % compared to 19 % ) ; and regions such as KwaZulu-Natal , Limpopo and the Eastern Cape are substantially under-represented .
In KwaZulu-Natal for example , Ratepop views from respondents here were just 18.5 % whereas ANC support – according to Ipsos – is high as 22 % .
The ANC 's own organisational report prepared for the 2012 National Conference corroborates this . KwaZulu-Natal had the biggest membership back then .
Additionally , in both Limpopo and the Eastern Cape ANC partisans amount to 13 % and 16 % respectively . Yet , Ratepop used just 9.7 % respondents in Limpopo and a meagre 5.1 % in the Eastern Cape .
A third concern of the Ratepop survey is that 44.7 % of respondents were sourced from a “ big city ” , 36.6 % from a “ small town ” and 18.5 % from “ rural ” South Africa .
The 2013 Iposos voter support survey paints an altogether different picture : the ANC 's support base was mainly rural ( 48 % ) with the party enjoying just 37 % support in the bigger cities and metros .
Noting that the use of Facebook was “ interesting ” for this survey , Dr Collette Schulz-Herzenberg jotted down more methodological concerns .
“ My major concern unsurprisingly relates to the sampling . As Ratepop admits , the sampling is not remotely representative . According to their demographics , most of the respondents are based in Gauteng ( urban ) , older voters and mostly male . Their respondents show no real resemblance to the wider South African population . How then can we even begin to suppose that these responses reflect anything more than the significant handful of people that self-reported ?
Secondly , surely sampling error or margins of error assumes a random , representative sample of the full population in which all respondents have an equal chance of being selected . Only once this prerequisite is met can we talk about sampling error as based on sample size . Thus , I am not sure how Ratepop can claim that their margin of error is so low ( despite a high number of respondents of 6000 ) , because the sample is non-representative . I may be wrong because I am not a statistician but this is my understanding of how margins of error work .
Third , the people who are willing to take the time to participate in this type of survey will most likely be voters who are already engaged and interested in politics . Already , this narrows the group down dramatically since we know that this represents a very small proportion of the South African electorate . This group may have very different attitudes and sentiments about the ANC compared to the vast majority of core ANC supporters who may be less cognitively engaged on political issues , ” Schulz-Herzenberg explained .
Surveys are just that
Despite some errors in sampling and how respondents were selected by Ratepop , credit must be given to the organisation for embarking on such an ambitious exercise .
There remains a dire shortage of such surveys using sentiment analyses , especially ones employing the wide-reaching capabilities of social media and social networking sites .
One has to remember though that surveys are by no means meant to replace rigorous scientific inquiry ; and thus should be treated as random sampling efforts to understand prevailing sentiment .

It 's safe to say that the entire world knows how important fitness is to Khloé Kardashian , creator of Revenge Body . While she and her sisters make healthy living look easy , it 's always good to remember that the KarJenner sisters are under extreme pressure to look a certain way , lest anyone point out a misplaced hair or five extra pounds around their waist . Because the world can be a strange place , the sister can also look `` too good , '' which is why it was n't surprising that Khloé Kardashian `` admitted '' that a bikini picture was `` deceiving '' on Twitter the other day .
Instead of being able to enjoy a cute video her sister posted , Kardashian had to assure fans that the post-baby body in the video was nowhere near her goal . And for what seemed like the first time ever , the majority of responses to her tweet were all positive and encouraging . But she should n't have had to send the tweet in the first place .
Here 's what happened : Over the weekend , Kendall Jenner posted an Instagram Story of her and Khloé lounging by a pool . From her own perch on a lounge chair , she filmed her sister laying down looking at her phone , looking pretty comfortable in her bikini . Because the focus on Kardashian largely centers around what her body looks like , the new mom took to Twitter to `` explain '' that her body looked a certain way in the video .
She assured people that it was all due to Jenner 's photography skills that she looked `` good , '' tweeting :
And I 'm just seeing that Kendall posted a video of me in a bikini… Thank God she knows her angles LOL cuz I do not look like I did in that video LOL laying down is a game changer . I had an hour to hang with Kenny while True was napping .
There 's a lot going on in that tweet to her followers and it 's all a little troubling . To start , our society puts a lot of pressure on women to have a certain body type , especially new moms . It comes at women both ways . Either they should `` bounce back '' after giving birth or `` learn to love '' their new body . Those sentiments might be well intentioned , but they 're also just ways to police how a woman looks and feels about her bod . There 's no winning this postpartum body game .
Kardashian has been more than open about getting back to the gym as soon as she could after True 's birth . Even when she was still pregnant , she talked about missing her workouts . The pressure is real for `` regular '' moms , so the pressure for someone with Kardashian 's celeb status must be excruciating . Khloé is obviously feeling like all eyes on her , her body , and her parenting philosophy , too .
Her tweet was all about preempting that hate . From people who might scold her for caring `` too much '' about her body or spending `` too much '' time on self care , which is another way our society burdens new moms . Not only did Kardashian have to make sure people knew that she was n't spending every day with her trainer , which by the way , is totally her right , she even had to make an excuse for spending alone time with her sister . Because you just know someone would have berated her on social media for not being with her kid at all times , like they did to Kim and Kanye for going out on a date night . There 's really no winning for Kardashian , or any new mom .
For Once , Social Media Was A Safe Space
Still , some people found a way to get a dig or two in . One person wrote that she should n't `` hide '' the fact that she has a nanny and she that she should be proud of being a better mom than `` the other two , '' meaning her sisters . Another lauded her for looking good in a bikini , despite being the `` fat sister . '' Sheesh , right ?
In any case , Kardashian was smart to get out ahead of the haters . And also show her cards a bit with fans . Feeling self conscious about your body and for being away from your kid — if only for an hour — is totally normal . Moms , even celeb moms , have so much pressure coming at them for so many things . Khloé 's tweet is a good reminder that a simple afternoon in the sun does n't have to be so loaded .
BAGHDAD : At least 10 people were killed and 35 wounded by a car bomb in a busy square in Baghdad 's sprawling Sadr City district on Monday , police and medical sources said .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Islamic State regularly targets civilian areas in the heavily fortified capital , even after losing most of the northern and western territory it seized in 2014 .
Three bombs killed 29 people across the capital on Saturday , and an attack near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday left seven policemen dead .
U.S.-backed Iraqi forces are currently fighting to push Islamic State from the northern city of Mosul , the militants ' last major stronghold in the country , but are facing fierce resistance .
The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for Islamic State 's self-styled caliphate , but the militants would still be capable of fighting a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq , and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West .
Since the offensive began on Oct. 17 , elite forces have retaken a quarter of the city in the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein . Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the group would be driven out of the country by April .

Patrice Nganang , a Cameroonian professor and author was last week arrested by the police as he was due to fly out of the country to Zimbabwe , where his family resides .
The cause of his arrest has been pinned on his critical views of president Paul Biya 's handling of the ‘ Anglophone crisis ' in the northwest and southwest regions of Cameroon .
His wife and lawyer averred that he was being held over an article he authored and which was published in the French magazine , Jeune Afrique .
His lawyer Emmanuel Simh said last Friday : “ He is accused of insulting the president of the republic , and after the hearings we will be able to give further information . ”
But the information minister , Issa Bakary Tchiroma is also reported as saying Nganang 's arrest was over a Facebook post threatening the president .
His arrest “ arose following a promise of death on the person of the Head of State , made by the person concerned through a message posted on his Facebook page , December 3 , 2017 at 19 hours 27 minutes ” , AFP quoted Mr. Tchiroma as saying .

What has become known as the ‘ Anglophone Crisis ' in Cameroon is at the stage of an armed confrontation between secessionists and the army . President Paul Biya two weeks ago declared war on the activities of the secessionists .
The declaration followed attacks on members of the security forces , which incidents claimed six lives – four soldiers and two policemen weeks ago . It brought the total number of casualties to 10 after four others were killed earlier .
The separatists are pushing for an independent country that seeks to breakaway with the two predominantly Anglophone regions .
The Cameroonian government has been slammed in the recent past by rights organizations like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch for trampling on the rights of the media and political actors . Yaounde is accused of torturing people being held and unnecessarily delaying trials which do not follow the due course of the law .
It is never easy to join a Housewives cast and Teddi Jo Mellancamp is living proof of that . Season 8 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills was rife with drama and she somehow always managed to end up right in the eye of the storm . So now that the reunion is upon us , there 's just one huge question that remains : will Teddi Jo Mellencamp return for RHOBH Season 9 ? It was quite the learning experience for her .
Teddi , mom of 5-year-old Slate and 3-year-old Cruz , is the daughter of rock and roll star John Cougar Mellencamp , so while she might be used to being famous , it did n't seem like she was ready for the glitz and glam of Beverly Hills . Or at least the drama , especially since she did n't know any of the women before joining the cast , as she told Romper during a phone interview just days before the Season 8 reunion . In fact , her only connection was Dorit Kemsley , with whom she shares a mutual friend . But now that she 's had her Bravo debut , is Teddi up for another season or what ?
Sadly , that information is still top secret for now . However , Teddi did open up about her experience on the show and gave some hope that she may be interested in coming back for more .
`` I ca n't really talk about [ coming back ] yet , '' she tells Romper , adding :
All I can say is that I do n't have any regrets from this season . Anytime I felt passionate about something , I spoke up . Anytime I felt hurt , I was honest and showed my true emotions . I think the biggest reason I would have had regrets was if I was n't myself . I could n't be myself , good or bad .
It sounds like there 's more than a shred of hope for Teddi 's RHOBH future , because despite all appearances , she did have fun . `` All in all , it was a good experience whether I was crying or laughing , '' she added . `` I made some real friendships from it and I think as long you are always authentically who you are , then you 're going to form relationships with the people who are most like you . '' I do n't know about you , but it sounds like a Season 9 contract might be in the stars . ( * Fingers crossed ! * )
Not that she is n't busy with other things , of course . But finding balance in her life , and helping other women find it , too , is literally what she does for a living . If Teddi seemed like she did n't have time for RHOBH drama , it 's probably because she actually did n't have the time when she had her family and job to think about , too .
Teddi 's coaching business , LA Workout Junkie , boasts over 350 clients , along with 12 other coaches who have all been through her program themselves . Her clients set health and fitness goals , and then she has them send daily photos of their meals and workouts . As a coach , she cheers them on or talks them through the rough patches , as required . But , it 's not just about weight loss . Teddi explains :
The biggest thing for me is the shift ... on women 's lives when they 're feeling their best ? It 's so huge . You feel empowered to tell your boss you 're ready for that promotion . You feel empowered to have a conversation with your husband about the balance you need in your life . You start taking charge of your life , instead of feeling like you 're going through the motions .
Juggling her business , family , and the show definitely wo n't be a problem if she does decide to come back for Season 9 , though she admits to feeling a like she 's missing out sometimes . `` I have those moments of mom guilt [ doing so many things ] , '' Teddi says . `` But , I tell myself , because of what I 'm doing for my job and for myself , it makes me such a better mother . If I did n't focus on me or my job a little bit , I might not have as much patience as much love , as much excitement , as I feel with my kids that I do now . ''
The good news is that her family is totally supportive of her role on TV . While she has n't let her daughter watch the show , Slate heard through the pre-school grapevine that her mom was on the tube .
Teddi makes a point of trying to be honest with both of her kids about what 's going on , explaining that `` mommy films with some friends and some days are good and some days are bad . '' Like only a 5-year-old can , Slate can sense what 's up , depending on her mom 's mood in the morning . `` She 'll be like , 'Did you get your feelings hurt yesterday ? ' I 'm like , 'No , I was OK. ' We have an open dialogue about it , '' she states . `` Cruz can care less . I 'm not a Power Ranger , so he 's like , ' I 'm out , mom . ' ''
So maybe her kids and husband , Edwin Arroyave , will help her make a decision about whether or not to come back for another season . In the meantime , she 's working on `` amping up '' her business , training for a marathon , and spending time on family vacations in the coming months . Hopefully , the downtime will bring her back to Bravo next year . Because The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills could use a little more straight talk from Teddi .

SINGAPORE : A 29-year-old Bangladesh national was on Thursday ( May 31 ) sentenced to six months imprisonment for molesting a maid from Indonesia .
Mia Momen , who was then a cleaner with Sembawang Town Council , noticed the 30-year-old victim walking past him , and took a liking to her , the court heard .

The victim can not be named due to a gag order .
Mia requested that the victim , who worked in the vicinity , be his girlfriend . However she rejected his advances as she was married .
Still , the accused continued to harbour hopes of entering into a relationship with the victim , the court heard .
On Oct 28 last year , at about 10.50am , the victim was returning home from the market when she ran into Mia . Mia followed her into the lift and touched her hair , after pressing the buttons for several floors .

The victim asked Mia politely not to touch her hair . Mia then went behind the victim and put his hands on her chest . The victim was unable to push him away as she was carrying groceries in both hands , the court heard .
The victim decided to squat down to evade Mia 's touch .
“ The victim was shocked and outraged by the accused 's act and reported the incident to her employer who advised her to lodge a police report , ” according to court documents .
Mia was also charged with molesting the same victim a second time , about a month later . This was taken into consideration in his sentencing .
For molest , he could have been jailed for up to two years , fined , received strokes of the cane , or faced any combination of such punishments .
None of the site 's historic buildings would be altered or used in the proposed project , Cannon said during the meeting . He noted that the site , which has been idle `` for a long time , '' has been used for filming . Construction would take 16 to 18 months and would include up to four above-ground storage tanks . Cannon did not elaborate on the use for the tanks .
MAZAR-I-SHARIF , Afghanistan : At least one person was killed and nine were wounded in the Afghan province of Faryab on Wednesday during a protest that underlined the tension between powerful regional leaders and President Ashraf Ghani ahead of elections due in October .
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Maiman , the capital of the northern province of Faryab , to demand the release of a prominent militia commander close to General Abdul Rashid Dostum , the ethnic Uzbek vice president who is in exile in Turkey .

The commander , area police chief Nizamuddin Qaisari , was arrested after a violent dispute during a meeting with leaders of government security forces on Monday , drawing angry protests from Dostum 's supporters .
The dispute has highlighted fragile security in Faryab , where Islamic State fighters have gained a foothold , battling militia commanders loosely affiliated with the government .
Dostum , in exile in Turkey after accusations that he ordered a political opponent to be tortured and sexually assaulted , issued a statement calling for the release of Qaisari and warning that the province , on the border with Turkmenistan , could collapse in chaos .
The protest descended into violence when protesters tried to force their way into governor 's compound and security forces fired in the air to stop them , said Karim Yourish , spokesman for the provincial police .

But the head of a provincial council , Mohammad Tahir Rahmani , said at least one person was killed and eight wounded in the firing , which then prompting the crowd to break into the compound .
`` We were trying to control the protesters and have a peaceful protest , but unfortunately it turned violent after security forces opened fire , '' Rahmani said , adding that one member of the provincial council was among the injured .
The trouble underlines the important role that Dostum plays in politics despite the international outrage that prompted his departure from Afghanistan last year .
Since his exile , there have been regular reports that he will return to Afghanistan , where he commands loyalty among ethnic Uzbeks who make up a significant minority in the north of the country .
With parliamentary elections due in October and presidential elections due early next year , there has been growing tension between powerful regional leaders , like Dostum , and Ghani 's Western-backed government in Kabul .
This week , Atta Mohammad Noor , the former governor of Balkh province , who stepped down in March after a months-long standoff with the central government , announced a new opposition movement called the Grand National Coalition of Afghanistan .
Noor , a leader of a party supported mostly by ethnic Tajiks , is associated with both Dostum and Mohammad Mohaqiq , a leader of the Hazara minority . He has insisted that the coalition be involved in overseeing the elections .
The political tension is a distraction for the central government as it battles the Taliban insurgency and a growing threat from Islamic State .

Carter appeared at the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport in November to appeal against the sanction and the tribunal 's Secretary General Matthieu Reeb said a decision was imminent .
`` I am confident that the Carter case can be finalised on or before Thursday this week , '' Reeb told the Inside the Games website .
The Jamaican team were ordered by the International Olympic Committee to return their medals in January 2017 .
Carter , the first-leg relay specialist , has been a vital member of Jamaica 's dominant squad , helping the Caribbeans win golds at the 2012 London Olympics and three successive world championships from 2011 to 2015 .

PARIS : Local authorities in France confirmed on Monday an outbreak of severe bird flu in the Deux-Sevres administrative department in the west of the country , an area previously unaffected by a recent spate of bird flu cases .
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of H5N8 avian influenza among backyard birds and at a poultry farm in two rural districts near the western town of Niort , the Deux-Sevres prefecture said in a statement .
The H5N8 strain of the disease is highly contagious among birds and has spread in a number of European countries since late last year . It is not known to be contagious for humans .
France has already confirmed more than 80 cases of H5N8 bird flu among domestic poultry , but these have been in southwestern areas far from the latest outbreaks .
The country , which is has the largest poultry flock in the European Union , was already affected by a severe bird flu episode a year ago in the southwest that led the authorities to suspend duck and goose breeding in the region known for production of foie gras liver pate .
Different strains of bird flu have also spread in Asia in recent weeks , leading to the slaughtering of millions of birds in South Korea and Japan and several human infections in China .

Tomorrow marks the Midwest premiere of Project Eden : Vol . 1 , a sci-fi thriller filmed in Minnesota and New Zealand . With the help of the Twin Cities Film Fest , the flick will be screening at Heights Theater .
The story follows a young woman who is grieving for her son , who is in a catatonic state . She soon finds herself on the run and in great danger after an ex-military officer reveals that there 's more to her son 's mystery state than mere medical anomaly .
While it 's a little hard to determine the Minnesota settings in the trailer ( is that a local park forest ? Is that alleyway in the Twin Cities ? ) , it is easy to spot the local actors . Peter Christian Hansen , who has popped up on local stages including the Guthrie and the Jungle Theaters , plays the ex-military man .
Other local actors who are part of the project include Guthrie vet Charles Hubbell , Bruce Bohne ( Dawn of the Dead , Man of Steel ) , and Bill McCallum , who is currently onstage at the Guthrie in The Royal Family .
Since the movie includes `` Vol . 1 '' in the title , this is presumably intended to be a series . There 's no word yet on whether the crew will be returning to our fair state to film a sequel , though our filmmakers tax incentive is surely attractive .
The film screens this Wednesday , February 15 at 7:30 p.m. at Heights Theater ( 3951 Central Ave. NE , Minneapolis ) . Tickets are $ 10 presale , $ 12 at the door . Purchase them here .
SACRAMENTO , Calif. ( AP )  Smoking and vaping will still be allowed at California state parks and beaches , despite lawmakers ' attempts to ban it .
Gov . Jerry Brown vetoed two bills Friday that would have banned lighting up in a park or at the beach . In a veto message , he writes , `` if people ca n't smoke even on a deserted beach , where can they ? There must be some limit to the coercive power of government . ''
One bill would 've imposed a $ 100 fine for people caught smoking tobacco , marijuana , or even electronic cigarettes .
Supporters hoped to mitigate the effects of nicotine and secondhand smoke while preventing litter from discarded cigarette butts . Brown has vetoed a similar bill before .

Last year , lawmakers raised the smoking age to 21 and voters approved a $ 2-per-pack increase in tobacco taxes .
A gunman opened fire on Wednesday on Republican U.S. lawmakers practicing near Washington for a charity baseball game , wounding senior Republican leader Steve Scalise and several others before being fatally shot by police .
ALEXANDRIA , Va. : A gunman opened fire on Wednesday on Republican U.S. lawmakers practicing near Washington for a charity baseball game , wounding senior Republican leader Steve Scalise and several others before being fatally shot by police .
The shooter fired repeatedly with a rifle at the baseball field in Alexandria , Virginia , before being wounded in a gunfight with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene , lawmakers said .
Scalise , No . 3 in the House of Representatives Republican leadership , was shot in the hip . He was tended to by fellow lawmakers including Brad Wenstrup , an Ohio congressman who is a physician , before being transported to a hospital .
Also wounded were one current congressional staffer and one former staffer . Two Capitol Hill police officers were hospitalized after the incident but it was not clear if both were wounded by gunfire .
The gunman , identified by a senior U.S. official as James Hodgkinson from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville , Illinois , died of his injuries . Media reports said Hodgkinson , 66 , owned a home inspection business .

His social media presence indicated he was strongly opposed to Republicans , including President Donald Trump . Police and the FBI said it was too early to determine a motive in the shooting or whether the attack was an attempted political assassination .
Trump announced the gunman 's death and called Scalise , a 51-year-old Louisiana congressman , a good friend . Speaking at the White House , Trump said Scalise was `` badly injured '' but in stable condition and would recover .
`` He 's a patriot and he 's a fighter . He will recover from this assault , '' Trump said .
Trump , who has been in office since January , also called for unity at a time of sharp political divides in America , saying , `` We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good . ''
Hodgkinson had raged against Trump on social media and was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including `` The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans , '' `` Terminate The Republican Party , '' and `` Donald Trump is not my President , '' a search of what appeared to be his profile showed .
Some 25 to 30 Republican members of the House and Senate had gathered for an early morning practice a day before the annual charity congressional baseball game pitting Republicans against Democrats , said Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama . The game is scheduled to be played at Nationals Park , home of the Washington Nationals Major League baseball team .
Two lawmakers who were at the scene , Representatives Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan , indicated there might have been a political motive in the attack .
Duncan said that as he left the field the man who would later open fire approached him in the parking lot . `` He asked me who was practicing this morning , Republicans or Democrats , and I said . 'That 's the Republicans practicing , '' Duncan told reporters .
DeSantis gave a similar account .
Brooks said the shooter said nothing during the rampage .
The shooting took place at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in the Del Ray neighbourhood of Alexandria , which is across the Potomac River from Washington .
'HEROISM ' OF POLICE
Brooks told CNN that during batting practice he heard a `` bam '' and then a quick succession of shots and saw the gunman shooting through the holes in a chain link fence .
When Scalise was shot he went down on the infield between first and second base , then dragged himself into the grassy outfield as the incident unfolded , leaving a trail of blood , Brooks said .
Two Capitol police officers who were at the scene to provide security for the lawmakers engaged the gunman with pistols , Brooks said , adding both the officers were wounded .
`` But for the Capitol police and the heroism they showed , it could very well have been a large-scale massacre . All we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle . Those are n't good odds , '' Brooks said .
Brooks estimated that there were 50 to 100 shots fired .
The shooting was certain to raise again the contentious issue of gun violence in the United States .
At a news conference near the scene of the shooting , Virginia 's Democratic governor , Terry McAuliffe , urged gun control measures . `` This is not what today is about , but there are too many guns on the street , '' McAuliffe said , citing a statistic that 93 Americans are killed with guns daily .
Scalise has been a strong opponent of gun control measures and has earned an `` A+ '' rating from the National Rifle Association - the influential lobby for expanding gun ownership rights . He has co-sponsored legislation to weaken gun control laws in the District of Columbia .
Wednesday 's incident was the first shooting of a member of the U.S. Congress since January 2011 , when Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt at a gathering of her constituents in Tucson , Arizona .
She survived , but six people were killed . Giffords resigned from Congress and became an activist for gun restrictions .

A Hong Kong-based activist investor in Toshiba Corp has told the embattled conglomerate that the US $ 18 billion sale of its chip unit to a Bain Capital-led group is no longer necessary after its recent capital injection , according to a letter seen by Reuters .
TOKYO : A Hong Kong-based activist investor in Toshiba Corp has told the embattled conglomerate that the US $ 18 billion sale of its chip unit to a Bain Capital-led group is no longer necessary after its recent capital injection , according to a letter seen by Reuters .
Argyle Street Management Ltd , a hedge fund with US $ 1.2 billion under management , sent the letter to Toshiba 's board late on Monday , the fund 's chief investment officer , Kin Chan , told Reuters . The fund declined to say how many Toshiba shares it owns .
The first activist shareholder to openly voice opposition to the sale , Argyle is inviting the 30-plus overseas investors who participated in Toshiba 's recent 600 billion yen ( US $ 5.3 billion ) new share issue to team up and is already in talks with at least three funds who share the same view , Chan said .
Toshiba agreed to sell Toshiba Memory - the world 's no . 2 producer of NAND chips - to the Bain consortium to cover billions of dollars in liabilities arising from its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear power unit Westinghouse .
In order to ensure its listing status , however , Toshiba also secured a US $ 5.4 billion cash injection from overseas funds this month , which with tax write-offs gives it sufficient funds to cover its liabilities .
Argyle believes `` there no longer is any urgency to undertake a sale of Toshiba Memory , '' it said in the letter , which proposed a meeting with Toshiba 's board in either December or January .

The US $ 18 billion price tag for the chip unit `` significantly undervalues the business , '' the letter said , adding that the board should consider instead an IPO for Toshiba Memory .
Representatives for Toshiba and Bain were not immediately available for comment .
While the potential for activist funds to hinder or even scupper the deal with the Bain-led consortium will depend on how many join forces in opposition , Argyle 's letter underscores some fears that Toshiba had opened a potential can of worms by tapping activist shareholders in its new share issue .

There appears to be no spending cap for Scott Disick .
The “ Keeping Up With the Kardashians ” star appeared in Complex magazine 's sneaker shopping video series to discuss his newly rediscovered love of athletic footwear . While explaining how he came to ditch his signature loafers in favor of Air Force Ones and Air Jordans , Disick admitted he could n't believe that Kanye West ‘ s Yeezy sneakers resale for $ 8,000 .
“ I mean it 's unbelievable that we live in a world that people are going to spend $ 8,000 to walk in a shoe , ” Disick said . “ I could see somebody wanting to spend $ 8,000 to walk in my shoes for a day , but that 's a little different . ”
Disick 's disbelief did n't last long , as he scooped up at least eight pairs of sneakers and a Louis Vuitton x Supreme hoodie , which rang up to just over $ 15,300 . Lord Disick casually slid over his credit card to pay the tab .
At least he got eight pairs instead of one ?

Journalists are n't pawns on the RCMP 's chessboard .
And yet , Ben Makuch , a VICE News journalist , may soon find himself behind prison bars for refusing to turn over chat logs of his interviews with suspected terrorist Farah Mohammed Shirdon .
Makuch appeared in court on Feb. 6 , in order to appeal a 2016 Ontario court decision , which ruled in favour of the RCMP , ordering him to turn over key background files to the police agency .
Shirdon , whose whereabouts is currently unknown , is a 22-year-old Calgary-born soldier of the Islamic State . He was charged with a number of terrorism-related offences in September 2015 .
The case against Makuch stems from a series of articles he wrote in 2014 , based on conversations he had with Shirdon over the instant messaging app Kik .
The implications of this case are certainly wider in scope than the respective outcomes for Makuch and Shirdon , and anyone interested in the ability of the press to serve as a proper check and balance in a democratic society should be concerned with the court 's decision .
In the final analysis , this should be considered as little more than an attack on the freedom of the press .
The right of journalists to protect their sources must be defended , regardless of the context .
Journalists depend on the public for much of the information they report . In most cases , sources are more than willing to have their names attached to the information they provide .
But , given certain circumstances , it is understandable why a source may be unwilling to do so . This may be because they could face reprisals or legal punishment , may not want to self-incriminate , or may be unwilling to come forward unless anonymity is assured .
A journalist is only as effective as his or her reputation . Should they prove willing to hand over important information and files , or the identity of sources , it can have a chilling effect on potential future contacts and whistleblowers .
Why would anyone in their right mind contact a journalist offering sensitive information in the public interest if they feel as if they will be easily identified and outed ?
The fact is , some of the most important news stories in history would never have been reported , had the journalists involved in the investigations proven themselves untrustworthy to sources earlier in their career .
Attacks on the freedom of the press of this nature have a negative effect on society as a whole , as important issues surrounding politics , crime and corruption may go unchallenged , unchecked or unreported .
Media rights are under threat whenever the state flexes its muscles in an attempt to force journalists – under threat of imprisonment – to release the identity of sources and background files which would be detrimental to the source-journalist relationship .
The reality is that Shirdon may very well never face trial in Canada , and , even if he does , it is not the task of the media to help make the RCMP 's case against him .
If they want to be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Shirdon is guilty of what they claim , then they should do their jobs and find the evidence to back up their claims .
Instead , they 're intimidating a journalist by threatening to either ruin his career , or take away his liberty .
SEOUL : North Korea on Saturday ( Feb 3 ) defended its plan to stage a military parade the day before the opening of the Winter Olympics in the South .
Pyongyang plans to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of its military on Feb 8 .
The annual parade was held on Apr 25 for years , but the government announced last month that starting this year , it would take place on Feb 8 .
`` Nobody has the right to take issue '' with the event , said Rodong Sinmun , the official daily of North Korea 's ruling Workers ' Party .
`` It is a custom and very basic common sense that any country in the world takes the founding anniversary of its military very seriously and celebrates it . ''
The Winter Games in Pyeongchang , South Korea , open on Feb 9 .

Satellite photos have shown North Korean soldiers and armoured vehicles apparently rehearsing for a parade that could be seen as a show of military strength .
Critics have accused Pyongyang of rescheduling the parade to ruin the atmosphere at the Winter Olympics .
Rodong Sinmun dismissed the allegations as `` malicious '' , noting that North Korea 's regular army was created on Feb 8 seven decades ago .
`` This amounts to arguing that we knew 70 years ago the Olympics will take place in the South on Feb 9 , 2018 , '' the newspaper said .
South Korean unification minister Cho Myoung-Gyon 's recent comment that the parade is `` highly likely to be a threatening one '' also prompted a warning from the paper .
Such criticism , the Rodong Sinmun said , would sour the opening of the Winter Olympics .
The North is participating in the Games after its leader Kim Jong-Un abruptly announced his willingness to attend in his New Year 's address .
The move was seen as an attempt to ease searing tensions on the Korean peninsula over Pyongyang 's nuclear and missile programmes .
North Korea on Monday called off a joint cultural performance with the South ahead of the forthcoming Winter Olympics to protest criticism of the military parade by South Korean media .
The European Union will resume political contact `` at all levels '' with Thailand , its foreign affairs council said on Monday , after putting relations on hold following a 2014 coup by the Thai military .
BANGKOK : The European Union will resume political contact `` at all levels '' with Thailand , its foreign affairs council said on Monday , after putting relations on hold following a 2014 coup by the Thai military .
The move comes after Thailand 's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha announced in October that a general election would take place in November 2018 - the most precise date the junta has given after many delays since the 2014 coup .
The government , however , has yet to end a political ban that would allow political parties to campaign ahead of the vote .
The EU is Thailand 's third trade partner after China and Japan . Thailand is the EU 's third-largest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) .
Thailand exported goods worth €19.6 billion ( US $ 23.11 billion ) to the EU in 2015 , according to the European Commission .
`` The Council decided to resume political contacts at all levels with Thailand in order to facilitate meaningful dialogue on issues of mutual importance , including on human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the road towards democracy , '' the EU 's Foreign Affairs Council said in a statement .

In June 2014 , the EU said it would keep its relations with Thailand under review and put on hold the signing of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PCA ) , which was aimed at closer economic and political ties with Thailand .
It has expressed concerns over freedom of expression in the country and has called for a swift return to democracy .
The signing of PCA and talks on EU-Thailand Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) could resume with a democratically elected civilian government under the new Constitution , the statement said .
The United States also downgraded ties with Thailand following the coup , scaling back joint military exercises , among other things .
According to the European Commission , the EU exported goods worth €13.4 billion ( US $ 15.80 billion ) to Thailand in 2015 , including machinery and transport equipment .

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday observed that felling over 16,500 tresses to build multi-storey accommodation for the proposed redevelopment of six South Delhi colonies was akin to “ leaving the city to die ” .Prohibited authorities from cutting down or taking away trees till July 26 , the next date of hearing on a plea against felling of trees for housing projects , the court asked how a sapling could replace a full-grown tree. “ If Delhi needs that they ( buildings ) be dismantled , they will be dismantled . You ca n't leave the city to die like this , ” a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said.It also asked why everyone needs to be given space in Lutyens ' Delhi when the peripherals of the national capital have sufficient vacant land , and added that “ the mantra is decongestion ” .Taking note of a submission that Delhi was running out of groundwater , the court asked the Centre and the city government how they proposed to water the saplings that were going to replace fully grown trees under the compensatory afforestation policy. “ Delhi government shall explain how a fully grown tree could be equated with 10 saplings ? How long will a sapling take to grow as a tree ? ” the HC asked.Questioning the Centre on its redevelopment scheme , the court asked how permission was granted to change a two-storeyed building , meant for two families , into an eight-storeyed building. “ What do you mean by redevelopment ? This is your scheme . Replacing a two-storeyed building with an eight-floor building , this is what you call redevelopment , ” the bench said. “ From where do you get water for such eight-floor buildings ? What amount of garbage will be generated ? Where is parking and what about air pollution ? You do n't apply your mind to planning , ” the bench said.The counsel , appearing for the National Buildings Construction Corporation ( NBCC ) , tasked with redeveloping half-a-dozen south Delhi colonies , claimed that no garbage was going out of the construction site.The court was also of the opinion that the construction was an impediment for ambulances and patients in reaching the two super speciality hospitals — AIIMS and Safdarjung — in the area . “ There will be traffic jam at the main gate of the colonies . Two major hospitals are at the intersection . How will people reach AIIMS and Safdarjung hospital ? You must have done an Environment Impact Assessment . Show it to us , ” it said.It also sought to know the density of the area and said after laying infrastructure , including road , water , electricity , garbage system , macro-level planning is done . “ How can you amend the master plan retrospectively after developing a colony ? ” The court asked the DDA to place before it all the schemes of redevelopment.The court granted time to ministries of environment and forest and housing , the Delhi government , NBCC , DDA , Delhi Jal Board , NDMC and other authorities to file their response on the petition , which has sought setting aside of the terms of reference ( ToR ) and Environmental Clearance ( EC ) granted to the housing project by the environment ministry , claiming it would lead to felling of over 16,500 trees.The bench also sought details as to how much space has been given for commercial activities.The court said there was a need for the presence of experts related to these issues and appointed environmentalist M C Mehta as amicus curiae in the matter.The Delhi government standing counsel told the court that the government has started the process of revoking and reviewing the permission granted to cut trees for the projects.The court was hearing a PIL by orthopaedic surgeon Dr Kaushal Kant Mishra against felling of trees for housing projects in six south Delhi colonies — Sarojini Nagar , Naoroji Nagar , Netaji Nagar , Thyagaraja Nagar , Mohammadpur and Kasturba Nagar . A similar issue is also pending before the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) .The petition has claimed that planting of saplings in another location as compensatory afforestation would not reduce the burden that would be put on the environment due to the large-scale felling of trees.It has claimed that saplings would be a “ poor substitute ” for the fully grown trees that would be felled for the housing projects.The issue of felling of trees became a political flashpoint between the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) and the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , with both the parties blaming each other for the permission granted to the project .

Grain shippers are welcoming the news that a work stoppage at CP Rail has been avoided for now following a recommendation from federal officials and the parties to hold a ratification vote .
The Western Grain Elevator Association ( WGEA ) says a work stoppage this week on CP would have had a devastating impact on grain shippers , farmers and end use customers in a year that has already been very challenging .
“ We would like to thank Minister Hadju , the federal mediators , CP and the unions for working hard to help avoid a disruption in service , ” said WGEA Executive Director Wade Sobkowich . “ Minister Hadju 's interaction on this demonstrates the Government 's understanding of the need to ensure that the Canadian economy does not suffer from an avoidable rail work stoppage . ”
WGEA notes rail service was unacceptably low throughout the winter of 2017/18 , and a work stoppage at CP would have made it impossible to salvage the shipping season .
“ We hope that this is not just a delay , but a step forward in resolving this labour negotiation , ” added Sobkowich . “ The impacts of a work stoppage would have hit Canadians that are employed in industries that rely on rail the hardest , rather than either CP management or the unions , and we applaud the government and the parties for getting an acceptable package on the table . ”
The WGEA is an association of grain businesses operating in Canada which collectively handle in excess of 90 % of western Canada 's bulk grain exports .
A Jos Federal High Court on Wednesday fixed July 10 to hear a new motion filed by the immediate past President of the Nigeria Football Federation , Amaju Pinnick , challenging the ex parte order it granted Chris Giwa , current President of the Federation .
Pinnick approached the court for the relief after the Supreme Court judgment which ordered him to comply with the lower court 's order that compelled him to vacate the office for Giwa .
Justice Musa Kurya , the Presiding Judge in the case between Yahaya Adama and Aminu Maigari had , on June 5 , gave an ex parte order asking Pinnick 's NFF leadership to vacate the Glass House for the Giwa-led executive .
But Pinnick , through his counsel , Festus Keyamo ( SAN ) , approached the court with two motions demanding the vacation of the order granted Giwa and others , pending the determination of an application challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case .
Though the case was heard in the chamber , the two counsels in the matter spoke to newsmen shortly after .
Mr. Festus Ukpe , who stood in for Keyamo , explained : “ We came to court to challenge the order which the court gave to Giwa-led executive .
“ Our aim or intention was to move our two motions , but the counsel to Adama and Ogba , Mr. Habila Ardzard , opposed it on the ground that they only got possession of the motions today ( Wednesday ) .
“ We told the judge that there was need for the court to hear these motions because of our fear of what Giwa will do in these few days that he claims he has power over Glass House .
“ That is why we argued that there was the need for the judge to vacate his order since we were not given fair hearing in the matter , which we are not a party to but for our interest . ”
Ukpe said that after both sides had made their submissions , the judge ruled and fixed July 10 for the hearing of the motions because of the urgency .
Also , Ardzard said he had to oppose Pinnick from moving the motions “ because by law , we are entitled to seven days within which we could study the motion and reply from the date of its receipt .
“ We were only asked to come to court today and when we came , we were told that there were two motions which Pinnick 's counsel intended to move today ( Wednesday ) .
“ Of course , we had to oppose it and the court finally ruled in our favour and therefore , fixed July 10 for the hearing of the motions . ”

A Real Estate Play That 's More Than ‘ Location , Location , Location ' “ One type of investment that 's typically shunned in a rising interest rate environment is real estate investment trusts , or REITs .

I mean , he was livid…He 's a pretty chill guy , but the first five or 10 minutes in that dressing room was not a lot of fun , ” he recalled .
Lars , with Katherine Heigl and Andrew Rannells sitting beside him on the couch , described the recording process for their latest album , Hardwired…to Self Destruct . Apparently , now that everyone has kids , it 's a lot more work .

“ You get up , you get the kids ready , you drop them at two or three different schools…after-school activities and play dates and all that and one kid 's here and one kid 's there , but we managed to put about six or seven hours into the studio in between that and the album was given birth to , ” he said .
He also dished that they 're not crazy rock stars anymore –life is pretty calm on the road for them . “ We carry our own chef that feeds us very organic and healthy stuff . We have not one , but two…guys that like , massage us and stretch us , warm us up , stitch us back together after the show , ” Lars shared .
Luckily for Gwenddwr 's 63rd Show , the rain held off and everyone enjoyed a traditionally warm and friendly welcome .
Show President , Mrs Minnie Jones , now in her 90s , is a stalwart supporter especially in the pony section .
She reflected on many friends in the local community no longer with us who gave so much to the show during their lifetimes .
Their families continue to be the mainstay of the show today , including the show queen , Beth Jones , whose Nan , Joyce Jones , who died last autumn , was a most capable show secretary .
The queen with two young lads in attendance , Ryan Jones and Daniel Pearson , arrived in unique and time-honoured style on a beautifully decorated float towed by Tir Canvas ' vintage Massey Ferguson tractor , driven this year by Mr Paul Jones . His mother , Mrs Megan Jones , who happily carried out this duty with great energy into her late 80s , sadly died last Christmas and she is greatly missed by all .
Bumper entries in the Fancy Dress got the show off to a highly entertaining start , with all ages in a marvellous variety of costumes in lively conversion with the judges .
Inventive entries in the craft , cookery and produce marquee displayed an abundant range of skills .
Sheep entries were top-notch though less than usual , sadly due to a funeral .
In the pony field , section As and children 's ridden classes were of a particularly high standard .
A diverse and wonderful gathering for the dog show included well deserved champions in both the pedigree and novelty sections .
Excellent professional standards in the fur , feather and pets prompted suggestions for an additional ‘ novice ' class next year to encourage more homely entries .
Fresh from the Royal Welsh , the Wye Valley Axe Display Team proved a tremendous attraction . Hot competition and team spirit with spills and thrills on the obstacle course proved a great way to round off another wonderful show .
Your diet largely impacts your brain health including cognitive power and vulnerability to dementia , Alzheimer 's and the likes . Although each one of us knows eating a healthy diet is important for a great body & brain , the definition of ‘ healthy ' in a diet keeps changing from time to time . The latest fad that has caught up fitness enthusiasts is to banish carbohydrates . The main ingredient that everyone frowns at is gluten and to limit gluten intake people cut down on grains.However , as per scientists , whole grains are loaded with fiber , which is quintessential for healthy brain function along with carbohydrates . As per scientists , fiber feeds good bacteria in our gut and scarcity of the same adversely impacts gut health , which in turn affects brain health and makes one vulnerable to long-term negative effects on the brain like brain fog , confusion , and even depression and anxiety.Thereby , rather than following fitness fads , include complex carbohydrates like whole grains , brown rice , oats , and sweet potatoes in your diet . These carbs are high in fiber and help stabilize blood sugar levels , enhance metabolism , aid healthy digestion while boosting the immune system with B-vitamins , antioxidants and minerals . Also , complex carbohydrates release glucose which is the main source of energy for the brain . And if you are gluten sensitive , then aim at including gluten-free grains like rice , amaranth , millet , quinoa , sorghum and buckwheat.Apart from complex carbohydrates , you must include vegetables , fruit and legumes to follow a Mediterranean-style diet that helps you reduce risks of diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular diseases , cognitive impairment as well as Alzheimer 's .

Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative ( CCMAI ) , an NGO , has urged the Federal Government to mitigate the causes of climate change .
The Senior Programme Officer of the initiative , Mr Richard Inyamkume , gave the advice on Monday in Abuja .
He said mitigating causes of climate change became necessary to reduce its huge negative that might affect more Nigerians in 2018 .
“ Climate change impact on communities in Nigeria is relatively huge and may affect more Nigerians in the coming years if we do not take proper steps to mitigate its causes , '' he said .
Inyamkume said the NGO was concerned about the prevailing challenge posed by global warming and how it affected the available natural resources meant to serve man 's needs .
“ Throughout 2017 , our organization has been engaged in advocacy programmes that are expected to enlighten the general public on the causes and imminent dangers associated with the impact of climate change .
“ Through our ‘ Green Bwari Project ' , we are able to mobilise children and youths for tree planting in Ushafa , Peyi , Jigo , Pambara , Kogo , Sabon Geri and Bwari township .
“ Over 80 trees have been planted and we are hoping to do more in 2018 . Bwari Area Council , Abuja , needs trees to assist in the purification of the atmosphere of the area . ''
He said that the organisation also engaged school children and tertiary institutions in its “ Save the Climate Club ” mobilising students to take action against climate change .
According to him , it will also influence their parents , friends and relatives to join the campaign against environmental degradation , pollution and improper waste disposal .

“ By 2018 , our organisation is hopeful that we will attract donors and partners in the actualisation of our projects and initiatives .
“ We are focusing more on green conservation and low carbon growth initiatives in the coming year .
“ We hope to mobilise and empower women to go on clean cooking technologies such as clean cookstoves and biogas stoves .
“ It is our conviction that communities will gradually switch to clean cooking options that will be available .
Inyamkume said CCMAI would empower women to take up ownership of home vegetable gardens and derive additional income from the sale of such produce .
“ Though our projects and initiatives have been constrained or limited by funds , we are still planning ahead of time to get our targets and goals accomplished .
“ Funds play a vital role in building a sustainable environment and organisations like ours that are not-for-profit , need charity donations from kind-hearted people for the actualisation of our objectives . ''
He called on the government to invest more in low carbon growth initiatives and support partnerships that would increase resilience to climate change risks .
Inyamkume also urged people to join the advocacy for a safe and healthy environment , as well as make donations that would support the activities of the organisation .
“ Our vision is to actualise green and safe environment for all Nigerians and to assist in transforming our surroundings into better and appreciable outlooks .
“ We have enlightened citizens as well as empowering men and women , youths and children in green and low carbon initiatives and projects .

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF/LONDON ( Reuters ) - Top managers at Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel have reached out to the European Commission to seek approval for a landmark joint venture deal , with legal experts and analysts saying they might have to sell assets to get it .
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel on Saturday agreed to merge their European steel activities into a 50-50 joint venture , creating the continent 's No.2 steelmaker after ArcelorMittal with 17 billion euros ( $ 20 billion ) in combined sales .
Informal talks with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager began a few weeks ago and will likely address the issue of disposals in some niche areas , including packaging , the sources say .
Tata Steel Europe already has an asset sale programme underway .
`` Even without knowing all the details of the transaction , much speaks in favour of discussing asset sales , '' said Jens Steger , counsel at law firm Simmons & Simmons , who advised Monsanto on antitrust matters in the takeover by Bayer .
Steger said he had received several requests from third parties who are interested in becoming part of the process , adding these could , in theory , be competitors keen on assets that might come up for sale or shareholders who oppose the deal .
Earlier this year , larger rival ArcelorMittal was able to secure EU approval for its purchase of Italian group Ilva only after pledging to sell a string of businesses across Europe to address competition concerns .
NICHE PRODUCTS
Experts see few problems regarding crude steel production of the combined Thyssenkrupp-Tata Steel venture , which Moody 's reckons will own just 14 percent of the European market , a distant second to ArcelorMittal 's 29 percent , which includes Ilva .
`` But there could be remedies with regard to niche products , '' said a senior steel banker . `` There you would have to sell individual parts . And that would not be a problem . ''
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel would have about a 50 percent share of the European packaging steel , or tinplate , market , which could require them to dispose of some of those assets , a person familiar with the industry told Reuters .
`` Our understanding is that while upstream consolidation does not raise red flags , downstream specialty products such as tinplate may require remedy measures , '' Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld said in a note .
Rasselstein , Thyssenkrupp 's packaging steel unit , made sales of 1.16 billion euros in the fiscal year 2015/2016 and employs about 2,400 employees .
It is also unclear how an ongoing asset disposal programme at Tata Steel Europe , initiated before the signing of the joint venture deal , will play into antitrust negotiations .
It has put a number of assets on the block , including Cogent , a manufacturer and processor of electrical steels , and about 1,100 employees , or about 5 percent of Tata Steel Europe 's workforce , would leave the group should all deals be realised .
`` I would be surprised if antitrust considerations did not play a role here , '' Simmons & Simmons ' Steger said .
The European Commission and Tata Steel declined to comment . Thyssenkrupp also declined to comment , saying that merger control proceedings had not officially been opened yet .

A new and sad study explores the cryptic intersections of class and race . Via a research group from Stanford University , Harvard University , the Census Bureau and other prestigious organizations , it was concluded that white boys who grow up rich typically remained wealthy as adults . However , Black boys who grew up rich were far more likely to become poor in 99 % of the U.S .
The researchers compared 10,000 American men now in their late 30s , split evenly between white and Black , revealing that approximately 20 percent of the Black men who grew up rich became poor as an adult ; only 17 percent of Black men who grew up rich remained rich . For white men , 39 percent remained rich , and only 10 percent became poor . Ibram Kendi , a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University , told the New York Times , “ One of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race , and clearly this study explodes that idea , but for whatever reason , we 're unwilling to stare racism in the face . ”
The numbers were not the same for Black and white girls . Reportedly , their eventual earnings were even , the NYT explained , “ While Black women also face negative effects of racism , Black men often experience racial discrimination differently . As early as preschool , they are more likely to be disciplined in school . They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often . ”
These stark numbers can be attributed to structural racism . “ The research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles Black males face . The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower , and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same . Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level , or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded . Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans . But the disparities are widest for Black boys . ”
Hopefully , this study can dismiss the notion that poverty trumps race . Sadly , racism still affects the everyday lives of people from education to heath to wages .

PARIS : A car smashed into a pizza restaurant east of Paris late Monday ( Aug 14 ) , killing an eight-year-old girl and badly injuring six other people , the police said , adding that the driver had been arrested .
Investigators believe the act was `` deliberate ... but apparently has no connection with a terrorist act , '' the public prosecutor 's office in the town of Meaux said .
France has suffered a string of terror-related attacks , including the use of cars as weapons .
On Aug 9 , six soldiers were injured after they were hit by a rented BMW in a western Paris suburb .
The suspect , a 36-year-old Algerian man , was later shot and wounded after a dramatic motorway chase .
NEW YORK : United Continental Holdings Inc 's first-quarter earnings on Monday beat analysts ' expectations on several key measures , and the carrier again apologized for the forceful removal of a passenger from a flight last week .
The parent company of United Airlines , the U.S. industry 's third-largest by passenger traffic , reported earnings of 41 cents per share , excluding special items , beating analysts ' consensus forecast of 38 cents .
Revenue of US $ 8.4 billion was up 2.7 percent year-over-year , slightly above the average estimate of US $ 8.38 billion . Passenger unit revenue , which measures sales relative to flight capacity , was flat , in line with the Chicago-based company 's estimate .
United estimated a 1 to 3 percent increase in that closely watched measure in the second quarter .
Higher fuel costs and recent labor agreements led to a 5.1 percent increase in unit cost per available seat mile from the year-ago period .
`` In the first quarter of 2017 , our financial and operational performance gives us a lot of confidence about the foundation we are building . It is obvious from recent experiences that we need to do a much better job serving our customers , '' Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement .
United is recovering from a public relations debacle after a passenger , Dr. David Dao , was dragged from his seat off the plane in O'Hare International Airport to make space for crew members .
`` The incident that took place aboard Flight 3411 has been a humbling experience , and I take full responsibility . This will prove to be a watershed moment for our company , and we are more determined than ever to put our customers at the center of everything we do , '' Munoz said .
United shares edged up 0.9 percent after closing up 2.46 percent at US $ 70.77 .

Nigeria will face Seychelles in their next competitive match in September in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier after crashing out of the World Cup where they placed third behind Croatia and Argentina .
“ Everyone was just trying to deal with the loss and move on , so it was a quiet dressing room but definitely one that learnt a lot and hopefully formed some players , ” Ekong told BBC Sport .
“ This is what you need as a team . When you talk about that Argentinian team , that 's a team that has experienced all levels , Croatia is the same while Iceland have played the Euros together .
“ You need a tournament like this just to learn what it is like to play at this level , under this pressure , in front of the whole world .
“ Hopefully by the next time we get to a World Cup , and if we can be part of that with all the players ( who played in Russia ) , it will be nothing new to us and it might be easier for us to perform at a higher level . ”
Troost-Ekong also praised the team spirit months Super Eagles , whose squads in the past have often been accused of being more about individuals than togetherness .
“ All of us are really down to earth and most of us are quite young , ” he said .
“ I think everyone has got great harmony , everyone wants to work for each other and if we can keep this up then it is definitely promising for the future . ”
Ready to feel like a bit of an underachiever ?
A West Island teenager is working alongside McGill researchers in the pursuit of a cure for Alzheimer 's disease , and that 's just part of the reason 17-year-old Maya Mikutra-Cencora recently won a $ 25,000 scholarship .
The Grade 11 student says she 's always been a very curious person .
“ Some teachers think I ask a few too many questions , ” she told Global News .
It 's a quality she channels into everything she does , and something that has helped her demystify that “ lazy teenager ” stereotype .

“ I get involved in science fairs , math contests , model UN conferences , writing contests , things like that , ” said the Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf student .
At 15 , Mikutra-Cencora took an interest in Alzheimer 's . After reading about the disease in a news article , she decided to dig a little deeper .
“ Every time I would not understand something , I would try to look something up about that factor in Alzheimer 's , ” she said .
“ That lead me to reading a lot of different studies at the same time , and through reading all them I started putting together some ideas . ”
The teen managed to get the attention of Dr. Claudio Cuello , a McGill researcher who invited her to his lab .
“ I just sent him an email and that was that , ” she said .
Now , the Ile-Bizard resident works alongside Cuello and grad student Rowan Pentz .
“ I 've already presented some preliminary results at different science fairs , ” she said .

At one of those science fairs , she got to explain her work to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . He also attended the same school and she said he was very attentive as she spoke to him .
In the midst of it all , she applied for the $ 25,000 Steam Horizon Award . In her application , she talked about her research , and about another way she spends her free time .
“ Volunteering with other kids , volunteering with intellectually handicapped teenagers . I do activities with them once a week , like arts and crafts , science experiments , ” she said .
Mikutra-Cencora was one of the five winners of the scholarship . Brébeufis also a CEGEP , so she will put some of the money toward her studies there .
“ I 'm not exactly sure what I want to do in university , probably a path toward science or math , ” she said .
“ I think she can do anything , ” said chemistry teacher Christine Adant . “ Any field she likes , she will be welcomed into it . ”

Washington : Steve Scalise , the senior Republican lawmaker seriously wounded in Wednesday 's shooting at a baseball practice near Washington , is a hardline conservative who opposes abortion , immigration and gun control , and who cleared numerous hurdles to become the number three House Republican .
The 51-year-old congressman from Louisiana was in critical condition after surgery at a Washington hospital for a gunshot wound to the hip . Three other people were shot , and two more suffered minor injuries . The attacker later died of injuries sustained in a shootout with police .
Scalise is considered a rising star in President Donald Trump 's Republican Party , a gregarious lawmaker who headed a conservative grouping in Congress before being elected by his peers as the House majority whip . The whip is the member of leadership who ensures discipline and makes sure the party has enough votes , particularly on key issues .
He has been seen as a bridge between the stark conservatives in the caucus , many of whom swept into office in the past seven years , and more traditional establishment Republicans .
Scalise had to face down demands for his resignation in 2014 after admitting to addressing a gathering with ties to Ku Klux Klan former leader David Duke , a scandal which complicated the party 's effort to distance itself from the specter of white nationalism .
Scalise apologised , saying `` it was a mistake I regret . '' But the issue for which Scalise has made no apology is gun control . He is a fierce supporter of the National Rifle Association , which gives him an A+ rating , and has voted repeatedly to expand gun rights in the United States .
Scalise `` will continue fighting to protect every citizen 's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms , '' his website says .
Last month , Scalise , who has described the constitutional right to bear arms as `` incredibly sacred , '' introduced legislation that would relax restrictions on interstate firearm sales , making it easier for law-abiding citizens to buy guns .
He has routinely opposed gun control legislation , even taking to the House floor in a controversial speech criticizing activists in April 2013 , just four months after 20 elementary school children and six adults were shot dead in Newtown , Connecticut .
`` We were all shocked and saddened by the murders at Sandy Hook . But I think what 's also disappointing , is when you have these tragedies , unfortunately there are people — Washington politicians — that try to take advantage of those tragedies to then come behind and try to impose their agenda , '' he said at the time .
Rapid political rise
Scalise was born in New Orleans and graduated from Louisiana State University . He worked as a software engineer and marketing executive before being elected to the Louisiana state House of Representatives in 1995 .
After a brief stint as a state senator , he headed to Washington after winning election in 2008 for the congressional seat vacated by Bobby Jindal , who became the Louisiana governor . Scalise rose rapidly through the ranks , and quickly made a name for himself on conservative issues .
In his third term , he was elected chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee , a group of more than 160 House Republicans . The group has played a vital role in debate over spending and deficit reduction efforts , but came in for criticism for proposing directions that were opposed by party leadership .
In November 2012 , after winning the RSC chairmanship , he said he wanted to pull leadership `` as far to the right '' as possible in order to enact conservative legislation .
Two years later , he stepped down from that role when he was elected chief Republican whip , a coveted position traditionally seen as a stepping stone to greater power in Congress .
Immaturity .
It 's a word that aptly describes the way the Bangladeshi cricketers and fans have been conducting themselves . From the many run-ins with India to the latest episodes of acrimony with Sri Lanka in the Nidahas Trophy , exacerbated by the performance of the crass Naagin dance that reeked of a blatant effort to disregard and mock the opponents , the way Bangladesh have behaved on and off the field has left a lot to be desired . The reactions have been so over-the-top and exaggerated that they have become embarrassing .
Bangladesh , without a shadow of a doubt , have put in some memorable performances and registered some fantastic wins since acquiring Test status in 2000 .
There has been that famous win over then world champions Australia in an ODI in 2005 , they have beaten Pakistan , South Africa , India and England ( twice ) in World Cups . They have put it past India in a bilateral ODI series in 2015 , have had Test wins against England and Australia , and have reached the final of the Asia Cup and indeed the just-concluded tri-nation tournament ahead of more illustrious opponents .
Yes , Bangladesh have plunged to the depths of despair and seemed totally out of place in the big league of world cricket from time to time . There have been occasions when you knew that if it was a Bangladesh fixture , there would be only one result possible – a Bangladesh defeat .
But they have improved and today are no more the pushovers they used to be . They can stun oppositions , and do it more frequently now . But all the good cricket often tends to get overshadowed by argy-bargy with the opposition . There has been a tendency to mock and disrespect the rivals every time that they taste the smallest of success .
Doing the Naagin dance in someone 's face is a distasteful , school-boyish way of celebration , totally unbecoming of a set of professional sportsmen who are supposed to be the ambassadors of their country . Perhaps Mushfiqur Rahim and Co need to take a leaf out of the book of the Iceland football team , who have united an entire nation not just by virtue of their giant-killing acts on the big stage , but also with their volcano clap celebration , and endeared themselves to the world .
Let 's face it : Among all the bizarre celebrations that you see on a sporting field , the Naagin dance would surely be among the worst , majorly because unlike the others , it tries to poke fun at the opposition . Bangladesh 's reactions would not fall under the category of structured , targeted sledging like what the Australians do , but they have been simply an unrestrained , out-of-control expression of emotion , obfuscating of the fine line between passion and jingoism . An when that happens , rivalries start to get ugly and personal .
It was utter disrespect of the opposition when , for example , a video made in Bangladesh claimed in 2015 that the visiting Indian team would be 'bambooed ' , or after a creditable ODI series win , a Bangladesh newspaper 'humiliated ' the Indians , portraying some of their players with half of their heads shaved , or when a poster was made of one of Bangladesh 's frontline bowlers carrying the 'severed ' head of the then Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a war trophy , or indeed when the celebrated Indian fan Sudhir Gautam was attacked .
Success tends to bring out a wild reaction among the Bangladeshi players and fans alike . They are often neither humble in victory , nor gracious in defeat , failing , therefore , at the first hurdle of qualifying as a champion side .
One remembers when Indian opener Rohit Sharma was caught off Rubel Hossain in the 2015 World Cup quarter-final , but the delivery was deemed to be a no-ball and the dismissal was struck down . It had the whole of Bangladesh whining , and complaining of a dark conspiracy . Rohit , who was batting on 90 at that time , went on to score a sparkling 137 and fashioned India 's victory . Bangladesh 's Mustafa Kamal , who was the then International Cricket Council ( ICC ) president alleged that the result was pre-arranged and threatened to resign from his post . The country 's prime minister Sheikh Hasina also condemned the umpiring decision . Now if that is not overreaction , what is ?
And not only India , England have witnessed this negative side of Bangladesh cricket as well . The second ODI of the series during their tour of Bangladesh in 2016 saw some unsavoury scenes as Mahmudullah got involved in a tiff with Jos Buttler , after the latter was dismissed , and the umpires had to intervene to prevent anything more untoward from happening . “ I was just disappointed in the way they celebrated , it 's an emotional game , ” Buttler said .
Then Tamim Iqbal apparently dropped a shoulder into Jonny Bairstow during the customary handshakes , which made Ben Stokes and other England players jump to Bairstow 's rescue , with Stokes pushing Iqbal aside . He later tweeted : `` Congrats to Bangladesh on the win tonight , outplayed us , what I wo n't stand for is someone putting a shoulder to my teammate at handshakes . ''
Against Sri Lanka , in a must-win game of the Nidahas Trophy on Friday , Bangladesh 's conduct was a complete disgrace . They pulled off a record chase in their previous match against the Lankans and Rahim , who was the chief architect of that historic win , having played a 35-ball unbeaten 72 , had broken into the Naagin dance after the win .
In fact , the Naagin dance and Sri Lanka versus Bangladesh contests have a history to them . One remembers Nazmul Islam doing it while celebrating Upul Tharanga 's wicket in one of the T20Is when the islanders toured Bangladesh earlier this year . It has now come to occupy a central place in what is fast turning out to be a ding dong rivalry . The Lankans have not shied away from giving it back , and when Rahim – one of the chief proponents of the Bangladeshi version of the Naagin dance – was dismissed on Friday , Sri Lankan spinner Amila Aponso offered the been ( flute ) to put Rahim 's naagin ( snake ) to sleep .
Bangladesh may have scripted a fine win on Friday that gave them the ticket to the Nidahas Trophy final . But the occasion was marred by some manic celebrations , heated arguments between Bangladesh 's reserve player Nurul Hasan , who had carried drinks on to the field , and Sri Lankan captain Thisara Perera . Bangladesh captain and one of the leading all-rounders in the world , Shakib Al Hasan , clearly gestured towards the batsmen , calling them back after an umpiring decision did not go their way in the final stage of the match . He later denied having asked the batsmen to withdraw .
`` I was n't calling them back . I was telling them to play . You can describe it both ways . It depends on how you see it , '' Shakib said . `` We are all humans and making mistakes is in our nature , '' he added .
There was complete chaos after the match and Bangladesh batsman Tamim Iqbal was seen having to calm down a furious Kusal Mendis as the players from both teams continued to argue . The glass of the Bangladesh dressing room was also found shattered , apparently the handiwork of some of the visiting players who had gone berserk in their celebrations . The incident made Sri Lakan legend Sanath Jayasuriya to term it `` third class behaviour '' in a tweet , which he deleted later .
The bad blood that Friday 's match created between the two sets of fans , led the Sri Lankan crowd to turn up in numbers and shout themselves hoarse in support of India in the final , while the Bangladeshis were hardly ever cheered . There were reportedly `` Jeetega bhai Jeetega , India jeetega '' chants from the stands and the anger against Bangladesh was palpable .
But the question is why Bangladesh go on the rampage after every little success . One of the reasons could be that success for them has been so scarce that when they do succeed , they lose control of themselves in the euphoria and do n't quite know what to do . The result is the wild celebration that we see . It may also spring from a craving for recognition , and a desire to be treated at par with some of the more established teams of the subcontinent . The Naagin dance et al are just ways to drive home that point .
The Sri Lanka-Bangladesh rivalry augurs well for cricket in Asia , where you could soon have an alternative ( albeit lower in stature ) narrative to the India-Pakistan contests . It would be great news for the game in general too , and an emaciated Sri Lanka and a competitive Bangladesh of the present day make good rivals . However , learning to handle success is an art that Bangladesh are yet to master . Here they can possibly take a lesson or two from the Lankans who had transited from being a lightweight in the 1980s and early 1990s to a major force since the 1996 World Cup . Sometimes smartness is in learning from your opponent !
LONDON : British athletics great Mo Farah wants to be known as 'Mohamed ' now that he is switching his focus to road racing , he has announced .
`` My road name is Mohamed , '' he said . `` I just feel like Mo is done . I need to forget about what I 've achieved and what I 've done ( on the track ) . ''
Farah , 34 , made the announcement after bringing the curtain down on his glittering track career by winning 10,000 metres gold and 5,000 metres silver at the World Championships in London .
Somalia-born Farah has won four Olympic titles and six world titles , but he bowed out under something of a cloud due to doping allegations against his American coach Alberto Salazar .
He hit out at the media during an emotional press conference on Sunday , accusing them of trying to `` destroy '' his achievements .
`` You can write what you like , '' Farah said . `` The fact is I 've achieved what I have from hard work and dedication ... year after year , and delivering for my country .

`` It 's like a broken record , repeating myself . If I 've crossed the line , if Alberto 's crossed the line , why bring it up year after year , making it into headlines ?
`` I 've achieved what I have achieved . You 're trying to destroy it . ''
SINGAPORE : Toy claw machines are a common sight in game arcades and carnivals , but for one charity , they have become an affordable way to raise funds .
Thye Hwa Kwan ( THK ) Moral Society rolled out two of those machines at Junction 8 mall in Bishan on Monday ( Jan 2 ) , at the launch of an exhibition to highlight its services .
The charity 's chairman Lee Kim Siang said given the uncertain economic outlook , voluntary welfare organisations ( VWO ) need to find `` innovative ways '' to raise funds . `` If we do a TV show , it 's going to cost quite a hefty sum . The going rate was a million dollars , '' said Mr Lee .
He added that THK has not yet been affected by the economy : `` We are okay … in good times and bad times , people help us . ''
For instance , the cost of the claw machines were covered by donors . The charity bought a total of 10 machines from China for about S $ 10,000 , which included the cost of shipping . To help save on maintenance costs , two Thye Hwa Kwan staff were trained to maintain and repair the machines .
For S $ 2 per play , you can have a go on the machine to try and win stuffed toys . THK hopes to raise S $ 2,000 during the one-week exhibition . The money will go towards the charity 's programmes and services like its free meal centres and free medical clinics .
Speaking at the exhibition , Member of Parliament for Bishan-Toa Payoh , Mr Saktiandi Supaat , also agreed that VWOs could do more in this economic climate to encourage donors to continue to give .
`` One way like what they 're ( THK ) doing is trying to use innovative , creative ways to fund raise , '' he said , adding that it is also important for charities to raise awareness of the services they provide .
`` Residents still appreciate the services that 's provided by organisations like Thye Hua Kwan ... that would create a bit more awareness , and a lot of fundraising can still continue in the year ahead , ” said Mr Saktiandi .
The claw machines will be at Junction 8 mall until Sunday , and from Jan 16 , they will be at Ang Mo Kio Hub and Northpoint Shopping Centre for at least a month .
There has been a lot of noise around the State of the Nation Address ( SONA ) . Much of it centred on the enormous security presence , including soldiers , in the Cape Town city centre , and the parliamentary precinct in particular . Then there was the interruption of President Jacob Zuma 's speech , the violent eviction of the Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) and the walkout by the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) . But what did Zuma actually say ? Judging by the first day 's SONA debate in Parliament , not many people can decipher this . Amid the uproar and heated exchanges , Zuma will wriggle out of committing to anything tangible for another year , while throwing about the obligatory “ radical ” like the F word in a rap song . By RANJENI MUNUSAMY .
It would be an interesting exercise to have President Jacob Zuma explain to South Africa in his own words what “ radical economic transformation ” is and how we should measure its implementation by government . Radical economic transformation was supposed to be the big takeaway from the 2017 SONA but since it was adopted at the ANC national conference in 2012 , it has been difficult to define and pin down .
Zuma did give a definition in his speech on Thursday :
“ What do we mean by radical socio-economic transformation ? We mean fundamental change in the structure , systems , institutions and patterns of ownership , management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans , especially the poor , the majority of whom are African and female , as defined by the governing party , which makes policy for the democratic government . ”
So how would this “ fundamental change ” come about ? The answer to that question was not in the SONA as there was nothing that was fundamentally different from anything Zuma or anyone else in government has said before . So we have no idea what exactly is starting when Zuma says :
“ Today we are starting a new chapter of radical socio-economic transformation . We are saying that we should move beyond words , to practical programmes . ”
Unfortunately the president no longer addresses press conferences so we can not ask him what he means or what will happen practically . Perhaps he might answer the question on Thursday when he responds to the debate on the SONA , or perhaps he will keep us guessing .
Zuma certainly did keep the country guessing on most of the topical issues , either restating what was said before or kicking the ball into touch .
On higher education , for example , there was no clear direction from the president to stave off further protest action and turbulence over the fees crisis . Government has to come up with an adequate response to the funding issue or another academic year could be in jeopardy .
But this is what Zuma said :
“ In the remaining years of this administration , our policies will respond directly to the following concerns that the students have placed firmly on the table :
“ Firstly , the students have expressed concern that the NSFAS threshold of R122,000 is too low . We will have to look into this matter with the view to raising the threshold on a phased basis in the period ahead .
“ Secondly , the students have pointed out that the full cost of study at some universities is higher than the subsidy that NSFAS provides . As a result , NSFAS students who study at some universities that charge higher fees end up accumulating debt . Our government-initiated processes are already looking at this issue too . ”
How long is this “ looking into ” process supposed to take and what do universities and students do in the meantime ?
On land , which is meant to be the cornerstone of radical economic transformation , Zuma said :
“ We had stated our intention of using the Expropriation Act , 1975 ( Act 63 of 1975 ) to pursue land reform and land redistribution , in line with the Constitution . I have now decided to refer the Bill back to Parliament for reconsideration on the basis that it might not pass constitutional muster . This is due to inadequate public participation during its processing . ”
He went on to say :
“ The reopening of land claims is also still on hold because the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act , 2014 ( Act 15 of 2014 ) was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court . The Constitutional Court found that the public consultation process facilitated by the NCOP and some provincial legislatures did not meet the standard set in the Constitution . ”
How is radical economic transformation starting “ today ” if government does not yet have the legislative tools to implement its land policies ?
Zuma did not even deal with critical issues such as the lack of a mechanism to distribute social grants by April 1 . All Zuma said was :
“ Government runs effective poverty alleviation programmes such as the Expanded Public Works Programme . In addition , social grants now reach close to 17-million people , mainly older persons and children . Many families would not be able to put food on the table if it were not for social grants . ”
That much is clear – hence the dire need to ensure that South Africa is not faced with a catastrophe in a month and a half .
Because so much of the SONA debate on Tuesday was focused on the sideshow of the past few days and Zuma 's long-running controversies , he is not being pinned down on his government 's programme of action and lack of tangible outcomes .
The EFF and Congress of the People are not participating in the two-day parliamentary debate . EFF leader Julius Malema told a media briefing that the speech was illegitimate and redundant , and that it was not worth their time to debate it .
DA leader Mmusi Maimane delivered a scathing 20-minute speech in which he asked Zuma if he was really so afraid of the EFF that he would steal their policies .
“ On Thursday we heard about the same old failed nine-point plan , sprinkled with a bit of stop-gap populism like land expropriation , talk of a state-owned mining house and threatening the banking sector , ” Maimane said .
“ Do n't be fooled by the language in President Zuma 's speech . His project , and that of the ANC , is the accumulation of personal wealth . ”
United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa warned that there were rising levels of anxiety and anger in the country “ with anarchy knocking at our door ” .
He proposed that the national consultative conference proposed by ANC veterans be open to all South African citizens to among other things discuss meaningful economic transformation . Holomisa said the conference should also evaluate agreements reached between the ANC and the apartheid regime .
“ Meaningful transformation , including the tranfer of land and control of the economy , will never be realised so long as those agreements ... lock the majority of citizens outside the mainstream , ” Holomisa said .
Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe acknowledged that most black people were still economically deprived and dissatisfied with the economic gains of freedom and democracy .
“ We must accelerate radical socioeconomic transformation to ensure beneficiation of the majority of black people . The ANC is unapologetic about its stance of prioritising the black majority in its transformative programmes , ” Radebe said .
KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala denied the ANC was copying the EFF 's land policies . “ The era of radical economic transformation and the pursuit of black industrialist programmes must take centre stage . ”
But the ANC and leaders in government always stop short of explaining how their goals would be implemented and do not provide time frames of what will be achieved when . It is as if they are newcomers in government and announce their intentions as if they had nothing to do with the preceding years of sluggishness and non-delivery .
Therefore DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen sliced deep when he said Zuma would never deliver on his SONA promises .
“ That 's why , when he droned on in that monotone , he put his own benches to sleep and he made this nation weep . His members slept , because they know , just as the nation knows , that he will never , ever deliver . ”
The 2017 State of the Nation Address , like the two before it , will be remembered for the commotion and sideshow in Parliament , rather than anything Zuma said . This means that government will coast along for another year based on the vague undertakings made by the president and it will be virtually impossible to pin him down on any of these .
It is only when Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan attaches funding to all these programmes in the Budget speech next week that they will start to crystallise . But implementation is still based on political will . Based on what was contained in the flagship speech last week , there is not much of that around . DM

The B.C . Lions just made their biggest acquisition of the off-season .
The CFL club acquired six-foot-2 , 255-pound defensive end Odell Willis from the Ottawa Redblacks in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the upcoming draft , as well as a player currently on B.C . 's negotiation list .
Willis had just been sent to the Redblacks from Edmonton in exchange for defensive lineman Jake Ceresna . Ottawa turned around and sent him to Vancouver .
“ This is the kind of addition to our roster that I believe our fans expect and deserve to head into this season , ” Lions general manager Ed Hervey said in a release .
“ Odell is a player who can change the complexion of a game in a single play . He makes the players around him better and he will be a significant addition to our defence this season . ”
Willis has played 155 CFL regular-season games with Calgary , Winnipeg , Saskatchewan and , most recently , Edmonton , racking up 86 career sacks , 218 tackles and 22 forced fumbles .

Ivory Coast will pay thousands of soldiers 15 million CFA francs ( $ 25,782 ) each as part of buy-outs aimed at reducing the size of its unruly and mutiny-prone military , documents showed on Monday . Africa 's fastest growing economy in 2016 , Ivory Coast was hit earlier this year by successive uprisings by low-ranking troops .
The costly bonuses paid to end the unrest helped balloon the budget deficit this year , and the episode tarnished its image as one of the continent 's rising economic stars . The government said last week that it would retire around 1,000 soldiers by the end of the year as part of efforts to bring the force – estimated at about 25,000 troops – in line with “ accepted standards ” .
A spokesman did not say last week how much the soldiers would receive under the voluntary scheme . However , a document obtained by newsmen outlining the plan stated that each retired soldier would receive a payment of 15 million CFA francs .
Neither the spokesman nor Ivory Coast 's defence minister were available to comment on Monday .

Diplomats said the move signalled that the government was beginning to implement a military reform law . According to a copy of the law seen by Reuters , 4,400 troops are to leave the army over four years .
It was not immediately clear if that figure includes soldiers already scheduled to retire during the period .
Ivory Coast 's army was thrown together from rival loyalist and rebel factions at the end of a 2011 civil war that brought President Alassane Ouattara to power after his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo rejected his defeat in a 2010 run-off election .
It remains plagued by internal divisions . Diplomats and analysts say the force is bloated with unqualified personnel and vulnerable to political manipulation .
An adviser to Parliament Speaker Guillaume Soro , considered a leading candidate to replace term-limited President Ouattara in 2020 , was arrested in October after a secret arms cache at his home helped to mutiny soldiers halt a loyalist advance .
Soro and his supporters say the charges were politically motivated .
Local pols are running away from accused pervy producer—and big Dem donor—Harvey Weinstein .
New York Sens . Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said Friday they are giving donations their campaigns received from Weinstein to charitable groups , after the movie exec was accused of harassing young female employees for decades .
“ Sen . Schumer is donating all of the contributions to several charities supporting women , ” said the Democratic politician 's spokesman , Angelo Roefaro .
Weinstein contributed $ 14,200 to Schumer campaigns dating back to the 1990s .
Gillibrand , who has been vocal in combatting sexual harassment in college campuses and in the military , announced that she is donating the $ 11,500 in contributions she received from Weinstein over the years to RAINN , the nation 's largest anti-sexual-violence group .
“ Sen . Gillibrand has received no donations from him this election cycle and will not accept any going forward , ” added the Dem 's spokesman , Glen Caplin . “ However , she will donate all the contributions she received in previous cycles to RAINN . ”
For his part , Booker , also a Democrat , said he is donating the $ 7,800 his campaign received to the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual violence , a nonprofit . Meanwhile , Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal is donating $ 5,400 from Weinstein to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence , according to BuzzFeedNews .
But so far , there has been no word from Gov . Cuomo on whether he is returning campaign donations from Weinstein . Cuomo 's campaigns have received more than $ 100,000 in contributions from Weinstein over the years , including $ 50,000 since last year .
Jon Favreau , a onetime speechwriter for former President Barack Obama , called on all Dems to give back their Weinstein donations .
“ I think he 's a horrible piece of s–t and that every Dem who took money from him should give it back , ” Favreau tweeted Friday .

MELBOURNE : Former Australia loose forward Scott Fardy has criticised Super Rugby 's governing body SANZAAR as an organisation of `` faceless men in suits '' far removed from the players on the pitch who are worried about their livelihoods .
The ACT Brumbies flanker will head overseas after the current season to play in Ireland but fired a parting shot early to the competition 's managers who have presided over a bungled expansion that will end with one Australian team and two South African sides culled for next year .
One of either the Melbourne Rebels or Western Force will be cut from the Australian conference but the final decision may be delayed further by legal action launched by the teams against the Australian Rugby Union .
Local media and pundits have slammed SANZAAR and the ARU for the protracted process that has kept players in the dark about their futures two months into the season .
But Fardy was unsurprised .
`` It 's disappointing it 's taken this long but is anyone surprised ? This is the game we 're in , it 's been like this for a long time , '' the 39-test loose forward told local media on Tuesday .
`` The officialdom in this game has always been like that .
`` Obviously everyone looks at the ARU at the moment but you would n't know who the head of SANZAAR is at any point - I would n't know what he looks like , '' Fardy said of SANZAAR CEO Andy Marinos .
`` In other sports , especially in Australia , you have a head we can look at . In SANZAAR rugby we do n't know who is running it .
`` It 's faceless men in suits in boardrooms . ''
In its statement announcing the competition 's contraction a week ago , SANZAAR defended its handling of the protracted process .
`` This has been a long and complex piece of work and we make no apology for that , '' Marinos said in the statement .
Along with Force and the Rebels , the twice champions Brumbies were the third team the ARU weighed cutting from the competition but the Canberra side 's future was confirmed last week .
Fardy sympathised with the Rebels and Force players who continue to compete with doubts over their futures . Contract talks for players at other clubs have also been held up .
`` It 's guys ' livelihoods , '' Fardy said . `` It 's incredibly tough for players to have gone through that .
`` I 'm hoping that with all that stuff we get change so we 're not having these conversations in five or 10 years ' time .
`` Hopefully we see changes for the benefit of rugby and this competition gets better from it . ''

A simple blood test has been developed that detects aggressive and potentially lethal prostate cancer by identifying rare free-ranging tumour cells .
The cells can flag up patients who have a 10-fold increased risk of dying from their disease , allowing targeted treatments to be delivered as quickly as possible .
Each year more than 40,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer . Often the disease is localised , slow growing , and relatively easy to treat .
In other cases , the cancer is much more aggressive and likely to spread or `` metastasise '' to other parts of the body , such as the bones and liver .
Spotting these dangerous cancers early on before they produce secondary tumours that show up on scans is not easy .
The new test , described in the journal Clinical Cancer Research , is said to provide a highly accurate and straightforward way to single out patients with life-threatening prostate cancer .
It identifies two specific types of circulating tumour cell ( CTC ) linked to metastasis and poor patient survival . These are tumour fragments that have broken away from the primary cancer and are travelling freely through the blood stream .
In addition the test picks up megakaryocytes , large bone marrow cells that generate platelets and appear to aid prostate cancer survival .
Lead scientist Dr Yong-Jie Lu , from Queen Mary , University of London , said : `` This work opens up a wide range of exciting opportunities to benefit cancer patients .
`` We have already started to test more patient samples and will soon move on to wider clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of the test .
`` We are also working to see if this test can be used on other types of cancer . ''
Researchers analysed blood samples from 81 prostate cancer patients using a new cell-capture technology called Parsortix , developed by the British company Angle plc .
The team found that combining the results for one of the CTCs with the standard prostate cancer blood marker PSA - Prostate Specific Antigen - predicted metastasis with 92 % accuracy . Used on its own , PSA testing is known to be highly unreliable .
A scoring system based on the test which took account of both CTC types and megakaryocytes was able to identify patients who were 10 times more likely than others to die prematurely .
Rebecca Porta , from the charity Orchid - Fighting Male Cancer , which funded the study , said : `` This is a very promising study for patients and has the potential to significantly increase the ability of clinicians to act earlier to treat those who are at a higher risk of dying earlier from their cancer .
`` Delivering more appropriate treatment more quickly could help to save lives and prolong life expectancy . ''
Dr Catherine Pickworth , science information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : `` Cancers spreading to new areas of the body is the main reason why people die from the disease .
`` This study shows a potential new way of helping to monitor this spread in men with prostate cancer . ''
The two types of circulating tumour cell are known as EMTing and EMTed CTCs . They are at different stages of a transformation process that allows them to acquire stem cell-like properties . Both have previously been notoriously difficult to capture and measure .
CAPE TOWN : South African Rugby have announced the venues for the Springboks ' three home matches in the 2018 Rugby Championship , including a fixture against world champions New Zealand in Pretoria .
The Boks will start their campaign at King 's Park in Durban when they host Argentina on Aug. 18 , before travelling to South America for the return fixture at a venue that has yet to be decided .
After matches away to Australia in Brisbane and New Zealand in Wellington , they return home to host the Wallabies at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Sept. 29 .
South Africa will finish their campaign against New Zealand at altitude at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria , where they have won their last nine tests since a 45-26 loss to the All Blacks in 2006 .
The Boks played their home Rugby Championship matches in Port Elizabeth , Bloemfontein and Cape Town in 2017 , when they finished third in the competition .
SA Rugby announced this month that the side would host England in three test matches in June , 2018 to be played in Johannesburg , Bloemfontein and Cape Town .

The Federal Government says that Nigeria 's current foreign reserves has peaked at US $ 40 billion against the previous high of US $ 24 billion in September , 2016 , an indication of the country 's economic recovery and reversal of capital flight .
The government , through the Minister of Budget and National Planning , Senator Udoma Udo Udoma , disclosed this yesterday , in Abuja , in a bid to encourage state governments to key into the Economic Recovery Growth Plan ( ERGP ) , and to ensure full participation of sub-regional governments in the Focus Labs scheduled to commence next month .
In a statement released by the Senior Special Adviser , Akpandem James , Udoma explained that the purpose of the Labs set-up was part of Government 's effort to ensure full and effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan ( ERGP ) .
“ Evidence of this is the fact that we have successfully reversed the capital flight we had been experiencing , and as a result our foreign reserves have been rising . Indeed , our foreign reserves are currently over US $ 40 billion , up from about US $ 23 billion as at September 2016 .
“ In addition , our forex markets and rates have stabilised , and our ranking in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking has moved up 24 places from 169 in 2016 to 145 in 2017 , ” he said .
Udoma added that : “ The ERGP was fashioned out to address the challenging economy which the Muhammadu Buhari inherited , as he pointed out that some positive results are already manifesting following the adoption of the ERGP , including the economy 's exit from recession in the second quarter of 2017 .
“ Furthermore , we have succeeded in reversing the rising rate of inflation , and since the first quarter of 2017 , the rate of inflation has been declining . Confidence in the economy has returned . ”
Whilst pointing out the positive trends , the Minister said more still needs to be done to achieve the ambitious targets of the ERGP , and to ensure that the benefits of the improved economic performance is felt by most Nigerians .
“ And that is why we are embarking on these Focus Labs to quicken the pace of the improvement of the economy and the achievement of the targets we have set for ourselves in the ERGP . ”
He noted that weak implementation has always been the bane of past development plans , which was why the present administration decided to set up the ERGP Implementation Unit in the Ministry to facilitate the delivery of key execution priorities of the plan . It is this Implementation Unit that is organising the Focus Labs , he added .
The Focus Labs is basically the bringing together of all relevant players : investors , both domestic and international , subject matter specialists , government officials at both Federal and State level , and other participants and stakeholders , to mobilise high impact investments for large projects that would contribute significantly to Gross Domestic Product and job-creation .
It would be a forum for private sector investors to bring forward entry-point projects they would like to invest in , and discuss with senior government officials in a closed setting .
The Minister explained that the programme is aimed at driving big , fast results in selected areas . The Labs will be starting with three key areas : Agriculture and Transport , Manufacturing and Processing , and Power and Gas , reflecting some of the execution priorities of the ERGP ; but will continue subsequently in other areas such as entertainment , services , sports and the media .
He recalled that at the last National Economic Council meeting on Thursday January 18 , 2018 , he had briefed state governors on the Labs and asked for the participation of states .
The Wednesday meeting was a follow-up engagement with representatives of states on the process .
“ It is important and critical that we work closely with the states , as most of the investments will be located in the states . In short , it is the state governments that will be hosting most of the investors . As the representatives of the states , we will be working with you to identify suitable projects that meet certain criteria such as GDP contribution , job creation , project readiness , amongst others , ” he said .
One of the targets of the ERGP , the Minister explained , is to create 15 million new jobs between 2017 and 2020 , with collaboration with several stakeholders , including the state governments , to create solutions .
The Federal Government , he said , is very keen on the job creation impact of the projects that would benefit from these Labs .
New commercial projects that commence production in the states , he added , would translate to thousands of jobs that enhance the livelihood of citizens , and lead to increase in tax revenue to state governments .

The Supreme Court made it clear . Doctors who — for religious or moral reasons — object to medically assisted dying ( MAID ) are not required to provide it . But is it acceptable for these same doctors to refuse patients who request a referral to a doctor who does administer MAID ? That 's the question at the heart of a Superior Court challenge led by the Christian Medical and Dental Society of Canada . They object to the effective referral requirements as set out by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario ( CPSO ) .The College has taken a welcome stand against patient abandonment . They say , “ an effective referral means a referral made in good faith , to a non-objecting , available , and accessible physician , nurse practitioner or agency . The referral must be made in a timely manner to allow the patient to access medical assistance in dying … ” This referral requirement strikes a reasonable balance between the physician 's right to conscientious refusal and a patient 's right to a peaceful death . It ensures that doctors who object on moral or religious grounds to providing MAID do n't stop vulnerable patients from exercising their legal right to a dignified death.The Christian Medical and Dental Society argue that simply making an effective referral implicates doctors who object to the provision of MAID . They say the requirement violates their right to conscientious refusal.Article Continued BelowThis is a questionable position for several reasons.First , providing a referral does n't assure a particular medical outcome . It does n't mean the referring physician will recommend the provision of MAID , or that it will be used by the patient.It 's inconceivable that a physician , who has as duty of care in the context of our public health-care system , would be allowed to refuse access to care for patients at a time of great need . These suffering patients are often immobile , in extreme pain , have difficulty speaking or typing . Some are not fluent in either official language . And many have considerable difficulty navigating our health care system .

Prince Charles voiced his joy Tuesday at the arrival of his third grandchild , as Britain waited to discover what Prince William and his wife Kate will call their new baby son .
Cannons were fired in London to mark the arrival of the little prince , who is fifth in line to the throne , and the bells of Westminster Abbey rang out in celebration .
The boy , weighing eight pounds and seven ounces ( 3.8 kilogrammes ) , was born at 11:01 am ( 1001 GMT ) on Monday with William present for the birth .
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left St. Mary 's Hospital in London around seven hours later , showing off their baby to the world 's media and royal fanatics camped outside .
William 's 69-year-old father Charles , the heir to the throne , said he and his wife Camilla were thrilled to have a new addition to the family .
The new baby is the younger brother of William and Kate 's children Prince George , four , and two-year-old Princess Charlotte .
“ We are both so pleased at the news , ” Charles said in a statement .
“ It is a great joy to have another grandchild . The only trouble is I do n't know how I am going to keep up with them . ”
William , 35 , and 36-year-old Kate are back at their Kensington Palace home in London .
As he left the hospital on Monday , the duke told reporters he was “ very happy , very delighted , ” adding : “ Thrice the worry now . ”
Baby name speculation
Kensington Palace said the baby 's name would be announced “ in due course ” .
Betting shops had Arthur as their favourite , followed by James , Albert , Philip , Alexander , Henry and Michael .
“ Arthur is the hot favourite at the moment , ” said Harry Aitkenhead , spokesman for bookmakers Coral .
“ James , Albert and Philip have also been backed and anything else would be a major shock . ”
Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said : “ Arthur might be the favourite with the bookies , but it 's actually James that 's the favourite with punters . ”
Official commemorative souvenirs are already on sale , despite the prince 's name being unknown .
The Royal Collection china is decorated with gold ribbons , silver pompoms and a coronet-inspired pattern .
The plates and pillboxes bear the words : “ Welcome to our new royal baby . ”
The birth was marked Tuesday by bell ringing at London 's Westminster Abbey , where William and Kate were married in 2011 in a ceremony watched by up to two billion people worldwide .
They rang “ a full peal of Cambridge Surprise Royal ” , the abbey said .
The birth was also to be celebrated with a 41-gun salute in London 's Hyde Park , while 62 rounds were fired near the Tower of London .
Britain 's overseas territories were also celebrating , with a 21-gun salute due to be fired in Gibraltar and a single round gun salute and rifle volley planned in Bermuda .
A briefing note from August shows Hajdu had already directed the department to come up with the new employer declaration to ensure funding went to groups with `` mandates that are consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and court decisions . '' Hajdu needed to approve the final wording before the fall , the note said .
Her department crafted several pages of legal advice , all of it blocked from release on the grounds of solicitor-client privilege .
The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada , meanwhile , was getting only radio silence from Hajdu 's office .
`` We did n't know what was really going on , '' said Joyce Arthur , the coalition 's executive director .
`` Then , in December , they suddenly announced this attestation requirement . At the time we did n't really know why they chose that solution , but we thought , 'Whatever works . ' ``
The new requirements appeared to come out of nowhere , said one government official , who described initial political trepidation about the eligibility rules .
Faith-based groups howled in protest , saying they violated religious and free-speech rights . Hajdu and Liberal MPs defended the wording of the declaration .
One Toronto-area Liberal MP wrote to a complainant , saying that while individuals could disagree with the declaration , `` freedom of religion is an individual right and is not something which can be superimposed on an organization . ''
Religious leaders who met with Hajdu in late March left with the impression there might be some movement on the wording , but a government official said Hajdu only agreed to a review and gave no hint that the language dealing specifically with reproductive rights would be removed .
Hajdu said Thursday she is looking to clarify language in the application form and guide that clears up concerns from groups and lets the government meet its policy objectives .
In the meantime , Arthur 's organization plans to pore over the full list of this year 's employers to see if any of the hundreds of groups in their database have been approved for funding .
Hajdu also said the department is working with employers who are concerned that increases in provincial minimum wages in provinces like Ontario may force them to cut back on hours offered to summer students .

Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar , widely regarded as one of the world 's best batsman , turns 45 on Tuesday . So does the former Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming.As the country recalled and celebrated their favourite memories of the cricketing legend Sachin , it was a video posted by Cricket Australia that has left several Sachin fans fuming on the microblogging site Twitter.The video shows the Aussie pacer Damien Fleming getting Sachin out clean bowled with an inswinger in an ODI in Perth during the 2000 Carlton & United Series.Unimpressed by their tongue-in-cheek humour , Indian fans hit back at Cricket Australia . `` I believe , Aussie 's are doing ball tampering from long time ago . Only it came into picture with proof this year . You are lucky @ bowlologist as you did n't get caught , Happy birthday ... '' wrote one irked fan.However , there were many who took the Tendulkar dismissal video sportingly.Interestingly , the 48-year-old Damien Fleming is currently in India , enjoying his commentating stint in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) matches .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - AstraZeneca has clinched two new deals with Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent as the British drugmaker steps up its drive to expand business in China .
China is now the world 's second-largest drugs market behind the United States and is a particular bright spot for AstraZeneca , accounting for 15 percent of its drug sales -- a far higher proportion than at other big pharmaceutical companies .
AstraZeneca 's sales in China grew 30 percent in the last quarter of 2017 and Chief Executive Pascal Soriot expects them to continue to increase at a “ low-20s ” percentage rate .
The new strategic partnership with Ali Health , a subsidiary company of Alibaba , aims to deliver new smart health services driven by the Internet and artificial intelligence to help patients find and stay on the right medicines .
The deal with Tencent , meanwhile , involves the development of online tracking systems to fight counterfeit medicines -- a common problem in China .
Both deals were announced on Friday , alongside AstraZeneca 's full-year results . [ nL8N1PS1G6 ]
“ Overall , these agreements will drive better health outcomes and ... better utilization of our drugs , ” said Chief Executive Pascal Soriot .
The tech tie-ups come two months after AstraZeneca created a new drug development joint venture with a state-backed private equity fund in China , designed to help get new drugs to market more quickly . [ nL8N1NW07Y ]
AstraZeneca is in a strong position in China after recently having had five new products added to the National Reimbursement Drug List - Onglyza for diabetes , cancer drugs Iressa and Faslodex , heart medicine Brilinta and antipsychotic treatment Seroquel .

The Accountant-General of the Federation , Ahmed Idris , has noted that the quality of leadership provided by President Muhammadu Buhari , which he described as rare courage and political will , is a major reason for the successes so far achieved by the Treasury Single Account policy implementation .
The AGF made this disclosure during his welcome address at the opening of a two-day retreat on the one year of the TSA implementation , the benefits , challenges and way forward , being organised by his office at the International Conference Centre , Abuja from February 14 to 15 , 2017 .
Highlighting the successes of the TSA , Idris revealed that N5.244 trillion has so far been realized as inflows in the TSA account following the moping-up and direct debits of accounts by the Central Bank of Nigeria .
Idris further said that TSA has eliminated multiple banking arrangements in the Ministries , Departments and Agencies and resulted in the consolidation of over 200,000 bank accounts , which were spread in Deposit Money Banks across the country .
TSA has equally brought transparency , effective tracking of Government revenue as well as blocked leakages and abuse in management of Government finances
“ TSA implementation has taken us out of the era of indiscriminate borrowings by MDAS and saved Government charges associated with borrowing , which amounted to about N4.7 billion prior to full implementation of TSA , ” the AGF said .
Furthermore , Idris revealed that given the considerable gains so far recorded in the TSA implementation , there was need to evaluate the programme and come up with the best ways of improving the policy , which is the reason for the retreat .

He gave the assurance that government was considering going beyond the Cash Management of TSA to explore other viable economic options of resource utilization and deployment , especially in this era of economic recession .
In a speech to declare open the retreat , the Acting President , Prof. Yemi Osibanjo , represented by the Special Adviser on Economic Affairs , Dr. Adeyemi Dipelu , congratulated the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation and its partners , particularly the IMF and the World Bank , for their successful implementation of the TSA .
Osinbajo underscored the importance of the TSA scheme as being instrumental to the efficient management of public finances and pledged Government 's commitment towards ensuring improvement in the implementation of the programme .
The Minister of Finance , Kemi Adeosun , highlighted the benefits of the TSA , saying that it has enhanced greater opportunity in exercising better control over the financial base of MDAs and allowed for critical decisions to be made .
Adeosun explained that attempts are being made to expand the scheme by engaging statutory cooperations to come on board in order to adopt the scheme , but identified the major challenge as the uncooperative attitude of some Deposit Money Banks , which are still keeping some government funds in their custody .
She however said that Government has been engaging them on the need to transfer funds without identity to the TSA and for the recalcitrant ones , government was making efforts to engage auditors to keep a tab on such funds .
There were presentations from the Managing Director of Access Bank , Herbert Wigwe , and the representative of the Anambra State Governor , Willie Obiano , and syndicate sessions , which provided the platform for brainstorming on the way forward .

Cardiff City struck twice late on through Lee Tomlin and Joe Bennett to salvage a point as the Championship title challengers recovered from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Reading on Monday .
REUTERS : Cardiff City struck twice late on through Lee Tomlin and Joe Bennett to salvage a point as the Championship title challengers recovered from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Reading on Monday .
Second-placed Cardiff have 44 points from 21 games and now trail leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers by four points .
Visiting defender Callum Paterson put the ball into his own net in the 16th minute after misjudging a corner and Jaap Stam 's Reading doubled their lead four minutes before halftime with a deflected Mo Barrow shot from the edge of the area .
Frustrated Cardiff manager Neil Warnock was sent to the stands after 77 minutes for appearing to complain to the fourth official about decisions going against his side but with defeat looking likely they managed to claw their way into the match .
Bennett halved the deficit with a volley in the 83rd minute before close-season signing Tomlin 's late strike hit the underside of the bar and landed over the line .
The ball had bounced back out of the goal but referee Steve Martin gave it after being informed by goal-line technology .

BARCELONA : The man who aims to end the 28-year career of the head of Spanish football is counting on the support of smaller clubs that he says have been neglected as elite soccer thrives .
Miguel Angel Galan , who runs a soccer coaching company and has never held office in sports administration , is a fierce critic of Angel Maria Villar whom he hopes to unseat as president of the national association , RFEF , at an election .
Galan says he will set a term limit of eight years for future presidents , increase the number of women on RFEF 's board from the current one , and plough funding into smaller clubs .
Although Spanish soccer has thrived at elite level under 67-year-old Villar , with the national team winning the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 and their first World Cup in 2010 as well as numerous triumphs for the country 's big clubs in European competition , Galan believes it needs serious reform .
`` I 'm the candidate for lower league soccer . Lower league clubs have been abandoned and they need a bailout . We ca n't make any future plans without rescuing them , '' Galan told Reuters .
His plan to topple Villar will depend on the votes of the 600 clubs in the lower rungs of Spanish soccer to whom he is promising a subsidy of 50,000 euros ( 42,539 pounds ) each .
The president is elected by an absolute majority of the 140 members of the RFEF general assembly which includes 120 members representing the clubs , players , referees and managers/coaches , who in turn are elected by the federation 's ordinary members .
GOAL-LINE TECHNOLOGY
Galan also wants La Liga to join the Bundesliga , Premier League , Serie A and Ligue 1 in installing goal-line technology , an issue which came under the spotlight after Barcelona were denied a clear goal in a 1-1 draw with Real Betis last month .
The election is set to take place on May 22 , with ex-RFEF general secretary Jorge Perez running as the third candidate .
Galan has been involved in a series of legal disputes against Villar in the last 12 months , the most recent centring on accusations that Villar misappropriated government funds donated to build a soccer school in Haiti after its devastating earthquake in 2011 .
The RFEF returned the donated sum , 1.2 million euros ( US $ 1.27 million ) plus 300,000 euros in interest , to the sports ministry last month . A judge is yet to determine whether the case should go to court .
`` He 's doing a lot of damage to Spanish football , '' Galan said .
An RFEF spokesman speaking on behalf of Villar declined to comment on the accusations made by Galan in this interview .
TOO LONG
Villar has sat on the executive committee of world soccer 's governing body FIFA since 1998 . He was fined 25,000 Swiss francs ( US $ 25,000 ) in 2015 by FIFA 's Ethics Committee for failing to co-operate with an investigation into the contest to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups .
Last year he stood as a candidate to succeed disgraced UEFA president Michel Platini but withdrew days before the election , saying he made the decision after being asked by representatives of Spanish soccer to stand for re-election to RFEF .
It is not the first time Galan has taken on a powerful football figure . In 2014 he complained about Zinedine Zidane being put in charge of Real Madrid 's reserve side without completing his coaching badges .
The Frenchman , now in charge of Real 's first team , was barred from coaching for three months .
Galan said he felt compelled to run for Spanish soccer 's top job after Villar 's clumsy response to the death of a Deportivo La Coruna supporter in clashes with Atletico Madrid fans in November 2014 .
While La Liga and Spain 's sports ministry launched initiatives to combat hooliganism , Galan says Villar did nothing .
`` We had a case as important as the death of a person , and the president of Spanish soccer says nothing , takes no measures and does nothing on the subject , '' Galan said .
`` It all contributed to me deciding to run for president . We ca n't keep Villar in the job for 28 years , it 's too long for any mandate . People want a change and I 'm the only one who has taken on Villar . ''

“ Vanderpump Rules ” star Stassi Schroeder did n't expect to be celebrating her four-year anniversary by herself .
On Saturday , the Bravo personality revealed that on-and-off boyfriend Patrick Meagher had called it quits ahead of a planned Mexican getaway .
“ Broken up with on our anniversary after I planned a trip for us to Mexico . Call me Carrie Bradshaw , ” the Bravo star posted Saturday on Twitter . “ @ rachelnobrien you 're coming w me now . ”
Though Schroeder , 29 , did n't divulge details of the split , she made clear she was n't going to let the trip go to waste .
“ Currently… . @ rachaelnobrien , will you accompany me to Mexico , close the shades & feed me oatmeal on the trip I planned ? If I see any ❤ s–t , I may die , ” Schroeder wrote on Instagram , alongside a photo of a jilted Carrie Bradshaw ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) who — spoiler alert — lashed out at Mr. Big ( Chris Noth ) for being a runaway groom in the first “ Sex and the City ” movie . With the help of Bradshaw 's friends , the would-be honeymoon is turned into a girls ' getaway .
While Schroeder 's romance with Meagher was n't a prominent “ Vanderpump ” plot line , she had no issue dishing about their troubles , especially on her “ Straight Up with Stassi ” podcast .
“ Because we 've broken up and gotten back together so many times , it was like : ‘ We ca n't do this pattern anymore , this routine of breaking up and getting back together every month , ” Schroeder told People in November . “ I ca n't do it . Like , I ca n't . ' ”
Schroeder , who previously dated co-star Jax Taylor , 38 , joked in February she was not “ emotionally stable enough ” for Valentine 's Day .
A housing development company has purchased the former Canadian Tire lot on Colborne Street that has been vacant for several years .
The buyer is Cachet Estate Homes , of Concord , Ont .
`` This is exciting news , '' Ward 5 Coun . Brian Van Tilborg said in a response to a question from from The Expositor . `` It 's been a priority of Ward 5 Coun . David Neumann and myself to see this large infill property be developed .
`` We are frequently asked , 'When is something going to happen on the old Canadian Tire ? ' ''
Interest in the site began heating up last year after city staff were asked to make marketing the property a priority , Van Tilborg said .
`` Coun . Neumann worked hard for this property to be front and centre for revitalization , '' Van Tilborg said .
Neumann said he is optimistic about the prospects for the development .
' I 'm hoping they come forward with a good proposal to redevelop the land , '' he told Expositor reporter Michael-Allan Marion .
Van Tilborg said the development will be welcomed by the neighbourhood , which includes Pauline Johnson Collegiate and the new Kiwanis Field sports complex .
`` I know the local businesses in the area are going to be happy with the development and new families coming to the area are going to have Kiwanis Field right next door for the children to use . ''
Cachet Estate Homes has housing developments in Beamsville , Brampton , Streetsville , Mississauga , Orangeville and Thornhill .

On Sunday 's `` Last Week Tonight , '' John Oliver harshly condemned President Trump for his response to the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Va. , this weekend .
`` It 's the kind of tragedy that calls for true leadership from whoever is in the Oval Office , '' Oliver said .
And as far as Oliver is concerned , that 's not what happened .
In brief remarks Saturday , Trump claimed there was bigotry and hatred `` on many sides '' -- a statement that immediately drew criticism across the political spectrum . ( Trump delivered another statement Monday morning , directly condemning hate groups and vowing that `` justice will be delivered . '' )
`` There honestly are n't that many instances in modern American politics where you can honestly think , 'That guy really should have mentioned the Nazis , ' but this is emphatically one of them , '' Oliver said , arguing that Trump had made `` a wild false equivalence between Nazis and people who oppose Nazis . ''
The comedian said there is a reason Trump enjoys vocal support among white nationalists such as David Duke , who said on Saturday that `` we 're going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump . ''
`` Nazis are a lot like cats . If they like you , it 's probably because you 're feeding them , '' said Oliver , also noting that Trump dodged repeated questions about his support among the racist groups at the rally .
`` It simply does n't get easier than disavowing Nazis , '' Oliver said , describing it as a `` presidential gim me '' like pardoning a turkey . `` It is almost impossible to screw up . ''
`` Incredibly , in a country where previous presidents have actually had to defeat Nazis , '' he concluded , `` we now have one who can not even be bothered to ... condemn them . ''
Elsewhere in the episode , Oliver took a closer look ( warning : the episode contains explicit language ) at another one of this week 's ominous headlines , escalating tensions with North Korea . Bonus ? He tapped `` Weird Al '' Yankovic for a new ode to the escalating threat of a nuclear attack .
KUALA LUMPUR : A five-month-old boy who was reported missing was found dead at the home of his babysitter in Taman Nakhoda , Batu Caves on Tuesday night ( Jul 3 ) .

A post mortem revealed that he suffered from internal bleeding in the brain and a cracked skull , Selangor 's criminal investigation unit chief said .
`` Adam Rayqal 's death was caused by head injuries due to blunt force trauma , '' said Senior Assistant Commissioner Fadzil Ahmat .
He added that police are still looking into a motive behind the baby 's death .
The 33-year-old babysitter and her housemate , aged 36 , have been detained . The case has been classified as murder .

The boy 's disappearance went viral on Facebook on Tuesday after the father , 28-year-old Mohd Sufi Naeif Mohd Fauzi , uploaded a picture of the baby and asked for the public 's help to locate him .
The baby 's mother , 28-year-old Farah Madiha Othman , realised that her child was missing when she went to pick him up from the babysitter 's house at 7pm .
The babysitter claimed that an unknown individual had run off with the boy . However , police decided to search the house after they found inconsistencies in the babysitter 's statement , reported Malaysian media .
Gombak police chief Ali Ahmad said the victim was stuffed in a green bag . He was fully clothed and wearing a napkin .
`` The discovery of the victim was based on information provided by the caretaker during questioning which raised suspicions .
`` However , an initial examination on the boy found no injuries and the body was sent to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital for post-mortem , '' he told reporters earlier in the day .
According to the Star , Deputy Women , Family and Community Development minister Hannah Yeoh visited the mortuary where the body of the baby was brought for a post mortem .
She said the ministry would issue a statement on the matter after it receives the post mortem report .
“ Would you like a bag ? ”
Considering I had just spent £120 on a pair of shoes for my 14-year-old son , the shop assistant 's question was the least of my worries .
For that amount of cash , I did n't ' just want a bag , I wanted my path to the shop exit sprinkled with rose petals . The staff could also form a guard of honour , piping me to the doors before carrying me on their shoulders to my car . If that 's not too much to ask .
I do n't really want to talk about the amount of cash I am forced to spend on my offspring . Particularly as I feel as if I 'm paying for the privilege of turning my son into a walking billboard for sportswear manufacturers .
North Face seems particularly popular . Though I do n't think my glum teenage son dragging his heels around a retail park is that good an advert for a mountaineer clothing company . Sour Face would be more apt .
“ That 'll be 5p , ” the shop assistant said . “ For the bag . ”
Such is the odd state of play in society today , I found it easier to part with the £120 for a pair of monstrous trainers than 5p for a plastic bag .
I balked at the bag . As I 've said before , buying a plastic bag when shopping is the modern equivalent of a billionaire tycoon lighting his cigar with a ten dollar bill . It 's a sign that you have more money than sense .
Obviously there are environmental concerns . That said , with the masses of plastic detritus floating in our seas and rivers , creatures will eventually adapt to their new polluted surroundings .
Evolution will ensure that fish and sea mammals will learn to use the rubbish we have dumped in our waterways . Just as the giraffe evolved a long neck to nibble food from the highest branches , so in years to come will lobsters evolve nimble fingers to carry their young in plastic Aldi shopping bags .
Nature will probably ensure sharks evolve sensitive lips too so they can pucker up and use the millions of straws we 've chucked in the waves . Sharks will continue to roam the seas ripping humans apart with their great gaping jaws , but in years to come they also then whip out a straw with their specially evolved gripping fin before slurping up the blood and body goo with the straws . Nature always finds a way .
This , of course , is going to take some years . A few million Darwin reckoned .
In the meantime , it 's probably best to limit our plastic bag use .
I 've taken to wearing trousers with specially designed pockets . They are extra large pockets , about the depth of a typical shopping bag .
It means that , should I forget my bag for life to collect my shopping , I can use the giant pockets in my strides .
The only awkward part of these wonder consumer pockets , is when the check out lady asks : “ Do you need a hand with your packing ? ” I always answer ‘ Yes ' . Raising my arms in the air and crying “ Fill her up ! ”
They then pay the 5p themselves ... and hand me a plastic bag . It 's known as a win win .
U.S. marshals on Wednesday served a subpoena on former Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon to compel her to appear before a U.S. Senate subcommittee on June 5 on efforts to protect athletes from abuse , a committee spokesman said .
WASHINGTON : U.S. marshals on Wednesday served a subpoena on former Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon to compel her to appear before a U.S. Senate subcommittee on June 5 on efforts to protect athletes from abuse , a committee spokesman said .
Simon , who resigned from Michigan State in January , and Steve Perry from USA Gymnastics were criticized for not doing enough to halt abuse by former doctor Larry Nassar , who was convicted last year of molesting gymnasts and was sentenced to an effective life term in prison .

It is extremely unusual for a congressional committee to resort to issuing subpoenas – and even more unusual to be forced to take the step of asking the U.S . Marshals Service to serve a subpoena to compel an appearance .
Witnesses can assert the right not to answer questions if they fear the answers could be used against them in a potential criminal prosecution .
A lawyer for Perry , who resigned in March 2017 , accepted a subpoena on his behalf , said spokesman Frederick Hill of the Senate Commerce panel that has been investigating abuse of athletes . Simon was served with a subpoena in Traverse City , Michigan , Hill said .
A lawyer for Simon did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

A third former official , Rhonda Faehn , who was the women 's programme director of USA Gymnastics and was dismissed earlier this month , has also been called and agreed to testify , Hill said .
It was not immediately clear who is representing Perry or Faehn .
Earlier this month , hundreds of women sexually abused by Nassar tentatively agreed to a US $ 500 million ( £376.5 million ) settlement with Michigan State University .
Kerry Perry , chief executive of USA Gymnastics since December , last week apologised to hundreds of female athletes who were sexually abused by Nassar and told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee hearing that `` those days are over . ''

Paris : In his first seven months in office , President Emmanuel Macron has faced little opposition . But on Sunday , the once-dominant Republicans , now the biggest opposition party in parliament , elected a new leader they hope will recover their voice .
The conservatives ' ambitious new chief , 42-year old Laurent Wauquiez , is a hard-hitting critic of the 39-year-old centrist president , whom he dismisses as out of touch with rural France , weak on security and too much in favour of closer European integration .
Wauquiez wants the party to pull its weight after months when internal divisions and the shock from failing to make the run-off in this year 's presidential election held them back .
“ Tonight , the Right is back ! ” he told supporters . “ France needs the Right because the president of the Republic ( Macron ) is passive against crime ... and not firm enough against radical Islam , ” said Wauquiez , who wants to relaunch the Republicans by taking them further to the right .
He won an overwhelming mandate with three quarters of the near 100,000 votes cast by party members on Sunday . Wauquiez bills himself as the champion of small-town , rural France — a France , he says , with which Macron has no connection as he pursues a “ start-up nation ” .
While there are few policy parallels between the two men , Wauquiez and Macron actually have some traits in common . Both are younger than French political leaders usually are and are graduates from the country 's top elite schools who promise to shake up the political establishment .
Inside Macron 's camp , some ministers have cautioned against underestimating the threat of Wauquiez . “ We need to be wary because he is very gifted , very strong and there 's nothing he wo n't do . He will establish a violent fight , ” Gerald Darmanin , Macron 's budget minister and former member of the Republicans , told the newspaper Le Monde .
But Wauquiez 's main challenge may well come from within . He inherits a party divided in its response both to Macron 's poaching of party stalwarts and economic policy that encroaches on its turf . Moderate veterans , ill at ease with his wooing of far-right National Front voters , have warned they could leave the party if he does not water down his hardline views .
And opinion polls show he is not popular with voters overall . Both far-left ‘ France Unbowed ' leader Jean-Luc Melenchon and far-right National Front chief Marine Le Pen have so far been viewed as stronger opponents to Macron , polls have shown . “ Now the hard part begins , ” said Jean-Daniel Levy , head of Harris Interactive pollsters .
Wauquiez has time to turn the party around . French voters will next go to the polls only in 2019 , for the European parliament election . The next presidential and parliamentary elections will be in 2022 .

Lawmakers for the European Union have announced an investigation after allegations user data of 50 million Facebook accounts were misused .
The investigation comes after Christopher Wylie , a whistle-blower who worked for data analytics company Cambridge Analytica , said on Saturday data of the 50 million users were harvested without their knowledge or consent .
Antonio Tajani , president of the European Parliament , said on Twitter the allegations , if true , constitute “ an unacceptable violation of our citizens ' privacy rights ” .
“ The European Parliament will investigate fully , calling digital platforms to account , ” he said .
The UK 's Information Commissioner 's Office , which concerns itself with privacy and data protection , reiterated on Monday it is also investigating the issue .
“ A full understanding of the facts , data flows and data uses is imperative for my ongoing investigation . This includes any new information , statements or evidence that have come to light in recent days , ” Elizabeth Denham , information commissioner , said .
“ This is a complex and far reaching investigation for my office and any criminal or civil enforcement actions arising from it will be pursued vigorously . ”
On Friday , the New York Times and London Observer broke a story about how Cambridge Analytica paid for illegally obtained personal information of 50 million Facebook users .
The company , which worked on Donald Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign and the pro-Brexit campaign as a consultant , then used that information to build a software program which could target potential swing voters , the newspapers found .
Cambridge Analytica allegedly got the data of the 50 million people from Aleksandr Kogan , a Russian-American researcher .
He built an app called ‘ thisisyourdigitallife ' that collected data for “ academic research ” .
However , the app not only collected personal information of the people who downloaded the app and consented to having their data used , but also of unknowing friends , according to the newspapers ' investigation .
Cambridge Analytica , who paid Kogan 's company and to build the app , was then able to create highly detailed profiles of 50 million people .
That data was subsequently used for several political campaigns , among them Trump 's and Ted Cruz 's presidential runs , as well as the Brexit campaign in the UK .
According to the Facebook terms of services , the sale of information to third parties is not allowed .
As a result of the news , Facebook shares have plummeted .
The company said in a response all parties involved , including the whistle-blower Wylie , had been suspended fpending an internal investigation .
Facebook , whose headquarters are based in Ireland , added on Saturday the data gathered were not the result of a breach , but that people knowingly provided their information and no sensitive pieces of information were stolen .
Cambridge Analytica has claimed in a statement that it did not use the gathered data for its work with the Trump presidential campaign and that has followed Facebook 's terms of services .
Funding for Cambridge Analytica came from former White House adviser Steve Bannon and hedge-fund financiers Robert and Rebekah Mercer , who supported the Trump campaign .
Brighton and Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton is worried about the number of goals his team is conceding and has urged his players to learn the lessons of their last two games ahead of Wednesday 's trip to Tottenham Hotspur .
REUTERS : Brighton and Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton is worried about the number of goals his team is conceding and has urged his players to learn the lessons of their last two games ahead of Wednesday 's trip to Tottenham Hotspur .
After a promising start to the campaign , Brighton have lost three and drawn two of their last five league games , conceding 10 goals in the process to slip to 13th in the table .
A 5-1 defeat at the hands of Liverpool was followed last Saturday by a 2-0 loss at Huddersfield Town and the Brighton defence is likely to get another through examination at Spurs .
`` Probably the conceding , '' Hughton said when asked by reporters about his biggest worry on Monday .
`` Even as regards to our goal difference , we were fairly respectable but over a two-game period , we 've conceded seven goals . The manner of the goals we conceded were disappointing and a concern .
`` As with everything , they are the challenges and if we thought we 've done something poor in the last game we have to make sure we do better in the next one . ''

Champions Chelsea is the only team to have beaten Tottenham at Wembley in the league this season but Hughton is hopeful that Brighton can snap their poor run at his former club .
`` I suppose it shows how well we have started in our levels , the fact that we 've lost two on the bounce and we 're looking at it as a difficult period , '' Hughton said .
`` In this division you 've got to show that you accept what the division is , that you 've learned from it , and you do your best in the next game . ''

NEW DELHI : Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke were removed by the country 's top court on Monday for not complying with its order to implement administrative reforms within the body .
The Court accepted in July most of the recommendations of a three-member panel it had set up to look into the operations of the world 's richest cricket board .
The BCCI rejected a few of the recommendations made by the panel headed by former chief justice R.M . Lodha , which also included age and tenure restrictions for top officials , as well as banning them from serving successive terms .
`` One should understand that once the order of the Supreme Court , the highest court of the land , has come it has to be obeyed by all ... nobody can escape it , '' Lodha told reporters after the verdict .
`` Being at the helm of affairs , if they were not able to implement the Supreme Court order , these consequences were bound to follow and that 's what has happened .
`` Administrators come and administrators go but ultimately it 's for the benefit of the game and the game will flourish , I 'm very sure . ''
Shirke said he was yet to read the order but was ready to step down .
`` If the highest court of the land wants me to leave , I 'd leave happily , I have no issues , '' he told CNN News18 channel from London .
`` We have to see that the BCCI , in its new form , continues to do well , cricket flourishes and India is able to maintain its position in global cricket . ''

A British court has sentenced the man who carried out a deadly vehicle ramming attack near a mosque in London last year to life in prison .
In June , Darren Osborne killed one worshipper and wounded several others in the Finsbury Park area of North London while the area was busy with worshippers leaving late evening prayers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
On Friday , a judge sentenced Osborne to a minimum 43-year prison term after he was found guilty of murder and attempted murder the previous day .
During the trial , jurors heard how Osborne had intended to attack a march celebrating ‘ Jerusalem Day ' earlier on June 18 but was unable to .
The 48-year-old from the Welsh city of Cardiff then drove around the English capital until he settled on the target in Finsbury Park just before midnight .
A group of worshippers had gathered around 51-year-old grandfather Makram Ali , who had collapsed , when Osborne drove his vehicle into the group , killing Ali .
Witnesses told the court that Osborne shouted : “ I 've done my job , ” before being caught and restrained by passersby while trying to escape .
In court , he had attempted to defend himself against the charges of murder and attempted murder by claiming that an accomplice named Dave had taken his place in the driver 's seat during the attack .
However , he was unable to provide an explanation as to why CCTV footage showed only one person in the car .
Sue Hemming from the British Crown Prosecution Service said Osborne was motivated by his “ hatred of Muslims ” .
“ He later invented an unconvincing story to counter the overwhelming weight of evidence , but the jury has convicted him , ” she said .
“ We have been clear throughout that this was a terrorist attack , and he must now face the consequences of his actions . ”

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday he was confident his government 's one-seat majority was safe , despite questions over his deputy 's citizenship which could disqualify him from parliament .
SYDNEY : Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday he was confident his government 's one-seat majority was safe , despite questions over his deputy 's citizenship which could disqualify him from parliament .
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said earlier on Monday that he may not be eligible for parliament after being told he may be a dual citizen of Australia and New Zealand .
The New Zealand government later said Joyce held New Zealand citizenship by descent as his father was born in New Zealand .
Australian politicians are not eligible to be elected to parliament if they hold dual or plural citizenship , a rule that has forced the resignation of two senators in recent weeks .
Turnbull 's one-seat majority would be eliminated if Joyce was forced from office , likely triggering an election , political analysts said .
Joyce said he has asked Australia 's High Court to decide the matter .

`` The government is the very confident the court will not find that the member for New England is to be disqualified from the Parliament . Very confident , '' Turnbull told parliament .
Opposition Labor MP Tony Burke told parliament Joyce should stand aside from the ministry and the government should not accept his vote .
`` We 've never before in this parliament ... had to go to the High Court and say : 'Look , we 're not really sure if there 's a majority government in this country ' , '' he said .
Joyce said he would not resign or temporarily step down from office after being told by Australian Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue that he would likely be cleared by the High Court .
`` Neither I nor my parents have ever had any reason to believe that I may be a citizen of any other country , '' he said .
Joyce 's mother was Australian and his father was born in New Zealand and came to Australia in 1947 as a British subject .
If Joyce was disqualified , Turnbull would be forced to rely on the support of independents to prevent a successful no- confidence vote from the opposition Labor Party .
`` I think if Joyce is forced out , Turnbull would call an election , '' said Peter Chen , a senior lecturer in government at the University of Sydney .
Recent polls suggest Turnbull would lose an early election , with his government bleeding support to the populist far-right One Nation party , while moderates have flocked to Labor as Turnbull struggles to deliver on his progressive reputation .

For his spring/summer 2018 show , designer Anthony Vaccarello sent models down a vast , open-air runway on the Trocadéro in a sexy , decadent mix of leather , sequins and ostrich feathers . Backlit by the sparkling Eiffel Tower , it was a sight that neither editors nor the audience alike—comprising the likes of Courtney Love , Lenny Kravitz , and Chloë Sevigny—will soon forget . It was all the more poignant given the passing of Yves Saint Laurent 's partner Pierre Bergé just weeks before . “ I really wanted to pay homage to him , ” Vaccarello told Vogue after the show . “ To Yves Saint Laurent , to the house . Even if it 's a cliché , I want to push the cliché so far it 's beautiful . ”

When Dior set up fashion day camp in California in May , it raised the bar—and several gargantuan tents . Artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri shuttled guests including Rihanna , Charlize Theron and Demi Moore to her debut Cruise collection show in the dusty Santa Monica Mountains , where scenes from Gone With the Wind and Little House on the Prairie were filmed . Referencing the feminist shamanic healer Vicki Noble and author of Women Who Run With the Wolves , Clarissa Pinkola Estés , the show took place in the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve in Calabasas . Dior Sauvage hot air balloons settled and the label 's lettering stood out from mountainous backdrop in homage to the infamous Hollywood sign . Campfires burned , drums banged and gold dust woman Solange Knowles later performed to the tune of green juice and vodka .

He 's a Belgian man in New York . Debuting his first women 's wear collection for the label—and also its first dual-gender show—here was the genius behind invigorating turnarounds at both Jil Sander in Milan and Dior in Paris , pitching up to play for one of the biggest names on team America . His audience heaved with A-list fans from Millie Bobby Brown and Brooke Shields , to Julianne Moore and Naomie Harris . They sat in an artwork by Sterling Ruby , while David Bowie 's “ This is Not America ” hauntingly played about them as a new Americana style pioneered before them ( both on the catwalk and in the wider country , with Trump 's inauguration ) . Simons instigated a new life into the label and seemed more than satisfied . Taking a run through his myriad of catwalks at the show 's finale , he blew kisses with longstanding right-hand man and new creative director Pieter Mulier .

Chanel presents around a rocket
Chanel 's autumn/winter 2017 show was a case of Karl Lagerfeld meets Carl Sagan , with a space-themed show staged in Paris 's Grand Palais . Lagerfeld took his audience to infinity and beyond , with silver pearl-encrusted headbands and glitter boots that came back down to earth as a street style favourite . But the piece de resistance was a life-sized Chanel-branded rocket in the middle of the room . At the finale Lagerfeld and a mini mascot took a spin around the foot of the rocket , where smoke bubbled and engines roared . A button was pushed , a recorded countdown began , sparks flew , “ Rocket Man ” played , and then we actually had lift off . Mario Testino held his camera up , mesmerised , and Cara Delevingne could n't have clapped any faster . It was thoroughly out of this fashion world .

Her sister , Bella , stepped up to the job of Princess Charming , providing a shoulder for Gigi—who wore an Almost Famous-inspired outfit—to hang on to . In sisterly solidarity , they buoyantly closed the spring/summer 2018 show to the tune of The Beatles ' “ Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds ” and ample applause . Bella could sympathise : last September she took a high-heeled fall from grace at Michael Kors .

Motocross drivers had spun stunts atop mountains of sparkling pink sand , but when closing her Fenty X Puma spring/summer 2018 show , Rihanna was of course the real star . Most designers opt for a modest bow to finish a show , but instead , the singer-turned-designer channelled her inner girl racer , hanging off the back of a motorbike driven by a helmet-hidden man . With sunglasses on , hair in a topknot and wearing athletica with flare-heeled , racer-striped boots , she was clearly enjoying herself . Royally cruising past the whooping crowd , she blew kisses and playfully stuck out her tongue , before driving off further into her Instagram Live .

Britain 's `` deep social mobility problem '' is getting worse for young people , a former cabinet minister has said after research found that 51 % of 18 to 24-year-olds believe social background determines chances of success in life .
Alan Milburn , chairman of the Social Mobility Commission , said young people `` feel like they are on the wrong side of a profound unfairness '' in society .
The Government advisory body 's findings , based on a poll of almost 5,000 people by YouGov , conducted before the General Election , showed that 40 % of those aged 65 and over also thought a person 's background and family was the main factor in where they end up in society .
Less than a third of those surveyed - 32 % - believed everyone has a fair chance in life regardless of their background .
According to the research , 30 % of young people thought it was becoming easier to move up in British society , and a fifth believed they have a better job security than their parents .
It also found that 49 % identified as working class , while 23 % who said that they grew up in a working class family thought their social background had held them back in their working life .
Only 1 % of people said they were upper class .
The poll pointed to a geographical divide , with 71 % claiming there were `` fairly or very '' large differences in opportunity depending on where a person lives .
People in Scotland , Wales and the North East were the most likely to think that such differences exist .
The research also found that more than three-quarters ( 76 % ) thought that poorer people have less opportunity to go to a top university , and 66 % thought poorer people have less of a chance of a professional career .
Former Labour minister Mr Milburn said : `` Young people increasingly feel like they are on the wrong side of a profound unfairness in British society - and they are unhappy about it .
`` Perhaps unsurprisingly , what could be dubbed the 'revenge of the young ' was evident at the General Election with record numbers of young people turning out to vote .
`` Down the generations , hope has been a defining characteristic of the young , but this poll suggests that today youthful pessimism is becoming the norm . There is a stark inter-generational divide about Britain 's social mobility prospects . ''
He said the country 's `` deep social mobility problem , for this generation of young people in particular , is getting worse not better '' , and that the `` 20th century promise that each generation would be better off than the preceding one is being broken '' .
Mr Milburn added that the research was a `` wake-up call for the new government '' , and said : `` Cracking Britain 's social mobility problem has to become its defining domestic priority . ''
( Bloomberg ) —While the process may take months , Brookfield Property Partners LP is likely to be ultimately successful in its bid to take over the portion of mall owner GGP Inc. it does n't already own , said the chief executive officer of Brookfield 's parent company .
The buyout talks remain active , said Bruce Flatt , CEO of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. , declining to discuss the negotiations in detail . GGP has rejected Brookfield 's original $ 14.8 billion bid for the 66 percent of the company it does n't hold , a person with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday , asking not to be identified because the discussions are private .
“ These are processes that everyone goes through , ” Flatt said in a Bloomberg Television interview , to be broadcast Monday . “ We think we have a fair offer on the table . We have a great board of independent directors and they 're going to consider it . There 'll be lots of stories between now and when the process ends , and I think they 'll see it as a fair offer . ”
Brookfield Property Partners is the real estate unit of Toronto-based Brookfield Asset , which has been focusing on buying and revamping shopping centers to take advantage of the land they occupy in urban areas . GGP CEO Sandeep Mathrani has also been looking for ways to repurpose struggling brick-and-mortar shopping centers .
Brookfield last month offered $ 23 a share for rest of GGP 's shares . That was about 21 percent more than Chicago-based GGP 's closing price on Nov. 6 , the day before Bloomberg News reported that Brookfield had held discussions about taking over the company .
Proposal Review
GGP said last month that its board had formed a special committee to review the unsolicited proposal from Brookfield . The deal would form one of the biggest publicly traded real estate companies in the world .
“ These are long , long processes , ” Flatt said in the interview . “ We thought it was a fair offer , and we 'll see where we go . ”
Reuters reported the rejected offer and ongoing talks on Sunday . Kevin Berry , a spokesman for GGP , did n't respond to calls and emails seeking comment Sunday evening .
In the third quarter , Brookfield exercised all of its outstanding warrants in GGP , bringing its ownership stake to 34 percent from 29 percent . The 68 million shares were purchased for $ 462 million . The combined company would be about 30 percent owned by existing GGP shareholders , Brookfield Property said .
Shares of mall companies have been hit hard as the rise of e-commerce squeezes traditional retailers . Store closures are accelerating , pressuring landlords to fill empty space and reinvent shopping centers . Simon Property Group Inc. , the biggest U.S. mall owner , has fallen 8.7 percent this year through Friday . Even after getting a boost from Brookfield 's interest , GGP shares are down 6.2 percent since the beginning of the year .

Hackers have released more unaired episodes of popular HBO shows but the latest leak did not include anything on the hit series `` Game of Thrones , '' the Associated Press reported on Sunday .
REUTERS - Hackers have released more unaired episodes of popular HBO shows but the latest leak did not include anything on the hit series `` Game of Thrones , '' the Associated Press reported on Sunday .
The hackers , who broke into HBO 's computer network and have released stolen information for several weeks , provided more unaired episodes , including the popular show `` Curb Your Enthusiasm , `` which returns in October .
They also leaked episodes of `` Insecure , '' `` Ballers '' and `` The Deuce , '' according to the Associated Press .
Time Warner Inc 's HBO said Sunday in an emailed statement that it was `` not in communication with the hacker , and we 're not going to comment every time a new piece of information is released . ''
`` It has been widely reported that there was a cyber incident at HBO , '' it said . `` The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention . That 's a game we 're not going to participate in . ''
HBO acknowledged the hack earlier this summer . It said the thieves had been leaking stolen materials and asking for a multi-million-dollar ransom .

Northumberland OPP were investigating a serious accident on Hwy . 401 in Cramahe Township when a customer at the Tim Hortons in Colborne called police to suggest another person in the store may have been involved in the collision . The caller gave police a description of the person and the car .
When police arrived and spoke to a man , he claimed he was n't the driver of the vehicle that had Colorado licence plates .
Police investigated and looked at a video from the store .
The man was arrested a short time later and is facing a variety of charges including fail to render assistance , no insurance , driving while suspended , driving with a G1 licence with no accompanying licenced passenger , using an unauthorized licence plate and driving with a G1 licence on a prohibited highway .
The suspect said while he was n't involved in the collision , he did know the driver involved in the Hwy . 401 accident .
Northumberland OPP announced Monday morning that westbound lanes of Hwy . 401 were closed to traffic between Exit 509 ( County Rd . 30 , Brighton ) and Exit 497 ( Big Apple Dr. , Colborne ) .

Industry insiders share easy ways ( that really work ) to care for your favourite leather shoes and bags .
SINGAPORE : Designer shoes and handbags are often considered investment pieces that we are most willing to splurge on . When it comes to taking care of leather , however , not many are sure about the upkeep the tricky material requires . To make sure your favourite shoes and bags last for years , we 've turned to some experts for advice .
GOOD CLEANING HABITS
White leather sneakers like this one from Common Projects require weekly cleaning to keep them pristine .
“ Make a habit of using a soft cloth to clean the insoles of your leather shoes and surface of your leather bag after each use , and leather care will no longer feel like a huge chore , ” shared Geraldine Goh , co-founder of local label Arete Goods , which specialises in quality handcrafted leather shoes and bags .
For celebrity stylist Furqan Saini , who owns over 90 pairs of leather shoes , cleaning them is a weekly affair . “ I make it a point to give my shoes a quick wipe when I get home – I do n't like the idea of dirt and grime accumulating for too long . I have 14 pairs of white leather sneakers that I clean religiously once a week . ”
STORE THEM PROPERLY

Stuff bags , like this Penta goatskin tote by Arete Good , with tissue before storing them to maintain their shape .
“ Air your leather bag or shoes for at least a day before storing . If they get wet , make sure they 're completely dry before you put them away , ” advised Goh . “ Do n't wear the same pair of leather shoes every day – try to rotate every two to three days . Keep your leather bags in shape by stuffing them with tissue before storing in dust bags . ”
DEAL WITH STAINS ASAP
The earlier you deal with stains , the more likely you can remove them completely . You can try using Jason Markk 3pk Quick Wipes , $ 5 ( L ) or the Saphir Renomat stain remover , $ 25 ( R ) .
“ Always remove fresh stains as soon as you can , because the longer the residue stays on , the more it may embed into the leather , ” said Furqan . “ If you 're accident-prone , keep leather wipes in your bag so you can clean up the mess immediately . ”
Goh recommends tackling fresh stains with Saphir Renomat stain remover , which effectively cleans spots without damaging the leather .
CONDITION ONCE A MONTH
A general rule for conditioning leather is to do it when you feel the leather is getting dry . However , as important as it is to avoid dry leather , it 's also essential that you avoid over-conditioning . The more you use a leather good , the more frequently you should be conditioning it .
“ If you use your leather goods often , we suggest cleaning and conditioning them once a month . Good leather can retain its properties for over 50 years , provided that adequate leather care is given , ” said Goh .
DO A PATCH TEST
“ Before conditioning any leather , clean the surface with a wet cloth to remove dirt that may otherwise be rubbed further into the leather , ” said Goh .
She also recommends testing a dab of conditioner on a discreet area on your bag or shoe as different leathers react differently to treatments . Look out for excess colour rub off on your cloth or discolouration on leather – if nothing goes wrong , it 's safe to proceed .
START WITH A SMALL AMOUNT
Different leather absorbs lotion differently , so a patch test can determine how much conditioner to apply to your leather good . Finished leathers usually have a special surface coating that slows their natural absorption rate , so your shoes and bag may only take a small amount of leather conditioner at a time .
Use a small amount of conditioner and apply to the leather in circular motions – make sure you 're using thin , even layers to give the surface a balanced coat and prevent splotchy drying .
After the conditioning is complete , Goh recommends wiping off any excess product and leaving your leather good to dry for at least a day before storing .
CHOOSE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS
Look for products such as the Scotchgard Suede & Nubuck Protector ( L ) and Collonil Clean & Care Shoe Cleansing Foam , to clean and protect your leather shoes and bags .
According to Goh , there are two types of leather care for different groups of leather . “ For vegetable-tanned and chrome-tanned leather , try using a leather lotion to clean and condition regularly . If your suede or nubuck goods look tired and flattened , use a suede brush to remove dirt and keep them looking fresh and smooth . Look for suede and nubuck specific leather care products to condition and waterproof these types of leather . ”
Furqan 's go-to choices include Scotchgard 's Suede & Nubuck Protector for weatherproofing leather shoes and Jason Markk 's Premium Shoe Cleaner for hardier shoes in top grain calf leather .
USE A TOOTHBRUSH
Stuck with tired-looking suede and nubuck goods while on holiday ? A clean toothbrush is all you need . Muji 4-colour toothbrush set , $ 16 .
Yes , you can spruce up dusty suede or nubuck shoes and bags while travelling , even if you did n't pack a suede brush in your suitcase . Goh suggests using a clean toothbrush to brush the dirt and dust off your leather goods and you 're good to go .
YANGON : Myanmar 's government on Monday ( Jan 2 ) said it has detained several police officers over a video apparently showing Rohingya civilians being beaten , a rare admission that authorities may have carried out abuses against the Muslim minority .
Tens of thousands of people from the persecuted ethnic group - loathed by many of Myanmar 's Buddhist majority - have fled a military operation in Rakhine state launched after attacks on police posts in October .
Bangladesh says about 50,000 Rohingya have crossed its borders over the past two months . Many have brought harrowing accounts of rape , murder and arson at the hands of Myanmar 's security forces .
Their stories have raised global alarm and galvanised protests against Myanmar 's de facto leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , who has been accused of not doing enough to help the Rohingya .
Her government has said troops are hunting militants behind deadly raids on police border posts , denying claims of atrocities and launching a dogged information campaign against reports of abuse .
However , on Monday authorities pledged to take action `` against police who allegedly beat villagers during area clearance operations on Nov 5 in Kotankauk village '' .
Suu Kyi 's office named four officers who were involved in the operation including constable Zaw Myo Htike , who filmed the 'selfie-style ' video .
`` Those who ( were ) initially identified were detained , '' it said in a statement . `` Further investigations are being carried out to expose other police officers who beat villagers in the operation . ''
Dozens of videos have emerged apparently showing security forces abusing Rohingya , but this is the first time the government has said it will take action over them .
`` HUMAN TRAGEDY ''
The footage shows police hitting a young boy around the head as he walks to where dozens of villagers are lined up in rows seated on the ground , hands behind their heads . Three officers in uniform then start attacking one of the sitting men , beating him with a stick and kicking him repeatedly in the face .
A Rohingya activist contacted by AFP said the footage had been verified by a refugee from the nearby camp , Shilkhali .
Around 600 people have been detained since the military operation , according to state media , including six who have died in police custody .
Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long discriminated against the stateless Rohingya , who rights groups say are among the most persecuted peoples in the world .
More than 120,000 have been trapped in squalid displacement camps since violence erupted in 2012 in Rakhine , where they are denied citizenship , access to healthcare and education .
More than a dozen Nobel laureates wrote to the UN Security Council last week urging action to stop the `` human tragedy amounting to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity '' in northern Rakhine .
Last month , UN rights commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein criticised the government 's `` callous '' handling of the crisis , describing it as `` a lesson in how to make a bad situation worse '' .
Under Myanmar 's constitution Suu Kyi 's civilian administration has limited power over the army , which maintains control of the defence , home and border ministries .
BENGHAZI , Libya : Libyan forces fought suspected Islamic State fighters , killing three of them near an oilfield run by Waha Oil in the southeast of the country , military officials said on Saturday .
The clash took place near the Dhahra oilfield , operated by Waha , a joint-venture between Libya 's state National Oil Company and U.S. firms Hess , Marathon and ConocoPhillips .
The oil protection force guarding the Waha operations is allied to country 's eastern government . The U.N.-backed administration sits in the capital Tripoli in western Libya .
The North African country has been mired in conflict since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and in December armed men blew up a Waha pipeline pumping crude to Es Sider port , temporarily cutting Libyan output by around 100,000 barrels per day . Officials blamed `` terrorists '' , without giving details .
The area has poor security and sources say it has been populated by Islamic State fighters since they lost control of their stronghold in Libya , the central city of Sirte , in 2016 .

A cassava processing factory is to be established at Diare in the Savelugu/Nanton Municipality of the Northern Region to process cassava into various products including flour and ethanol to support the economy of the area .
The factory , which is in line with the government 's One-District One-Factory agenda , is a project of PT and T Ghana Limited in partnership with the Ministry of Trade and Industry ( MoTI ) , with support from Traditional Authorities at Diare .
To this end , representatives of PT and T Ghana Limited , MoTI and Traditional Authorities at Diare visited the 20-acre land site of the factory at Diare to assess progress of work .
Mr Prince Mohammed Tawfik Tikum-ma , the Chief Executive Officer of PT and T Ghana Limited , said the decision to site the factory in the area was to add value to cassava , which was widely cultivated in the area to increase incomes for farmers as well as create jobs for all .
He said farmers would be given fertilizers and credit facilities amongst other incentives to enable them to produce enough raw materials to feed the factory .
Mr Habib Issahaku , the Northern Region Officer of MoTI , said the establishment of factories in each district , especially in the Northern Region would reduce rural-urban migration of the youth as they would be engaged productively at home .
Hajia Ayishetu Seidu , the Savelugu/Nanton Municipal Chief Executive ( MCE ) , lauded the initiative , which would help improve incomes of cassava farmers as well as create jobs for the people of the area .
Hajia Seidu said the Assembly was working to find solutions to the Fulani herdsmen menace in the area to protect the investment of crop farmers .
Abubakari Abdulai , Regent of Diare , appealed to government and non-governmental organisations to explore the untapped farming resources in the area to create opportunities for the youth .

The team of policemen that allegedly handcuffed and bundled a Lagos hotelier into the boot of their vehicle from Apapa to their base in Ikorodu area of the state , have been arrested .
The policemen attached to the Zonal Intervention Unit , Ikorodu , stormed Formula 2 Hotel and Suites in Apapa area of Lagos recently , to effect the arrest of its owner , Mr. Obimdi Ocho , over claims that his guards were found with guns .
In a petition to the Inspector General of Police , Idris Ibrahim , lawyer to the victim , Dan Okoro , alleged that the policemen placed a gun on the victim 's hand , took a shot of him and , thereafter , demanded for N1 million .
According to the lawyer , the officer told the hotelier that if he does n't come up with the amount , the pictures will be released to journalists .
The petition , entitled Complaint Against Supol Salawu of Zonal Intervention Unit , Ikorodu , for Professional Misconduct , Misuse of Police Power , Extortion and Incivility to Members of the Public , further stated that the policemen threatened to brandish the victim as a robber if he failed to part with the demanded sum .
The petition read : “ Our client has briefed us that on November 24 , some policemen bashed into his hotel complex in a commando style and when our client came out to meet them , they told him that they had information that his private security men in the hotel were armed .
“ Our client told them that the arm he had has a licence and it was shown to the policemen .

“ However , our client was informed by the policemen that the Pump Action gun does not have a licence , but our client informed them that when the gun was bought , he took it to Ikeja , where the said gun was issued a licence in the year 2015 .
“ When our client was questioned about using a gun in the hotel , he told them that cultists were always disturbing his customers and members of the public , dispossessing them of their belongings .
“ He said cult boys usually come to the hotel to engage the guards in fights , injuring them in the process . One of the cases was reported at Trinity Police Station , where the cultists were arrested and handed over to Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad , FSARS , from where they were charged to court .
“ One of the security men , Cyril Nwachukwu , was also arrested and taken to their office without dropping their address or phone number . Our client quickly ran to Trinity Police Station to inform them of the situation .
“ But he was told that the policemen were from the Zonal Intervention Squad , Ladegboye , Ikorodu . ”
It was gathered that the IGP forwarded the petition to Zone 2 Command , Onikan , with a directive to fish out the policemen involved and investigate their culpability .
As on Friday , Police sources at Zone 2 Command said that four policemen , who were involved , had been apprehended .
When contacted , the Zonal Public Relations Officer , Dolapo Badmus , confirmed the arrest and disclosed that the policemen involved were being investigated at the X Squad section of the Federal Criminal Investigation Department , Alagbon , Lagos .
RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has sparked a controversy in Kerala by hoisting the national flag during Independence Day celebrations at a government-aided school defying a restraining order by the district collector.Bhagwat raised the Tricolour at the Karnaki Amman school in Palakkad district despite orders from the collector that only elected representatives or functionaries of the school are allowed to do so in aided schools.The collector 's order had been issued to the school on Monday night by the district administration made no attempt to physically restrain the RSS chief from defying it . Authorities are expected to proceed against the school sometime later , though both the district collector and the district police superintendent were not immediately available for comment.The school is run by a pro-Sangh private management , but the collector 's order still applies as it is funded by the government.The management said no rule was violated as the Collector 's order only said that the flag should be hoisting by a public figure in the presence of the principal and school authorities.BJP district president E Krishnadas was quoted as saying , `` The collector acted like the branch secretary of the Marxist party ( CPM ) . That is why such a circular was sent at 11 last night . `` Bhagwat is in Palakkad to attend a two-day RSS meeting . Kerala had recently witnessed violence between cadres of the CPM and RSS-BJP and this incident is likely play out much beyond the technicalities of violating a government order.The RSS and the BJP have stepped up their attack on the Left Front government in Kerala since the killing of RSS worker Rajesh on July 29.The CPI ( M ) , which heads the Left Front , has denied any links with those accused of the July 29 murder who have already been arrested . It also alleged that the RSS and the BJP are more involved in violence in Kerala but “ pretend ” to be the victims .
Social media sensation Jeremy Meeks , the 'hot felon , ' made his New York Fashion Week debut on the Philipp Plein runway earlier this week .
Meeks made headlines in 2014 after his mugshot , posted on the Stockton Police Department 's Facebook page after he was arrested on federal weapons charges , went viral .
He became an instant Internet celebrity , with users commenting on his good looks .
Meeks was later convicted and sentenced to 27 months in a California prison , but he has since traded the cellblock for the catwalk .

London : Maria Sharapova insists she is not finished as a Grand Slam force despite her worst-ever performance at Wimbledon , a tournament which should have been her perfect showcase .
The 31-year-old gave up a set and a 5-2 lead to lose in the first round on Tuesday to fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko , an injury-plagued qualifier ranked a lowly 132 in the world .
Diatchenko , who needed treatment on her back on three occasions , celebrated an unlikely 6-7 ( 3/7 ) , 7-6 ( 7/3 ) , 6-4 triumph after more than three hours on Court Two .
The match ended in twilight , a fitting metaphor for Sharapova who slipped to her first-ever opening round defeat at the England Club where she first burst upon the scene in 2003 .
One year later , as a 17-year-old , she stunned Serena Williams to capture the Wimbledon title , the first of her five majors .
However , she has been back to the Wimbledon final only once since 2004 , losing to Petra Kvitova in 2011 .
Before Diatchenko , there had already been some embarrassing howlers — in 2008 , losing to Alla Kudryavtseva , ranked 154 , then to World No 45 Gisela Dulko in 2009 and to Michelle Larcher de Brito , a 131st-ranked Portuguese qualifier in 2013 .
This year was Sharapova 's first appearance at Wimbledon since 2015 having been sidelined by a doping ban in 2016 and injury last year .
Since her return from suspension , her Slam record stands at a last-16 run at the US Open , third round in Australia and a quarter-final place at Roland Garros .
Steady , not spectacular but Sharapova insists there are positives .
`` I have to take away the things that did n't work well for me and get back and work through those , look for my next opportunities , '' said Sharapova whose fate was sealed against Diatchenko when she served up her 11th double fault of the match .
Not pleasant
Tuesday 's loss was her first opening-round exit at a Slam since Australia in 2010 .
Before that , her only other first-up losses came in her maiden season in Melbourne and Paris in 2003 .
Sharapova , who decided not to play the Birmingham grass court warm-up event , admitted that the passing years pose a new challenge .
`` I always find the transition from clay to grass has been a little bit tougher for me as I 've gotten older , '' she admitted .
`` That 's just a matter of training , getting through the soreness in the first week or so . There 's no perfect formula . ''
Since her return to the tour in April 2017 , Sharapova has added just one more title to her career tally — at the low-key season-ender in Tianjin .
She also suffered a mini-slump this year , losing three first-round matches in succession at Doha , Indian Wells and Stuttgart .
She now stands at 15-9 on the season .
`` At this moment , my competitive desire is not great , '' she said in the aftermath of her loss to Diatchenko .
`` It 's always tough to assess motivation after a first-round loss . There 's no doubt that when I will , I do n't shy away from mistakes and errors , looking back at film , learning from what went wrong .
`` It 's not always pleasant moments , but sometimes those are the ones you need to get better . ''

JAKARTA - At least 12 people died after a ferry carrying over 139 passengers went down in waters off Bulukumba district of Indonesia 's South Sulawesi province on Tuesday , officials said . Search and rescue operations are still underway , and some of the passengers were rescued . Ferry KMP Lestari Maju , heading to Selayar island , sank at 2:30 p.m. local time ( 0730 GMT ) in the waters of Selayar , spokesman of national disaster management agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told Xinhua in a text message .
Search and rescue is underway , but bad weather hampered rescuers from approaching the scene , head of port operation in Bulukumba district Zainuddin told Xinhua in a text message . `` The sea waters came into the ship because of unfavorable weather condition , '' director general for sea transports R. Agus Purnomo said . The vessel was also loaded with 48 units of cars and motorcycles in addition to the passengers , Purnomo told Xinhua , saying that some of the passengers have been rescued .
Taking ferries is a favorite way of transportation in the vast archipelago country , but lack of safety standards often trigger sea incidents .
The accident happened only days after a boat , allegedly overloaded , sank in lake Toba of North Sumatra province , killing at least four people and left nearly 200 others missing .
As Didier Deschamps plots another World Cup title tilt with France , Kylian Mbappe , who was not even born when his coach lifted the trophy in 1998 , has become an indispensable figure for Les Bleus .
It was only two-and-a-half years ago that the teenager made his professional debut , but the rise of Mbappe — the second-most expensive player in history — has been meteoric .
After winning successive French league crowns with Monaco and then Paris Saint-Germain , the 19-year-old announced himself on the global stage by knocking Lionel Messi 's Argentina out of the last 16 in Russia .
With Cristiano Ronaldo , a childhood hero of Mbappe 's , crashing out of the competition on the same day with Portugal , it felt like a passing of the torch to a new generation .
Mbappe 's breathtaking acceleration and steely composure were used to devastating effect as he became the first teenager since Pele 60 years ago to score at least twice in a World Cup match .
“ I gave Kylian a new nickname , it 's 37 , because he reached a peak of 37km/h ( kilometres per hour ) against Argentina , ” said France teammate Florian Thauvin .
To put his searing speed into context , triple Olympic 100-metre champion Usain Bolt 's career peak was clocked at 44.72 km/h during his world record run at the 2009 world championships .
And while Mbappe may be the game 's new superstar , the French teenage sensation is not forgetting his roots .
According to L'Equipe , he has promised to donate his World Cup bonus to organise sporting initiatives for children in hospital .
He will likely find a robust Uruguay defence far less charitable , but former France defender Lilian Thuram expects Mbappe to thrive on the challenge .
“ He is young , and young players really enjoy themselves when the standard of the opposition increases , ” said Thuram .
More talent than Pogba
France great Thierry Henry , who followed a similar trajectory to the top as Mbappe , cited the latter 's intelligence as the driving force behind his success .
“ When I watch him dribble , he 's thinking , ” Henry said in an interview with Canal+ .
“ There 's something that gets me going and saddens me at times . We often speak of a player and say : ‘ He 's fast , he 's tough , he jumps high ' , but we never speak about a player 's brain .
“ He thinks when he plays , and that for me is the most important thing in a player , he uses his brain , ” explained Henry .
“ It 's the sign of a guy who can go very far . ”
Ludovic Batelli , coach of the France team that won the Under-19 European Championship in 2016 , said Mbappe had a rare level of maturity for someone so young .
“ He has this clear-headedness , this sangfroid in front of goal which is the mark of great goalscorers , ” said Batelli .
“ It 's often acquired more in the second part of one 's career . He has it at a very , very young age . It 's what is going to allow him to become a future great . ”
Mbappe scored 21 goals in his first season in Paris after joining the club in a monumental deal worth an eventual 180 million euros ( $ 210 million ) .
Paul Pogba , one of the cornerstones of the current France side , said Mbappe has only just scratched the surface of what he is capable of achieving .
“ He 's got a lot more talent than me , ” Pogba said of Mbappe . “ And he 's not going to stop there . He 's got so much talent . ”
Four days after suing former Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick , accusing him of fraud , early Uber investor Benchmark told Uber employees why it resorted to legal action : Kalanick , it said , was getting in the way .
In an open letter sent to Uber employees and publicly shared on Twitter , the Silicon Valley venture capital firm — which also has a seat on Uber 's board of directors — alleged that Kalanick had forced Benchmark 's hand by undermining the Uber board 's search for a new chief executive .
Citing Kalanick 's ongoing day-to-day involvement with the company ( despite his resignation as CEO a month ago ) and what the venture capital firm called his failure to make good on a promise to modify Uber 's voting agreement to ensure that “ independent , diverse and well-qualified ” directors could be appointed to the board , Benchmark said Kalanick had created uncertainty for everyone .
“ It has appeared at times as if the search [ for a CEO ] was being manipulated to deter candidates and create a power vacuum in which Travis could return , ” the letter said .
“ A number of people have asked why we took legal action before giving Travis the chance to sign these amendments . The fact is that we did give him a chance . … We were asked to postpone any filing and assured that efforts would be made to get these changes made without a lawsuit , ” the letter said . `` We waited and waited , watching as things deteriorated even further . Eventually , we felt that we could no longer wait and took action . ''
Benchmark said the lawsuit also was intended to hasten the search for a chief financial officer and to bring about cultural change at the company .
Last week , a spokesperson for Kalanick described the lawsuit as “ baseless ” and “ riddled with lies . ''
Benchmark filed its lawsuit against Kalanick last week , alleging that the Uber co-founder had defrauded investors by keeping unethical business practices secret . The lawsuit attempts to void the three board seats that the board of directors approved last year on Kalanick 's insistence , a move that would effectively kick Kalanick off the board because he occupies one of those three seats . It also attempts to bar Kalanick from being involved in the day-to-day operations and decision-making of Uber and its board of directors .
In its open letter Monday , Benchmark reiterated that it believed Kalanick 's ongoing presence at Uber was creating a governance and management crisis for the company .
“ It 's easy to reduce this situation to a battle of personalities , ” it said . “ But this is n't about Benchmark versus Travis . It 's about ensuring that Uber can reach its full potential as a company . And that can only happen if we get rid of the roadblocks and distractions that have plagued Uber , and its board , for far too long . ''
Spokespeople for Uber and Kalanick did not immediately respond to a request for comment . A spokesperson for Benchmark declined to comment .

NIAGARA FALLS , N.Y. ( WIVB ) — Erendira Wallenda says she is fearless and ready to be taken on this challenge and make history . The acrobatic artist says she 's been preparing for this moment for a while now .
“ You ca n't do what we do and be freaked out , ” says Erendira Wallenda , the lifelong performer . “ If you 're scared of it , then it becomes dangerous . ”
The stunt performer will be spending several minutes suspended under a helicopter , hanging by her teeth , nearly 300 feet above the falls . She will be dangling above doing different aerial movements , eventually hanging from her feet and then her teeth while wearing a mouth piece , similar to mouth guard , and using all the muscles in her jaw to stay above the falls . That part of the stunt will last about 10 to 20 seconds . She will be tethered during the ordeal , though she 's hopeful she wo n't have to use the security rope .
Erendira is looking to break her husband , Nik 's , record- hanging by his teeth at 200 feet– and says she 's excited to be taking on this challenge on the five year anniversary of his daring walk across the falls .
“ I remember watching Nikolas as he was crossing the falls and thinking , ‘ I wonder what it would feel or look like , ' ” recalls Enerdira . “ [ I was ] never thinking that five years later , I would have the same opportunity . I feel blessed . ”
The daredevil couple says they hope the millions from around the world who watch the stunt will be inspired by it and that it 'll draw even more people to visit Niagara Falls .
Erendira says rain or shine , as long as there is n't any lightening , she will be out here at 8:30am Thursday morning , hoping to shatter the record .

Gov . Samuel Ortom of Benue has called on the people to set aside their political differences and support the government in tackling insecurity in the state .
Ortom made the call when he received Mr Joseph Tondo , the state Chairman , Conference of Nigeria Political Parties , and other members of the coalition on a condolence visit to him in Makurdi on Friday .
The governor emphasised the need for synergy to tackle the security challenges faced by the state , pointing out that the activities of terrorists did not know APC , PDP , LP or APGA .
He said those terrorising the people of Benue had ulterior motives , including the takeover of the state , and had made their intentions known in several fora .
He expressed optimism that God would see the people of the state through the current security challenges given the way the stakeholders were going about the issues .
Earlier , Tondo said that they came to commiserate with the governor over the incessant killings of Benue people by suspected herdsmen .
He said the attacks had caused a lot of setbacks in the state but commended the governor for the pragmatic steps he had taken in handling the crisis .
He urged the governor to sustain efforts aimed at restoring order in the state and hailed his leadership style of appointing people across party lines into public offices .

SINGAPORE : The overall road safety situation in Singapore improved last year compared to 2015 , but accidents involving elderly pedestrians remain a key concern , according to the Singapore Police Force 's ( SPF ) annual road traffic situation report released on Wednesday ( Feb 15 ) .
According to the report , the number of fatal accidents occurring on the roads fell from 148 fatal accidents in 2015 to 140 in 2016 . The number of fatalities also dropped from 151 in 2015 to 141 in 2016 , continuing a downward trend over the past five years .
The fatality rate dropped to its lowest since data collation for the report began 1981 . In 2016 , the fatality rate was 2.51 per 100,000 persons , down from 2.75 in 2015 .
There were also fewer accidents and violations involving speeding . The number of speeding-related accidents decreased by 10 per cent from 1,206 accidents in 2015 to 1,081 in 2016 . Similarly , the number of fatal accidents involving speeding also fell by about 16 per cent to 40 accidents in 2016 , down from 48 accidents in 2015 .
However , the number of elderly pedestrians killed in traffic accidents increased from 23 in 2015 to 28 in 2016 . At the same time , the number of accidents involving elderly pedestrians also went up nearly 20 per cent , from 224 in 2015 to 268 in 2016 .
Commander of the Traffic Police Sam Tee said the authorities would reach out to more elderly people to educate them on the dangers of the roads and how to use the roads safely . `` Similarly , we hope that motorists will do their part to look out for elderly pedestrians , '' he added .
One recent initiative is the Road Master Test Kit launched last November , which aims to help the elderly gauge their road sense and strengthen their road safety awareness .
From February this year , the test kits will also be made available through dispensers at bus stops in areas with a high concentration of accidents involving elderly pedestrians such as Outram , Bishan and Serangoon .
Despite the overall drop in accidents and fatalities , the traffic police also said it would continue to look into new ways to safeguard all road users .
It will be deploying new Average Speed Cameras ( ASCs ) - which can detect and compute the average speed of vehicle as it enters and exits the enforcement zone - along the new stretch of Tanah Merah Coast road in the first quarter of 2018 .

After four seasons of escalating melodrama , “ Nashville ” is preparing for a key change .
Picked up by CMT last year after its cancellation by ABC , the series set in country music 's capital begins its fifth season Thursday night . And along with a new network has come a fresh creative team promising a move away from the soapy theatrics that slowly came to define the show .
In the fourth season alone , those included a plane crash , an attempted suicide and a guy falling in slow motion from a high-rise rooftop — each hard to imagine when “ Nashville ” debuted in 2012 as a surprisingly credible backstage drama with serious ties to the country music establishment .
Yet such contrivances have no place in the upcoming season , according to Marshall Herskovitz , the veteran show runner who 's taken over “ Nashville ” with his longtime producing partner , Ed Zwick . Known for critically acclaimed shows like “ Thirtysomething ” and “ My So-Called Life , ” the two view “ Nashville ” — which stars Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere — as more “ people-centered ” than it became as ABC tried to reverse flagging ratings with Twitter-ready spectacle .
New `` Nashville '' executive producers Marshall Herskovitz , left , and Ed Zwick Lionsgate New `` Nashville '' executive producers Marshall Herskovitz , left , and Ed Zwick New `` Nashville '' executive producers Marshall Herskovitz , left , and Ed Zwick ( Lionsgate )
“ We 're betting that a deep , emotional connection to the characters will be a stronger pull for the audience than the OMG effect , ” Herskovitz said .
To foster that connection , they 're also renewing the emphasis on music in a show originally inspired by the lives and careers — and , OK , the tortured romances — of Nashville 's creative class : the singers , songwriters , producers and executives responsible for the city 's highest-profile export .
Indeed , within the first five minutes of the two-part season premiere airing Thursday , we see Britton 's character , Rayna Jaymes , discuss the folk standard “ Wayfaring Stranger ” with a grizzled old man clutching a mandolin .
“ Nashville ” started out depicting the country scene convincingly . Early seasons featured cameos by respected roots-music figures like Pam Tillis and Del McCoury , and some scenes are shot inside a painstaking re-creation of a real-life venue , the Bluebird Cafe . The show 's creator , Callie Khouri , recruited her husband , producer T Bone Burnett , to oversee “ Nashville 's ” original music , which led to a series of successful soundtrack albums .
But eventually , the songs performed by Rayna , Panettiere 's Juliette Barnes and others began to feel like an afterthought , lost in an ever more complicated shuffle of betrayals and overdoses and criminal conspiracies .
“ To make things happen at such a fast metabolic rate was to deny the music the chance to do what music can do best , ” said Zwick , “ which is to grow and to linger — to provide a kind of emotional foundation . ”
Added Herskovitz : “ I can say that we 'll play more music and for longer this year than ever before in the show . ”
That focus was evident on a recent afternoon at the suburban Los Angeles home of “ Nashville 's ” music supervisor , Frankie Pine , who 'd gathered a dozen or so songwriters — old hands and youthful up-and-comers — to spend the day crafting potential tunes for the show 's characters .
The atmosphere was relaxed , with musicians grouped in twos and threes around the spacious backyard , working from story notes they 'd been given by Zwick and Herskovitz . As the songwriters strummed guitars and punched lyrics into their phones , Pine 's children splashed in a swimming pool and a chef prepared brick-oven pizzas . ( Hey , even “ Nashville ” can go L.A . )
Around dusk , though , a ripple of nervous energy went through the place when Pine called the musicians to a makeshift stage on the patio : Here was where they 'd pitch their material to the show runners , who sat together at a picnic table waiting to hear if anyone had successfully channeled the voices of the fictional stars they 're trying to make more believable .
Jake Etheridge and Garrison Starr pitch a song they wrote during a recent songwriters ' retreat for the CMT series `` Nashville '' Lionsgate Jake Etheridge and Garrison Starr pitch a song they wrote during a recent songwriters ' retreat for the CMT series `` Nashville '' Jake Etheridge and Garrison Starr pitch a song they wrote during a recent songwriters ' retreat for the CMT series `` Nashville '' ( Lionsgate )
It turned out a few had , including Garrison Starr and Jake Etheridge , whose song “ Burn to Dark ” was later selected as a tune to be sung in the upcoming season by country hunk Will Lexington ( played by Chris Carmack ) . The “ Nashville ” brain trust picked out another cut — “ All of Me , ” written by Tim Lauer , Lindy Robbins and Phillip LaRue — for Scarlett O'Connor ( Clare Bowen ) and Gunnar Scott ( Sam Palladio ) , two young stars in an on-again/off-again romantic relationship .
After the afternoon 's performances , Herskovitz said he 'd been “ knocked out ” by the talent on display .
“ I ca n't believe all these people could just sit down — some of them with people they 'd never worked with before — and start writing songs , ” he said . “ If you threw me in a room with a scriptwriter , I 'd panic . ”
Starr , whose music has been featured in other TV shows including “ Pretty Little Liars ” and “ The Fosters , ” said Zwick took more of a role in the process than she 'd anticipated ; the show runner even sat down with her and Etheridge as they worked .
“ And at first it was kind of annoying , ” she said . “ In my head I got a little sensitive : ‘ Dude , more power to you as a writer , but you 're not a songwriter . ' As we went along , though , he was so on point with the things he was saying . He gave us a different perspective on the bridge of the song and helped us bring it home . ”
Herskovitz said he and Zwick want to bring that kind of artistic collaboration to the screen as part of the new “ Nashville . ”
“ We 're very interested in the nuts and bolts of creativity , ” he said , recalling scenes in “ Thirtysomething ” that showed two primary characters , both advertising execs , spitballing ideas for new campaigns .
He continued : “ We have an entire episode [ of ‘ Nashville ' ] where we play out a relationship between two people in the writing of songs . That 's not something you usually see on television . ”
But is there an appetite among viewers for the drama of process as opposed to that of a plane crash ? The audience for ABC 's “ Nashville ” may have shrunk as the series got soapier , but so have ratings for music-factory talent shows like “ The Voice ” and the now dormant “ American Idol . ”
That does n't scare Herskovitz .
The doors of the Nationalist Movement Party ( MHP ) are open to all Kurds without any conditions or descriptions in the upcoming period of local and general elections , MHP Deputy Chairman Celal Adan said .
Speaking in a televised interview Thursday , MHP Deputy Chairman Adan said his party has never hurt any Kurdish person . `` The doors of the MHP are open to them . The doors of the MHP are open to Kurds without any description , '' he said , underscoring that the MHP is the most dynamic political party in the southeastern and eastern region .
Stressing that the MHP will get many votes from the region in the 2019 local and general elections , Adan said the party has branches in southeastern Diyarbakır and Şırnak provinces as well as in eastern Ağrı province . `` We had a deputy from Bingöl in 1999 . We had deputies in Van and Bitlis . As long as there is the MHP , there will not be any Turkish-Kurdish conflict . The MHP is the assurance for that . ''
There has been recent criticism that an alliance between the Justice and Development Party ( AK Party ) and the MHP would not be able to garner votes from Kurds due to the latter . Responding to these comments , Adan said that such words are uttered by those who are against Turkey 's Operation Olive Branch fighting the PKK-affiliated People 's Protection Units ( YPG ) in Syria 's Afrin region . `` The MHP is not perceived by any Kurdish citizen in such a way , '' he said .
Commenting on the recent talks between the AK Party and the MHP to forge an alliance in the 2019 elections , Adan said authorities from both parties work on the issue around the clock . `` They carry out their works under chairmen . This alliance is a grand alliance . It is an alliance that will cruise Turkey to welfare , '' he said .
Asserting that citizens lend great support to the idea of the alliance , Adan said cooperation between the AK Party and the MHP gives comfort to people . The two parties have been on the same page on several issues for a while , and they agreed to form an alliance in the 2019 local and general elections as well as the presidential elections . MHP Chairman Devlet Bahçeli has called it a `` people 's alliance , '' while President and AK Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan termed it a `` domestic and national alliance . '' The alliance has recently been termed the `` national agreement . ''
MHP Chairman Bahçeli previously made it publicly known that his party would not nominate a candidate and instead support President Erdoğan 's re-election , which became the first step toward a political alliance for the 2019 presidential elections .
Adan reiterated that the MHP 's candidate would be President Erdoğan . `` Every party will enter the elections with their own identity , but the allied party , namely the AK Party and the MHP , will enter the elections with their own emblems on the ballots , '' he said , adding that those voting for the AK Party would automatically vote for the MHP as well . The MHP deputy chairman also said the alliance of the two parties would be implemented in the March 2019 local elections without a problem .

PORTLAND , Ore. ( AP ) — A federal judge has overturned a decision by school administrators in Oregon , who banned a student from wearing a pro-border wall T-shirt to school .
Liberty High School in Hillsboro had prohibited senior Addison Barnes from wearing his `` Donald J. Trump Border Wall Construction Co. '' shirt on school grounds . But U.S. District Judge Michael W. Mosman found Tuesday that the Hillsboro School District could not justify its censorship , The Oregonian/OregonLive reported .
The school district is entitled to be concerned about the response of other students to the T-shirt , Mosman said . But the `` thin '' court record so far offers little support for the district 's argument that the shirt could `` substantially disrupt '' the school , he said .
Barnes earlier this month sued the high school , the principal and district , arguing they violated his First Amendment rights when he was told to go home or cover up the shirt in class .
Barnes , 18 , was suspended Jan. 19 for wearing the shirt to his `` People and Politics '' class , where the topic of discussion was immigration . After his father met with the principal , the school rescinded the suspension but told Barnes he could n't wear the shirt again in school .
Background : Liberty High teen suspended for wearing pro-border wall T-shirt
School officials said the shirt would contribute to a `` hostile learning environment '' and would make students feel insecure , noting students of Hispanic descent make up about one-third of the school population . The district also described increased tensions arising from racially-charged language around immigration .
After the hearing , when asked if Barnes was going to wear the shirt to school before he graduated , his lawyer , Bradley Benbrook , responded , `` Yeah , that was the idea . ''
Barnes is scheduled to graduate June 7 .

SINGAPORE : A man was arrested for grabbing the arm of a National Environment Agency ( NEA ) officer who caught him smoking in an area where he was not allowed to do so .
Last Tuesday , four NEA enforcement officers at Woodlands Centre Road saw the man smoking under a covered walkway - an area in which smoking is not allowed .
When the man was stopped by the NEA officers , he refused to give his particulars when asked . Instead , he `` forcefully grabbed '' the arm of the one of the officers , police said in a news release on Monday ( Aug 14 ) .
The police were called , and they arrested 57-year-old man for using criminal force against the NEA officer .
If convicted of using criminal force to deter a public servant from carrying out his duties , the man could be jailed for up to four years and/or fined .
TOKYO : Japan killed 122 pregnant minke whales during a highly controversial annual whaling expedition that Tokyo defends as scientific research but conservationists call `` gruesome and unnecessary . ''
The four-month expedition in the Antarctic ended in March after the fleet killed 333 minke whales , according to a report submitted by Japanese authorities to the International Whaling Commission last month .

Of those , 122 were pregnant , according to the Japanese report , with dozens more immature whales among those killed .
Humane Society International , a conservationist group , called the figures `` a shocking statistic and sad indictment on the cruelty of Japan 's whale hunt . ''
`` It is further demonstration , if needed , of the truly gruesome and unnecessary nature of whaling operations , especially when non-lethal surveys have been shown to be sufficient for scientific needs , '' said the group 's senior program manager , Alexia Wellbelove .
Japan is a signatory to the International Whaling Commission , which has maintained a moratorium on hunting whales since 1986 .

But Tokyo exploits a loophole allowing whales to be killed for `` scientific research '' and claims it is trying to prove the population is large enough to sustain a return to commercial hunting .
It makes no secret of the fact that whale meat ends up on dinner tables .
Japan has hunted whales for centuries , and their meat was a key source of protein in the immediate post-World War II years when the country was desperately poor .
But consumption has declined significantly in recent decades , with much of the population saying they rarely or never eat whale meat .
In 2014 , the International Court of Justice ordered Tokyo to end the Antarctic hunt , saying it found permits issued by Japan were `` not for purposes of scientific research '' .
Tokyo cancelled the hunt the following year , but resumed it in 2016 , also killing around 300 minke whales .
A small airplane crashed near a supermarket in a residential area outside Lisbon on Monday , killing five people , rescue workers said .
The private airplane crashed after taking off from the small Tires airport , which is located near the resort town of Cascais about 20 km ( 12.5 miles ) west of Lisbon and used mainly by private aircraft .

At the risk of suggesting it 's as ugly as a Pontiac Aztek and therefore as worthy of covering up with nylon , may we say that one of the more fun “ reveals ” we noticed at this year 's New York International Auto Show was this bed tent ? It 's custom designed to fit a Honda Ridgeline pickup bed .
The basic design is a dome tent , with the poles resting in pockets that overhang the bed just slightly . It is retained by nylon straps that hook to the undercarriage , wheel openings , and front seat assist handles . Inside there are zippers galore that provide access to the in-bed trunk and to the in-bed 12-volt power source . They also cover the window screens for privacy . Naturally , the in-bed speakers will kick your jams right through the nylon tent material . Designed to extend over the lowered tailgate , there 's ample room to accommodate a full-size air mattress and for 6-footers to stretch out inside . An awning provides shelter when standing behind the tailgate for cooking , etc . When collapsed , it fits in a carrying case about the size of a larger camp chair .
Honda Ridgeline owners ' forum discussions note that when attached , the truck can be driven slowly to switch campsites . If you need to drive the truck around more , it slides out and will support itself on the ground pretty easily until you get back .
The list price is $ 350 , but a bit of light Googling reveals plenty of outlets selling the official Honda product for around $ 100 less than that . Honda also sells a larger dome tent ( $ 381 retail ) that sets up on the ground and connects to the open hatch of any of its SUVs ( like the Pilot shown below ) or the Odyssey . It sleeps four people and packs into a larger duffel-sized carrying case .
Happy glamping starts by ordering part number 08Z04-T6Z-100A .

Forest Hills ' PS 144 will finally get rid of its trailers and create a $ 52.4 million four-story addition to house 26 classrooms .
More than two years ago , the city 's School Construction Authority installed trailers on PS 144 's playground that housed 36 students in the school 's pre-K program , with the intention of it being replaced by an extension , which at the time was only in the design phase .
“ The $ 52.4 million , four-story addition will house 26 new classrooms , an entrance lobby , an outdoor play area , a cafeteria , offices and a medical suite , ” said Donald E. Henry , Jr. the principal for Urbahn Architects . “ The new building 's contemporary architecture will reflect the exterior of the original school erected in 1931 . ”
On Friday , Queens Borough President Melinda Katz , SCA Director Lorraine Grillo and PS 144 Principal Reva Gluck Schneider led a groundbreaking for the addition , along with elected officials and the architects for the project .
The school currently serves 894 students in pre-K to fifth grade .
“ The new building will accommodate 590 students and address functional deficiencies of the existing school , ” said Martin D. Stein , the principal and designer for Urbahn . “ The expansion will also eliminate the need for the currently used temporary modular , outdoor classroom facilities . ”
The addition is designed in accordance with the city 's Green Schools Guide and Rating System , which specifies energy efficiency and healthy-environment requirements for New York City public schools .
The addition was designed by Manhattan 's Urbahn Architects in Manhattan and New Rochelle contractor MPCC .
In addition to 26 classrooms , there will also be an outdoor pre-K and kindergarten play area , a cafeteria and kitchen , principal 's and administrative offices and medical facilities .

David Moyes took a sarcastic swipe at rival Jurgen Klopp as Sunderland claimed a vital point .
A month after Klopp said his Sunderland side were the most defensive ever – Moyes gained revenge as a Jermain Defoe penalty double dented his title bid .
Moyes claimed Sunderland played an aggressive high pressing game – and joked he 'd be getting loads more praise for those tactics if he was a German coach .
Moyes said : “ I 'm feeling we were n't too defensive today .
“ I honestly thought today the players raised the supporters by the way they got up to Liverpool , how they put them under pressure , how they pressed them .

“ Maybe if I was a German manager , you might praise that . If I 'd been German you might praise me for doing something different . ”
Moyes was pleased with the reaction of his players after he said they were “ dire ” losing to Burnley at the weekend . 5 pictures which perfectly sum up Liverpool fans ' feelings after 2-2 draw against Sunderland
He said : “ We 're saying to the players it 's important to pick up points at home , that 's really important . We 're starting to get a bit of belief that we can win games or draw them against the better teams here , which between now and the end of the season is going to be massive for us to do that .
“ I thought we did well . We stuck at it . We stuck against Liverpool as much as we could and tried to make it hard for them and we played well as well .
“ I was pleased with the reaction . With the team we put out today we were always mindful of getting something from the game . We were disappointed at Burnley . ”
Moyes praised Defoe who never misses a penalty kick , and said : “ It 's important is to have a really good penalty-kick-taker . He converted the two of them brilliantly well . ”
Asked about the disputed free kick that led to Sunderland 's second equaliser , Moyes said : “ I think things go against you . You should see what it 's like at the bottom of the league ! ”
Hong Kong : Activity in China 's factories expanded at its fastest pace for eight months in May , official data showed Thursday ( May 31 ) , as demand at home and overseas improved despite brewing trade tensions with the United States .
The purchasing managers index came in at 51.9 , up from 51.4 last month , the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) said , in line with a Bloomberg News survey .

The reading , the first monthly economic indicator to gauge the world 's second-largest economy , was well above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction .
NBS analyst Zhao Qinghe said in a statement that high-tech manufacturing and improved export orders both contributed to the growth .
The May reading marks the fastest rate of expansion since September despite US President Donald Trump 's threats to impose tariffs on China , and Beijing 's vows to hit back .
The rise in new export orders `` is perhaps due to frontloading by importers in fear of a possible trade war '' , Nomura chief China economist Lu Ting said in a research note .

Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard warned that the growth may not be sustainable .
`` It appears to mostly reflect a temporary boost to industrial output from the easing of pollution controls rather than a turnaround in underlying demand , '' he said .
China curbed activity in heavy industries in the country 's northeast during winter months in an effort to reduce surplus capacity and lessen the heavy smog that typically blankets the region .

Bayelsa State Government has said it will build tank farms for petroleum products to mitigate the effects occasioned by scarcity of the products in the state .
Markson Fefegha , the Commissioner for Mineral Resources , stated this at the weekend while giving a presentation on the scorecard of his ministry at the inter-ministerial/agency briefing to mark the sixth anniversary of the Governor Seriake Dickson administration in Yenagoa .
He said the tank farms would serve as reservoirs for petroleum products .
Fefegha said the tank farms would also encourage people to go into distribution of the products and boost the local economy .
According to him , the ministry has helped the state government recover over N15 billion 13 % derivation revenue under-payment since 2006 to date .
He said his ministry had also resolved conflicts between communities and oil companies , communities and cluster boards for communities .
Fefegha listed as achievements the establishment of the Bayelsa Oil Company , which was recently overhauled by the current administration , to begin production of oil at the Atala Mining Oil Field , OML 46 , allotting 48 Oil and Gas Attaches to International Oil Companies to monitor and ascertain the true volume of oil and gas taken from the state , among others .
“ There is a plan by the ministry to build tank farms for petroleum products in the state especially when there is petroleum scarcity .
“ In Maiduguri , they have petroleum products for weeks and months because they have tank farms . Government is going to do that for the state . This will encourage our people to go into distribution of the products , ” he added .

NBC has released a new promo for “ This Is Us ” highly anticipated Super Bowl episode , playing into the current controversy surrounding the faulty slow-cooker that leads to Jack 's demise . In the ad , portrayer Milo Ventimiglia delivers a “ very special message ” ahead of Sunday 's Patriots vs. Eagles match-up , reminding audiences what a privilege it is to gather with loved ones for the Big Game .
“ In 2018 , gathering with friends and family is not as easy as what it used to be , ” he says . “ The country is divided , and sometimes that can make it tough to find common ground .

OHSWEKEN - The Six Nations elected council says it is ready to talk with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy to discuss differences concerning the Burtch lands that prompted barricades to be set up in Caledonia .
After a special council meeting Monday morning , Chief Ava Hill and the elected council issued a statement declaring that they `` continue to respectfully request a meeting with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council to discuss community needs and issues affecting the well-being of the Six Nations of the Grand River . ''
The statement comes four days after a group of activists supporting the HCCC set up barricades early Thursday morning on Argyle Street South in Caledonia , next to the former Douglas Creek Estates subdivision ( called Kanonstahton , Mohawk for `` protected place , '' by the Haudenosaunee ) . It was the site of a blockade 11 years ago over land rights issues , and is still in HCCC hands .
The group stated that its demands are aimed at the provincial and federal governments and the Six Nations elected council , and the barricades will remain in place until their demands are met .
Their main issue is that the province last March 31 turned over the Burtch lands in Brant County to the elected council rather than the Confederacy council .
That action is , according to the activists , contrary to an agreement between provincial and HCCC negotiators in the heat of the last occupation in 2006 , that the land would be turned over to the HCCC in its original state and status under the Haldimand Proclamation of 1784 .
By transferring the land to a corporation run by the elected council , `` Ontario has committed fraud and lied to our people , '' the activists said .
Haldimand OPP responded to the barricade at 8:30 a.m. Thursday and set up a road block to divert traffic away from the blockade . Argyle Street North at Highway 6 and southbound Argyle at Braemar Avenue were closed .
They remain closed Monday .
No incidents were reported over the weekend , OPP Const . Rod LeClair said Monday morning .
`` We 're still in the area , watching the barricades and controlling traffic , '' he said .
`` We 're maintaining public safety . ''
The Ontario government is sticking by its actions .
`` Ontario committed to transfer the Burtch property to the people of Six Nations in 2006 , '' Carey Marsden , spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation , said in an email Monday afternoon .
`` After a thorough cleanup of the lands , we honoured that commitment earlier this year by transferring the land to a corporation established by the Six Nations elected council that will hold the land on behalf of the people of Six Nations .
`` We remain hopeful that all parties will be able to work together in a spirit of mutual respect to ensure the land benefits all the people of Six Nations . ''
Because the matter is before the courts , Marsden said that `` any further comment would be inappropriate . ''
The HCCC made clear its objections as soon as the Ontario government announced two years ago that it was cleaning up the 380-acre parcel , the site of the former Burtch Correctional Institute , and wanted to transfer it to Six Nations through a corporation that the elected council would set up .
The corporation was to manage the land until it could be made reserve land according to the federal government 's additions to reserve policy .
The elected council set up 9646035 Canada Ltd. and invited the HCCC to choose a member to sit on the board . The HCCC has refused to sit on the board , saying its authority would be reduced from a nation to a seat on a board .
Six Nations farmer Kris Hill has farmed the land for the past three years on a lease given by the HCCC . This year , Hill was given a written notice to vacate by the elected council and the corporation , which told her she had no authority to work the land .
She continued to work the land , but in June she was handed a notice that the corporation had made an application to Superior Court to have her evicted . By order of Justice John Harper that injunction proceeding was deferred to a trial of the issues on Aug. 17 and 18 . But the judge also issued an interlocutory injunction forbidding Hill and her employees from going on the land until the case is heard
Weeks ago , Hill was given notice of a contempt of court motion alleging she has been violating the interlocutory injunction .
That proceeding was deferred last week to Aug. 22 .

Several Petro-Canada gas stations have had their pumps closed in parts of Edmonton this week and Suncor Energy , whose brand the gas stations operate under , says the outages are the result of a supply issue .
“ We are currently experiencing a gasoline supply shortage , ” Suncor said in an emailed statement to Global News on Tuesday . “ We understand that this is an inconvenience for our customers and we apologize .
“ We are doing everything we can to minimize the impact , including sourcing additional supply . ”
Suncor did not say what brought on the supply shortage .
This week , Global News crews have spotted various Petro-Canada gas stations that had their pumps closed , including locations near Southgate Centre mall , on 23 Avenue near Rabbit Hill Road and in the area of 57 Avenue and 111 Street .
It is not clear when the supply issue will be resolved .

Two years ago , Suncor Energy apologized to consumers for gas shortages at Petro-Canada stations across Western Canada . In that case , the energy firm blamed gas production problems in the United States and Alberta for the fuel shortage at the pumps .
At the time , Suncor said the Fort McMurray wildfire and an outage at its Edmonton refinery were impacting supply at the pumps .
ALEXANDRIA : A rifle-wielding critic of President Donald Trump opened fire on Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) on US lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game , seriously wounding a top Republican congressman and injuring four others before he was killed by police .
The 66-year-old gunman was identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville , Illinois , an ardent supporter of liberal Senator Bernie Sanders - who said he was `` sickened '' by what he called a `` despicable act . ''

In a national address , Trump appealed for unity following the morning assault in the Washington suburb of Alexandria , Virginia , which came amid high political tension in the US capital after a vitriol-filled 2016 election .
`` We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good , '' said the president .
Congressman Steve Scalise underwent surgery after being shot in the hip and remained in critical condition , according to MedStar Washington Hospital Centre .
Four others were wounded : a congressional aide , a lobbyist for Tyson Foods , and two US Capitol Police officers .
Trump described Scalise , the number three Republican in the House of Representatives , as a `` very good friend '' and `` patriot , '' telling him : `` America is praying for you and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting . ''
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana , a true friend and patriot , was badly injured but will fully recover . Our thoughts and prayers are with him . — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 14 , 2017
The FBI said it had recovered and was attempting to trace two weapons , a rifle and a handgun , and was actively investigating Hodgkinson 's `` associates , whereabouts , social media impressions , and potential motivations . ''
According to his Facebook page , Hodgkinson was a fervent supporter of Sanders , the feisty independent who battled Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination last year .
Hodgkinson 's social media posts displayed strong anti-Trump sentiment .
`` I know he was n't happy with the way things were going , the election results and stuff , '' his brother , Michael Hodgkinson , told The New York Times . But he said news of the shooting came `` totally out of the blue . ''
Sanders swiftly responded to report the suspect had volunteered on his presidential campaign .
`` I am sickened by this despicable act , '' he said . `` Let me be as clear as I can be . Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms . ''
'RUN , HE 'S GOT A GUN '
All Wednesday House votes were cancelled , but the annual congressional baseball game will go on as planned on Thursday night at Nationals Park .
After an all-members briefing where Democrats and Republicans held hands and prayed , House Speaker Paul Ryan and top Democrat Nancy Pelosi addressed the somber chamber and proclaimed lawmakers were `` united . ''
The shooting took place just after 7.00am ( 6.00pm Singapore time ) as the Republican team practiced for the well-loved charity showdown .

Congressman Rodney Davis told CNN he was at bat at the time , and Scalise was in the field at second base .
`` I was batting , we heard a loud noise ... The next thing I remember was somebody on the field yelling 'Run , he 's got a gun . ' ''
Alexandria police chief Michael Brown said his officers arrived within minutes and engaged Hodgkinson , together with Capitol Police officers . The gunman was taken into custody and later died of his injuries .
Lawmaker Jeff Duncan said he was leaving the practice when he was approached by a man he later learned was the shooter , who asked if the team was Republican or Democrat before heading toward the field .
`` I 'm shaken up , '' Duncan said . `` My colleagues were targeted today by someone that wanted to kill them . ''
Joe Barton , the Republican team manager , arrived at the US Capitol still wearing his red baseball uniform .
`` The heroes are the police officers who attacked the shooter , and in doing so quite probably saved many , many lives , '' the congressman said , his voice breaking .
GUN RIGHTS ADVOCATE
Scalise 's office said the 51-year-old was `` in good spirits '' before entering surgery , although the hospital later updated his status to critical .
The conservative from the southern state of Louisiana is helping lead the drive to repeal Barack Obama 's health care law .
He is also a firm supporter of the constitutional protection of the rights of Americans to bear arms and last month introduced legislation that relaxes restrictions on interstate gun sales .
Republican lawmaker Mo Brooks described Scalise dragging himself across the field in a bid to escape as the firing continued .
After the shots subsided , several people tended to Scalise . Brooks used his belt as a tourniquet for a bleeding staffer who was shot in the leg .

Several Democrats were practicing at a different field when they heard the news , and immediately gathered to pray for their wounded colleague .
Democrat Nanette Barragan said it will be `` bittersweet '' when she takes the field for her first congressional baseball game - under tightened security . `` We 're going to look over our shoulder a little bit , '' she said .
As in-fighting consumes the British government , Europeans have stepped up quiet preparations for a possible collapse of Brexit talks that could see Britain crash out of the EU without a deal 18 months from now .
BRUSSELS : As in-fighting consumes the British government , Europeans have stepped up quiet preparations for a possible collapse of Brexit talks that could see Britain crash out of the EU without a deal 18 months from now .
Prime Minister Theresa May 's EU counterparts still see the `` no-deal scenario '' she threatened them with as most unlikely , as they think it would hurt Britain much more than the continent .
But after her faltering party conference this week and ahead of important meetings in Brussels over the next fortnight , diplomats and officials there and in big member states said they have been putting renewed focus on contingency planning for a legal limbo in March 2019 and urging businesses to do the same .
German officials say that in recent months they have been spending just as much energy on how to handle that as on preparing for a negotiated solution . The BDI industry federation in the biggest EU economy warned German firms on Thursday that it would be `` naive '' not to be ready for a `` a very hard exit '' .
Like May , who on Friday rejected calls from some lawmakers to resign , Michel Barnier , the European Union negotiator , says his aim is an orderly exit . But he repeatedly cautions that he also has a mandate from EU leaders to help prepare for failure and regularly tells businesses to be sure to plan for the worst .
`` We want to be ready for all eventualities , including ‘ no deal ' , '' he told business and labour representatives after the negotiations began in July . Deal or no deal is `` the fundamental question '' , he said , after talks made little progress in August .

`` This is the growing feeling , absolutely , '' a senior EU official said of concerns that talks could collapse , not because Britain saw economic advantage in that , as May has warned , but because British politics could end up in domestic stalemate that could mean missing reasonable deadlines for a withdrawal treaty .
For many , talk of a breakdown in talks remains part of the bluff and counter-bluff of negotiations . But what May 's problems inside her own government indicate to many across the Channel is that the country is so divided it may be unable to reach a deal .
`` You need to factor in that it 's not a rational process , '' the senior EU official said , repeating a common view that voting for Brexit made no economic sense in the first place . `` So it 's not unlikely that they again shy away from what are the economic imperatives and we end up cliff-edging by political default . ''
CONTINGENCY PLANS
People close to Barnier 's negotiating team draw attention to new legislation last month aimed at protecting the EU carbon market from a disorderly British departure and moves to force euro-denominated securities clearing from London to the continent as examples of Brussels ' contingency planning .
`` It 's the responsible approach . And the more it goes on like this , '' said one EU official of the lack of clear breakthroughs in the talks , `` the more we 'll see of these steps . ''
Another senior official said : `` There 's every reason to be worried and European industry should take this more seriously . ''
May 's Brexit minister , David Davis , is expected back in Brussels on Monday for a fifth round of negotiations with Barnier . But expectations among EU officials are low to nil for a breakthrough on key divorce issues that would allow EU leaders to tell May when they meet her the following week that they are willing to open talks on a future free trade accord .
Aside from uncertainty over how a new EU border with Ireland will work and differences over rights for expatriates after Brexit , a standoff over tens of billions of euros that Brussels argues Britain will owe on departure seems far from resolution .
Describing as `` unbelievable arrogance '' British offers to pay just 20 billion euros ( £17.96 billion ) of a `` Brexit bill '' which the EU estimates at perhaps 60 billion euros , a senior diplomat from a country Britain generally views as an ally in EU affairs said May would have to face down hardliners who reject such payments .
Few of Britain 's negotiating partners see any benefit in a change of prime minister now . That would cost more time that neither side has , since the chances of London or Brussels agreeing to extend the Brexit deadline seem limited .
`` With Boris Johnson as prime minister , the negotiations would be easier , '' one EU diplomat said of the foreign secretary , who has sniped at May 's push for a deal that could see Britain stay bound by some EU rules , at least for a transition period .
`` We could save ourselves all this analysing , '' the diplomat said , `` As he 'd just drive the talks straight off the cliff . ''
For many , ending with a legal void remains far-fetched .
But though British ministers talk of a `` bespoke '' deal to exit EU rules while retaining market access , EU officials warn that time is running out for London to find any option other than to agree to something like the status of Norway - being in the EU market and accepting rules on which is has no vote .
`` Pretty soon , '' said one , `` It will be Norway or nothing . ''

HANOI : The communist party chief of one of Vietnam 's largest cities was fired on Friday ( Oct 6 ) for violating party rules , the government said , part of the country 's massive anti-corruption sweep targeting political heavyweights and executives .
Dozens of bankers , businessmen and current and former officials have been toppled in recent months as the notoriously corrupt one-party state vows to punish wrongdoing and polish its public image .
Analysts say the campaign is about political infighting as much as tackling corruption .
Danang party chief Nguyen Xuan Anh , 41 , was sacked for violating party rules , tarnishing the party 's reputation and sparking anger among his colleagues and the public , according to the party 's supervision commission .
`` Nguyen Xuan Anh 's violations and mistakes are serious , '' the commission said on its website Friday .
He is accused of setting a poor example for receiving a car from a company and for holding a doctorate degree from a US university not recognised by Vietnam 's Ministry of Education and Training .

The party committee also raised questions about his use of two different homes owned by companies .
Xuan Anh has been Danang party chief since 2015 , presiding over the fast-developing coastal city that will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) leaders ' summit in November .
US President Donald Trump is expected to attend the meeting in his first Asia jaunt since he was elected , along with the leaders of Russia , China and Japan , among others .
Xuan Anh 's takedown follows a series of high-profile anti-corruption cases .
In May , serving member of the politburo Dinh La Thang was fired over his previous stewardship of the massive state energy firm PetroVietnam ( PVN ) .
Thang was party chief of the southern financial hub Ho Chi Minh City when he was abruptly dismissed for mismanagement at PVN .
Officials had also sought his former colleague , Trinh Xuan Thanh , the former head of PVN 's construction unit accused of losses worth US $ 150 million , who fled Vietnam last year .
He was kidnapped from a Berlin park in August by Vietnamese security agents , according to German officials who decried the Cold-War style abduction as a `` scandalous violation '' of international law .
Thanh later appeared on state television in Hanoi where officials said he had voluntarily handed himself in .
Last week , 51 bankers and businessmen were convicted in a massive fraud case , including ex-banker Nguyen Xuan Son - who later chaired PVN - who was sentenced to death for causing losses worth millions of dollars .
Analysts have said that while previous administrations have waged anti-corruption drives , the current campaign is unique in its scope and speed .
Vietnam 's ranking on Transparency International 's Corruption Perceptions Index improved in 2016 for the first time since 2012 , to 113 out of 176 .
But it remains behind Thailand , Philippines , Indonesia and Malaysia and TI said earlier this year Vietnam `` has yet to show for a real breakthrough '' .
WASHINGTON — Police are checking 6,000 security cameras in an effort to trace the suspect 's steps after an explosion in a crowded subway corridor near the Port Authority Bus Terminal Monday morning . The explosion left at least five people injured .
CBS News homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues has been working his sources to find out more about 27-year-old Akayed Ullah .
Within hours of the explosion , heavily armed police swarmed the suspect 's apartment building in a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood .
Sources tell CBS News that Ullah made the bomb himself and that he was inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) to carry out the attack .
In Brooklyn , neighbors say the one-time taxi driver and electrician , largely kept to himself , rarely speaking more than a few words when they 'd see him .
But Kisslyn Joseph says she told police something stood out over the weekend that caught her attention .
“ The only thing that I heard was an argument that happened on Sunday morning , it was like , uh , around 2:00 , 3:00 in the morning , ” Joseph told CBS News .
Audio from Broadcastify captured some of the moments Monday as the incident unfolded : “ We got a perp down with a device in a tunnel . Central , four two and eighth . There are reports of an explosion over division . ”
Ullah came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011 . He arrived in the country with his parents and siblings on a family immigrant visa , eventually becoming a legal permanent resident .
Investigators are trying to determine who else might have known about Ullah 's plan to detonate a bomb Monday morning .
They 'll be looking for his electronic devices to see what he may have been doing online , and scanning terrorism databases to see if he was in contact with terror groups .
A photo confirmed by CBS News showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with his shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering his bare midriff . A police officer is holding the man 's hands behind his back .
A law enforcement source tells CBS News ' Jeff Pegues that four Port Authority Police officers apprehended the suspect . When they encountered him , there was smoke around him and debris all over the floor . CBS News has learned that Ullah sustained a shrapnel wound . He was taken to a Manhattan hospital .
The source also says as police approached the suspect appeared to be reaching for a cellphone and he had wires protruding from his jacket and his pants .
The four officers identified as making the arrest range in age from 26 to 45 years old . Three of them served in the military , with one of them being a bomb technician , Pegues reports .
Sources tell CBS News that in September , the suspect was back in Bangladesh for about a month . In the past , Ullah also visited the United Arab Emirates . The investigation will likely stretch into those countries as well .
A unit of Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group 's pharmaceutical business on Monday said it is bidding for a stake in U.S. speciality drugmaker Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC .
HONG KONG : A unit of Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group 's pharmaceutical business on Monday said it is bidding for a stake in U.S. speciality drugmaker Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC .
Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said in a stock exchange filing its Hong Kong unit submitted a non-binding bid for a stake in Arbor , which is backed by private equity firm KKR & Co LP , without disclosing the financial terms .
The unit has not entered exclusive talks with the seller and will begin conducting due diligence to determine further steps , Fosun Pharma said .
Atlanta-based Arbor produces mainly branded prescription drugs for the pediatric , hospital and cardiovascular markets .
New York-based KKR agreed to buy more than a quarter of shares in the company in December 2014 , in a deal that valued privately held Arbor at over US $ 1 billion .

BUFFALO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) — Parents and teachers are fed up with bed bugs at Buffalo Public School 37 .
Parents received a letter from the district last week that stated an individual in the building had possible bug bites .
The Buffalo Teachers Federation ( BTF ) says school officials are n't doing enough to handle the problem .
A Buffalo parent , Michelle Eggleston , says her 7 year-old son goes to School 37 . Eggleston says she pulled him out of school last Friday because the issue was n't resolved .
“ I 'm not sending my son to school and I bring home these bugs , because they 're not going to pay for my house to be fumigated , and I ca n't afford it . Thursday , I went in , and there 's stuff everywhere . People are throwing out their classroom stuff , you know people are just- their hair 's all tied up , they say they put rubbing alcohol on the kids , there are kids still missing from school , it 's not taken care of , ” said Eggleston .
The teachers union says the issue should have been dealt with quickly and decisively . The BTF filed a grievance against the district for exposing teachers to unsafe and unhealthy working conditions .
“ What we 're looking for is a governmental agency that will go in there and tell them , look , you got to do better , you have to have a policy and you have to make sure that this does not happen , ” said Phil Rumore , President of BTF .
The teachers union also said during a meeting with a parent , a bed bug crawled onto a teacher 's hand , latching on to the teacher 's finger . The union said after that , the teacher did n't feel safe going to work and was afraid of bringing the bed bugs home .
Eggleston tells us because the issue is n't resolved , she 's not sending her child back to School 37 .
“ He 's already been pulled out for next year . Like I am not returning him to that school next year . I just feel bad , I did n't want it to have to come to this . you know I love the staff at that school , but it really needed to be handled better , and the ball was dropped big time on this , ” said Eggleston .
Buffalo Public Schools issued this statement :
“ In our ongoing effort to address occasional sightings the District has contracted with an experienced and qualified pest management company . They have responded to the situation and continue to inspect and monitor the school . As we review what we have done so far and obtain more information , we will adjust our plan accordingly . “ We have sent letters and provided information to the staff and parents of School # 37 , including the basics of identification of the bed bugs in the home and what can be done to help prevent the spread. ” Yvette Gordon , Director of Safety and Health
LOS ANGELES : Ava DuVernay may be the first black female director to be Oscar-nominated for a documentary , but it 's not something she is especially happy about .
Like her film , `` 13th , '' which explores the far-reaching repercussions of slavery in the United States today , DuVernay says the Oscar nomination merely demonstrates how little progress has been made .
`` It 's bittersweet because I know I 'm not the first black woman deserving of these things , '' DuVernay , 44 , told Reuters Television .
`` I hope that it is also really clear that we are way behind on where we should be ... and that women and people of color do n't intend for it to be another 100 years for the second and the third . ''
`` 13th '' argues that although it has been 150 years since slavery was officially abolished in the United States , it is still alive in the form of mass incarceration that disproportionately affects black people .
The documentary notes that the U.S. prison population rose from 357,000 in 1970 to 2.3 million in 2014 . While black men account for some 6.6 percent of the U.S. population , they currently make up 40.2 percent of the prison population .
`` 13th '' has already won a British BAFTA award and a slew of critics prizes , making it a front-runner for the best documentary Oscar at the Feb. 26 ceremony .
DuVernay is currently celebrating another first . She is directing the movie version of the children 's classic book `` A Wrinkle in Time , '' which marks the first time a black woman in Hollywood has commanded a US $ 100 million movie budget .
`` Now that some of these things have been broken that they need to be shattered and we need to move forward in a more robust inclusive way , '' she said .

NBA All-Star Game Spotlights LGBT Oasis
NEW ORLEANS ( AP ) — The city hosting this year 's NBA All-Star game has long enjoyed a reputation as a welcoming place for the gay and lesbian community . New Orleans is home to one of the country 's oldest gay bars , the gay celebration Southern Decadence draws nearly 200,000 people yearly , and gay and lesbian authors flock here for the Saints and Sinners literary festival .
All of that acceptance will be on full display this weekend in a not-so-subtle statement about equality .
The city of Charlotte was supposed to host the All-Star game Sunday , but the NBA moved it to New Orleans when North Carolina passed “ the bathroom bill , ” which limits protections for lesbian , gay and transgender people . It also requires transgender people to use many public restrooms corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate .
Louisiana has n't passed laws similar to North Carolina . Gov . John Bel Edwards touted the state 's diversity while lobbying the NBA , saying bringing the game here would reaffirm the league 's “ commitment to communities that value fairness and inclusion . ”
Just last year , Edwards signed an executive order barring discrimination against LGBT state workers and contractors .
“ We were able to recruit and bring the NBA here because of positive pro-equality work that the city and state have been doing , ” said SarahJane Guidry , who heads the Forum for Equality , a Louisiana group advocating for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people .
She said Edwards ' executive order went further than his Democratic predecessors by including transgender people ( immediate predecessor Republican Gov . Bobby Jindal did not sign any such order ) . The order has since stalled in legal wrangling but Guidry still considers it important .
Activists also point out New Orleans passed an ordinance protecting the LGB community in 1991 and extended it in 1997 to the transgender community .
Kathy Behrens , the NBA 's President of Social Responsibility & Player Programs , said a variety of factors went into picking New Orleans . The issue of LGBT inclusion played a role as did the city 's ability to work under a tight deadline and track record of putting on big events ; it hosted the All-Star game in 2014 .
“ It 's important for us to have our All-Star game in a city that 's welcoming to all of our participants and guests , ” she said . She said the city and state “ know how to manage and put on great big fun events and welcome everyone and treat everyone fairly and equally . ”
Beyond the laws , the city has long had a status as a welcoming place for gay and lesbian people — Tennessee Williams , author of “ A Streetcar Named Desire , ” called New Orleans home for years .
“ Any young gay man or girl from Texas to Oklahoma to all the way to Georgia , when they came out , would come here or if they got kicked out by their parents , ” said Frank Perez , author “ In Exile , ” about the city 's LGBT community . “ You either go to New York , San Francisco , Chicago or New Orleans . ”
Perez credits part of the welcoming atmosphere to the city 's French settlers — “ puritanical morality ” never really took over here .
Mardi Gras — a holiday where people dress in elaborate costumes and mask their identities — also played a key role , said Wayne Phillips , author of an upcoming book about the history of gay Carnival in New Orleans .
The first gay krewe formed in 1958 . They gathered yearly for their ball until a 1962 police raid ended with dozens of people arrested . Phillips said some hypothesize it was instigated by someone who did n't get an invite .
But instead of being cowed , another gay Carnival group — Petronius — decided the key to survival was getting formal recognition like other krewes . So the group got a signed charter with the secretary of state .
Petronius is still in existence today , and its tactic was emulated by other gay krewes in the 1960s . Phillips said the krewes were essential to New Orleans becoming a center for sexual identity diversity in the South .
“ They … provided a de-facto family , particularly in the early years — 1960s and 1970s — when many of these men moved to New Orleans , perhaps leaving their own family behind and finding a new family in New Orleans , ” he said .
Not to say the city 's LGBT community has n't faced challenges . Perez describes raids on gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s and arson that killed 32 people at a club in 1973 .
This year 's All-Star game-related activities feature a number of LGBT-friendly aspects . The Forum for Equality is hosting a reception with the NBA 's New Orleans Pelicans to help kick off the week 's events .
The host group putting on the game created an “ inclusion committee ” to reach out to LGBT businesses , said Jay Cicero , who heads the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation , which led the bid to get the game here .
And the NBA is partnering with organizations including Athlete Ally , which tries to end homophobia in sports , on a forum to educate area coaches on gender and sexuality issues .
Troy Glines , a gay man hanging out one evening outside Cafe Lafitte in Exile , a bar that has operated since 1933 , said he 's a football fan and the NBA 's decision is n't going to make him any more likely to watch basketball . But he praised the league for pulling the game from Charlotte .
“ It was absolutely a good thing . Money , that 's where you can put a hurt on somebody , ” he said .

Text messages from a British Sainsbury 's worker helped save a kidnapped four-year-old girl in America .
Supermarket worker Harry Brown , 21 , traced little Yvette Henley to a motel in Arizona after befriending her estranged father , who had fled .
He started talking to Virgil Henley , 28 , on Facebook after the pair had coincidentally connected online a few years ago .
Harry chatted to Henley politely over messenger , asking him about money , the weather , and eventually offered to get him a pizza .
They exchanged messages back and forth for a while , but when Henley accepted the offer of the pizza , Harry was able to give police his location .
Harry asked him : `` Do you want a pizza ? ''
Henley replied : `` My kidneys hurt soo bad I ca n't eat but my wife does . ''
He then gave Harry the hotel address and his room number .
Previously Yvette was reportedly staying with her father when a court granted guardianship to her grandparents , Gary and Kim Forester .
But after the hearing in June , which found that Yvette was suffering “ emotional damage ” and was in danger , her dad was unaware of the outcome and nowhere to be found .
The girl 's anxious grandparents contacted police who launched an investigation , but after almost three weeks she was still nowhere to be seen .
It was n't until Gary , 46 , and Kim , 47 , contacted Harry - a total stranger - that they jointly managed to solve the case and find Yvette .
After discovering Harry and Henley were Facebook friends , Yvette 's grandparents pleaded with him to help them , so he agreed and struck up a conversation with their estranged family member out of the blue .
Over two days of talking , Harry teased information out of him and learnt he had taken his girlfriend Alyssa , 28 , and Yvette to Arizona , where they stayed in cheap hotels or slept rough .
He eventually pinpointed their exact location by offering to order a pizza to his room at a motel and even convincing him to hand over the room number .
Instead of the food showing up at the door , police did . Yvette was recovered and is now living safely with her grandparents in California , who has custody .
Harry , of Staines , Surrey , said : “ I spend my life on the internet but little did I know that talking to random people would lead to me finding this little girl .
“ She is loving where she is now . I cried so much when I saw the photos of her with her grandparents .
“ The police had been trying to find her since May and within two days I got his exact location .
“ It 's a really weird set of circumstances that fell into place . Before , Yvette was probably living a nightmare .
“ Now she is in the best place possible for her . She is having the happiest days of her life .
The dad , who was using a Facebook profile under the name Mark Johnson , let slip his location while complaining about the humidity , ranting : “ f * cking HATE Arizona ” .
Harry later managed to get his exact location in Kingman , Arizona by offering to buy him pizza .
Harry , who plans to fly out to California to meet Yvette and her grandparents soon , added : “ He said he did n't want any but his wife did .
“ He gave me his exact address and room number . I rang Gary straight away . ”
San Bernadino County Sheriff 's Dept said : “ The missing person report for Yvette Henley was filed by her grandfather on June 20 in Hesperia .
“ He believed Yvette was with her parents and he had not been able to reach them .
“ The grandfather was given guardianship of Yvette also on June 20 .
“ At the time he filed the report it had been 10 days since he had last seen the three of them . ”
A spokeswoman added : “ On July 9th the reporting party contacted the Hesperia Station stating he had been advised that the child was located in Kingman , Arizona .
“ Child Protective services was contacting Kingman and the reporting party stated he would be going to Kingman to pick up the child . ”
Salman Khan joined Katrina Kaif on Vogue India 's December 2017 cover in what was a first for the actor , who has enjoyed a loyal following ever since he made his lead debut in Maine Pyaar Kiya , and went on to star in Bollywood blockbusters like Hum Aapke Hain Koun , Judwaa , Dabangg and more . If you 're a fan of the Tiger Zinda Hai star and love collecting trivia about his life , here are five things that happened on the set of our cover shoot that may interest you :
1 . Each time he saw Katrina Kaif stepping out of the van in her look for a shot , he had a natural , genuine look of awe on his face that was priceless .
2 . No on-set buffet for him . He had a full spread of delicious-looking food brought to him from home and he was sweet enough to offer it to us . It looked healthy too ; we spotted some brown rice in there .
3 . Contrary to what you would expect from a celebrity , as soon as Salman Khan arrived on set , he said , “ chalo I 'm ready , let 's start ” . Actors usually take 40 minutes to an hour to be ready for a shot once they 're on set . He announced he would need only 10 minutes for hair and makeup as he had started in the car , and he stuck to his word : He was in front of the camera in 10 minutes .
4 . With fans following every move and even arriving on far-flung sets just to get a peek , it would be understandable if the star sought some quiet time in his vanity van between shots . But Khan does n't like sitting in the van . Instead , there is a set-up of tables and chairs in a tent right outside his van , which makes it easier for his loyalists to access him .
5 . The celebrity loves breaking into his famous dialogues in his iconic accent from time to time . This takes you straight back to the Salman Khan you knew and loved growing up .

The criminal investigation into the Grenfell Tower fire in London in which 71 people were killed is “ unprecedented ” , a police spokesman said on Monday at the opening of a public inquiry into the blaze .
“ Outside certain counter-terrorism inquiries , the investigation is unprecedented in terms of its scale and complexity , ” Jeremy Johnson , a lawyer for London 's Metropolitan Police , said at the hearing .
Johnson said police were examining possible offences of manslaughter , corporate manslaughter , misconduct in public office and fire safety breaches .
The investigation into the west London blaze involves a team of 187 police officers and civilian staff and has so far taken statements from 1,144 witnesses , he said .
“ Nothing has been excluded from the scope of the criminal investigation , ” he said , promising a “ meticulous , thorough and fearless ” probe .

Scotland Yard said last month that 71 people had died , including a stillborn baby . Police said they were hoping to wrap up their investigation in late 2018 .
The public inquiry , which is expected to produce recommendations for fire safety in public housing , will run alongside the police investigation .
Survivors and people who lived in the vicinity of the apartment block have already criticised the inquiry , however , saying they are not sufficiently involved .
Monday 's hearing ruled that 424 individuals or groups , including some survivors , would be granted “ core participant ” status in the inquiry meaning they have access to documents , can make statements and can question witnesses through legal representatives .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission , a non-departmental public body , said it had begun its own investigation that would look at issues that might be “ overlooked ” by the official inquiry .

Justice Olusola Williams of a Lagos Special Offences Court , Ikeja Lagos on Wednesday asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , EFCC , to produce the chairman of Innosson Motors Limited , Innocent Chukwuma , in court for arraignment .
Justice Williams made this pronouncement due to the absence of Chairman of Innoson Motors Nigeria Ltd , who was scheduled to be arraigned before her over an alleged forgery charge against him by the EFCC .
The judge said : “ I believe it is the job of the prosecution to bring the defendant to court because they are the Executives .
The judge is just to make an order that he should appear in court but we can not enforce the order , the responsibility still lies on the EFCC to make sure he is in court , ” She said .
Innoson 's non-appearance in court is the sixth time he will be absent in court after he had refused to appear before Justice Mojisola Dada of a Special Offence Court , Ikeja .
He has also been declared wanted by the court by Justice Dada following the request by the commission .
Justice Dada was however withdrawn from the case on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council ( NJC ) responding to the Feb. 12 petition of the automobile boss .
The matter has been re-assigned to Justice Williams for arraignment .
At the resume of the proceedings on Wednesday , Innocent Chukwuma , was also absent in court when the matter was called .
Counsel to the prosecution , A.B.C Ozioko , informed the court that the defendant and his counsel are absent in court .
” My lord it appears that the second defendant and my learned colleagues from the other side are not in court .
“ He has refused to come for his arraignment for the sixth time even when the matter was before your learned brother , Justice Dada despite all efforts to bring him here .
“ He has also filed seven different applications in-between the period he was supposed to be arraigned , ” he said .
Ozioko further told the court that the 2nd defendant Innocent Chukwuma is the alter-ego of the 1st defendant which is his company .
He said the application he submitted before the court earlier includes : an application challenging the jurisdiction of the court , an application to disqualify himself from the charge before the court .
Other applications include an order of stay of execution on the bench warrant issued by the court and a stay of execution of the warrant of arrest among others .
The prosecution also informed the court that Innoson boss , has refused to honour the court order by his continuous absence in court after he was granted an administrative bail by the EFCC .
“ My lord , in view of the absence of the defendant , we shall be asking for an adjournment date . ”
Justice Williams , however , told the EFCC 's counsel to do all he can do to bring the defendant to court .
She further said that one of the court 's registrar informed her that someone came to file a motion on behalf of the defendant and the registrar made an attempt to serve him the hearing notice but the person refused to collect it .
“ It is the prosecution 's duty to make sure the defendant is in court to answer his case .
“ I ca n't be issuing an order to a defendant that seems not to be existing .
“ I will give you a date and anytime you are able to arrest the defendant , just inform the court registrars and bring him to court for arraignment . ”
The judge thereafter adjourned the matter till October 10 , 2018 , for arraignment .
Chukwuma and his company , Innoson Motors Nigeria Ltd. , were to be arraigned on a four-count charge of conspiracy to obtain property by false pretences , obtaining property by false pretences , stealing and forgery in a transaction with Guaranty Trust Bank ( GTB ) .

After the second-longest game in AUS women 's hockey history ( 97:17 of playing time ) , the Huskies women 's hockey team has won their second consecutive championship . Third year forward Gemma MacDonald scored the winner in triple overtime to put the Huskies up 3-2 . Winning the series after three one-goal games against St. Francis Xavier , the Huskies demonstrated what exceptional hockey looks like .
All six of the # 3-nationally-ranked Huskies playoff games were one goal games , in fact . The Huskies were challenged in the semifinals by Moncton , who came fifth in the regular season . However , they prevailed to face upset winners St. FX for a physical , high-shooting final series . Opening the series at home on March 3rd 2017 , the Huskies claimed a 3-2 win , with one goal from Laura Polak and two from rookie and eventual playoff MVP Siobhan Birch . Up by three goals until halfway through the third period , St. FX nearly started a comeback , scoring one after the ten-minute mark . With less than five to play , St. FX 's Daley Oddy instigated a near-brawl with a hit to the head on Siobhan Birch . SMU 's Caitlyn Manning and the X-Women 's Heather Tillsley traded punches before being called on roughing . Oddy received a double minor for her hit , but SMU gave up a goal on the power play to make it a 3-2 game . However , the Huskies held on for the win .
The Huskies lost 2-1 in Antigonish on March 5th 2017 , with Nicole Blanche scoring the lone goal and Rebecca Clark making 35 saves in the loss . Returning home for the do-or-die game , the Huskies wowed the home crowd with their intensity and tenacity . Caitlyn Manning scored under five minutes into the game , but St. FX responded by the end of the first . Oddy put X up 2-1 early in the 3rd , but Nicole Blanche responded minutes later with an assist from Hannah Askin . The teams traded shots and chances for over fifty more minutes before MacDonald , from Askin and Polak , ended the game in triple overtime .
The Huskies swarmed the ice , celebrating the win . But the celebration wo n't last long – the team travels to Napanee , Ontario , along with St. FX , next week to compete at the U Sports championship starting March 16th .

( SCOTT BURNSTEIN - For Digital First Media ) Foster Loyer is joined by his Clarkston teammates after being named the Hal Schram Mr. Basketball Award on Monday .
DETROIT > > Clarkstons Foster Loyer had a lot to live up to for his high school basketball career . The Michigan State-bound , 6-foot-0 point guard has lived up to it all .
On Monday , Loyer was named Michigans 2018 Hal Schram Mr. Basketball Award winner , the honor given annually to the top player in the states senior class . And it wasnt even close . Loyer beat out runner-up Brandon Johns of East Lansing by almost 1,000 votes ( 3,691 to 2,792 ) . Johns is headed to Michigan for his college career . Loyer becomes the first player from Oakland County to win the award since Rochesters Paul Davis collected the trophy in 2002 . Davis also went on to Michigan State .
To receive such a prestigious award of this magnitude is a surreal experience ,  said Loyer at a ceremony held at The Detroit Free Press in front of a gathering of his teammates , coaches , family and media . I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the people that helped me get here and most of them are in this room right now . Just to be mentioned in the same category as all the excellent players to have won this award before me means so much and its something I dont take lightly and will appreciate forever.
Besides Davis , other Oakland County cagers to bag the honor include future NBA standouts Chris Webber and Shane Battier of Birmingham Detroit Country Day and his future assistant coach in college , Dane Fife , the son of his current head coach , Dan Fife , also a Clarkston alum .

The Fife family laid the foundation for Clarkston basketball , its incredibly special for me to be in that conversation when discussing our programs history ,  Loyer said .
Last year , Loyer led Clarkston to the programs first state title . With word circulating while he was still in middle school about his status as a prodigy on the hardwood , he entered the prep ranks in 2014 with the expectation of greatness . It didnt take long for him to start achieving it . A four-year first-team all-state selection , his teams have accumulated a glitzy 96-4 overall record . Hes averaging 27 points , seven assists , four rebounds and three steals per game this season .
Clarkston ( 23-1 ) and its freshly-minted Mr. Basketball will face Flint Carman-Ainsworth in the Class A quarterfinals today . The final four is played on Loyers future home court in college , the Breslin Center in East Lansing .
This is a great way to start the week off , today will act as a motivator for the rest of what Im hoping will be a long , but rewarding five days ,  he said . I plan on having no regrets.
Dan Fife gushed with praise about his star floor general in the aftermath of Mondays announcement .
I have supreme confidence in Foster as a playmaker and as a young man ,  he said . Hes a true coach on the court . Hes answered the call for us through these last four years in every way humanly possible . Never once has he ever let us down , on or off the basketball floor . Thats the kind of kid he is.

Tensions on the Korean peninsula eased slightly on Monday as South Korea 's president said resolving Pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions must be done peacefully and key U.S. officials played down the risk of an imminent war with North Korea .
SEOUL/BEIJING : Tensions on the Korean peninsula eased slightly on Monday as South Korea 's president said resolving Pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions must be done peacefully and key U.S. officials played down the risk of an imminent war with North Korea .
Concern that North Korea is close to achieving its goal of putting the mainland United States within range of a nuclear weapon has underpinned a spike in tensions in recent months .
U.S. President Donald Trump warned at the weekend that the U.S. military was `` locked and loaded '' if North Korea acted unwisely after threatening last week to land missiles near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam .
`` There must be no more war on the Korean peninsula . Whatever ups and downs we face , the North Korean nuclear situation must be resolved peacefully , '' South Korean President Moon Jae-in told a regular meeting with senior aides and advisers .
`` I am certain the United States will respond to the current situation calmly and responsibly in a stance that is equal to ours , '' he said .
While backing Trump 's tough talk , officials including National Security Adviser H.R . McMaster on Sunday played down the risk of the rhetoric escalating into conflict .

`` I think we 're not closer to war than a week ago , but we are closer to war than we were a decade ago , '' McMaster told ABC News ' `` This Week '' .
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un might well conduct another missile test but talk of being on the cusp of a nuclear war was overstating the risk .
`` I 've seen no intelligence that would indicate that we 're in that place today , '' Pompeo told `` Fox News Sunday '' .
North Korea reiterated its threats on Monday , with its official KCNA news agency saying `` war can not be blocked by any power if sparks fly due to a small , random incident that was unintentional '' .
`` Any second Korean War would have no choice but to spread into a nuclear war , '' it said in a commentary .
MISSILE DOUBTS
South Korean Vice Defence Minister Suh Choo-suk agreed North Korea was likely to continue provocations , including nuclear tests , but did not see a big risk of the North engaging in actual military conflict .
Suh again highlighted doubts about North Korea 's claims about its military capability .
`` Both the United States and South Korea do not believe North Korea has yet completely gained re-entry technology in material engineering terms , '' Suh said in remarks televised on Sunday for a Korea Broadcasting System show .
The United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce , not a peace treaty .
Tension in the region has risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July , tests that the North often conducts to coincide with important national dates .
Tuesday marks the anniversary of Japan 's expulsion from the Korean peninsula , a rare holiday celebrated by both the North and the South . Moon and Kim , who has not been seen publicly for several days , are both expected to make addresses on their respective sides of the heavily militarised border .
Trump has urged China , the North 's main ally and trading partner , to do more to rein in its neighbour , often linking Beijing 's efforts to comments around U.S.-China trade . China strenuously rejects linking the two issues .
Trump will issue an order later on Monday to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property , senior administration officials said on Saturday .
China 's official China Daily said such an investigation would poison the relationship between the two countries .
`` By trying to incriminate Beijing as an accomplice in ( North Korea 's ) nuclear adventure and blame it for a failure that is essentially a failure of all stakeholders , Trump risks making the serious mistake of splitting up the international coalition that is the means to resolve the issue peacefully , '' it said .
`` Hopefully Trump will find another path . Things will become even more difficult if Beijing and Washington are pitted against each other . ''
STOCKS RALLY
Asian stocks rallied on Monday as investors took heart from the less bellicose rhetoric after fleeing riskier assets last week .
Financial markets regard tensions between Pyongyang and Washington as more serious than in the past , South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said .
`` The effect from North Korea-related jitters on financial and foreign exchange markets has been causing some global anxiety and we can not rule out market volatility can widen from the smallest shock , '' he said .
Kim Dong-yeon will meet South Korea 's central bank governor on Wednesday to discuss the risk to markets and potential stabilising measures , according to the Bank of Korea .
U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford is visiting Seoul to discuss the rise in tensions ahead of major U.S.-South Korean joint military drills scheduled for later this month .
South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Lee Jin-woo said the drills , long a source of aggravation for Pyongyang , would go ahead as planned .
`` They are just , legal and annual drills that are focused on defence and to curb North Korea 's provocations , '' he told a regular briefing in Seoul .

The deal underscores PepsiCo 's efforts to strengthen its healthy snack portfolio as consumer tastes shift toward products that are less processed .
PepsiCo announced it is buying Bare Foods , a San Francisco-based startup that sells baked fruit chips and vegetable chips .
The terms were not disclosed , but CNBC , citing an unnamed source , reported the deal was valued at less than $ 200 million .
“ PepsiCo is the right partner to help bring our simply baked fruit and vegetable snacks to even more consumers across the world , ” Bare Foods Chief Executive Santosh Padki stated on Friday .
Bare Foods , which operates as Bare Snacks , said it would still operate independently from its San Francisco headquarters and report to Frito-Lay North America .
In the past , Padki has been critical of the traditional packaged-food industry .
“ Big companies have faced problems with quality and not connecting to the consumer , and now they are backing into a corner , ” he said in a recent interview .
“ Other brands have tried to make inroads in produce , but ( retail ) buyers do n't really have the space . ”
Bare offers apple , banana , beet and coconut chips , which are baked rather than fried . Its products are sold alongside fresh produce , making them visible to more shoppers since fewer people browse the center grocery aisles , Dow Jones reported .
“ While we will continue to offer the current Bare Snacks product line , we look forward to working with the Bare Snacks team to deliver new , innovative options , and ultimately expanded distribution , to meet the ever-growing consumer demands for authentic and nutritious snacks , ” the president and chief operating officer of Frito-Lay North America , Vivek Sankaran , said .
Reuters says the acquisition underscores PepsiCo 's efforts to strengthen its healthy snack portfolio as consumer tastes shift toward products that are less processed and lower in salt .
Last year , Kellogg said it would buy the owner of RXBAR protein bars for $ 600 million while Campbell Soup bought the maker of Cape Cod potato chips in a $ 4.9 billion deal .

President Nigeria Labour Congress ( NLC ) , Comrade Ayuba Wabba , has called for an upward review of pension to help minimise economic hardship facing pensioners .
Wabba said this at the 16th edition of Pensioners Day Celebration in Abuja .
He said that the review of pension was long overdue , saying Federal and State government had been adhering to the constitutional provision .
“ Section173 ( 3 ) and 210 ( 3 ) of the federal republic of Nigeria constitution 1999 ( as amended ) stipulate that pension be reviewed every five years or together with any increase in workers ' wages . ''
According to him , it is criminal that federal government pays N4000 as pension to some pension in this hard economy , if we want a better Nigerian than we must be willing to take care of our pensioners and workers .
“ Our country is so blessed with various resources but it is a pity that we can not account how it has been spent . ”
He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for releasing the bailout fund to states to pay pensioners and workers , urging that government monitors and make them accountable on how the money was spent .

He said government needs to take care of the security and welfare of its people in other to avert some of the security challenges in the country .
He appealed to pensioners to support one another , adding that the NLC will continue to show their support and solidarity .
Executive Secretary of Pension Transitional Administration Directorate , Ms Sharon Ikeazor , said the payroll for pensioners for December was ready and pensioners would get their pension before Christmas .
“ We got releases to pay six months out of 12 months been owed civil service pension out of the 36 month we have paid six months out of it .
“ For police pension we paid them one year out of the 33 months and we just have a balance for 12 months for police pensions .
“ Government is making the money available we will pay up , ” she said .
She said the essence of the verification was to make sure pensioners were fully capture so that there would not be need for them to come back again .
Ikeazor promised that by the first quarter of 2018 the directorate would pay the arrears of the 33 per cent increase .

BRUSSELS : Israel 's leader said Monday ( Dec 11 ) the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the Jewish state 's capital `` makes peace possible '' as he faced renewed pressure from Europe to reboot the Middle East 's moribund peace process .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move by US President Donald Trump - which prompted diplomatic alarm and street protests across the Islamic world - had `` put facts squarely on the table '' .
He spoke as he arrived for talks at the EU , where the bloc 's diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini urged Israel to find a `` sustainable and comprehensive solution '' to the decades-long conflict with the Palestinians .
The EU expressed alarm last week at the US decision , but Netanyahu said Trump had `` put facts squarely on the table '' by acknowledging Jerusalem had been the capital of the Israeli state for 70 years and of the Jewish people for 3,000 years .
`` It does n't obviate peace , it makes peace possible , because recognising reality is the substance of peace , it 's the foundation of peace , '' he said in a statement alongside Mogherini ahead of a breakfast meeting with EU foreign ministers .
lestinians following widespread protests over the US move .

The Jerusalem decision upended decades of US diplomacy and broke with international consensus . Mogherini last week warned it could take the situation `` backwards to even darker times '' .
Mogherini said the EU - the Palestinians ' largest donor - would step up efforts with the two sides and regional partners including Jordan and Egypt to relaunch the peace process .
`` We believe it is in Israel 's interest , especially in the security interest of Israel , to find a sustainable and comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , '' Mogherini said .
Netanyahu has praised Trump 's decision as `` historic '' and he explained To Sunday that Jerusalem `` has always been our capital and it has never been the capital of any other people '' .
Both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital and previous peace plans have stumbled over debates on whether and how to divide sovereignty or oversee holy sites .
Mogherini also condemned attacks on Israel - after Netanyahu took aim over the weekend at what he called Europe 's `` hypocrisy '' for condemning Trump 's statement , but not `` the rockets fired at Israel or the terrible incitement against it '' .
`` Let me condemn in the strongest possible way all attacks on Jews everywhere in the world , including in Europe , and on Israel and on Israeli citizens , '' Mogherini said .
Netanyahu pointed to a new US peace initiative as a possible way forward .
`` There is now an effort under way to bring forward a new peace proposal by the American administration . I think we should give peace a chance . I think we should see what is presented and see if we can advance this peace , '' he said .
Trump 's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been working with a small team to develop a new US proposal to revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians , but it is not clear what progress he is making .
EU NOT UNIFIED
Most EU members , including the bloc 's biggest countries , have expressed alarm over the Trump administration 's policy shift .
Alongside Netanyahu on Monday Mogherini repeated Europe 's stance that `` the only realistic solution '' for peace is two states - Israel and Palestine - with Jerusalem as the capital of both and the borders returned to their status before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War .
But the 28-member block is not unified on the issue - Hungary , Greece , Lithuania and the Czech Republic in particular favour warmer ties with Israel .
And last week Hungary broke ranks to block a joint statement from the EU that was critical of Washington 's Jerusalem shift .
Trump 's announcement on Wednesday has been followed by days of protests and clashes in the Palestinian territories .
Four Palestinians were killed either in clashes or from Israeli air strikes in retaliation for rockets fired from the Gaza Strip .
Tens of thousands have also protested in Muslim and Arab countries , including Jordan , Turkey , Pakistan and Malaysia .
Macron was also asked if France would attempt to launch another peace initiative to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict following failed efforts in the past .
`` There 's a desire by the Americans to mediate which remains and I do n't want to condemn it ab initio ( from the beginning ) , '' he said . `` We need to wait for the next few weeks , the next months to see what will be proposed .

LONDON : England striker Danny Welbeck says he has emerged mentally stronger after a knee injury ruled him out of the 2016 European Championships and the 27-year-old is keen to make an impact in next month 's World Cup in Russia .
Welbeck was sidelined for eight months after undergoing surgery for the knee problem but the Arsenal forward has since forced his way back into England manager Gareth Southgate 's plans .

`` Missing out on the last tournament with injury was frustrating for me , '' Welbeck told British media .
`` If you get a big injury , it is not easy at all to deal with it . It 's a lonely period when you 're not out on the pitch helping your teammates and doing what you love doing .
`` You can develop mentally when you 're away from the pitch . You can take all that frustration , pain and hurt from not playing and try and use that as a way of helping you and reminding you of what you are missing out on . ''
Welbeck has 15 international goals in 37 matches , the most for any player in the squad bound for Russia and three more than first choice striker Harry Kane , and will look to add to his tally when England takes on Nigeria in a friendly on Saturday ( Jun 2 ) .

`` I have n't pointed that out to the manager , he knows all the ins and outs but that is something I want to build on , '' Welbeck added ahead of the match at Wembley . `` I have had a lot of success on the international stage and I want that to continue . ''

Hilary Duff 's ex-husband Mike Comrie is reportedly under police investigation over a rape allegation .
The retired ice hockey star , who used to play in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , has been accused of raping a woman at his Los Angeles home on Saturday night , according to TMZ.com .
An unnamed woman has claimed she met him in a bar that night and they went back to his place and he raped her “ multiple times ” . She reportedly went to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center soon afterwards and had a rape kit administered .
Sources connected to the 36-year-old former athlete claim the woman , who Mike has allegedly known for a long time , had given her full consent to sex . They also allege there was another woman present during their sexual encounter and she has not filed a complaint .
Officers with the Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) are investigating the allegation but have not yet spoken to Mike , according to the site .
Mike began dating 29-year-old actress/singer Hilary Duff in 2007 , they tied the knot in 2010 and have a four-year-old son named Luca . Hilary filed for divorce in February , 2015 , citing irreconcilable differences and requesting primary custody of their son , and it was finalized in February , 2016 .
They have remained friends ever since and have regularly been spotted together with their son . She spoke to The Love Bomb podcast in November about how they handled the split .
“ I think that I was in a very successful marriage for a long time , ” she said . “ We got together based on love and we separated in a very loving way . I ca n't imagine going through that process with anyone but him , and he continues to be my very good friend .
“ I think we handled it very consciously and with a lot of love . But marriage is sacred and marriage is not for everyone . Marriage is work . Marriage is really hard . ”
She has since dated trainer Jason Walsh , and in January , she made her red carpet debut with new man , musician Matthew Koma .

MADRID : Spanish police have dismantled a prostitution network that exploited transsexuals recruited in fake `` Miss Trans '' competitions in Venezuela that promised winners the opportunity of a new life in Spain .
Police said on Monday they had freed over 20 victims forced to live in `` inhumane conditions '' in overcrowded apartments in Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca where they had to pay off debts through prostitution and drug dealing .
The network lured transsexuals to Spain by offering to pay for their travel and accommodation , along with new breast implants , police said in a statement . The network 's leader promised them `` great prosperity . ''
When the individuals arrived in Spain , the network confiscated travel documents and imposed a debt per person of 15,000 euros ( 13,617 pounds ) for their return . They had to be available 24 hours a day to clients , police said .
The operation led to the arrest of 14 people suspected of managing the network , which earned up to 1 million euros ( US $ 1.18 million ) over five years , police said .

Emergency crews were forced to evacuate the hockey arenas at the only recreation centre in Airdrie because of an ammonia leak that was detected on Saturday morning .
Police say that at about 7:05 a.m. , an ammonia leak alarm sounded in the ‘ Twin Arenas ' area of Genesis Place on East Lake Boulevard in Airdrie .
As a result , the arenas were immediately evacuated by city staff while they awaited the arrival of first responders .
No one was injured in the leak .
Constable Casondra Greene with the Airdrie RCMP says the leak was contained to a single room in the facility but they had no idea where the leak was when they got there ..
`` The alarm had been shut off by staff before we got there so we were just trying to determine the extent of the leak . ''
Greene says a number of the closures were precautionary .
The leak only led to the closure of the Twin Arenas and all other areas , including the fieldhouse , gyms and swimming pool , remained operational .
A few hours after the closure , the arena was reopened , but the situation had the potential to be much worse .
In October 2017 , three men died while trying to repair an ammonia leak at the Fernie Memorial Hockey Arena .
They were exposed to highly toxic anhydrous ammonia , a chemical used in the cooling process at many arenas across the country , that was found to be leaking in the facility .
The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety says ammonia is a colourless gas that is toxic if inhaled .
Once upon a time , Dave Grohl asked David Bowie to record a song with the Foo Fighters . No cigar . However , the song is about to be recorded and released anyway … by a surprise artist .
In a new interview with British GQ , the Foo Fighters frontman discussed the soon-to-be-released song . Apparently , it was one of those songs that just does n't work out the way you hope it does . For years , Grohl tried to record the track and even asked Bowie to help out and record it for a movie soundtrack . According to Grohl , Bowie was n't all that into the movie , so the collaboration never happened .
Instead , Grohl passed the song off to another band that he refuses to expose . ( He does love a good surprise , does n't he ? )
So the gist of the story is this : Sometime , the unknown song will be released by some other band .
It 's either a highly unsatisfying or wildly exciting conclusion—it all depends on whether or not you 're into surprises .
The 25-year-old Englishman of `` Stay With Me '' fame will arrive in St. Paul on August 14 of next year . Tickets go on sale October 12 via Ticketmaster and the venue box office , but prices are not yet available ; there 's a fan pre-sale on October 11 .
Smith will be promoting The Thrill of It All , his anticipated sophomore follow-up to In the Lonely Hour , his 2014 debut LP that propelled him to the Best New Artist Grammy Award . The soulful , evocative , heart-on-sleeve songman will likely test-drive Thrill singles `` Too Good at Goodbyes '' and `` Pray '' this weekend on Saturday Night Live .
Speaking of awards , Smith took some heat at last year 's Academy Awards -- from himself and from the LGBTQ community . He described his uneven performance of Bond theme `` Writing 's on the Wall '' as `` the worst moment of my life . '' Smith scored an Oscar for that song , and during his acceptance speech suggested he was the first `` openly gay man '' to have won the award , which is not true . Blowback ensued .
But hey , new year , new Sam Smith . Check out this recent Billboard profile that details his descent into booze following the Oscar drama , how his `` Pray '' collab with Timbaland was inspired by Iraq , and much more . Thrill of It All drops November 3 .

BUCHAREST : Romania 's ruling left-wing party withdrew its support for Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu on Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) , a move likely to bring down his government , which has only been in power since January .
It is the second major crisis to rock the government since it won a thumping poll victory in December , barely a year after being forced from office over a deadly nightclub blaze .
`` A prime minister is only legitimate as long as he has the support of the parties that voted for him . We have withdrawn that support , '' Liviu Dragnea , the leader of the Social Democrats ( PSD ) , said after cabinet ministers resigned en masse on Wednesday evening .
Grindeanu however refused to step down , saying he would only quit once centre-right President Klaus Iohannis had appointed his successor from the PSD .
`` I will not resign , I am a responsible person , '' the 43-year-old told journalists in Bucharest . His statement appeared to contradict Dragnea , who said the premier had agreed to leave .

The PSD , holder of a parliamentary majority with the small ALDE party , accused Grindeanu of failing to implement economic reforms in the European Union 's second-poorest country after Bulgaria .
But some observers say the move is the result of a fallout between the prime minister and Dragnea .
The powerful party boss , 54 , was barred from running for premier because of a voter fraud conviction and is currently on trial for alleged abuse of power , a charge he denies .
The surprise development comes after mass protests forced the PSD to scrap a controversial decree aimed at watering down anti-corruption laws in February .
INTERNAL DISPUTE
Analysts say the internal disagreement may have been linked to the failed proposal , which could have allowed Dragnea to run despite his conviction .
`` Liviu Dragnea only wants one thing - amendments to the anti-corruption laws '' that currently prevent him from becoming premier , according to former PSD member Alin Teodorescu .
The government had already got off to a rocky start when President Iohannis rejected the PSD 's first prime ministerial candidate , who would have been the country 's first female and Muslim head of government .
The crisis eventually ended with Grindeanu 's nomination in January . Dragnea has made no secret of the fact he had chosen a candidate close to him .
Grindeanu , a former communications minister , was seen as a `` disciplined soldier '' within the PSD ranks , having joined the party at a very young .
`` I wanted a man I could trust , a man who would n't use his government position as a springboard , '' Dragnea said after Grindeau 's appointment .
The PSD quit following angry protests in 2015 over a nightclub fire in Bucharest that killed 64 people . The inferno was blamed on corrupt officials turning a blind eye to fire rules .
A decade after joining the European Union , the nation of 20 million inhabitants remains mired in poverty .
Nonetheless , the former communist state logged first-quarter economic growth of 5.7 per cent , according to data released last month - the fastest rate in the EU .
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Thursday arraigned a former Minister of Water Resources , Sarah Ochekpe , a former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Plateau State , Raymond Dabo , before the Federal High Court in Jos for alleged embezzlement of N450 million .
The EFCC Alps arraigned one Lyons Sunday Jatau .
The accused were charged with illegally receiving the money from a former Minister of Petroleum Resources , Diezani Alison-Madueke , to finance the re-election campaign of former President Goodluck Jonathan and his Vice-President .
At the first hearing of the suit , Mrs. Ochekpe told trial judge , Musa Kurya , that she handed over the said sum to the PDP governorship candidate in the 2015 gubernatorial election in the state , the late Gyang Pwajok .
Mr. Pwajok died in an Indian hospital after a protracted aliment after the election which he lost to Simon Lalong of the Progressives Congress .
EFCC prosecution counsel , Yusuf Muchaka , said the accused persons breached the law by receiving money they knew was corruptly sourced .
He supported the charge with an affidavit sworn to by Olayinka Rotimi , an operative with EFCC who was part of the team that investigated the case .
The judge granted the accused persons bail on self-recognition and adjourned the case to February 13 and 14 for further hearing .
Finnish mobile games and animation studio Rovio Entertainment Ltd said on Tuesday its sales in the first half of the year almost doubled following the success of `` The Angry Birds Movie . ''
HELSINKI : Finnish mobile games and animation studio Rovio Entertainment Ltd said on Tuesday its sales in the first half of the year almost doubled following the success of `` The Angry Birds Movie . ''
First-half revenue rose to 152.6 million euros ( US $ 179.7 million ) from 78.5 million a year earlier , while adjusted earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization increased to 41.8 million euros from 11.0 million a year ago .
Following years of falling earnings , job cuts and restructuring , Rovio returned to profit in 2016 as the 3D Hollywood movie release revived the Angry Birds brand and gave a boost to game sales .
First-half revenue from games increased by 76 percent to 117.9 million euros . Rovio 's main titles include `` Angry Birds 2 , '' `` Angry Birds Friends '' and the new multiplayer game `` Battle Bay . ''
This year 's growth is also due to movie revenues that had not shown in Rovio 's numbers previously .
The company is now planning a sequel to the Angry Birds movie with Columbia Pictures , scheduled for release in 2019 .

Citing unnamed sources , Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Rovio was planning a possible initial public offering .
Rovio , which had earlier said a listing could be possible in the future , declined to comment .
Rovio is 70 percent owned by Kaj Hed , the uncle of company co-founder Niklas Hed . Other investors include venture firms Accel Partners and Atomico .

Four Honolulu police officers have been placed on restricted duty while the FBI investigates allegations of misconduct .
HPD Chief Susan Ballard says the department began investigating after a memo claimed officers may have forced a man to place his mouth on a public urinal .
She says it happened on Sunday afternoon in the Keeaumoku area . The officers were responding to a trespassing complaint at the time .
“ If true , these allegations violate the core values of the HPD stands for . Our officers are sworn to uphold the rights of all persons and I expect every officer to treat every member of the public fairly and with respect , ” Ballard said . “ Personally I am appalled at the behavior if it is true , and appropriate action will be taken . ”
Ballard says officers tracked the victim down on Tuesday and contacted the FBI on Wednesday .
The four officers have between three to 16 years of service .
After an initial investigation , the department contacted the FBI and turned over its findings .
The department is now cooperating with federal investigators .
It 's just the latest retailer to seek bankruptcy protection , close stores or go out of business entirely as more people skip the mall and shop online . Toys R Us , for example , announced last week that it would close or sell all its stores after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year .
Dwayne Allen did n't get off to the strongest start with the New England Patriots . In spring practices , he led the team with drops , and looked as if he was n't quite ready to handle the rigorous workload the Patriots were throwing at him .
However , Allen has fixed his issue with drops , and appears on pace to be their second best tight end behind Rob Gronkowski .
“ I 'll say I 'm a little bit better than horrible , ” Allen told ESPN last week .
Allen did n't play during the Patriots ' first preseason game where they lost 31-24 to the Jacksonville Jaguars . Allen 's absence in the preseason game served as further proof he will be one of New England 's starters . He was a healthy scratch with offensive players like Tom Brady , Julian Edelman , Rob Gronkowski and Brandin Cooks .
That 's a testament to his strong training camp — which has gone much better than his spring practices .
“ Spring was horrible , ” he told ESPN.com last week . “ It 's one of those things where you have an offseason where you 're training , you 're doing well , you 're thinking that you 've trained and prepared enough , and then you come into OTAs and it 's like , ‘ Oh my goodness , I have not trained enough . ' ”
When he got into shape , he was ready to adjust and acclimate to New England 's challenging offense , he explained .

Pumpkin Cream Puffs
Makes : About 20 puffs
Prep Time : 35 minutes
Bake Time : 30 minutes
Cool Time : 20 minutes
Total time : 1 hour 25 minutes
Ingredients :
For the pate a choux pastry
1 stick unsalted butter
1 cup water
1 Tbsp granulated sugar
½ tsp salt
1 ¼ cups all purpose flour
4 large eggs
Instructions :
Preheat oven to 425 . Bring the water , butter , sugar , and salt to boil in a medium saucepan . Remove from heat , add flour , and mix until a smooth , paste-like dough forms . Let dough cool for a few minutes , then beat on medium with a hand mixer for about 1 minutes . Dough will break apart into chunks , this is ok ! Add the eggs one at a time , beating after each addition . After the fourth egg , the mixture should come together to form a smooth , sticky pastry . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper . Using a tablespoon , drop rounded , golf-ball sized rounds of dough in rows of four . You should be able to fit 12-16 puffs to a sheet .

For the pumpkin buttercream
2 sticks unsalted butter , softened
½ cup plus 2 Tbsp pumpkin puree
1 tsp cinnamon

With a hand mixer , beat butter and pumpkin until completely incorporated and fluffy . Add cinnamon and about half of the confectioner 's sugar and beat on medium until smooth . Add the rest of the sugar and beat on medium to combine , then on high until smooth and very fluffy .
Slice the puffs in half crosswise , spoon filling on bottom half , then pop on the top half . Drizzle with melted chocolate chips if you like for extra pizzaz !
Responding to mass shootings , terrorist attacks and other violent atrocities has become a grim rite of passage for late-night comedians in this fraught era . But for Jordan Klepper , the moment has arrived sooner than most . Just a week after the premiere of his nightly show , “ The Opposition , ” the country is riveted to their screens following news of the carnage in Las Vegas .
“ We all woke up shocked , ” says Klepper , 38 , in his office near Penn Station on Monday afternoon . “ We 're constantly watching the news as the numbers keep changing . It 's heartbreaking and it 's overwhelming. ” Klepper and his team have already formulated their approach : they will address the tragedy that night but wait to weigh in more significantly until later in the week when “ we feel like there is something to be added to the conversation . ”
Instead , they 'll offer viewers “ some laughter on a dark day ” with a lead story about Chance the Rapper 's bizarre feud with Rotten Tomatoes — a subject that 's apolitical but “ full of joy , ” he says . ( On Tuesday , though , Klepper offers a tongue-in-cheek guide “ to avoid [ ing ] the gun debate in times of crisis . ” )

Las Vegas would be a difficult subject for any comedy show to tackle , but is especially tricky for a new program whose host performs in character as a factually challenged fear-monger styled after Sandy Hook truther Alex Jones . Just as “ The Colbert Report ” satirized the belligerent , hyper-partisan cable news environment of the Bush-Obama years , “ The Opposition ” skewers far-right media outlets like InfoWars and Breitbart .
The nightly half-hour follows the same basic recipe of news segments , field pieces and interviews as “ The Daily Show ” and its offspring , but there are adjustments that reflect the zeitgeist when the very concepts of observable reality and non-partisan truth seem to be in question . Correspondents are known as “ citizen journalists , ” and the bunker-like set includes a projected conspiracy board and desk piled high with dog-eared papers .
Just as “ The Colbert Report ” introduced the idea of “ truthiness , ” Klepper — or “ Klepper , ” rather — laid out the show 's manifesto in the debut episode : `` No human society has ever enjoyed such an abundance of facts , which is why in America in 2017 , you get to pick which facts are right for you . ”
While the format makes it hard for Klepper to be earnest , in other ways he 's well-suited to discuss gun violence . Raised in Kalamazoo , Mich. , where six people were killed in a mass shooting last year , he fondly recalls shooting with his grandfather as a kid . “ Guns mean something different in Michigan than they do in New York City , ” he says .
He also spent months traveling the country , talking to lobbyists , militiamen and gun enthusiasts — including his duck-hunting cousin , Pete — for a special , “ Jordan Klepper Solves Guns , ” that aired this year . The experience left him surprisingly hopeful .
“ My big takeaway was just how much middle ground there is on the issue of guns . It 's mostly middle ground , ” says Klepper who , with a voluminous pompadour and a tall , lanky frame accentuated by a wardrobe of slim-cut suits and skinny ties , is physically reminiscent of a young Conan O'Brien . There are traces of the Midwest in his voice , especially when he mentions Chicago . He pursued comedy there after college , performing at Second City and in the improv show “ Whirled News Tonight , ” which stoked an interest in political satire .

Eventually relocating to New York , Klepper joined “ The Daily Show ” as a correspondent in 2014 , not long before Jon Stewart announced his retirement . Klepper struck up an easy rapport with Stewart 's successor , Trevor Noah , who is an executive producer on “ The Opposition . ”
In an email , Noah praised Klepper 's “ ability to make any situation funnier . I hope Jordan is at my funeral to keep people laughing . ”
He 's also shared some advice : “ I just told Jordan to enjoy every moment of the journey . The doubt , the fear , the critics , all of it . It 's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the joy you get from creating the show is the joy the audience often feels when watching the show . ”
Particularly once the 2016 presidential campaign got underway , Klepper earned notice for his field pieces , often filmed at Trump campaign events where the candidate 's popularity was undeniable . In a memorable segment , Klepper interviewed Trump supporters who suspected that Bill Clinton had contracted AIDS from Earvin “ Magic ” Johnson and wondered why Obama was n't in the Oval Office on 9/11 .
“ What I quickly noticed was people were n't necessarily talking about Fox or CNN , they were talking about these other alt-media sources , ” Klepper recalls . “ There 's this world of news , this perspective that I 'm not very tapped into , but half the electorate is and it 's controlling our dialogue right now and eventually our policies . ”
When Comedy Central began looking for the right talent to take over the 11:30 time slot , Klepper was the inevitable choice , says network President Kent Alterman . “ His approach was so responsive to how much the world has changed . He 's actually going into the new ways that people are engaging with political discourse and the new ways people are getting their news and information — or misinformation , as it may be . ”
While Noah has successfully steered “ The Daily Show ” in the post-Stewart era , finding a worthy successor to the “ The Colbert Report , ” which bowed out in late 2014 , has been trickier . The ratings-challenged “ Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore ” was canceled last year and replaced by “ @ midnight , ” a comic game show whose non-political bent ( and title ) did n't really work following “ The Daily Show ” at 11:30 .
Early reviews of “ The Opposition ” have been positive , and viewership in the time slot is up by 43 % over last year . But “ The Opposition ” joins an already crowded field of satirical shows featuring graduates of the University of Jon Stewart , including “ Last Week Tonight With John Oliver , ” “ Full Frontal With Samantha Bee ” and “ The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . ”
“ It is definitely a golden era for these types of late-night programs , ” says executive producer Stuart Miller , one of many “ Daily Show ” and “ Colbert Report ” veterans now working at “ The Opposition. ” “ What we bring to the table is obviously Jordan , being in character and being able to use satire in a unique way . ”
Given the current political climate , where news stories are increasingly shared with the caveat “ not an ‘ Onion ' headline , ” there is a risk that real life is beyond satire and figures like Alex Jones — who has already dismissed Klepper 's fans as “ mentally retarded ” — are too absurd or too loathsome to lampoon .
`` We 're trying to win here and we want to win with the right people , '' Telesco said . `` And I think if you have the right people , they can handle adversity . And if things get tough , a lot of times the guys who do n't have the character you want are the first guys to go south on you . You ca n't rely on them , and you need people you can rely on .

Now having seen all three Cars movies , I 'm comfortable coming to the conclusion that these movies just are n't for me . I do n't find Lightning McQueen to be a particularly interesting protagonist , his world filled with anthropomorphic cars only raises more questions than it answers , and his struggles to win races are n't all that appealing . The latest outing , Cars 3 , is certainly better than the misguided Cars 2 , but at the end of the day , it ultimately shakes out to being a nice movie about mentorship and motivation , a concept Pixar explored far better in Monster University . There 's nothing particularly wrong with Cars 3 , but there 's also nothing that shows the franchise has found a new gear .
Lightning McQueen ( Owen Wilson ) is happily racing through the circuit , winning races and being a champion . However , his world is turned upside down when a new breed of racers led by the passive-aggressive Jackson Storm ( Armie Hammer ) come on the scene . These new racers use superior technology and mathematics to obtain top speeds , and McQueen ca n't keep up , especially after a devastating crash . When he resolves to get back on the circuit and become a champion again , he enlists the help of trainer Cruz Ramirez ( Cristela Alonzo ) , but discovers that he might have more to teach her than she has to teach him .
Whereas Cars 2 was really Mater 's ( Larry the Cable Guy ) story and a bizarre spy tale with Lightning 's race serving as the background , Cars 3 is all about Lightning and his desire to figure out his legacy and his desires . It 's a surprisingly mature movie that really cuts back on a lot of the jokes and wacky humor in favor of telling a story about a character who 's struggling to hold onto his life of racing even as the sport starts to leave him behind . That 's a far cry from the last film where Mater wrestles with a Japanese toilet .
The new film is really about Lightning finding his motivation and discovering that Cruz needs his help more than he needs hers . It 's a predictable direction for the franchise to reach , but it 's still a nice message that reinforces Pixar 's belief that collaboration is the most important lesson its characters can learn . Yes , that does position Cars 3 as yet another Pixar buddy movie , but at least it 's in tune with the studio 's ethos . It acknowledges that technology ( represented by Storm ) is always going to improve and leave the old ways behind , but that what makes a champion is the willingness to work together and acknowledge those who came before as Lightning and Cruz do when they meet up with the old friends of Doc Hudson ( Paul Newman ) . The studio is basically saying that what makes them the best is n't that they have the most powerful computers or even the best artists ; what makes them the best is that they work together .
And that 's a perfectly adequate message for a kids movie , and the kids at my screening were all applauding at the final race , so presumably they were invested in Lightning and Cruz ' story even if there were n't the easy laughs that a character like Mater provides . It 's a fine movie in terms of what it 's trying to do , the message it 's trying to convey , and the characters involved . But that being said , it 's also not pushing the envelope in the way Pixar used to do .
Cars 3 is probably the safest possible movie Pixar could have made , and I understand that the purpose of the Cars franchise is to sell merchandise rather than tell groundbreaking stories . It 's never been that kind of series even from the first film , which was back during the studio 's heyday . They 're simple stories , kids seem to like them , and that 's apparently good enough for everyone involved . And compared to Cars 2 , Cars 3 seems like a towering achievement that 's far more mature . But compared to Pixar 's greatest hits , it feels like the studio is just coasting .
Sadly , we 're right in the midst of a sequel boom for the studio . Finding Dory made over a billion dollars worldwide , and we 've got The Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4 on the way with only Coco as the sole original movie announced for their slate . So maybe when Lightning and Cruz find Doc 's old pals , it 's not about the importance of acknowledging those who came before . It may be a message that the future is in the past .

Iran will help shed light on the case of one of its Vienna-based diplomats who was arrested in Germany over a suspected plot to carry out a bomb attack on an exiled Iranian opposition group , Austria said on Wednesday .
VIENNA : Iran will help shed light on the case of one of its Vienna-based diplomats who was arrested in Germany over a suspected plot to carry out a bomb attack on an exiled Iranian opposition group , Austria said on Wednesday .
The case cast a shadow over Iranian President Hassan Rouhani 's visit to Austria on Wednesday at which both sides discussed issues including salvaging the Iran nuclear deal after the U.S. decision to withdraw and reinstate sanctions on Tehran .

`` We expect full clarification in connection with this and I thank you , Mr President , for assuring us that you will support this clarification , '' Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to reporters after meeting Rouhani .
Rouhani did not mention the diplomat in his remarks and the two leaders took no questions .
Austria summoned Iran 's ambassador over the case on Monday and said it was stripping the arrested Iranian of his diplomatic status .
Belgian authorities identified the diplomat as 46-year-old Assadollah A and said he is suspected of having been in contact with two people arrested in Belgium with 500 grams of the homemade explosive TATP and a detonation device in their car .

Their alleged target was a rally near Paris last weekend of the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) - an umbrella organisation of opposition groups in exile that seek an end to Shi'ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran .
Belgium also issued a European arrest warrant for a man of Iranian origin being held in France suspected of being involved in the alleged plot , a French judicial source said .
U.S. President Donald Trump 's lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as former European and Arab ministers attended the NCRI meeting .
The NCRI held a small protest against Rouhani 's visit on the edge of the area of central Vienna that police sealed off .
Foreign ministers from the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal - Iran , France , Britain , Germany , Russia and China - meet in Vienna on Friday to discuss salvaging the accord .
European powers are putting together an economic package aimed at safeguarding the deal by shielding Iran from some of the impact of U.S. sanctions resuming . Rouhani has said Iran will stay in the accord if its interests are preserved .
An Iranian official said Rouhani was also due to meet the head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which is policing the restrictions the deal places on Iran 's atomic activities in exchange for sanctions relief .
Rouhani 's one-day visit to Austria followed a longer trip that was planned two years ago but which he cancelled at the last minute on unspecified security grounds .

BIG WINNERS : Eliberto and Anita Cantu
BIGGEST-EVER STATE LOTTERY WINNER EMERGES FROM HIDING
April 17 , 2017
LITTLE ROCK – He 's the 55th lottery-made millionaire in the state , but with a $ 177 million dollar win , Eliberto Cantu of Lubbock , Texas , could make many more millionaires on his own . Mr. Cantu finally came forward today after purchasing the winning Mega Millions ticket March 30 .
As the state of Arkansas held its collective breath , the newly-minted multi-millionaire wisely got his financial ducks in a row before being the main attraction at a press conference held today at the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery 's offices downtown .
“ All I can say is , we 're blessed – and keep buying lottery tickets ! , ” Mr. Cantu , 71 , said at the press conference , where he was presented with an oversized check by Arkansas Scholarship Lottery director Bishop Woosley .

It 's usually Duana who 's good for one bonkers observation/prediction every week during Game Of Thrones . This time it 's my turn .
Is it just me or have you noticed that Daenerys Targaryen is wearing a lot more makeup this season ? She 's back in Westeros , of course , and not taking 5 years to walk across the desert , with no beauty products in her backpack , I get it . But even when she was hanging out in Mereen , where the accommodations were pretty comfortable , Daenerys was n't wearing a full face . Last night , that close-up shot of her saying goodbye to Jon ? There was a LOT of makeup happening . That 's the superficial sign that Daenerys is breaking bad . Of course there are several other , less shallow , signs as well .
Tyrion and Varys are wringing their hands over her bloodthirst . Every day , more and more , is she becoming like Cersei ? Like all the rulers before them ? I mentioned this in my recap last week – Daenerys and Cersei have never had the benefit of female mentorship or significant counsel . As female rulers they 're wary of not being taken seriously by men , a valid concern . But the only way they know how to assert power when they 've been challenged is by ruthless retribution – not exactly a radical approach . As history has shown us in the present , the primary motivation of those in power is to protect it . Every move becomes about how to preserve power , as opposed to how to share it in service of others .
How then will Daenerys react when she finds out that she and Jon Snow share a bloodline – and that his claim to the throne might be more legitimate than hers ? Gilly 's nighttime reading has revealed to us that Jon Snow is n't actually a bastard . And given that his father , Rhaegar , was the older brother of Daenerys , it makes Jon the true first heir of House Targaryen . Which is probably why Drogon , instead of eating him , decided to ( in dragon terms ) bend the knee , without having to be asked .
Daenerys 's favourite word these days seems to be “ MINE ! ” What will happen when she finds out that it was never hers to begin with ? Sarah texted me last night to say that this is what Game Of Thrones has been building towards : that Jon Snow has both the ancestry and the temperament to lead , to be the king the unites everyone , the prince who was promised . Jon shared power with Sansa five minutes after his bannermen named him King of the North . He does not seek the crown for power 's sake . Now he 's going back out beyond the wall to play capture the flag with the white walkers ( this is the dumbest plot ever ) , potentially sacrificing his own life yet again for the greater good . Let 's send him on another adventure , because what would a season of Game Of Thrones be without a Jon Snow adventure and battle ?
Great . Fine . We get it . He 's the Dawson . He 's the only one who has his eye on the real threat , f-ck your politics , the zombies will destroy us all !
Am I the only one who does n't give a sh-t about the zombies ? This is where they 've been taking us for 7 seasons . The human war over King 's Landing and the greater war with the immortals over existence , period . And , presumably , it 's the war with the immortals that will be the ultimate conclusion to the show . Would n't it be way more fun though to finish off the zombies first and then get back to the politics ? After all , what 's truly immortal is human nature . Greed , rivalry , revenge , and family drama , these have always been the pillars of the show . And , frankly , the Night King 's plots are so much less interesting than Littlefinger 's schemes .
Trust , mistrust , and distrust are Baelish 's sharpest weapons . And now the R Kelly of Westeros is trying to play Sansa and Arya Stark off of each other , the way he used to play their mother . We are supposed to believe that Baelish got the jump on Arya last night , planting a letter for her to find that will fuel the doubt she has in her sister 's intentions , engaging A Girl in a game of I Know You Know That I Know That You Know That I Know . That 's what he thinks . That he 's playing A Girl . But A Girl is No One . Arya is going to f-ck him up so hard , I ca n't wait . And if it were up to me , it will be Arya who ends up the Hand of the eventual Queen , Sansa . If , that is , Sansa is n't her stupid mother 's daughter . F-cking Catelyn , I still hate her so much .
PS . Speaking of hating , goddamn pervy Jorah and his boner over Daenerys and those jealous eyes he keeps making at Jon Snow , how is it that he had the greyscale peeled off of him and he only looks like he got a sunburn ?
PPS . That double date between Daenerys and Jon and Samwell and Gilly just got hella more awkward . I mean Daenerys and Jon are already related . And Daenerys just dragon-burned Sam 's father and brother . Or maybe Sam wo n't mind it so much ?
PPPS . Why is Lannister incest so fertile on this show ?

GUAM : The Lieutenant Governor of Guam said on Tuesday ( Aug 15 ) that there is no change to the island 's threat assessment and that the government is `` happy '' with a recent report indicating that North Korea is holding back a missile strike towards Guam .
North Korea 's state media reported earlier in the day that leader Kim Jong-un was briefed on a plan to fire missiles near the US Pacific territory but hinted that he would hold off on the launch .
According to KCNA 's report , Kim inspected the command of the North 's army on Monday and would be watching to see if the US `` persists in extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity , testing the self-restraint of the DPRK '' .
Speaking to reporters at the government complex , Lieutenant Governor Ray Tenorio said : `` We are happy that he has taken a look at the plans and will be holding off on the threats to Guam at this point .
`` There does n't appear to be any indication based on what we are hearing that there will be missile attacks in the near future or distant future . ''

Tenorio added that there is `` no change '' to threat assessments and that Guam is `` operating as usual '' .
Responding to a question about the reliability of KCNA 's report , Tenorio said the government is taking information from various media sources `` as best as ( it ) can '' and the latest news could be seen as a `` silver lining around the cloud '' .

`` This information at least gives us reason to believe that Kim Jong-un has pushed his intention to shoot anything towards our direction , '' he said .
`` So we find a silver lining around the cloud and hope that that 's an indication that he 's pushing off his intention to fire four missiles in Guam 's direction . ''

Locals Channel NewsAsia spoke to also said that they are not panicking .
`` I 'm not scared at all , to be honest , '' said taxi driver Abdul Jacol Mamon Sarap . `` There are some people I know who are doing some preparations just in case , but I 'm not worried . If I have to , it 'll be for my children . ''
He mentioned there were similar threats from North Korea in 2013 but there is a `` strong belief '' among the people in Guam that the strong US military presence on the island will act as a deterrence .

Another local who preferred to be known as Martin echoed similar sentiments . The former military man , who was fishing along Tumon Bay on Tuesday morning , told Channel NewsAsia that he has `` confidence '' in the US ' defence capabilities .
`` You know , life goes on , '' he said . `` If we let it dictate how we feel or live , then it 's a shame . Like me , I 'm here fishing almost every morning and I 'll keep doing that . ''

The island of Guam , a US Pacific territory home to two US military installations and 6,000 US soldiers , has found itself at the centre of the world 's attention amid threats of a strike from North Korea .
US President Donald Trump has been engaged in verbal sparring with Pyongyang over its weapons and missile programmes , with the Republican billionaire ramping up his tone by declaring last Friday that the US military is `` locked and loaded '' .
In a phone call , Trump also told Governor Eddie Calvo that the US government is `` with ( Guam ) a thousand per cent '' .
SACRAMENTO — A woman was arrested and charged after she threatened to kill fellow passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight from Portland to Sacramento . The chaotic scene was captured on video that a fellow passenger sent to CBS Sacramento .
The incident on Saturday began after a woman attempted to smoke in the airplane bathroom and alter the smoke detector , according to airline officials .
The passenger who shot the video said the woman was ordered back to her seat but began yelling irrationally , threatening to kill everyone on board , and demanding that the plane land . He said she pushed a flight attendant and had to be physically restrained by passengers and crew for the remaining 30 minutes of the flight .
Valerie Curbelo , 24 , was arrested at the gate when the plane landed , and she was taken to Sacramento County Jail and charged with making criminal threats .

Southwest Airlines sent a statement to CBS Portland affiliate KOIN-TV saying 136 customers were onboard the flight , which landed safely following the incident . The company said a passenger “ violated federal laws by both smoking onboard an aircraft and by tampering with a smoke detector in an aircraft restroom . ”
Speaking to CBS Sacramento , Curbelo said her anxiety led to her decision to smoke in the restroom . “ The anxiety , yeah the anxiety , ” Curbelo said without elaborating . She did not explain why she threatened to kill everyone . “ I do n't know , ” she said . “ It was not me . It was not me . ”
Cabello is from Sandy , Oregon , just outside of Portland . She would n't discuss why she was flying to Sacramento .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Russian man accused of operating a network of infected computers used by cyber criminals has been extradited to the United States from Spain and will make an initial court appearance on Friday , the U.S. Department of Justice said .
U.S. prosecutors said Peter Levashov , 37 , ran the Kelihos botnet , a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses , ransomware , phishing emails and other spam attacks .
Levashov denies the charges in an eight-count indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in Connecticut in April .
Levashov , who fought the extradition , told Spain 's High Court in September that he had worked for Russian President Vladimir Putin 's United Russia party for the last 10 years , Russia 's RIA news agency reported .
He told the court that investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges , RIA said .
Levashov was charged by U.S. prosecutors with causing intentional damage to a protected computer and wire fraud , which carry a potential prison sentence of up to 52 years if he is convicted at trial .
He was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona last April and in October , Spain 's High Court granted a U.S. request to extradite him . Levashov was scheduled to appear in court in Bridgeport , Connecticut , the Justice Department said .
PARIS : Spain 's Mediapro , majority-owned by a Chinese investment fund , has strengthened its presence in European sports broadcasting by snapping up the rights to broadcast France 's Ligue 1 football , highlighting the growing interest in China for European football .
In a major blow to Vivendi 's French broadcaster Canal Plus which has shown Ligue 1 matches since 1984 and now holds the bulk of the rights , Mediapro on Tuesday won the rights to broadcast the games for the period 2020 to 2024 in an auction by the French football league .

Total yearly broadcasting rights for the championship , including lower level packages of the match bundles on offer which Mediapro did not bid for , will reach a record €1.15 billion ( US $ 1.33 billion ) , a 60 per cent jump over the previous five-year period .
Mediapro , a major TV and film producer , is planning to create a TV channel specifically dedicated to French football , France 's League of Professional Football ( LFP ) said in a statement announcing the results of the rights auction .
With 6,600 employees and revenues of €1.6 billion in 2017 , Mediapro is a heavyweight when it comes to European sports content .
It holds the rights to the bulk of the Spanish league 's matches as well as the rights to broadcast the main international football championships in Spain .

The company also has the rights to broadcast Formula One car racing championships in Spain as well as Euroleague basketball games .
'GREAT PLAYERS '
This is not the first time that Mediapro and Canal Plus have clashed over broadcast rights .
Between 2006 and 2013 Mediapro and Spanish pay-TV company Sogecable , which had the rights to broadcast Canal Plus 's programmes in Spain and which historically held the rights to broadcast most La Liga matches in Spain , fought what the press dubbed a `` football war '' .
Mediapro began negotiating directly with individual clubs the right to broadcast their matches , leading to lengthy court battles with Sogecable . Mediapro eventually ended up with the bulk of Spain 's La Liga broadcast rights .
The Barcelona-based production company , which has produced Woody Allen films such as `` Midnight in Paris '' in addition to documentaries and TV series , was founded by Jaume Roures , who is reportedly close to Catalonia 's separatist leaders .
Its sudden interest in the French league is directly linked to Chinese private equity group Orient Hontai Capital 's decision in February to acquire a majority stake in Mediapro , said Carlos Canto , a professor at Spanish business school ESADE who focuses on the economics of sports .
`` Interest in French football and Ligue 1 matches is growing '' especially in China `` thanks to teams like Paris Saint-Germain , Lyon or Marseille , and of course the arrival of great players like Neymar , '' he told AFP .
ITALIAN WOES
In a sign of the growing interest in Asia in French football , in March a Paris Saint-Germain-Nice match was scheduled for 1:00 pm on a Sunday , an unusual time in France but which meant it could air during prime time in China .
China has been investing heavily in football and media in recent years . The country in 2014 declared sports , and especially football , a priority and since then Chinese investors have bought AC Milan , taken control of OGC Nice and own a minority share in Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City .
`` But since 2017 , they have put a brake on these investments , which have caused capital flight and have not always generated the expected return on investment , '' economist Ivana Casaburi , a specialist in Chinese investment in Europe , told AFP .
The only operations which China now authorises are those considered to have a high potential for profitability , such as Orient Hontai 's purchase of Mediapro , she added .
Mediapro 's expansion strategy has run into roadblocks .
An Italian court earlier this month annulled a contract awarding the company rights to broadcast Serie A football matches for 2018-21 for just over one billion euros , ruling in favour of a legal challenge by Sky 's Italian unit which argued the sale did not respect Italian competition rules .
Pending the conclusion of the case , Italian viewers do not yet know where they will be able to see matches nest season , which begins on Aug 18 .

I 'm so into Maggie Rogers . She 's got a vibe that is as equally striking as her voice . You might remember her from the time she knocked Pharrell 's socks off . Her breakout single `` Alaska '' has amassed over 41 million streams on Spotify , and I 'd like to think a good million were mine .
Her first EP , `` Now That the Light Is Fading , '' is the perfect soundtrack for getting ready for fall . `` On + Off '' is my favorite track .

Taylor Swift . Sorry , girl . I have always admired the well-oiled-machine that was her brand . From sending her fans personalized Christmas presents to inventing # squadgoals with the `` Bad Blood '' video , she ran a tight strategic ship . Until her fallout with the Kardashian-West family sent her into hiding .
I hoped she would rise from the ashes like a phoenix . Instead , she literally crawled out of her reputation 's grave in `` Look What You Made Me Do . '' Not the same . Actions speak louder than music videos , T-Swift .

Plateau State Governor , Simon Lalong , has accused his predecessor , Senator Jonah David Jang , for endorsing and creating Grazing Reserves in the state to mitigate farmers/herdsmen clashes during his administration .
Lalong stated this yesterday during the 3rd annual Plateau prayer day held at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium , Jos , Plateau State .
“ Contrary to beliefs and propaganda by some people who have chosen to politicize this issue , this government has never initiated the establishment or creation of Grazing Reserves . Rather , we inherited a Gazette of April 2009 by my immediate predecessor that recognized and established Grazing Reserves in Plateau State with approved budgetary allocations made for their development .
“ My administration did not embrace he concepts of Grazing Reserve as solution to abating the series of clashes , in view of the fact that in this 21st century and modern times , they are outdated , unacceptable and recurrent recipe for crisis as we have been witnessing .
“ There is nothing on the part of this administration like accepting or endorsing Grazing Reserves and Grazing Bills or cattle colony related to land grabbing or seizure to be given to a particular group of people by the state government as being erroneously insinuated and propagated by some people . ”
Lalong stressed that government has no right to colonize any local government in the state for any reason and urged Plateau state not to believe the rumour peddling round by some individual in the social media to create tension and set the state on fire again .
He handed over all documents obtained from the office of the Vice President , Prof. Yemi Osinbajo , to Plateau State CAN chairman , Rev . Soja Bewarang , which pointed to the fact that Grazing Reserves were created in the state during the administration of Governor Jonah David Jang .
The Governor added that his administration set up a committee in 2016 to study and advice government on the new policy on reaching which government has been holding consultative meetings with religious , traditional and community leaders to explore suitable way of implementation to end the perennial farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state .

A Ukrainian judge on Monday turned down the prosecutors ' request to place Ukrainian opposition figure Mikheil Saakashvili under house arrest , paving the way for his release from detention .
KIEV : Ukrainian opposition figure Mikheil Saakashvili was freed from detention on Monday , after a Ukrainian judge turned down the prosecutors ' request to place him under house arrest : the latest twist in his dramatic standoff with the authorities .
President of his native Georgia for nine years until 2013 , Saakashvili moved to Ukraine after a popular uprising there and served under Poroshenko as a regional governor from 2015-2016 , before falling out with the Ukrainian leader .
The 49-year-old accuses the Ukrainian authorities of widespread corruption . Prosecutors wanted him placed under house arrest while investigators look into accusations he assisted a criminal organisation , charges he says were trumped up to undermine his campaign to unseat Poroshenko .
`` The prosecutors ' petition ... is dismissed , '' Judge Larysa Tsokol told the court .
A crowd of several hundred supporters , who had remained outside the courthouse throughout the eight-hour hearing , cheered the judge 's decision .
`` The judge is good . She did everything correctly and in accordance with the law , '' Saakashvili said . `` It means not everything is lost in Ukraine . ''

The case against him remains open .
Speaking after the ruling , which was attended by several prominent opposition lawmakers , including former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko , Saakashvili said he planned to continue his political work .
Together with other opposition politicians he will `` prepare for a peaceful but very important and necessary change in leadership in Ukraine '' , he said .
Saakashvili , who launched a hunger strike to protest against his detention , sang the Ukrainian national anthem at the beginning of the hearing .
The courtroom was so packed with journalists and Saakashvili 's supporters that his lawyer asked the judge to move the session to a larger room .
The investigation provoked violent clashes between protesters and riot police last week , while on Sunday several thousand people attended a peaceful rally in central Kiev to support Saakashvili and call for Poroshenko 's impeachment .
`` While the protest does not represent a significant risk to government stability at the moment , it will likely attract the attention of Ukraine 's international supporters and donors , '' London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence said in a note .
Saakashvili is also facing the threat of possible extradition to Georgia , where he is wanted on criminal charges .
Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko told Reuters the extradition request was being considered but no final decision had yet been made . He denied the case was politically motivated .
`` Every person who lives in Ukraine must respect the basic laws , '' he said .
`` Unfortunately so far we only see things that are unworthy behaviour of such a person . ''

The management of the Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida University , Lapai , has increased fees for students of the institution who are not indigenes of Niger State .
The increase is for the 2017/2018 session .
The Vice-Chancellor of the institution , Mohammad Maiturare , confirmed this to the News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN ) in Minna on Monday .
He said the management of the institution reviewed the fee from N52 , 000 to N93 , 000 , saying that the increase was inevitable .
The fee for Niger indigenes , however remains at N52 , 000 , according to him .
He said that returning students were expected to pay N27 , 000 and N55 , 000 for indigenes and non-indigenes .
The vice-chancellor explained that the increase in fee was necessitated by the high operational costs affecting the smooth running of the institution .

He further explained that the management was mindful of the fact that some students might not be able to meet the new obligation .
He said to that effect , the varsity had thought out the possibility of loan facility for students , which would be paid on instalment basis .
Mr. Maiturare also said that the state government had agreed to avail indigent students the opportunity of an incentive to meet their fees obligation .
He said the management had in a meeting with the Student Union Government agreed to extend the resumption date to give parents and guardians apple time to prepare for the new session .
The vice-chancellor said the old fees been maintained for the last five years , adding the university could no longer operate on that fee .
Benjamin Mendy admits enjoying the Super Bowl is a perk of being injured , but expects to rejoin Manchester City full training within a month .
The left-back joined City for £52m in the summer but ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in just his fourth Premier League appearance for the club back in September .
Mendy has been able to pursue his growing love of the NFL during his time out from football , though , and has travelled to Minnesota to watch this Sunday 's Super Bowl LII between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles .
But the defender insisted he will be back in full training and ready to help his Manchester City team-mates before long .
“ It 's a lot better , ” Mendy told Sky Sports , when asked about his injured knee .
“ I worked so hard and now I run , touch the ball , so I just need to keep going and maybe soon I 'll be on the pitch . ”
Mendy had originally targeted the Champions League semi-finals as his return date , but asked when he will rejoin full training , he said : “ One month , very soon .
“ The team is so good now , we have two players in my place and every day I speak with them . We are a good group and we need to keep going to take a lot of cups . ”
Sergio Aguero is another Manchester City player with a keen interest in the NFL , and Mendy joked he had to persuade his team-mate to stay behind and help the team ahead of Saturday 's game against Burnley .
“ He told me he wants to come but he has a lot of games and we need him on the pitch , ” said Mendy . “ So I told him stay in Manchester ! ”

A street drinker and drug user whose appalling behaviour has caused misery to people and businesses in Harrogate has been given a Criminal Behaviour Order .
Paul Richard Nelson , 51 , of Harrogate , has dozens of previous convictions for theft , violence and public order offences .
The order was imposed after Nelson was convicted of several begging and public order offences at Harrogate Magistrates Court on 11 May 2017 .
Under the requirements of the order , Nelson must not :
Be drunk in a public place in Harrogate
Be in possession of alcohol in an unsealed or open container in Harrogate
Cause harassment , alarm or distress to people in Harrogate
The order will be in force until May 2022 . Posters will be distributed around the town centre to inform members of the public about the order .
PC Graham Wilson , of Harrogate Police , said : Harrogate is a thriving town with a vibrant atmosphere and very low levels of crime . Although there will always be an element of crime and anti-social behaviour in any busy town centre , unfortunately Nelson 's dreadful behaviour has been a public nuisance for many years . I hope this order sends a strong message that we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour , and continue to work closely with our partners to take robust action against those who persistently cause a misery to those who visit , work or live in Harrogate .
Councillor Mike Chambers is Harrogate Borough Council 's Cabinet Member for Safer Communities . He said : Harrogate Borough Council and the police are working hard to tackle anti-social behaviour in our district . It is important that residents , visitors and businesses feel safe and a Criminal Behaviour Order is an effective means of addressing this issue , giving the clear message to offenders that their actions will not be tolerated .
Failing to comply with the requirements of a Criminal Behaviour Order is a criminal offence , punishable by a custodial sentence . Any suspected breaches of an order should be reported to North Yorkshire Police on 101 .
The Nigeria Police Force , Ebonyi Command , on Wednesday in Abakaliki urged residents of Abakaliki to ignore the sit- at-home order by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra describing the order as unlawful .
The Command 's Police Public Relations Officer , Lovett Odah , told the News Agency of Nigeria that adequate security preparations had been put in place to secure lives and property of every citizen .
She urged residents of Abakaliki and every citizen of Ebonyi to go about their lawful and legitimate businesses , noting that the law would deal with anybody or group who tried to molest them .
Odah said : “ The police authorities wish to urge the people of Ebonyi and Abakaliki residents in particular , to ignore the unlawful order from an unlawful terrorist organization .
“ I want to remind members of the public , including the press , that IPOB remains proscribed , it is an illegal organization and they can never give order in Nigeria .
“ The Ebonyi Police Command , under the Commissioner of Police , Titus Sumba-Lamorde , wants to assure residents of its readiness to deal with anybody or group who wants to forment crisis by forcing innocent law abiding citizens to comply with the unlawful order .
“ The police wish to remind those out there to commit crime to relocate out of the state because there is no room for them and that the eagle eyes of the Police will catch up with them . ”
She said that any member or members of IPOB caught forcing innocent Nigerians to obey the unlawful order would face immediate prosecution .
Meanwhile , there was a zero compliance by Abakaliki residents to the sit-at-home as government offices , shops , private and public schools , banks as well as commercial activities within the Abakaliki metropolis remained open and operational .
Two shop owners at the popular Abakpa Main Market in Abakaliki , Messrs Lawrence Obiekwena and Magnus Onwe in separate interviews , told NAN that they defied the order because the market officials said that it would not close for business .
They maintained that people should not be forced or intimidated to observe the sit-at-home order .
They said : “ The sit-at-home is a non-violent form of agitation or protest and people should be allowed to voluntarily observe or participate in it and compliance should never be by coercion or intimidation . ”
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Police and other security agencies are on surveillance patrol to forestall possible security breaches .
The Federal High Court in Abuja had proscribed IPOB all over Nigeria .
It also declared the pro-Biafra group a terrorist organisation , following an case filed by the Attorney-General of the Federation .

SUBMITTED This photo of the Steamtown National Historic Site taken by Steamtown volunteer James Benetzky will be featured in Eastern National 's Passport To Your National Parks 2018 Regional Stamp Set .
For the first time in the Steamtown National Historic Site 's 32 years , the park will appear on collectors ' stamps sold across the United States National Park System .
Distributed by Eastern National , the Passport To Your National Parks 2018 Regional Stamp Set — collected by many parks enthusiasts — now features Steamtown as its 2018 Mid-Atlantic Regional Stamp .
The historic site joins numerous parks featured on the stamps that stick inside Eastern National 's passports books .
“ There are millions of frequent National Park visitors and we 're all about trying to get more people to visit our park , ” said Ruth Giardina , Steamtown gift shop manager . “ One way to encourage people is the passport . ”
Giardina was instrumental in getting a Steamtown stamp .
The stamp features a photo by Steamtown volunteer James Benetzky that shows a steam engine pulling through the park 's turntable , a device used to turn trains . The park 's other engines can be seen in the background .
“ It is a very dynamic photo and stood out from the rest ” because the photo does n't feature typical landscape imagery , said Emily Geesaman , Eastern National marketing manager . “ It 's a more action-oriented and compelling image that showcases this particular site . ”
Passport books vary in size and color with the most common , a 104-page guidebook , mimicking the look of a United States passport . Its pages give detailed information about the National Park System while blank pages leave space to place the stamps and date cancellations found in most park book stores . Cancellations mark the date and name of the park visited .
Eastern National , a nonprofit which supports the National Park System by enhancing visitors experiences with educational products , releases new commemorative stamp sets every year . This is the first year Steamtown , which opened in 1986 , the same year Eastern National started distributing the stamps , made the cut . Eastern National runs Steamtown 's gift shop .
Steamtown joins the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site , Biscayne National Park and Appalachian National Scenic Trail , among others , on the new 10-stamp set , which cost $ 4.95 .
“ It brings more awareness , ” said Steamtown Superintendent Debbie Conway . “ There are a lot of people who definitely have their national park passport wherever they go . ”
Collectors often comb through previous year 's stamp sets in National Park Gift Shops to find certain parks for their passports . The historic site is among 417 units of the National Park System that includes major parks like the Grand Canyon , recreation areas and military parks .

Uber will re-start its ride-hailing business in Finland on Wednesday after a one-year pause , it said , seeking to benefit from the country 's transport law reform .
The U.S. company has come under pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe , who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules .
In Finland , Uber was deemed legal provided its drivers held valid taxi licenses , but the company has been the target of police investigations and drivers have been ordered to give up their earnings to the state for not having valid permits .
An overhaul of transport legislation came into force on July 1 , removing a cap on the number of taxi licenses the government issues in a year and fare restrictions , while creating a legal framework for apps such as Uber .
The company will relaunch its uberX and UberBLACK services on Wednesday afternoon in the wider capital region , including Helsinki , Espoo , Vantaa and Kauniainen .
“ Drivers who have been fully licensed under the new regulations will now be able to help hundreds of thousands of Finns get around at the touch of a button , ” Uber Nordics general manager Joel Jarvinen said in a statement .
“ We hope that other countries , where local people are not currently able to use apps like Uber either to get around or to make money on their terms , will soon follow suit . ”
Jarvinen said more than a quarter million people in the Helsinki area have opened the Uber app since August even though the company was not operating .
post-mayor 's cup
Days after the conclusion of the 2017 Cebu City Mayor 's Cup Commercial Basketball Tournament , the city 's basketball scene has reverted to being idle once more — a state that is lamented by some of Cebu 's most experienced and decorated players .
ADVERTISEMENT
Mark Jonas Ababon , the aforementioned tournament 's Most Valuable Player , said that he pities today 's crop of talented ballers , who now have to resort to barnstorming different leagues — an act more commonly known around these parts as “ panalay ” — around the region after exhausting their playing eligibility in the collegiate ranks .
“ It 's important that the basketball scene in Cebu be brought back , ” said the former cager of the University of the Visayas who had the benefit of playing in Cebu 's esteemed commercial leagues — the Cebu Basketball Federation , the Cebu Basketball Association and the Cebu Basketball League — during his time .
“ Being able to play in those leagues really made a huge difference in my career . It was a stepping stone for me to eventually play in the PBL ( Philippine Basketball League ) and the Liga Pilipinas , ” added Ababon , whose career reached its penultimate height when he suited up for Granny Goose during the PBL 's 2005-2006 season .
Ababon said that he hopes that today 's batch of basketball players would be able to experience playing in different leagues apart from the Cesafi .
“ Our fresh graduates here , they 're very talented . But without the benefit of having tournaments here in Cebu , they 're forced to play-for-pay alongside us old guys . It 's a waste , ” Ababon noted .
Janjan Auditor , another collegiate standout who 's a regular on the “ panalay ” scene , said Cebu City should have more competitions than the province , not the other way around .
“ They have a lot of potential but just lack both experience and exposure . We 're supposed to be the hoops hotbed outside of Manila but sadly , there are far more tournaments being held in the provinces than here in the city itself , ” observed Auditor , who suited up and won a title playing with current PBA MVP June Mar Fajardo with the University of Cebu .
“ If only more leagues were established , it would go a long way towards helping players out here in the hopes of getting them to the next level , ” he added .

What a Goal from @ AKannok to secure the win late in the 3rd . 5-4 . Assists from @ brayden_watts29 and @ TyRonning7 . This was Ronning 's 200 @ TheWHL point ! pic.twitter.com/ARoGqhsm8T — Vancouver Giants ( @ WHLGiants ) February 4 , 2018
Here 's what we learned from the Vancouver Giants ' 5-4 win over the Medicine Hat Tigers on Saturday at the Langley Events Centre .
* It was the most engaging , entertaining game we 've had at the LEC in awhile . Medicine Hat plays their traditional quick style this season , and maybe they dragged Vancouver back into that brand of game .
There were plenty of uptempos , fan friendly nights at the LEC prior to the holiday break . Vancouver home games during the 2018 calendar year had taken a step back in that regard , or at least until Saturday .
Rookie defenceman Alex Kannok Leipert bagged the winner at 16:54 of the third period , sneaking in from the right point to the face-off circle and converting a Brayden Watts pass from behind the net after Ty Ronning had kept a play alive by sprawling to swipe a loose puck away from a Medicine Hat defender .
Ronning , the New York Rangers prospects , has gotten lots of press for his goal-scoring exploits this season . Lots of press . He added his 47th goal of the season earlier in the evening , moving him to with one of Evander Kane 's single-season team record , set in 2008-09 .
His play on the winner , though , was heart and hustle . The Giants did get more of that type of thing on the night then maybe they 've had in the last while .
“ Our work ethic , our hunt , our retrievals , our reloads were really good tonight , ” said Vancouver coach Jason McKee . “ That goal was a direct result of us being first on a puck .
“ I use the saying ‘ When you think you 've done enough , do more , ' and we saw that tonight . We had guys doing more . ”
Kannok Leipert has been a healthy scratch three of the past seven games with the Giants , which adds another layer to the goal . Bowen Byram , the superb 16-year-old , has gotten the majority of the attention amongst the Vancouver blue liners , but youngsters Kannok Leipert , 17 , and Kaleb Bulych , who just turned 18 , have proven more than capable . They 've been taking turns sitting out since the trade deadline , when Vancouver picked up over-age defenceman Brennan Riddle in a bid to bring a poise and a calm to their own zone .
Byram , centre Tyler Popowich , and right-winger Dawson Holt had the other goals for Vancouver .
Defenceman Dylan MacPherson , with a bank shot off a Vancouver defender at 10:12 of the third period that made it 4-4 , was among the goal scorers for the Tigers .
Medicine Hat ( 26-22-7-0 ) was playing their fourth game in five days as part of a B.C . road trip .
Vancouver ( 28-16-5-3 ) is four points in back of both the Kelowna Rockets ( 32-16-3-1 ) and the Victoria Royals ( 32-18-3-1 ) for top spot in the B.C . Division . The Rockets , who lost 8-2 to the Everett Silvertips on Saturday and Giants both have two games in hand on the Royals , who beat the Seattle Thunderbirds 3-2 in overtime on Saturday .
Vancouver is at Kelowna on Wednesday .
The Federal Government on Friday filed a criminal charge against the Chairman of Code of Conduct Tribunal , Danladi Umar , over an allegation of receiving N10 million from one Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo .
The charge marked CR/109/18 was filed on behalf of the Federal Government by Festus Keyamo , SAN , at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory .
Umar had on June 14 , 2017 discharged and acquitted the Senate President Bukola Saraki of the 18-count charges preferred against him by the Federal Government at the Code of Conduct Tribunal .
Umar had insisted that the Federal Government could not substantiate evidence it made against Saraki .
Saraki was prosecuted on an 18-count charge bordering on false asset declaration and other related offences preferred against him in September 2015 .
Consequent upon the outcome of the CCT trial , the FG headed to the appellate court to seek redress .
But the Court of Appeal on December 12 , 2017 , ordered the CCT led by Umar to try Saraki on 3 Counts , having upheld the decision of Umar that dismissed 15 out of the 18-charges .
However , Umar 's ordeal started following a petition written against him , dated June 20 , 2013 by Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo .
In the latest development , Umar is being prosecuted by the FG on a 2-count charge .
Count one reads , “ That you , DANLADI YAKUBU UMAR , being the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal and presiding over a case with Charge No . CCT/ABJ/03/12 , involving one Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo , sometime in 2012 , at Abuja , within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court did ask for the sum of N10,000,000.00 ( Ten A Million Naira ) from the said Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo , for a favour to be afterwards shown to him in relation to the pending Charge ( No . CCT/ABJ/03/12 ) in discharge of your official duties and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 12 ( 1 ) ( a ) & ( b ) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act , 2003 ” .
Count two reads , “ That you , DANLADI YAKUBU UMAR , being the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal and presiding over a case with Charge No . CCT/ABJ/03/12 , involving one Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo , sometime in 2012 , at Abuja , within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court did receive the sum of N1,800,000.00 ( One Million , Eight Hundred Thousand Naira ) from the said Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo , through your Personal Assistant by name Alhaji Gambo Abdullahi , for a favour to be afterwards shown to him in relation to the pending Charge ( No . CCT/ABJ/03/12 ) in discharge of your official duties and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 12 ( 1 ) ( a ) & ( b ) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act , 2003 ” .
In a bid to prosecute the CCT Chairman , the FG stated it would rely on the following documents to prove it 's case beyond reasonable doubt .
They include a Petition dated 20th June , 2013 , by Rasheed O. Taiwo ; Statement of the Defendant ; Zenith Bank Statement of Taiwo Rasheed Owolabi ; Zenith Bank Statement of Ali Gambo Abdullahi ; Copy of Zenith bank Cheque of Taiwo Rasheed Owolabi and Copy of Zenith Bank Cheque of Ali Gambo Abdullahi .
Others include , all processes and documents in Charge No . CCT/ABJ/03/12 ; Statements of Witnesses ;
Other relevant documents and Proof of Evidence .
More so , Keyamo revealed that the FG will be calling the following as witnesses . They are Rasheed Owolabi Taiwo , Alex Ebbah and Reuben Omosynho , all Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ; Abdulmajeed Ibrahim ; Mohammed Bala ; and Staff of Zenith Bank , Abuja ( on witness summons to tender documents ) .
The matter is yet to be assigned to a Judge for arraignment of the CCT Chairman .
A self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian Sunday night in Tempe , Arizona , police said , in what appears to be the first case of its kind .
Comments
REUTERS : U.S. stocks were set to open slightly lower on Wednesday , after a recent spate of record highs , as investors assessed upbeat economic data that strengthened the prospect of an interest rate hike .
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday , before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee , that delaying a rate hike would be unwise , but did not indicate when the Fed would raise rates .
While she painted a largely upbeat picture of the economy , she also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration .
Yellen 's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will be scrutinized for further clues on when the central bank might pull the trigger , as will be comments by three Fed presidents at other scheduled appearances .
Some Fed officials have said it would be prudent to move sooner than later , but traders have priced in a slim chance of a rate hike at the Fed 's March meeting .
`` Yellen 's hawkish stand yesterday was well received as investors focused on the upbeat assessment of the economy , '' Peter Cardillo , chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote in a note .
Adding to the recent spate of strong data , reports on Wednesday showed retail sales rose much more than expected last month , while the consumer price index notched its biggest rise in nearly four years as households paid more for gasoline and other goods .
Dow e-minis were up 2 points , or 0.01 percent at 8:57 a.m . ET , with 30,047 contracts changing hands .
S & P 500 e-minis were down 5 points , or 0.21 percent , with 136,215 contracts traded .
Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 9.25 points , or 0.18 percent , on volume of 24,669 contracts .
Wall Street 's main indexes have closed at record highs for the past four sessions , sparked by President Donald Trump 's promise on Thursday of a major tax announcement and fueled by Yellen 's comments .
`` While the rise continues to feed on itself , a prudent approach of not fighting the tape should be accompanied by being cautious , '' Cardillo said .
Among stocks , Dow component Procter & Gamble rose 2.5 percent to US $ 90.05 after activist investor Trian Fund disclosed a US $ 3.5 billion stake in the consumer products company .
AIG slipped nearly 5 percent to US $ 63.55 after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss .
Shares of Southwest , United Continental , American Airlines rose more than 2 percent after Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping US $ 2.1 billion in each of the carriers .
Watchmaker Fossil dropped 19 percent to US $ 18.51 after posting fourth-quarter revenue that missed analysts ' expectations .

SEOUL : US Vice President Mike Pence arrives in Tokyo on Tuesday ( Apr 18 ) bringing a renewed commitment to Japan 's security amid a growing threat from a nuclear armed North Korea .
Throughout his bareknuckle election campaign , US President Donald Trump repeatedly called into question a mutual defence treaty between Japan and the United States , suggesting Tokyo should pay for its own security .
But now , Pence will try to reassure his jittery hosts that those decades-old security commitments are ironclad , a necessity made more acute as tensions rise over Pyongyang 's latest missile test and Washington 's refusal to rule out military action against the regime .
Defying international pressure , the North on Sunday test-fired another missile and fears are growing it may also be preparing a sixth nuclear test .
North Korea could react to a potential US strike by targeting South Korea or Japan , and officials in Tokyo and Seoul have been ill at ease with the more bellicose language deployed by Trump 's administration .
During a visit to the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea on Monday , Pence pointed to the new president 's recent strikes on a Syrian airbase and an Islamic State complex in Afghanistan as a warning to Pyongyang not to underestimate the administration 's resolve .
`` All options are on the table '' in pushing for an end to Pyongyang 's nuclear programme , Pence said , adding that the era of US `` strategic patience '' in dealing with the regime was over .
Washington is worried that North Korea may soon build a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the United States .
Like South Korea , Japan already faces a direct threat from the secretive regime .
In February , the North simultaneously fired four ballistic missiles off its east coast , three of which fell provocatively close to Japan , in what it said was a drill for an attack on US bases in the country .
Pence 's Japanese hosts will likely be cautious about any US military action that could trigger a broader regional conflict .
Their hope is that the White House will focus on pressuring China , Pyongyang 's only major ally and biggest trade partner , to redouble its efforts to rein in the regime and prompt North Korea to return to the negotiating table after it abandoned the six-party talks in 2009 .
`` With close coordination , I expect we will strongly demand North Korea to refrain from taking provocative actions and to adhere to UN Security Council resolutions , '' said Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga .
Pence 's trip will also feature a heavy economic focus .
Trump 's decision to scrap a 12-nation trans-Pacific trade deal was a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who expended substantial political capital to get the deal passed at home .
In Tokyo , there is still hope that the core of the agreement , thrashed out between the United States and Japan and intended to counterbalance China 's regional economic power , can be salvaged in some form .
But US officials say expectations of an ambitious bilateral trade deal may be premature .
As the strike action by the Joint Health Sector Union ( JOHESU ) enters the second week , patients in federal health institutions have continued to lament their situations .
When our correspondent visited the Lagos University Teaching Hospital ( LUTH ) , yesterday , there was queue of patients at every unit in the hospital , especially at the pharmacy post . Some of the patients who spoke with LEADERSHIP said doctors are attending to patients , but it is at a very slow pace when compared with what it used to be .
Mr Adebayo Dele , a 40 year old diabetes patient said yesterday was his appointment to see the doctor , but unlike other day , he has been in the waiting room for five hours trying to see his doctor .
Dele said , “ It is so unfortunate that my appointment had to be today . I came very early to see my doctor at LUTH , only for me to see a long queue of patients trying to see him . When I asked why the long queue , I was told that other health workers except doctors are on strike .
“ I came here 10:00am and this is 3 o'clock and I am yet to see a doctor . I think I will have to go home and then come back tomorrow very early in the morning so that I can leave on time . ”
Another patient who want to be anonymous said she regretted coming to LUTH because she wasted all her time , without achieving the reason she came to the hospital .
She said , “ Though my case is n't an emergency case , but I would need a qualified laboratory scientist to diagnose me of what brought me to LUTH this morning . My prayer is that my case should not get worse before they call-off the strike . ”
LEADERSHIP also visited the emergency unit and found out that though doctors are attending to patients there are still many patients to be attended to due to limited manpower .
The public relations officer , LUTH , Kelechi Oduneme , while speaking exclusively with LEADERSHIP said , “ We are attending to patients , the doctors are on ground , you know doctors are not involved , yet we still need the efforts of other health workers for smooth operation .
“ The management of LUTH has decided to work with the available manpower along with qualified medical volunteers . There are many patients still on the ward and we are managing to care for them with the limited staff we have . We are also managing emergency cases and out-patients with the limited staff .
“ The management of LUTH however regret any inconveniences the strike action would have on our patients , both in-patients and out-patients and we hope that this issue would be resolved between the Ministry of Health and JOHESU as soon as possible , so that Nigerians can once more enjoy quality healthcare services from all health professionals . ”
The national chairman , JOHESU , Comrade Biobelemoye Josiah , in a telephone conversation with our correspondent said since Wednesday , the strike has been on in all the federal health institutions nationwide .
Josiah said that they embarked on the strike because the government has failed to fulfill the agreement both parties signed since 30th of September , 2017 , an agreement that would have been fulfilled five weeks after the day they signed the agreement .
He said , “ It is six months as at today and government did not see the reason to fulfill its own bargain . We also gave government 21 day ultimatum as at February this year , and they did not also seize that opportunity to do the needful so as to avert the strike action .
Chase Utley was announced as a pinch-hitter for Brandon Morrow , so Arizona Manager Torey Lovullo replace David Hernandez with Andrew Chafin . So Dave Roberts replaced Utley with Austin Barnes .
After all that maneuvering , Barnes singled to right .
And that 's it for Chafin . Nice outing . Jimmie Sherfy will now be pitching .
Chris Taylor grounded to first , Barnes advancing to second .
Corey Seager triple down the right-field line , scoring Barnes .
Justin Turner singled through the drawn-in infield , scoring Seager . Turner has five RBIs in this game , tying a postseason record held by Pedro Guerrero and Davey Lopes .
Cody Bellinger struck out .
Yasiel Puig flied to left .
Manchester City players have been given four days off next week and Pep Guardiola has told them they can go anywhere they want .
City appear to be cruising towards the Premier League title and are 15 points clear at the top of the table ahead of Saturday 's game at Burnley .
The players will go their separate ways after the match at Turf Moor which kicks off at lunchtime and will not have to report back for training until Wednesday afternoon .
There was an issue last September when Sergio Aguero was ruled out for two weeks when he broke a rib in a car crash while on a break in Amsterdam , but Guardiola says there are no restrictions on where the players can travel .
“ The doors of the CFA ( City Football Academy ) will be closed , ” Guardiola said . “ They can travel , they can do whatever they want
“ They have to forget a little bit about football , be with their families and friends and move on .
“ Wednesday afternoon we have to prepare here , three training sessions for Leicester and Basel , and we have to move on . But we need a break a little bit , everybody .
“ Not just the players , the staff , the physios , everybody . It was a tough , tough period in winter time . We have that chance for three or four days and we give it to them . ”
BEIJING : China is considering revisions to its maritime safety law which would make foreign submersibles travel on the surface and report their movements to authorities when in China 's waters , state media said .
China set off a dispute with the United States in December when a Chinese naval vessel took a U.S. underwater drone in the disputed South China Sea , though China later returned it .
The draft revisions , reported by the official China News Service late on Tuesday , make no direct mention of the South China Sea .
`` Foreign submersibles , passing though territorial waters of the People 's Republic of China , should travel on the surface , raise their national flag , and report to Chinese maritime management administrations , '' the news service cited the draft revision as saying , without giving details .
The draft will also allow Chinese maritime authorities to stop foreign ships entering Chinese waters if the ships are judged to be a possible cause of harm to navigational safety and order , the China News Service said .
China claims a large part of the South China Sea , and has been constructing artificial islands and boosting its military presence in the waterway .
Taiwan , Malaysia , Vietnam , the Philippines and Brunei also claim parts of the waters , that command strategic sea lanes and have rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits .
China has a separate dispute with Japan over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea .
China has repeatedly said it is committed to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea , and has been upset with the U.S. military for carrying out freedom of navigation operations close to Chinese-controlled islands .
The China News Service said the revisions to the law were based on the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea and Chinese laws on the sea , adjacent areas and exclusive economic zones .
The revisions will `` increase the basic system of managing foreign ships entering and exiting territorial waters , inoffensive passage , right of hot pursuit and expulsion '' , it added .

BEIJING : A court in southeastern China on Tuesday sentenced the former Communist Party boss of the northern province of Hebei to 15 years in jail after finding him guilty of corruption , the latest senior official jailed in a sweeping crackdown on graft .
Zhou Benshun was the top official of Hebei province , which surrounds Beijing and is China 's most important steel producer .
He had earlier worked with one-time domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang , who was jailed for life in 2015 after a secret trial in China 's most sensational graft scandal in 70 years . The two are not related despite sharing a family name .
In a statement on its official microblog , the court in Xiamen city said that between 2000 and 2015 Zhou had directly or via family members taken more than 40 million yuan ( 4.6 million pounds ) in bribes .
The bribes were given in exchange for help with real estate projects , bank loans and promotions , the court said .
Zhou admitted his guilt and has repented , the court said , adding that most of the bribes were handled by family members and that Zhou only found out about it subsequently .
Zhou has decided not to appeal , it said .
It was not possible to reach legal or family representatives for comment .
The Hebei city of Zhangjiakou has won the right to host the 2022 Winter Olympics along with Beijing . Zhou had attended meetings of the bid committee .
Zhou became party chief in Hebei in 2013 . He had worked for five years in the Central Politics and Law Commission as its secretary general , under Zhou Yongkang .
The court statement made no direct mention of Zhou Yongkang , but noted that some of Zhou Benshun 's crimes occurred while he was working on the Central Politics and Law Commission .
Zhou Benshun 's case was featured in a government-made documentary about corruption broadcast in October , describing his involvement in `` superstition '' .
Party officials are not supposed to practice religion and the charge of superstition is often levelled against the corrupt to further blacken their names .

SEOUL : South Korean President Moon Jae-In hopes to `` normalise '' ties with giant neighbour China on his first state visit to the country this week , his office said on Monday ( Dec 11 ) , after Beijing was infuriated by a US missile system deployment .
Seoul and Washington decided to install the powerful US THAAD ( Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ) system in the South earlier this year to guard against threats from the nuclear-armed North .
Beijing saw it as a threat to its own security and reacted furiously , slapping a string of measures against South Korean businesses and banning group tours to the South , in moves seen as economic retaliation .
China is the South 's top trading partner and the diplomatic row took a major toll on many South Korean firms , most notably retail giant Lotte Group , which provided the land to host the powerful US missile system .
Angry boycott campaigns and regulatory crackdowns by Chinese authorities decimated its business in the world 's second-largest economy , and it was forced to put its supermarket unit in China up for sale .
But last month the two countries issued identically-worded statements on their mutual desire to improve relations .

It did not state any specifics , but Beijing has demanded that Seoul formally promise not to deploy any more THAAD launchers and not to join any regional US missile defence system .
Nam Gwan-Pyo , a deputy director of the presidential national security office , did not give reporters details of any concrete steps that could be expected from Moon 's four-day trip - his first to China since taking power in May .
But he said it would be a turning point in relations towards a `` more mature '' relationship , he said , `` by recovering bilateral trust and strengthening friendship between the leaders of the two nations '' .
Ties recently showed some - albeit limited - signs of thaw as China 's state tourism board approved last month Seoul-bound group tours from some parts of China .
Moon heads to Beijing on Wednesday and will hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping the following day to discuss issues including how to curb the North 's nuclear weapons drive , Nam added .
China - the North 's sole diplomatic ally and economic lifeline - has stepped up sanctions on the North amid pressure from the US and the international community to play a bigger role in taming its regime .
Beijing has backed recent UN sanctions imposed on the North over its nuclear and missile tests , including a ban on coal imports , although it repeatedly pushed for talks to defuse the tensions .
It has urged a `` double freeze '' on both North Korean weapons tests and joint military exercises by Seoul and Washington - an idea consistently rejected by the US and South Korea .
KUALA LUMPUR : The press secretary of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday ( Aug 14 ) hit back at attempts to blame ruling party UMNO after an opposition-organised forum descended into violence .
The `` wild allegations '' blaming Najib and UMNO for the violence at Sunday 's 'Nothing to Hide 2.0 ' forum were `` false , reckless and unbecoming '' , his press secretary Tengku Sariffuddin in a statement on Monday .
He noted that the forum was organised and managed by the opposition Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia ( Bersatu ) , and attended by its leaders and supporters .
`` Bersatu was entirely responsible for the event , so to blame the pandemonium on UMNO is an attempt by the opposition to cover up the shameless action of its own members , '' he said .
The townhall meeting in Shah Alam was led by Bersatu chairman , former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad . It was aimed at highlighting the major financial scandal that has ensnared Najib and spurred his former mentor into coming out of retirement at the age of 92 .
About 90 minutes into the event , troublemakers started throwing shoes , chairs and bottles at Dr Mahathir . Flares were also set off in the venue . At least two people were injured .

Opposition figures blamed Malaysia 's ruling party , with Parti Keadilan Rakyat deputy president Azmin Ali saying that Najib was `` using gangsterism to silence Mahathir '' .
However , Tengku Sariffuddin said that the violence erupted after opposition supporters became `` upset with Dr Mahathir Mohamad 's inability to answer questions ... on scandals during his rule , such as the jailing of Anwar Ibrahim and the Memali Killings .
`` The 'Nothing to Hide 2.0 ' forum instead became an 'Everything to Hide ' forum . ''
Dr Mahathir recently joined forces with long-time enemy Anwar Ibrahim , who is in jail , to form opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan .
The coalition was also criticised by the prime minister 's press secretary , who called it a `` fundamentally divided '' `` marriage of convenience by former enemies who did everything to destroy each other for decades '' .
`` If Pakatan is unable to even organise its own forums without chaos , we can only imagine what they would do to Malaysia , '' Tengku Sariffuddin added. `` It is clear that it would be a disaster for the country if the DAP ( Democratic Action Party ) -led opposition assumed power at the next General Election . ''
Tengku Sariffuddin reiterated in his statement that the authorities would investigate the incident and `` take the necessary action '' .
Meanwhile , `` this government under the leadership of the prime minister will continue to focus on the economic welfare , social well-being and security of all Malaysians '' , he added .
REUTERS : Roger Federer showed no signs of rust in his first competitive match for six months when he outclassed Dan Evans 6-3 6-4 at the Hopman Cup on Monday .
The 17-times grand slam winner underwent knee surgery in February and , after missing the French Open with a back injury , announced in July that he needed extensive rehabilitation and would be sidelined for the rest of the season .
Federer walked out to a standing ovation from more than 13,500 fans at the Perth Arena and breezed to an easy win over Evans , putting Switzerland 1-0 ahead in their match against Britain in the mixed team event .
`` The standing ovation coming in , it was very special . I 'm here now enjoying and looking forward to the week of course , '' the 35-year-old said in a courtside interview .
Asked what keeps him going , Federer said ; `` I guess it depends also on how you get hurt . I got hurt filling up a bath for my children . It 's not really the way I wanted to leave this game . ''
The former world number one , who has slipped to 16th in the rankings , said he enjoyed the time out but had started to miss tennis .
`` You ca n't be more happy to return back on a Centre Court , taping your ankles , tying your shoes and walking out and getting that kind of welcome , '' he said .
Federer has not won a grand slam title since Wimbledon in 2012 .
`` It would be nice to win another one , of course I 'd even take two-three-four , '' he said .
`` It 's tough at the top . A lot of good guys are there right now , a lot of young guys are coming up too . The gap 's definitely not very big but I gave it chance . Let 's see what happens . ''

ASTANA : Talks on the Syrian crisis involving Russia , Iran , and Turkey that were due to start in the Kazakh capital , Astana , on Wednesday have been delayed by one day , Kazakhstan 's foreign ministry said without explaining the reason for the delay .
Syrian rebels cast doubt on Monday over whether they would attend the talks , accusing Russia of failing to get Damascus to comply fully with a ceasefire or take any confidence-building steps .
Kazakhstan , Moscow 's close political ally , said last week the two-day talks , to which United Nations special envoy for Syria , Staffan de Mistura , had also been invited , would focus on consolidating the Syrian ceasefire .
Delegations of the Damascus government and the rebels attended the previous round of talks in Astana in January but refused to negotiate directly with each other or sign any documents .
A new round of U.N.-backed peace talks is due to begin in Geneva next week .

Taking note of the decrepit condition of the capital on Saturday , Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif wrote to the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad Mayor Sheikh Ansar Aziz to explain the failings of the CDA in its failure to maintain overall sanitation and cleanliness .
It is refreshing to see the PM take note of such matters that impact the common man .
As per recurring reports , the CDA has been failing to keep up with its responsibilities , contributing to the rising levels of pollution , faulty street lights , unfit drinking water and the overall laxity in garbage removal within Islamabad .
In a move that looks like responsible governance , the Prime Minister adopted a hardline stance with the CDA and CADD regarding the maintenance of the beauty and visual aesthetics of the city .
He asserted that the minister should immediately suspend the responsible people and hold inquiry into the matter as to why these officials had failed in accomplishing the task in given timeframe .
It seems that the Prime Minister is taking a leaf out of Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif 's playbook and implementing a firmer approach with development authorities and civic bodies that have been idling with their responsibilities in the capital .
The Chief Minister of Punjab has always adopted strict measures and comprehensible plans for the maintenance of the provincial metropolis .
While many can disagree with the politics of the party and the scandals they have embroiled themselves in over the years , it must be conceded that in Punjab the party has set a benchmark for urban revitalisation to be emulated by other civic authorities .
Perhaps this is the right time for the PM to bring the focus back to good governance and efficient management of authorities that have been dithering of late .
The ruling parties in each province will realise in time , that when good governance is taken up as a goal , there will be appreciation from the people , and this is a fool-proof way to stay in power with maximum legitimacy .
Sushant Singh Rajput opts out of Chanda Mama Door Ke due to date clash , plans to make own space film
Mumbai : Sushant Singh Rajput has opted out of Chanda Mama Door Ke due to date conflicts but plans to develop his own space movie , according to a release .
The 32-year-old actor , who was recently in news for buying land on the Moon , plans to make what he claims would be India 's first space film , to be developed via Innsaei Ventures Pvt Ltd , a company a co-founded by Rajput and entrepreneur Varun Mathur .
`` Sushant 's passion for the Moon and space is second to none in this sphere . He has unparalleled interest to learn more about the universe , and to delve into anything that might help him understand this phenomenon further . However , since there was a lot of up and down in this film , Sushant will not be able to give his dates to Chanda Mama Door Ke since he has his hands full with many projects .
`` Having said that , it does not mean we wo n't be making a space film . Innsaei Ventures is quite keen on making a space film and Sushant will be working on this very soon . I extend my very best wishes to Mr Sanjay Puran Singh ( director of Chanda Mama Door Ke ) and Viki Rajani for this film . I hope it brings them great success , '' Mathur said in a statement .
The actor is currently working on Abhishek Chaubey 's dacoit drama Son Chiriya , Kedarnath and Drive .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it approved Sanofi SA 's Admelog as the first follow-on biologic version of Eli Lilly and Co 's fast-acting insulin , Humalog .
REUTERS : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it approved Sanofi SA 's Admelog as the first follow-on biologic version of Eli Lilly and Co 's fast-acting insulin , Humalog .
Admelog , generally taken just before meals , was approved for use in children older than three and adults with type 1 diabetes , as well as adults with type 2 diabetes .
Like Humalog , which earned Lilly US $ 696.2 million in the latest quarter , the short-acting drug helps diabetics control blood sugar levels after eating .
Additionally , diabetics may need a long-acting insulin treatment to prevent blood sugar levels from fluctuating through the day .
Patients with type 1 diabetes require both types of insulin , while those with type 2 may not need a short-acting insulin .
Admelog 's approval bolsters Sanofi 's position in the diabetes treatment market after its blockbuster drug Lantus , a long-acting insulin , lost U.S. patent rights in 2015 .

( JASON SCHMITT - For Digital First Media ) Troy United 's Quest Bigelow ( 6 ) fires a shot past Rochester United goalie Cole Friedman during the second period Friday night .
ROCHESTER > > The Troy United hockey team held off a third period surge by Rochester United to claim a key 3-2 victory in OAA Red action late Friday night .
Its a good win for our team ,  Troy United head coach Tim Zimmerman said . I thought they played with a lot of energy tonight . I thought it was a good battle between two evenly matched teams . It just comes down to a bounce here or there , and we got the lucky one today.

Mitch Cochran got what proved to be the game winning goal with 9:05 to play in the third period , slamming home a pass from Merrick Witkowski for a power play goal and a 3-0 Troy United lead . It was Troy Uniteds first shot on a goal in a period dominated by Rochester United , who piled up a 17-6 advantage in shots on goal in the period .

Rochester United would make it close late  getting back to back power play goals from Kyle Crutchfield and Tyler Drummy to cut Troy Uniteds lead to 3-2 with 4:24 to play .
I think the boys played well all things considered and I was very proud of how the intensity continued in the third period , and down the stretch I thought we had an opportunity to compete for a win ,  Rochester United head coach Bryan Kowalski said .
As much as Rochester United dominated the third period , Troy United had dominated the second period . Troy United started the period fast when Quest Bigelow and Merrick Witkowski scored just seven seconds apart early in the period to give Troy United a 2-0 lead . Despite a slew of power plays  including nearly three straight minutes of five-on-three time at the end of the period , Troy United could not extend the lead any further in that period as the Rochester United penalty killers lead by Steven Moote , Mitchell Shell , and Mike Young largely shut down the Troy United power play on the night , killing off seven of eight power plays including all the five-on-three time .
Thats something we take a lot of pride in  our penalty killers ,  Kowalski said . We ask a lot from those guys , and thats something that we work on in practice . Its something thats important . Ultimately , we dont want to kill penalties ; but when we have to , we have the right personnel out there to do it.
After not having much to do for the first two periods , Troy United goalie A.J . Moceri had to come up big in the third period  and did . Rochester United came out strong and generated the first 10 shots of the third period until Cochrans goal extended Troy Uniteds lead . In all , Moceri finished with 20 saves in the victory .
A.J . played really good , played really aggressive tonight . I was glad to see that ,  Zimmerman said . He was a little down the last couple weeks . But hes battled back during practice and it showed in the game today.
With the win , Troy United ( 14-3 , 9-1 OAA Red ) maintains first place in the Oakland Activities Association Red Division . Troy United will now head home to host the second place Lake Orion Dragons on Wednesday in a game that could decide the division title .
It will be a good game . It will be an up and down game , probably similar to this game . Lake Orion is playing really good right now , and theyve had a really tough schedule . So theyll be battled tested for sure ,  Zimmerman said .
Rochester United ( 10-7-5 , 4-3-3 OAA Red ) has nearly two weeks off before facing Walled Lake Western on February 15 .

Mabel Gray 's James Rigato believes Detroit 's food scene could use more criticism .
Once again , Detroit restaurant `` critics '' ( with a couple exceptions ) refuse to offer specific negative feedback in response to a direct question asking about disappointing experiences . This has been a long-term issue , and without fair assessments ( as opposed to blind cheerleading ) , diners and readers are ultimately losing out .
Among the many end-of-the-year pieces capping 2016 , we noticed Eater Detroit 's annual roundup of “ food writers ” sounding off on “ The Year 's Most Disappointing Detroit Restaurant Meals . ” With that sort of set-up , it seemed destined to be a rip-roaring read.What we found , however , was a list of meager , often anonymous complaints that left us unsatisfied . Only slightly more than half of the writers had the nerve to name the actual restaurants that disappointed them . And one writer was apparently disappointed by nothing at all . ( Really ? Somebody dines for a paycheck and everything is great all the time ? For real ? ) This caused somebody at our editorial office to ask the question : “ Are these people 'restaurant critics ' or 'food writers ' ? ” It 's a fair question , one that was , in fact , voiced by a commenter on Eater Detroit 's article : What is behind these tepid , safe , name-free statements of what needs improvement ? Probably a lot of things.Chief among them might be a phrase I 've heard before : Detroit is a small town , and you should be nice to people on the way up so they 'll be nice to you on the way down.There 's a certain logic to it : Why needlessly make enemies ? Want to butt heads with people all day long ? All you 'll get is a headache.But it has arguably gone beyond that in Detroit , where new restaurants have become almost synonymous with “ urban regeneration. ” The pressure for discriminating fine-dining writers to trade their pommes frites for pom-poms has never been greater . After all , when you criticize a business owner who has invested tens of thousands of dollars in “ a neighborhood on the upswing , ” are n't you just being a troublemaker ? Actually , no.It always sounds ridiculous to state the obvious , but here it is : In a way , it 's one remaining vestige of what used to be called “ consumer journalism. ” And here 's how it works best : • The critic is n't greeted by the manager upon arriving at the restaurant ; the critic pretends to be just another customer.• Real restaurant critics do n't get special treatment or free food ; they judge the experience as if spending their own money.• A restaurant review is supposed to be something more than a fireside chat with a delighted business owner ; if the food , service , drinks , or anything else need to be addressed , the critic needs to bring this up.Where in the past we 'd have restaurant reviews , we often instead have what are essentially development stories , keyed to a kind of entrepreneurial mythology . In this sort of atmosphere , genuine , constructive criticism can be regarded as “ biting the hand that feeds you. ” And so Detroit 's overheated restaurant scene should probably be reminded of a few fundamentals.First , most reviews are n't negative . It 's difficult to justify writing a 1,200-word tear-down and printing 50,000 copies of it . If a restaurant is really that bad , a seasoned dining editor will generally pass on a review and let the dining public render its verdict in receipts.Second , the most brittle reactions to any criticisms often come from owners of brand-new restaurants , especially from entrepreneurs making their first culinary endeavor , being more used to nodding business reporters than actual critics.Most importantly , though , the people who 've been ( or will be ) in this business a long , long timecriticism . We 're reminded of Paul Grosz , who still patrols the rooms at his two restaurants , asking diners about their meals.Grosz does n't do it to bask in accolades or glad-hand big-shot diners . His ear is always cocked to any suggestions , any criticisms . He does n't argue ; he listens , and then acts on what he hears.In an interview several years ago , on the subject of customer comments , Grosz told us , “ I have to adhere to their needs . And that helps me think about menu design and combination of flavors . … You have to evolve . And you ca n't do that on your own ; that would be selfish . You have to know what the customer likes. ” That calls to mind a more recent chat we had with James Rigato , the outspoken chef behind the Root and Mabel Gray . He and a few other young chefs have sort of made it their mission to help make Michigan into an globally recognized food scene . They often pour a fortune into product , take staff on trips to farms and orchards , and fight a daily battle to preserve their scene 's integrity . Rigato believes we need more criticism , not less. “ There needs to be more of a conversation of accountability , ” Rigato said . “ Do n't just open a restaurant because there 's attention and activity in the dining scene . Like , go to San Francisco . You know what happens if a bad restaurant opens in San Francisco ? It closes . Because people wo n't eat there ! Go to Italy . You go to a town of 30,000 people in Abruzzo , and anywhere you eat is awesome . Because if you 're not , people shun you . Somebody 's going to pull you aside and say , 'You ca n't serve this bad food . ' ” And who will help separate the restaurants that provide consistently excellent product from profiteers who saturate the market mystery meat from a bulk foods outlet ? By what agency will diners know who 's doing worthy work in our budding Michigan food scene ? That 's the job of critics . As in naming names and offering criticism that restaurants ignore at their peril . Far from being “ troublemakers , ” , critics can help foster excellence by keeping watch over a dining scene 's integrity. “ If we want to have a internationally relevant food scene , it 's going to come from ethics , ” Rigato said . “ It 's not going to come from pats on the back and awards . There are some chefs and restaurants out there that need serious help . Once you 're low on staff , once you 're busy , and the rent 's going up — ethics are the first thing to go out the door . ”
Capt . Michael Mullen of the U.S. Coast Guard answers questions during a news conference at Burke Lakefront Airport , Friday , Dec. 30 , 2016 , in Cleveland . The U.S. Coast Guard says there 's been no sign of debris or those aboard a plane that took off from the airport on the shores of Lake Erie and went missing overnight .
Possible debris from a small plane that vanished last week after taking off for Ohio State University has been found washing ashore on Lake Erie near the airport where it took off , authorities said Sunday night .

Six people , three of them children , were aboard , returning to Columbus after having attended a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game .
The unified command coordinating search operations by the Coast Guard and local fire and police crews said Sunday night that it had received multiple reports of debris washing ashore east of the airport . None of the reported has been verified as having come from the Cessna , it said .
Cleveland police , who are leading the investigation , said they 're investigating the contents of a bag that was recovered separately Sunday near Shoreby Club Harbor in Bratenahl .

REUTERS : Grammy-winner Dennis Edwards , who performed lead vocals for some of the chart-topping Motown singles recorded by The Temptations in the 1960s and 1970s , has died at age 74 , his manager said on Friday .
Edwards died at a hospital in Chicago on Thursday night or Friday morning of complications from an unspecified illness , his manager Toby Ludwig said by phone .
The singer , who lived outside St. Louis , would have celebrated his 75th birthday on Saturday .
The Alabama-born Edwards replaced David Ruffin as lead singer of The Temptations in 1968 .
Edwards sang lead on some of the vocal group 's most memorable hits , including `` Papa Was a Rollin ' Stone , '' a 1972 release that earned Edwards and the group two Grammy Awards , and `` I Ca n't Get Next To You , '' which topped the pop charts in 1969 .
Edwards left The Temptations around the time the group left Motown to sign with Atlantic Records in 1977 . He rejoined and left multiple times in the 1980s , when the group enjoyed far less success on the pop charts than in the previous two decades .

LAWRENCE , Kan. -- University of Kansas chancellor Douglas Girod says the school did n't produce any written reports after an independent examination of the athletics department during a federal investigation of corruption in college basketball .
Girod said Monday he was given verbal briefings after the Kansas review last fall but he did n't think an external written report was necessary .
The review came before Kansas was named earlier this month as one of the schools where a former Adidas representative allegedly arranged payments to parents of athletes to ensure they committed to the schools .
When The Lawrence Journal-World filed an open records request seeking all written reports related to the review , Kansas officials said no such records exist .
Girod said in an interview the school has found no evidence related to the alleged scheme .
Aaron Carter has left the treatment facility where he was trying to “ improve his health and work on his overall wellness ” in the hopes of “ coming back stronger than ever before ” after only two weeks .
“ Aaron has left the facility where he has been working on his wellness . Several legal and personal matters arose that required his immediate and in-person attention , ” the 29-year-old singer 's rep , Steve Honig , told Page Six in a statement Friday .
He continued , “ He is still very much committed to his wellness and will be continually working toward being the best person possible . ”
No further details were provided regarding the legal and personal matters .
Page Six reported in September that the family of the former child star was talking to the authorities and experts about ways to intervene after a string of concerning incidents including a DUI arrest and a serious car accident . Carter also appeared on an episode of “ The Doctors , ” where Dr. Travis Stork told him he was lucky to be alive .
Ever since getting pregnant , I have had a reoccurring dream that my baby will come out as a carbon copy of my husband with no trace of my genes to be found . Babies often resemble one parent more than another , sometimes even looking identical . These photos of Prince William as a kid vs . Prince George show how adorable that kind of family resemblance can be . Down to the very outfits that their parents dressed them in , Prince George is the spitting image of his dad , and I ca n't get enough of their photos .
Prince George was born on July 22 , 2013 , officially ushering Prince William into fatherhood . Father and son have been photographed together numerous times since and the family resemblance is uncanny . But there is more than just a passing resemblance when you look back on photos of Prince William as a child and compare them to photos of his eldest child — which , by the way , I ca n't stop doing . George has been photographed in many of his biggest moments and photos from roughly 30 years earlier show his dad in the same poses , looking like little twins . So , without further ado , let 's check out some of the royal family 's biggest lookalike moments .
In Their Fathers ' Arms
These two photos of William and George , both dressed in baby blue , being held by their dads in uniform will have you doing double-takes . This one comes with a bonus then-and-now comparison of Prince Charles in profile .
On The First Day Of School
Take a look at this shot of Prince William 's first day of school in 1987 as Princess Diana led him by the hand to Wetherby Preparatory School in Notting Hill , London . Now , check out Prince George on his way to school for his own first day at Thomas Battersea School . Little George was dressed in his `` summer uniform , '' according to TODAY , which includes a blue button-down shirt beneath a navy v-neck sweater and matching shorts . William 's first day called for slightly warmer clothes , but there 's not much else that differs between the two photos .
And Again
These up close photos of the two on their way to school show that their hair was even about the same length — although George has a bit more of a part going on in his hair .
When They Became Older Brothers
Both Prince George and his father were photographed holding their new baby siblings and they look alike there too . There 's an arguable resemblance between Prince Harry as a baby and Princess Charlotte , too . There 's no doubting that this bunch is related .
At Their Siblings ' Christenings
My personal favorite side-by-side photos of the father and son pair features the outfits that they wore to their siblings ' christenings . Royal christenings are a long held practice in the monarchy , according to Pop Sugar , as baptism is an important sacrament in the Church of England . But these occasions also often double as royal babies ' first public appearances , and the family is always dressed to the nines . Prince George is dressed so similarly to William that I thought they were in the same exact outfit . How cute are they ?
Babies often look like their fathers , but Prince William and Prince George take lookalike to a whole new level . The two of them have a lot of features in common and have been photographed in many of the same occasions . Given the tendency towards tradition in the royal family , it 's not all that surprising that they would be posed similarly . But these photos are seriously cute and I for one ca n't wait to see what the coming royal baby looks like . Maybe it 's time for Duchess Kate to get a twin of her own .

Antonio Conte dismissed speculation surrounding his future at Premier League champions Chelsea , saying that he plans to see out his contract and is focused on his job .
REUTERS : Antonio Conte dismissed speculation surrounding his future at Premier League champions Chelsea , saying that he plans to see out his contract and is focused on his job .
Conte , who guided Chelsea to the league title in his first season , has struggled to extract the same level of ruthlessness from the London club in his second campaign in charge .
Chelsea is fourth in the table with 50 points , 18 points behind leaders Manchester City , and the Italian manager admitted the club were in danger of missing out on a Champions League place next season after a 3-0 defeat by Bournemouth in midweek .
`` The only thing I can tell you now is that I have 18 months left on my contract at Chelsea and my will and my desire is to stay here and continue my work , '' Conte said ahead of Monday 's league clash at 11th-placed Watford .
The Italian has suggested this season that his squad is too small to be playing Premier League , Cup and Champions League competitions and that he has little control over signing new players in the transfer window .
British media reports have said Conte 's relationship with team owner Roman Abramovich has become strained , particularly over reinforcements to the squad but the manager said he was not interested in talk of him being sacked .

`` From the start of the season , and since the defeat against Bournemouth , there 's been a lot of speculation about me being sacked , '' Conte added .
`` But I 'm not interested in this . I 'm only focused on working with my team and trying my best for the team .
`` I trust in my work . This is the only way I work and that brought me to be one of the best coaches . Only trusting in my work and in my job . I continue in this way , because I think this has made me become one of the best . ''

‘ Gluttons for punishment '
Quinn Welsch
editor @ thewestsidejournal.com
A strong breeze rustled through the sugarcane stocks . The light , sandy dirt funneled into a dust devil , swirling briefly across the bumpy road and scattering into thin air as the breeze died .
In the distance , the rhythmic patter of feet come ever closer . Attached to them , runners – or marathoners , to be exact – of the most extreme variety . At just after 3 p.m. , they have been on the dirt roads of West Baton Rouge 's farmland for nine hours .
Several dozen runners began this grueling journey with goals of reaching 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) , 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) and even 100 miles . Travelling from across the country , they arrived on Lafiton Lane at 6 a.m. to begin .
This is WHOA Racing 's third such event in West Baton Rouge , known as Children of the Cane – Part III , The Reaping . It 's a one-of-a-kind “ ultramarathon ” in Louisiana , race director Walker Higgins said .
Unlike many ultramarathons in Louisiana , which utilize trails , the Children of the Cane 's route traverses unpaved dirt roads beaten down by farm trucks and equipment . This might be a challenge for an average marathon runner , but for an ultramarathon it 's downright punishing – not to mention the heat , humidity , limited food , lack of sleep and 18-plus hours of nonstop running .
For the runners , it 's a challenge to be met .
“ Your body is an amazing machine . You want to see what it 's capable of , ” Higgins said . “ Some people start off at 5Ks , then they try a 10K , then a half marathon and then , by progression , you hear about an ultra . ”
Brandon Eddards , of Denham Springs , describes his fellow runners as “ gluttons for punishment. ” He bought his girlfriend , Callie Smithson , of New Orleans , and himself tickets for the run , as opposed to buying her flowers , he said .
“ We met at a 40 mile relay race , ” he said . “ Instead of asking her out on a date , I just asked her if she wanted to go on an ultra run . ”
“ It hurts , it 's painful , but the fact that you went out there and ran 50 miles , you think “ Holy crap , I ca n't believe I just did this , ' ” Smithson said .
Others , such as Sam Landry of New Orleans , say that the run has a meditative quality to it .
“ You learn about yourself , ” Landry said . The trail has “ lessons , ” he said .
While most ultramarathons around the country take place in cooler temperatures in the fall , the oppressive heat of South Louisiana remains . In the afternoon , they hug the sides of the sugarcane crops , catching whatever shade they can get . Most wear sunglasses , baseball caps and scarves stuffed with ice around their necks to keep cool .
They also carry bits of food , caffeine and supplemental gels to keep their bodies fueled as they run . At about the 50 mile mark , runner Raymond Maguire , going for 100 miles , slowed down to a walking pace . As he moves , he tries to eat a few hundred calories per hour to keep himself going , he said .
However , as blood leaves the stomach to reach a runner 's legs , digestion becomes slower , making eating ( and sometimes holding the food down ) a difficult process .
Aid stations are placed throughout the running trail , which is designed to be run back and forth , in case any stragglers fall out due to exhaustion .
There is a potential danger to it , but that is “ mitigated by proper judgement , ” Higgins said .
“ It 's a real mental game , ” said Josh Moore , of Hattiesburg , Mississippi , who was pacing one of his friends for the final 30 miles . “ When you get out there and you 're alone , your thoughts get to you . ”
Higgins said that many casual runners see ultramarathons as “ fantasy ” until they make their first attempt , “ and the rest is history . ”
“ I never personally thought I would do a 100-mile race , and now I 've done several , ” he said .
As exhausted runners drop into the main aid station to eat some fruit and refill their water bottles , they are instantly met by supporters and fellow runners who wait on them .
It 's a sport that inspires a strong sense of community , Higgins says . And it 's catching on in Louisiana .
“ It 's just a cool group of people . A lot of them like to have fun , ” he said .
Higgins will host the Cane Field Classic next , on Saturday , Oct. 21 . More information can be found on WHOA Racing 's Facebook page .
Gorsuch Hears First Supreme Court Arguments
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Justice Neil Gorsuch dived into the public side of his new job Monday , piping up early and often as he took his seat on the Supreme Court bench for the first time to hear arguments .
The new justice waited just 11 minutes before asking questions in the first of three cases the court heard Monday , its first session since President Donald Trump 's pick was sworn in one week earlier .
The 49-year-old Gorsuch echoed his own confirmation hearing testimony with questions focused on the text of federal laws and rules at issue before the court . He employed a bit of humor , expressed a modicum of humility , showed a hint of irritation and even channeled Justice Antonin Scalia , the man he replaced , with a touch of sarcasm .
“ Would n't it be a lot easier if we just followed the plain text of the statute ? ” Gorsuch asked during the first argument , a highly technical case about which court federal employees go to with some discrimination claims .
That question sounded a lot like the answer Gorsuch gave last month , when he was pressed to defend an opinion he wrote against a fired trucker . “ Senator , all I can tell you is my job is to apply the law you write , ” he said then .
While some of the other justices slouched , rocked back in their chairs or leaned their chin or forehead on their hands , Gorsuch sat straight in his high-backed chair , to the far left of Chief Justice John Roberts .
The justices sit by order of seniority , with the two longest-serving members of the court flanking the chief justice . The two newest justices sit on either end of the bench . The justices had removed one chair from the bench after Scalia died more than 14 months ago . Monday 's session was the first since then with the ninth chair restored , and nine justices present .
Roberts issued the standard welcome for new justices , wishing Gorsuch “ a long and happy career in our common calling. ” Gorsuch thanked his new colleagues for their “ warm welcome . ”
He shared a laugh with his seatmate , Justice Sonia Sotomayor , before arguments began .
The first case was so dense that even the justices who can wax eloquent over a misplaced comma were beside themselves .
“ Who wrote this statute ? Somebody who takes pleasure out of pulling the wings off flies ? ” Justice Samuel Alito said to laughter .
Gorsuch drew a few laughs of his own in an exchange with lawyer Christopher Landau , who is representing a former federal worker .
“ I think I am maybe emphatically agreeing with you and… , ” Landau said .
Gorsuch cut in : “ I hope so . ”
But at another point , when Landau said his client was n't asking the court to break new ground in its decision , Gorsuch launched a zinger reminiscent of Scalia .
“ No , just to continue to make it up , ” he said .
He also apologized to Landau for asking so many questions in a row . “ I 'm sorry for taking up so much time , ” Gorsuch said .
In the second case , he repeatedly tried to elicit an answer from lawyer Shay Dvoretzky .
“ If you 'd just answer my question , I 'd be grateful , ” Gorsuch said , flashing frustration .
The cases are expected to be decided before the end of June .

Reporting on 2017
Several IFEX members have published comprehensive and compelling reports about the state of freedom and democracy across the Asia-Pacific region .
Bytes for All identified emerging threats in Pakistan 's internet landscape which include “ arbitrary administrative shutdowns , misplaced judicial activism against internet freedoms , the rise of cyber armies , enforced disappearances of activists and abuse of cyber-crime laws . ”
In Sri Lanka , the Committee to Protect Journalists noted that “ impunity for crimes against journalists remains a front-line issue ” despite the election of a new government . It added that , for many years , Sri Lankan authorities “ have not secured a single conviction in the cases of 10 local journalists murdered in retaliation for their work since 1992 . ”
Human Rights Watch published its World Report 2018 , which featured some of the problems facing the region , including the impact of Afghanistan 's armed conflict on the civilian population due to deadly suicide attacks by insurgents in key urban areas .
The report puts the Bangladesh government to task for its failure “ to respond to repeated and serious allegations of secret detentions , enforced disappearances , and extrajudicial killings , denying the abuses instead of holding perpetrators accountable . ”
It also notes how Vietnam has intensified its crackdown on dissident bloggers and peaceful activists , by handing out harsh prison sentences to individuals accused of conducting anti-state propaganda .
New @ hrw report summarizes awful 2017 f/ activists , bloggers , journalists in # Vietnam . At least 21 arrested , others tried & shackled to long sentences . Attacks on activists common , religious freedom restricted , detentions drawn out . # Humanrights suffering https : //t.co/2ZhNfHWqBm — The 88 Project ( @ The88Project ) January 18 , 2018
Asia-Pacific : Rise of anti-democratic forces
An overview of the threats against online expression in South Asia was the topic of a Global Voices report , which provided context for cases of internet shutdowns , censored news sites , tweets , threats against bloggers and media workers , and even cinema censorship.election year led to an increase in press freedom violations in the country . Freedom Forum recorded a total of 66 cases of media attacks in 2017 , which was higher compared to 25 monitored incidents in 2016 . It added that a total of 230 media persons were directly affected by these attacks.The Thai Journalists Association said 2017 in “ was marked by the aggravated media censorship and attack on free expression imposed under the military government , and a hard struggle of the media industry. ” It cited the filing of Lese Majeste ( anti-Royal Insult law ) cases against some journalists who were critical of the government ; and the closing down of printed publications that resulted in the loss of jobs of hundreds of media workers.The Southeast Asian Press Alliance conducted a mission in , and expressed concern about the threat of seizure of assets or immediate shutdown of media companies suspected of violating some licensing rules . It urged the government to conduct its probe “ in a transparent , fair , and consistent manner so that these do not appear as directed attacks on selected media outlets. ” It was a busy year for the members ofMedia , Entertainment & Arts Alliance , which initiated several campaigns on themes such as media reform legislation , the release of Manus Island detainees , and working towards zero tolerance for sexual harassment in the media workplace .
Through its annual report on the state of freedom in the world , Freedom House warned about the consolidation of power of several repressive regimes across Asia-Pacific . It featured the persecution of the opposition in Cambodia , the growing influence of China 's Communist Party leadership in Hong Kong , the brutal displacement of the Rohingya minority in Burma , and the killing of a prominent blogger in the Maldives .
# StandWithRappler : Media freedom under attack in the Philippines
Philippine-based news website Rappler was ordered to cease operations by the country 's Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for allegedly violating laws restricting foreign ownership and control of the media sector . The order is unprecedented , since the Philippines boasts of having a 'robust ' freedom of the press . Indeed , the country has no censorship board and the media is not strictly regulated . But the rise to power of President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016 has in turn raised concerns about his combative statements against the press , whom he often accused of spreading 'fake news ' . In fact , he mentioned Rappler during his 2017 State of the Nation address and accused it of being owned by Americans .
Rappler has maintained that it remains a Filipino-owned startup , despite receiving funds from foreign sources . Some believe that the real problem is not its financial records , but rather its persistence , like other independent media outlets , in exposing human rights abuses of the Duterte government .
The state-backed harassment did n't end with the 'kill order ' issued by SEC . It was reported that a state agency has received a cyber libel case against some of Rappler 's officials based on a news report published in 2012 .
Rappler 's case highlights the worsening political situation in the Philippines as the government seems intent on silencing voices which are seen as a threat to the plan of the ruling party to amend the constitution in order to consolidate its power . In fact , a ranking member of the House of Representatives has proposed the revision of the constitutional provision on free speech by inserting the phrase 'responsible exercise ' of freedom of speech . Media groups were quick to point out that this is a dangerous proposal that would “ enshrine prior restraint as part of the basic law of the land . ”
Beyond Rappler , it is also important to emphasize that the Philippines is consistently ranked among the most dangerous countries for journalists .

Repressive laws and rulings
In Nepal , Freedom Forum warned that a recent high court ruling that allows the police to enjoin the media to 'cooperate ' in an investigation could be used to force journalists in the future to disclose their confidential news sources .
In Thailand , a court in southern Thailand has sentenced a blind woman to almost two years in prison for 'insulting ' the monarchy on Facebook . According to the charge sheet , the blind woman shared an article deemed insulting to the monarchy .
In Samoa , the Pacific Freedom Forum is urging the government to reconsider its decision to revive the criminal libel law . The government claimed the law is intended to stop anonymous bloggers from criticizing authorities without presenting evidence . Media groups suggested a public consultation instead of bringing back a colonial-era law which was already repealed in 2013 .
In Malaysia , the Court of Appeal has reversed an earlier ruling dismissing a defamation suit filed by a mining company against independent news website Malaysiakini . The suit was about Malaysiakini 's coverage of the health concerns of local residents against a mining operation . The case is still pending but Malaysiakini was able to crowdsource funds for its legal battle .
In Macau , the new Cybersecurity Law was passed based on a purported public consultation last December 2017 and intended to protect the rights of citizens . But critics are worried that it provides a `` legal framework for mass surveillance . '' It requires the adoption of the 'real name ' registration system and it empowers cybersecurity officers to enter the offices of internet service providers .
In Australia , Reporters Without Borders joined local media groups in reminding the government that the proposed national security law threatens the work of journalists . The proposed expanded definition of espionage would criminalize the mere act of receiving and possessing classified information . The bill also broadly defines classified information as information that could `` cause harm to Australia 's interests . ''
Focus on gender
WASHINGTON : The latest North Korean missile launch may have been of a new and hitherto unknown system being developed by Kim Jong-Un 's regime , a weapons expert said on Monday ( Apr 17 ) .
The Pentagon has not discussed which missile blew up `` almost immediately '' after launch early Sunday from near Sinpo on the North 's east coast , and the White House has said only that it was a medium-range device .
John Schilling , a weapons expert with the 38 North monitoring group , said the launch failure was indicative of a new systems test .
`` The discussion of it failing very early in launch , that 's a common failure mode for North Korean missiles very early on in their development cycle when they are working out the bugs in the propulsion and guidance system , '' Schilling told AFP .
`` More detail would always be nice . But I am going to suspect that this was a new missile or certainly one that has not been well-developed . ''
Anonymous US officials told Fox News the missile was a new type of Scud called the KN-17 - a single-stage , liquid-fuelled missile - that could be used to target ships .
Schilling thought the test could have been of a new design that Kim showed off in a massive military parade on Saturday in Pyongyang .
That missile was being carried on a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile transporter , but was a different type of device , Schilling said .
`` That 's something that we 've never seen tested . If they are trying to demonstrate that as a real capability , it would make sense for them to test it as soon as possible after showing it to the world . ''
Susan Thornton , acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs , said it was difficult to glean much information given how quickly the rocket failed .
`` Our understanding is that it was not one of the longer-range missiles that they were trying to test there . It was something like a medium-range ballistic missile but still with prohibited technology , but it 's still an object of ongoing discussion , '' Thornton said .
NUCLEAR REVIEW
Sunday 's launch failure led some observers to speculate that US hacking efforts might have played a role .
The New York Times last month reported that under former president Barack Obama the US stepped up cyberattacks against North Korea to try to sabotage its missiles before launch or just as they lift off .
Britain 's former Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC `` there is a very strong belief that the US - through cyber methods - has been successful on several occasions in interrupting these sorts of tests and making them fail . ''
But Schilling said the ability to hack North Korea 's missiles is overblown .
`` From what we know of North Korean missiles , the propulsion technology in particular is fairly primitive with no digital or electronics to be hacked , '' said Schilling said .
The 38 North programME is part of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington .
Also ON Monday , Pentagon chief Jim Mattis ordered the start of a review of America 's nuclear deterrent to ensure it is `` safe , secure , effective , reliable and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies , '' officials said .
Such reviews take place every seven years or so .
FIRST DAY OF WORK
As he enters the halls of City Hall today for his first-ever Cebu City Council session as newly appointed councilor , Renato “ Junjun ” Osmeña Jr. said he will bring with him a mission — unity at City Hall .
Osmeña immediately made this clear as he went to visit the office of his uncle , Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña , yesterday afternoon to make a courtesy call .

In a photo posted by a staffer of Councilor Joel Garganera on Facebook , the two Osmeñas could be seen standing close together in a photo with their smiles wide open .
“ What you see in the picture , that 's how it is . I told him I 'm here for a courtesy call because you 're the head of City Hall . I 'm here to offer my services to you . I told him I do n't want to listen to any intrigues . I 'm here to work , ” Junjun said of his meeting with the mayor .
Junjun also paid courtesy calls to Vice Mayor Edgardo Labella and other members of the City Council yesterday .
The younger Osmeña was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte to replace Councilor Nendell Hanz Abella who resigned after being appointed commissioner of the National Labor Relations Commission ( NLRC ) seventh division .
Although an Osmeña , Junjun is allied with Barug Team Rama , the rival party of the mayor 's Bando Osmeña-Pundok Kauswagan ( BO-PK ) .
“ I told him my mandate as councilor is to help the people and the City of Cebu . Let 's put the politics aside . I believe the mayor has good intentions for the City of Cebu . And I want to be part of it , ” he said .
Junjun revealed that the mayor asked him what committees he would like to handle in the City Council where committee chairmanships are currently under his BO-PK allies .
Junjun narrated that he told the mayor about some committees that he was interested in as well as how Councilor Dave Tumulak asked him to provide assistance in the preparations for Sinulog 2018 .
“ If the mayor will say I should help , then why not ? ” Junjun said .
Junjun earlier disclosed that he is interested in heading the committee on traffic and transportation and the committee on public order and safety .
Having previously worked with the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. ( Pagcor ) for 23 years , Junjun also wants to be part of the ad hoc committee for Pagcor funds , which reviews the city 's charges and use of the funds .
But while Junjun is already eyeing these committees , his allies in Barug Team Rama said that they still do not have immediate plans to call for a revamp of the committee chairmanships in the City Council .
With the entry of Junjun , the City Council currently now has eight Barug Team Rama members and eight BO-PK members . Vice Mayor Labella , who presides over the council , could break the tie as he is allied with Barug Team Rama .
Junjun plans to temporarily share offices with either Councilor Garganera or Councilor Raymond Garcia while the vacated office of Councilor Abella was still being “ fixed ” for his standards .
The younger Osmeña also plans to retain the staff members of Abella until their current contracts expire .
In today 's council session , Junjun said he will deliver a privilege speech but for the most part observe the proceedings as a first-time councilor and politician .
“ I want to be productive . And I want to bring in unity . My coming into the city is to bring unity . So I will do that . I want them to see that I am the nephew of the mayor and I 'm from a different party . Just to make the council understand that we should just work hand in hand , ” Junjun said .
A U.S. Justice Department lawyer said at a court hearing on Wednesday it could take `` weeks or months '' before regulators decide whether to approve a software fix for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV diesel vehicles .
WASHINGTON : A U.S. Justice Department lawyer said at a court hearing on Wednesday it could take `` weeks or months '' before regulators decide whether to approve a software fix for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV diesel vehicles .
In May , the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler , accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014 . Fiat Chrysler hopes regulators will quickly approve the company 's proposed software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale and then use that software to update the 104,000 vehicles on the road .
Leigh Rende , a Justice Department lawyer , said at a San Francisco federal court hearing `` there is uncertainty '' about whether the fix will be approved . `` It could be weeks or months away , '' Rende said of a decision . `` This is really a technical decision . ''
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board accused Fiat Chrysler in January of using undisclosed software to allow excess diesel emissions in 104,000 U.S. 2014-2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks in a notice of violation in January .
Fiat Chrysler has said it does not believe the software update would impact performance or fuel efficiency . Company shares trading in New York fell 1.3 percent to US $ 10.86 on Wednesday .

The January notice was the result of a probe that arose out of regulators ' investigation of rival Volkswagen AG 's excess emissions .
Fiat Chrysler faces more than 20 lawsuits from dealers and owners over the alleged excess emissions .
U.S. District Judge Edward Chen is also overseeing suits filed against Robert Bosch GmbH stemming from its role in developing the Fiat Chrysler diesel engines .
At Wednesday 's hearing , lawyers representing owners said they plan to review millions of pages of documents and urged a speedy trial date if no settlement is reached .
Reuters reported in May that the Justice Department and the EPA have obtained internal emails and other documents written in Italian that look at engine development and emissions issues that raise significant questions .

The Justice Department lawsuit also names Fiat Chrysler 's unit VM Motori SpA , which designed the engine in question .
In total , VW has agreed to spend more than US $ 25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners , environmental regulators , states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles , but the precise amount depends on the number of vehicles repurchased .

ASUNCION : Qatari two-time winner Nasser Al Attiyah overcame a fire in his Toyota to win a dramatic opening stage of the 2017 Dakar Rally on Monday ( Jan 2 ) .
Al Attiyah completed the 38.5-kilometre special stage in 25 minutes 41 secinds , the first on a high-octane , high-altitude 8,8000kilometre continent-crossing trek from Asuncion in Paraguay to Buenos Aires .
`` About a dozen kilometres out from the finish we smelt smoke by ( co-driver ) Matthieu 's ( Baumel ) seat and there was a bit of a fire . We slowed down to finish the stage and were able to put it out at the finish , '' the Toyota driver said after arriving in the Argentinian city of Resistencia .
The Qatari 's teammate Giniel de Villiers had to come to the rescue and tow him away .
Former World Rally Championship driver Xevi Pons was 24 seconds adrift in his Ford Ranger while fellow Spaniard Nani Roma came in a further five seconds back in his Toyota .
Nine-time world rally champion Sebastien Loeb was 55 seconds off the pace as he came in sixth while defending champion Stephane Peterhansel was one minute 34 seconds behind Al Attiyah in 12th .
Peugeot 's Peterhansel is seeking to add to an extraordinary record in the race which comprises six wins apiece in both moto and auto categories
Earlier , Australian KTM rider and defending champion Toby Price set out at the start of the two-week rally , which will take participants via Bolivia through unforgiving mountainous terrain .
Competitors were watching the skies before the start following days of violent tropical storms in the Paraguayan capital .
Participants swiftly resumed last-minute technical checks after seeing in the New Year ahead of the traditional pre-race briefing Sunday evening .
Riders and drivers must negotiate some 4,000 kilometres of special stages before reaching Buenos Aires on Jan 14 .
ALTITUDE CONCERNS
Five stages will be held at above 3,500 metres altitude - and participants will get a day off on Sunday to see a little of the Bolivian capital La Paz , the world 's highest capital at 3,600 metres .
The thin conditions of the region will pose a severe endurance challenge .
`` There is a little uncertainty as regards the altitude ... I do n't really know how we shall react - drivers , co-drivers , but also assistants and mechanics , '' said Peterhansel , who started off in 1988 , when the race still remained true to its African origins .
`` If you feel a little off one day you could lose everything and that 's true for all drivers , even those who have spent time at altitude and are well prepared . ''
For Peterhansel , `` it 's very open . I 'd say there are six or seven drivers capable of winning - at Peugeot of course but also Toyota , and even Mini , with Mikko Hirvonen coming up on the rails '' , following his maiden fourth place showing last year .
The motorbikes section is also looking open coming out of a decade of domination by Frenchman Cyril Despres and Spaniard Marc Coma , five-time winner with KTM and now on board with organisers ASO .
Many eyes will also be on the progress of brave Frenchman Philippe Croizon , a quadruple amputee who will be driving a specially adapted buggy .
Croizon , 48 , lost his limbs after he suffered a massive electric shock while working on a television antenna at his home 22 years ago .
Croizon brought out a book , entitled I Decided To Live , and turned to sport , swimming the English Channel six years ago and also completing the Intercontinental Straits Swimming Challenge - crossing four straits separating five continents .
The 2017 race will be the ninth time the Dakar has been held in South America .
The race was cancelled in 2008 over security threats in Mauritania , organisers taking the decision to move the rally to another continent in 2009 .
LONDON : Global stock markets clawed back losses on Monday ( Aug 14 ) as spiralling tensions over North Korea showed tentative signs of easing , in turn reducing appetite for safer assets .
Fears of a catastrophic confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang were calmed when CIA director Mike Pompeo said Sunday that there was `` nothing imminent '' in the escalating stand-off .
London 's benchmark FTSE 100 index climbed 0.6 per cent , while in the eurozone Paris and Frankfurt added more than one per cent .
`` European equity markets appear to have left the fears of late last week behind , with investors coming out of their defensive positions to move back into riskier assets , '' said Joshua Mahony , an analyst at IG Markets .
Approaching midday in New York , the Dow index was up 0.7 per cent , edging back above the key 22,000 level .
Earlier in Asia , Hong Kong was back in positive territory on Monday after slumping two percent Friday , while Shanghai ended the day higher despite data showing that Chinese industrial production slowed sharply in July as government efforts to rein in debt weighed on demand .

However , Tokyo closed down one percent as traders returned from a three-day holiday weekend to play catch-up after Asian and European shares had dropped on Friday , with the Nikkei finishing at its lowest level in more than three months .
Investors largely shrugged off official data showing that Japan 's economy grew by a faster-than-expected one per cent in the three months to June , as the world 's third-largest economy marked its longest expansion in more than a decade .
'NOT OUT OF THE WOODS '
`` What we are seeing today is relief at the ( geopolitical ) situation not deteriorating over the weekend , something traders were clearly wary of towards the end of last week , '' said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam .

As stock markets started recovering , the dollar rose against the Japanese currency and the euro , while gold halted its advance after jumping 2.4 per cent last week .
`` We 're seeing a small unwinding of ... risk aversion trades , with gold trading slightly lower and the yen and Swiss franc off against the dollar , pound and euro , '' Erlam added .
Last week 's losses worldwide were triggered by President Donald Trump 's threat to unleash `` fire and fury '' on North Korea , and Pyongyang countered by announcing plans to test-launch missiles toward Guam .
`` There is a still a 'buy the dips ' mentality running through financial markets , '' said Chris Weston , chief market strategist at IG Markets .
But analysts cautioned that with joint South Korean-US military exercises scheduled and North Korea celebrating `` Liberation Day '' on Tuesday , market volatility could return .
`` We are not out of the woods yet and the situation in North Korea will remain front and centre , '' Weston said .

Former Arsenal and Manchester City defender Bacary Sagna has signed for Benevento , who are currently bottom of Serie A .
Sagna , 34 , has been without a club since his City contract ended last summer and was training on his own in London as he considered offers .
But now he has made the decision to move to Serie A and revealed that it was the spirit of Benevento that persuaded him to make the shock move .
“ In the past few months , I have had several offers from clubs in the top leagues in England , France , Spain , Turkey , MLS and elsewhere in Italy , ” he told FootballFanCast.com . “ However , they were not the right moves for myself or my family .
“ Going to Benevento is not a move I am making for financial reasons . I could have gone to many other clubs , many of whom made substantial offers to me . My career for the past decade has been at the very top level , what Benevento offers me is the opportunity to represent the underdog and to play for a club whose story is such a beautiful one .
“ In an era when football has become more of a business at many clubs than an actual sport , Benevento represents the heart and soul of what a football club should be about . Passion , heart , hope , joy , love and a philosophy that is aligned to that of my own way of thinking in life .
“ They are a great family club , built around the community they are in . At this moment in my life , it is where I want to play football , it is where I want to be right now . I still believe I have two or three years of playing football at a very good level . I have always kept myself in very good shape and I live a healthy lifestyle , so the fitness side of the game will not be an issue to me . ”
Sagna also hopes that playing for his new club will reignite his chances of playing for France at the 2018 World Cup .
“ I still believe I can make the World Cup Finals this summer and play again for France , ” he added . “ I have always been proud to play for my country and the burning ambition to continue to do that has never left me . I will give it my best shot to be in Russia .
“ My move may surprise many but I am 100 percent sure , that I am joining the right club , for the right reasons . ”
The department of Judaic Studies makes a disappointing decision
Posted by Aidan Byrne on December 11 , 2017 · Leave a Comment
On Wednesday , November 29 , two academic discussions were held at the University of Massachusetts on the topics of anti-Semitism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . The events happened at the same time , 7 p.m. , in different buildings , a physical separation representative of the ideological divide between the discussions . At one event , two UMass professors , Sut Jhally and Joseph Levine , joined forces with Vijay Prashad , a professor at Trinity College , to discuss the exploitation of the label “ anti-Semitism ” to suppress criticism of Israel 's actions toward Palestinians . Their event was sparked by a Daily Collegian columnist 's unfair representation of Thomas Suarez as an anti-Semite after he gave a talk criticizing Israel at UMass in September . On the other side , the Department of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies held a symposium on the general topic of “ Antisemitism and Islamophobia : Historic Perspectives and Civic Engagement Against Hate in 2017 . ”
It was not a coincidence that these events occurred on the same day , at the same time , and in different buildings . Within only a few weeks , members of the Judaic and Near Eastern Studies Department organized their panel in an effort to compete with and discourage students from attending the “ Exploiting Antisemitism ” event , which had been planned for over a month . Leaders of the “ Antisemitism and Islamophobia ” event even admitted to such . Jonathan Skolnik , one of the event organizers , said , “ I felt something had to be done to shift a negative discussion to a positive one…I felt it was best to take a cue from Michelle Obama ( ‘ When they go low , we go high ' ) and do what university departments can do best : organize a thoughtful , intellectual panel with expert scholars and accomplished activists with diverse perspectives…for the education of students and the community . ”
The Department of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies definitely did not turn a negative discussion into a positive one , and they most certainly did not take the high road . Their actions were disappointing and petty . I can only compare the situation to a spoiled child taking their ball and going home when they do n't like the score of a game . In their attempt to stifle academic discussion , they did a great disservice to UMass students and the University as a whole .
As an intellectually curious college freshman , I was torn as to which event to attend , as I would have appreciated hearing perspectives from both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , and I 'm sure many of my fellow students felt the same way . In the end , I chose to attend the “ Exploiting Anti-Semitism ” panel because I committed to going long before I even knew about the “ Antisemitism and Islamophobia ” symposium . That being said , I will not be commenting on the events of “ Antisemitism and Islamophobia , ” nor will I share my largely naive opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . What I will say is that I learned a lot from my attendance of “ Exploiting Anti-Semitism , ” and I gained a new perspective on an issue that I have had little exposure to .
In no way did I find the event to be negative or harmful . Anyone who makes the charge that the talk was anti-Semitic clearly was either not in attendance or has very biased and selective hearing . Did I agree with everything that was said ? Absolutely not , but that is the point of having these discussions on campus . I was able to listen to experienced intellectuals present the facts , as they know them , and I learned a lot from what they presented . I believe that the professors who organized the “ Antisemitism and Islamophobia ” event could have benefitted in the same way as I did . It is deeply disturbing to me that certain high level academics at UMass are n't tolerant of opposing viewpoints being voiced , to the extent that they feel the need to host counter-events at the exact same time . If our professors are really not open to hearing a different opinion to their own , maybe they should rethink their career paths and maybe we should reconsider who is teaching our classes .
Regardless of the Judaic and Near Eastern Studies department 's intentions , their actions only hurt their cause . Students like myself who would have loved to attend their panel and would have learned a lot from their opinions are now worse off because we were n't able to hear their side of the argument . If their event had been held on another day or even another time , more people would have been able to hear their message and be better educated .
Politically I 'm very moderate , and by no means am I a free speech absolutist or raving conservative , but it saddens me that respected members of my University have employed the largely leftist tactic of attempting to silence voices they do n't agree with . I trust that the majority of the student body would agree that UMass should be a University where a difference of opinion and debate are encouraged . I signed up to attend a large , public University , not an ideological safe space .

Employment Minister Patty Hajdu thanked the parties for their commitment to the collective bargaining process .
`` This is further evidence that when employers , organized labour , and governments work together and respect the collective bargaining process , we get the best results for Canadians and for our economy , '' she said in a statement after the agreement was announced .
Agricultural and mining shippers , who had already been calling for government intervention , said they were pleased because the quick deal will minimize the impact on their sectors .
`` We were mentally prepared for a strike that would have gone on longer but perhaps it would be fair to say that we 're relieved that it 's been resolved as quickly as it has been , '' said Wade Sobkowich , executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association , which represents the country 's largest exporters .
He said the less-than-a-day-long strike prevented about $ 20 million of grain from moving , something that should be made up .
Sobkowich said he believed the two sides were under tremendous pressure from the federal government after the prime minister signalled Tuesday that it was n't rushing to step in with back-to-work legislation or binding arbitration .
`` If there was going to be a resolution to this it was going to have to come from the negotiating table and I think that that put pressure on both sides to try and resolve things , '' Sobkowich said .
An agreement between CP Rail and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers representing 360 signalling workers just before Tuesday evening 's strike deadline ensured that Canada 's three largest cities and Via Rail would avoid chaos during Wednesday morning 's commute .
The quick resolution also suggested that the Teamsters may not have been far from a deal as well , added Todd Lewis , of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan .
`` We 're going to have a bad week of service this week , but hopefully we can get everything back to normal and with the new legislation that 's been put forward we can get some improved service , '' he said in an interview .
Lewis believes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's comments suggesting the government was n't going to intervene put extra pressure on the railway .
`` Back-to-work legislation is a two-edged sword , '' he said . `` It does impact a settlement but I think the signals were given that maybe the railroads would n't have been happy with the settlement that would have been imposed this time . ''
Trudeau 's comments were a little unsettling , said Pierre Gratton , CEO of the Mining Association of Canada , who assumed that the government would intervene because of the negative consequences for the mining sector and the Canadian economy as a whole .
`` What was going on behind the scenes was much more intense than met the eye , '' Gratton said .
The Conservative federal government was more aggressive with unions during the last two strikes .
Train crews ended a brief walkout in 2015 and agreed to arbitration after the Harper government warned of back-to-work legislation . Three years earlier , federal back-to-work legislation was enacted to end a 10-day strike .
Gratton would n't say which approach he believes is more successful .
`` I do n't really care how it 's resolved . We just ca n't have our members not able to get the materials in or out so we 're just delighted , relieved . ''

The Imo State Governor , Chief Rochas Okorocha , has said the exit of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar from the ruling All Progressives Congress is not a good development for the party .
Atiku , a former Vice-President , defected recently from the ruling party to the Peoples Democratic Party .
Okorocha spoke with journalists after he received an honorary doctorate degree at the Adekunle Ajasin University , Akungba Akoko , Ondo State on Saturday . He described Abubakar as a heavyweight politician .
He said , “ I have taken a holistic view of our party , it ( Atiku 's exit ) is not the best because no matter how anybody thinks , Atiku carries some political weight . His leaving our party is not the best . ”
The Imo State Governor , however , noted that since Atiku had decided to move on politically by going to another political party , the APC would make amends and his ( Atiku ) place would be filled up accordingly .
Reacting to the recent statement credited to the National Leader of the APC , Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu , which said there would be no automatic ticket for President Muhammadu Buhari for the 2019 presidential election , against the position of the APC governors , Okorocha maintained that he would support Buhari for a second term .

The chairman of the APC Governors ' Forum had earlier said all the governors would support the sole candidacy of President Buhari in the 2019 election but Tinubu disagreed insisting that the APC 's presidential candidate must emerge through a primary .
Okorocha said , “ The ( Tinubu 's ) statement came to me as a surprise ; come to think of it , I never referred to him . I referred to the governors of Nigeria , including the PDP governors and I said only one or two of them had not joined yet .
“ Since I made the statement , no governor has said something contrary to what I said . I am surprised that Asiwaju will now be speaking for the governors . He looks like somebody crying more than the bereaved . I did not see reason for the statement actually . But he commands my respect and I do n't want to take issue with the national leader of my party .
“ What I mentioned was for the governors and secondly what I said is support . The word I use is support that does not mean there will not be a primary . Governors can only contribute 37 votes ; we still have over 5,000 votes up there . What I was talking about was governors . I was not talking about other party members . Governors alone do not determine the standard bearer of a party . ”
Well Blue Jackets fans , you 've made it . Your team is now just hours away from their opening night puck drop . After a pretty eventful offseason , training camp and preseason , it 's time for the real stuff .
Before their season kicks off though , I 'd like to present a handful of Jackets players to keep a close eye on in the early goings . Obviously , every player that laces up has an important role on the team . But based on the offseason moves and the overall state of the team , I believe there are five or six Blue Jackets that will be under the microscope through the first few games .
Pierre-Luc Dubois
Dubois was in the spotlight all the way through training camp and it probably wo n't go away anytime soon . The former third overall pick in 2016 has made the roster and will look to ride an impressive preseason into the regular season .
Because he was picked right behind Auston Matthews and Patrik Laine in last summer 's NHL Entry Draft , he has been held to high expectations . A lot of people , myself included , were skeptical whether or not he would ever reach the potential the Jackets were looking for when they selected him . But he 's here now and he 's looking to make a name for himself in his rookie season .
Even though he was drafted as a centerman , he will play on the wing . It has been a consistent experiment through the preseason to see what he can do at the position and he looked pretty darn good which is why the Jackets will roll with it at least to begin the season . He has proven so far that he belongs but we 'll see how ready he is for full NHL action in game one .
Nick Foligno
Of course , the captain is under the microscope . He always is . But I 'll tell you why he will be a focal point from the beginning of the season . He 's going to play at center . Foligno , who has spent the majority of his career as a left or right winger , will open the year as a centerman . This is the result of Dubois ' switch to the wing and the lack of depth at centre the Jackets have at the moment .
Foligno was actually drafted by the Ottawa Senators as a center and has played the position with the Blue Jackets on occasion . To me , he is n't best fitted to play in the middle but as the heart and soul of the team , he 'll do anything to help . I 'm sure he will hold his own as a center but I 'm wondering whether or not this is just a temporary move before they find extra help .
Josh Anderson
Finally , the extension holdout fiasco has come to a close . After missing camp , Anderson ultimately signed a three-year , $ 5.55M extension on Tuesday . It was a long staring contest between the front office and the Anderson party but now that an agreement has been made , it 's time for everybody to move past it and look forward to what Anderson can do this season .
He wo n't start the year in Columbus as it was announced on Thursday that the Blue Jackets sent him down along with defenseman Markus Nutivaara to their minor league affiliate Cleveland Monsters on a conditioning assignment . This is a telling sign that the Jackets do n't feel Anderson is in the physical shape he needs to be in to play at the NHL level .
Because he held out , he has n't been practicing or skating with the team . Over the last few weeks , he 's been skating overseas in Switzerland but he did n't participate in the John Tortorella training camp in Columbus , which is a big thing to miss . As of right now , his skating legs are likely not meeting Torts ' standards .
This is n't a huge deal . He is n't quite ready for NHL action and the Jackets will give him the opportunity to work himself into game shape down in the minors . He will miss Friday night 's game and most likely wo n't suit up in Chicago on Saturday night . It 's possible that Anderson will make his season debut on Tuesday night against the Carolina Hurricanes .
Hopefully , any tension from contact negotiations or any physical rust will be worn off by the time his season starts . The Jackets are hoping to get a similar , if not better , Anderson from last season . The 23-year-old tallied 17 goals in his rookie season and will seek to prove that total was no fluke .
Brandon Dubinsky
The 31-year-old veteran is coming off offseason wrist surgery that held him from most of the preseason . For a while , Dubinsky was questionable to be ready for opening night but he suited up in the final preaseason game in Pittsburgh last Saturday .
In that game , he was flying around , throwing the body all over the place like he usually does . Maybe that 's just because it was the Pittsburgh Penguins , a team he loves to play against but either way , it 's good news to see him ahead of schedule out on the ice in actual gameplay .
I 'll be giving him an extra look early on to see if he is truly fully recovered from surgery . He 's also coming off a down year as far as point totals go . He played in all but two of the Jackets ' 82 regular season games last season and only notched a line of 12-29-41 .
Dubinsky is n't a guy that should be expected to fill the net . As an assistant captain , he 's a phenomenal leader and will do anything to help the team win , whether that is being physical or blocking shots . However , 12 goals marks his lowest total as a Blue Jacket since the 2012-13 lockout shortened season .
I do n't expect to see any major indications that Dubinsky is n't fully healthy or ready to begin the season but he is slated to be the third center behind Foligno and Alexander Wennberg . Is this because the Jackets are lacking center depth and need Dubinsky for opening night even if he is n't 100 % ? That 's just a theory I 'm throwing out there .
I think Dubinsky as the third line center gives the Jackets great balance throughout the forward group . Hopefully , he can provide some scoring to that third line on top of the grit that pours out of him from game to game .
Ryan Murray and Gabriel Carlsson
Because the two are projected to be a defensive pairing , I 'll place them on my watch list as a package deal . Murray 's presence on the Blue Jackets has been discussed across the hockey world . Is he a key member of the team ? Why is he not living up to the expectations of a former second overall pick ? Is he going to be traded ? All of these questions have swirled around him for some time now and even though I ca n't speak for the player , it has to be difficult to avoid all that talk .
He now has a chance to swat all these discussions down with a solid performance to start the season . But how is it possible for him to live up to former second overall pick expectations when he 's playing on the bottom pairing ? We 'll see what the future holds for Murray in Columbus . Perhaps his early play will have an impact on that future .
As for Gabriel Carlsson , this will be his first season start with the Blue Jackets . He came in basically out of thin air at the very end of last season and played solid minutes in the playoffs . His performance might not have blown anybody away but it was impressive for a guy who had no NHL experience to compete like he did .
After a strong showing in training camp , he forced management to give him a spot on the 23-man roster . It 's pretty clear that his potential is very high and he has done well to squeeze himself into an already sturdy defensive group . He has a chance right away to showcase why it was a good move for the Jackets to trade up for a first round pick to select him in the 2016 Draft .
Final Thoughts
To clarify , I 'm not putting on blinders to the rest of the team . I will follow all players as close as I possibly can . This is just a short list of players that , to me , deserve an extra spotlight because of where they 're positioned on the squad right now .
Jackets newcomer Artemi Panarin should be an honorable mention on this list . It will be interesting to see if all the hype is too big for him . I 'm not at all worried about him . He has already shown that he is as dynamic as advertised and will provide the Jackets with the scoring help they need .
Like I said before , every player for the Jackets has his own level of importance . As a team , they can do some incredible things . Last year was the best year in franchise history . Can the team build on that historic season and make a push for the playoffs ? That 's the big question that they 'll attempt to tackle later on . Right now , it 's all about winning game one .

The weather did n't stop gardening fans who were interested in growing their own cucumbers .
Cold Lake and District FCSS hosted a silly science garden gnome seed starter program to get a head start on Community ChooseWell Garden Gnomes summer program that starts in July .
The event called the School 's Out Silly Science Garden Gnome Seed Starters program taught children about healthy eating and growing their own vegetables .
Local children had a choice of planting tomatoes , mint , peas and cucumbers . Later they sat back and watched the Gnomeo and Juliet movie featuring garden gnomes .
The community gardening program runs in the summer starting from July 13 .
It helps families and children learn to garden and inspires them to start their own garden .

Yes , I am talking about B.C .
It is also remarkable that a region whose economic success is so intertwined with Alberta is so clueless about how much we rely on each other for our mutual success .
READ MORE : Alberta government suspends electricity talks with B.C . in response to proposed ban on increased bitumen shipments
The B.C . NDP government 's announcement that it intends to restrict our ability to export bitumen got our listeners blood boiling this week .
So , what can we do about it ? I 've been talking to different people this week to try to get some answers to that .
Premier Rachel Notley said she is retaliating by suspending negotiations about buying electricity from B.C. , in a deal that would be worth as much as $ 500 million . Sounds good on the surface , but it got my listeners asking why we are buying $ 500 million worth of electricity from B.C . ?
I spoke to energy market expert Sheldon Fulton about it . He said most power currently going back and forth between our two provinces is sold at zero value , so he 's not sure where Notley is getting these numbers .

I spoke to Jason Kenney as well . He supports launching a court action against the B.C . government , but he also is n't afraid to ramp up the pressure .
The lower mainland gets two-thirds of its supply from Kinder Morgan 's Trans Mountain pipeline . Is there any doubt how disruptive it would be to B.C . if Alberta decided to turn off the taps ?
Or how about slapping an import tax on every MCF of natural gas that flows through Alberta pipelines en route to the US ?

Finally , Cody Battershill from Canada Action reminded us of the Tar Sands Campaign organized in 2008 by CorpEthics and funded by U.S. based foundations and environmental groups .
CorpEthics brags about the strategy to “ land-lock the tar sands so their crude could not reach the international market where it could fetch a high price ” and that it is a strategy that “ is successful to this day . ”
He encourages every one of us to get on the phone and talk to B.C . friends , family , suppliers , small businesses , and get them to tell their government they are making the wrong decision .

We have all kinds of ways we could use the pretext of environmental regulation to retaliate against B.C . For instance , Alberta is rat-free . How can we be sure we do n't accidently import any rats unless we stop every railcar , every transport semi , every passenger vehicle – just to be sure ?
Why stop there ? We also know there are invasive species of insects and weeds that might harm our province 's biodiversity . Best to have checkstops to give a thorough check of every single vehicle that comes across the border from B.C. , do n't you think ?
Obviously , this would be ridiculous . But it illustrates how ridiculous B.C . is being .

* * * * * * * * In a new Global News series , we 'll be taking a deep dive into marijuana legalization . Watch the video above for a province to province look on how you will be able to buy recreational pot once it 's legalized .
Recreational marijuana in Canada is on track to be legalized in July 2018 , but there 's a real mix of approaches across the country when it comes to regulating it and selling it .
Across each province , there are still many lingering questions such as where Canadians can buy pot , how much it will cost and the kinds of cannabis products that will be available to the general public .
READ MORE : Investors bet on weed companies ahead of legalization date
Eight provinces have set their minimum age to purchase at 19 ; Alberta and Quebec have made it 18 . It 's also looking like you can buy five different cannabis products , which include dry , fresh , oil cannabis , seeds and plants in most provinces .
One thing to keep in mind , though , is that Quebec and Manitoba have said no to home-grows , so it 's not really clear if you 'll be able to buy seeds , or whatever else is needed to grow marijuana plants at home , says Trina Fraser , an Ottawa based lawyer at Brazeau Seller Law who specializes in cannabis business law .
Also across each province , you 'll be able to buy weed through private storefronts , provincially-operated entities , or a mix of both . Also , most provinces and territories have said yes to online sales , except for the Northwest Territories .

Based on frameworks , proposed laws and guidelines released by the provinces , marijuana will mostly be distributed through liquor boards or subsidiaries of liquor boards , like the Cannabis Management Corp. in New Brunswick .
In terms of what Canadians can expect to pay , it 's looking like it will be roughly $ 10 a gram . In December , finance ministers agreed they wanted to set a price that would deter people from buying pot from the black market .
TULA , Russia : A Russian soccer fan leader jailed over clashes with England supporters at the 2016 European Championship said he and other fans had been warned by police against engaging in violence at the upcoming World Cup in Russia .
Sergei Gorbachev spent seven months in a Marseille jail over the clashes before Russia 's match against England at the tournament two years ago in France , where punches were thrown , bottles flung and smoke bombs detonated .

Russian authorities , hoping to expunge memories of the Marseille brawls , have pledged to curb violence at the World Cup , to be held from June 14 to July 15 in 11 Russian cities .
Gorbachev , who heads the supporters ' association of Arsenal Tula , a Russian Premier League club , said police regularly dropped in on fans known to authorities , even though they are not officially banned from attending sporting events .
He said he had also taken part in meetings with police in which fans were told not to engage in stadium violence .
`` The guys who are now in the fan world , they are feeling the effects of what the authorities are doing to ensure the World Cup is held without any trouble , including from the Russian fans , '' said the 35-year-old .

At a bar in Tula , an industrial city about 170 km ( 105 miles ) south of Moscow , Gorbachev is greeted by patrons and called the `` star of Marseille '' by the barman .
Speaking to Reuters , he said English fans travelling to Russia for the World Cup have nothing to fear - if they behaved themselves .
`` If they behave in a civilised way , I will shake their hand , '' added Gorbachev , who said he studied French and read the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky and Mikhail Bulgakov while serving his sentence at Marseille 's Baumettes prison .
`` I would want the same from them . I would n't want to see same attitude and behaviour I encountered in Marseille . ''
'POLICE EVERY 20 METRES '
In the run-up to the World Cup , Russia has increased fines for violent stadium behaviour . In some cases , fans are asked to make a written pledge that they will not organise or participate in fights .
A senior interior ministry official told Reuters there would be `` a policeman every 20 metres '' in host cities to prevent petty crime and drunken fights .
Officers have been told to pay special attention to English fans , who they fear could spark `` mass fights , riots and provocations , '' the official said .
Moscow and London have been exchanging information to prevent another Marseille scenario , with Russian authorities visiting England to watch soccer policing in action and British officials travelling to Russia to discuss tactics .
Gorbachev said he trusted that Russian police would crack down rapidly on any troublemakers . Russian fan groups , he said , would resist provocations and any calls for a Marseille rematch .
When asked if Russian fans could take matters into their own hands if they encountered violent behaviour from other groups , he shrugged .
`` I think our law enforcement will do their jobs , '' he said . `` It 's not just for me to serve a sentence in France under their laws . English ( who misbehave ) should serve time here under ours . ''
Gorbachev has yet to apply for a World Cup fan ID , a document needed to attend matches which proves that a ticket holder has been vetted by Russian authorities . He plans to do so in the coming days .
His name does not appear on an interior ministry blacklist that bars more than 400 people from attending sporting events , including for offences committed in Russia such as lighting flares and public drunkenness .
Reuters found this month that a blacklisted fan had been granted a World Cup fan ID , and that several other blacklisted fans had regularly skirted the ban .

When it comes to busted traffic signals , what you probably always thought was the law is now the law .
Confusion has dominated how to handle a non-functioning traffic light in Michigan for decades , typically only getting sporadic attention or media coverage during storms and power outages .
Most drivers were quite certain : Its a four-way stop .
But it wasnt .
It was a four-way yield , meaning if you were the first one at the intersection or there was no other traffic , you could slow and go without stopping .

Now you have to stop .
Lt. Gov . Brian Calley on Tuesday signed legislation to clarify nonfunctional four-way stops that had been introduced by Sen. Rick Jones , R-Grand Ledge .
BEFORE : Its a yield
This is about improving safety on our roads when the power is out and a traffic light isnt working ,  said Jones . It can be dangerous if two drivers have different expectations when approaching an intersection where the traffic light is out . If one driver thinks everyone is stopping and another driver thinks he has the right of way , thats a recipe for disaster.
Senate Bill 521 , now Public Act 109 of 2018 , requires drivers to treat intersections where a traffic signal is malfunctioning as a four-way stop . The new law will not apply to traffic lights that are only active during certain periods , such as signals outside of a school or a fire department .
Most drivers already believe that treating an intersection with a nonworking traffic signal as a four-way stop is the law , and with this reform , it now will be ,  Jones said . This will end the confusion in Michigans law and ensure that all drivers in our state are on the same page when approaching an intersection with a nonworking traffic light .
It might slow traffic a bit on major roads , but its worth it if it can help save lives.
Word from the Baker Island KH1/KH7Z DXpedition team is that “ things are humming on Baker Island. ” But , because of the tides , the DXpedition , which has logged more than 40,000 contacts , has announced that it will cease operation on July 6 — a day sooner than projected — and depart the following day . Station teardown will start late on July 4 . Since its arrival , the team has encountered antenna-damaging storms , satellite phone failures , and extreme heat , but everything now has been restored to working order .
“ We are all happily working radio shifts handing out ATNOs [ all-time new ones ] and making memories that will remain with us forever , ” the DXpedition said in an update over the weekend .
KH1/KH7Z will shift its 30-meter frequency to 10.107 MHz to avoid European interference , and it will try “ normal ” FT8 mode on 1.840 on July 3 at 0900 UTC for the US east coast . If successful , the DXpedition will remain on 160 through the night for eastern Europe .
The DXpedition has said that “ fully half ” of all FT8 callers are not using the correct software . Callers must use WSJT-X version 1.9.1 , go into Advanced settings , choose “ Hound ” mode , and sync their computer 's clock . DXpedition Pilot Lee Finkel , KY7M , has prepared a “ Quick Start Guide ” ( attached below ) for working KH1/KH7Z that includes more details . KH1/KH7Z hopes to activate FT8 on 60 meters on July 4 .
All eight stations are on the air , covering 160 through 6 meters . The KH1/KH7Z frequency plan is on the DXpedition website . DXpedition operators will be operating split . Please do not call on the DX station 's transmitting frequency !
Lizzie Kelly stars on New Year 's Day 2017 at Cheltenham Posted by racenews on Sunday , January 1 , 2017 · Leave a Comment
Jockey Lizzie Kelly was the star of Cheltenham 's New Year 's Day fixture , riding a 92.5/1 double for her stepfather Nick Williams , headlined by the victory of Agrapart in the G2 Dornan Engineering Relkeel Hurdle .
A race-by-race report for all the action on New Year 's Day can be found below .
Cheltenham Racecourse 's next fixture is Festival Trials Day on Saturday , January 28 .
12.15pm £20,000 Neptune Investment Management Novices ' Hurdle ( Listed ) , 2m 4f 56y
The going at Cheltenham on New Year 's Day changed to Good to Soft , Good in places before racing after four millimetres of rain and the runners in the first race finished strung out apart from the first four past the post .
They were led home by five-year-old Coo Star Sivola , trained by Nick Williams and ridden by his step-daughter Lizzie Kelly , who stayed on strongly up the hill to win , for the first time , by four and half lengths from the front-running Report To Base ( Evan Williams/Paul Moloney , 10/1 ) .
The 9/2 chance , who ran well when third in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle at The Festival in March , raced prominently among the 10 runners ( Dashing Oscar was a non-runner ) and went second four out .
Coo Star Sivola challenged the leader between the last two hurdles and was in the lead by the final flight , staying on strongly up the hill . The 4/1 favourite Poetic Rhythm finished a further two and a quarter lengths back in third .
Kelly , who had not partnered a winner since November , was relieved to be back in the winner 's enclosure .
She said : “ I am really happy , that is a brilliant start to what should be a good day . I have four rides today .
“ He is lovely and I could not have asked for a nicer ride . He had good form and was my second winner at Cheltenham today .
“ It is hard when you are not riding winners – you become a bit desperate . You have to tell yourself , just chill and keep calm .
“ He has done everything I have asked him to do . He stays well , which is his forte , and the soft ground suited him . He is a very good horse and I think he will have more big days hopefully . ”
The official going was changed to Soft before the second race .

There was a shock result in the second , with 50/1 chance Tour Des Champs holding on by short-head in a thrilling finish from the David Pipe-trained ( Tom Scudamore , 14/1 ) , with the 7/2 market leader Arpege D'Alene ( Paul Nicholls/Sean Bowen ) third .
Tour Des Champs is handled by a newcomer to the training ranks , Samuel Drinkwater , a former amateur rider who gained his experience with local trainers Nigel Twiston-Davies , who used to be responsible for Tour Des Champs , and then Fergal O'Brien .
Drinkwater received his training licence on December 1 and had his first runner and winner with Working Title at Sedgefield on Boxing Day .
10-year-old Tour Des Champs , who had not raced for 260 days , was just Drinkwater 's fourth runner and first at Cheltenham . The horse did his new owners , Prestbury Racing Club , proud .
The chaser , who used to be owned by the late Raymond Mould , chased the leaders before going second three out . He led two out and just held on in a driving finish .
Drinkwater , who is based at Strensham in Worcestershire , said : “ I got my licence at the beginning of December and my brother Joe gave Working Title a great ride to win at Sedgefield . Yes , it is going OK .
“ I started off with Nigel Twiston-Davies and he was great to me . I rode my first winner for him , then moved to Fergal O'Brien and rode all his point-to-pointers and learnt a lot there .
“ I have about 10 horses at the moment and obviously would like to expand and have plenty more winners .
“ Katie Mould , after Mr Mould sadly passed away , asked whether I would be interested in any of the horses and this horse was one of them I was interested in and could afford .
“ I was getting a bit worried on the run-in as Tour Des Champs had n't a run under his belt but the horse toughed it out . ”
The winning rider Robert Dunne added : “ That is two winners within a week for Sam .
“ I was travelling too well which is why I went for home when I did . All Tour Des Champs does is stay and stay and probably wants further . I did not want to be done for toe and thankfully it worked out .
“ It is proper soft ground out there . Sam and I are good mates . He got me the ride on Wayward Prince when the horse won the Scottish National so I owe him a lot . ”
There were 16 runners , with Trioka Steppes not taking part because of the ground .

1.25pm £32,000 BetBright Dipper Novices ' Chase ( Grade Two ) 2m 4f 166y
Whisper ( Nicky Henderson/Davy Russell ) won his second race over fences at Cheltenham when taking the G2 BetBright Dipper Novices ' Chase . He was previously successful over the same distance at The International on December 10 .
O O Seven was a non-runner because of the soft ground which left four to go to post . Clan Des Obeaux ( Paul Nicholls/Sam Twiston-Davies ) was sent off the 10/11 favourite after a Grade Two success at Newbury , with Whisper the 3/1 second favourite .
In another thrilling finish , it was nine-year-old Whisper who prevailed by a half-length after a ding-dong battle .
This was the horse 's fourth course victory , with the most notable being success in the 2014 Coral Cup at The Festival .
Russell , who was making it two winners in two days for Henderson after success on William Henry at Newbury , said : “ He jumped the last couple of fences really well and stayed on well to the line .
“ All credit must go to Nicky Henderson . That was Whisper 's second win over fences at Cheltenham .
“ The horse has grown in confidence and has even got stronger underneath me . He stayed really well today .
“ It 's soft ground out there but it is the first of January – what do you expect ? ”
Nicky Henderson added : “ He 's won two Aintree Hurdles and all sorts of races , he 's just tough and genuine and is a real friend .
“ When these old ones come back it is great . It feels like he has been around a long time , but he is only a novice chaser .
“ He 'll have to come into the JLT picture , I think , although he does get three miles . He 'll go on any ground and it never worried me running him on the ground today .
“ He 's a brave little fellow and very genuine . The key question now is whether he has a run before the Festival . He does n't need to have one . ”
Noel Hayes , Director of Sportsbook , BetBright said : “ We 've had a great day 's racing at Cheltenham today , the highlight was Whisper 's winning of the BetBright Dipper Novices ' Chase and we 've made him 12/1 for the JLT Novices Chase for the Festival . ”
2.00pm £60,000 BetBright Best For Festival Betting Handicap Chase ( Grade Three ) 2m 4f 166y
The richest race of the day , the £60,000 BetBright Best For Festival Betting Handicap Chase went the way of Shantou Flyer ( Rebecca Curtis/Aidan Coleman , 20/1 ) . The seven-year-old was making his first start for Curtis , having previously been trained by Colin Bowe in Ireland .
Despite not enjoying the clearest of runs , the seven-year-old took the lead two fences from home and kept on resolutely to see off 11/4 favourite Village Vic by three lengths . Top-weight Top Gamble ( Kerry Lee/Davy Russell , 8/1 ) was a further half-length back in third .
Rebecca Curtis said : “ It is so nice for his owner Carl Hinchy to have a winner at Cheltenham . He has put a lot of money into racing and to have a winner here is amazing .
“ We were told when he joined us that he wanted better ground but I think the soft ground today has suited him . ”
Aidan Coleman added : “ I thought it was n't going to be my day but this is a very clever horse and is an exceptional jumper . He sidestepped the fallers very well .
“ I spoke to Davy Russell and Adrian Heskin who have both ridden him before and they told me all about him . He is a very , very good jumper . He is a genuine horse this – if you get him to the wings of the fence , he will do the rest . ”

2.35pm £20,000 BetBright Casino Handicap Hurdle 2m 7f 213y
The victory of the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Cogry was notable for the gameness of the winner and the comeback to Jump racing of his rider William Twiston-Davies who had started out in Jump racing before switching to the Flat .
His tally of 189 successes in Britain on the level dwarfs the nine Jump racing . His previous Jump victory was back in May , 2012 .
William Twiston-Davies , after his third ride back over jumps , said : “ It is an unbelievable feeling to have a Cheltenham winner , five , six years on . Thanks to Dad and Sam for letting me have the ride .
“ I really , really pleased though I am thinking of Ryan Hatch . This horse deserved to get a good win . It was a team effort .
“ I just want to have a nice time riding over jumps . It 's nice to ride a nice horse for dad .
“ I have had a great time riding on Flat and just want to enjoy riding in National Hunt racing . ”
His brother Sam Twiston-Davies , stable jockey to champion Jump trainer Paul Nicholls , watched the race in the weighing room .
Sam said : “ William gave Cogry a great ride and I am delighted for him – he has put a lot of work into getting his weight back .
“ If you schooled Cogry at home , you would not think he could fall as he is a brilliant jumper . I was happy for Willy to ride him today . The horse is a real trier . ”
The horse led until Rocklander ( Tom George/Adrian Heskin ) went on after the last but rallied under an inspired ride by Twiston-Davies .
Cogry fell on his previous start in the Unicoin Group Handicap Chase at Cheltenham on December 9 and rider Ryan Hatch sustained neck and back injuries and remains in hospital .

3.10pm £40,000 Dornan Engineering Relkeel Hurdle 2m 4f 56y
Jockey Lizzie Kelly and her stepfather Nick Williams enjoyed a 92.5/1 double on New Year 's Day at Cheltenham when Agrapart took the G2 Dornan Engineering Hurdle .
The 2015 Stayers ' Hurdle winner Cole Harden ( Warren Greatrex/Richard Johnson , 7/1 ) led the field along until Agrapart took the lead approaching the last . Agrapart was then headed shortly after the last by L'Ami Serge ( Nicky Henderson/Daryl Jacob , 2/1 favourite ) but battled back gamely to score by a head .
Kelly said : “ Agrapart is a legend . I knew today we had a great shout and we came into the race quietly at 16/1 .
“ The way he won the Betfair Hurdle at Newbury last season , I always thought he would stay a bit further . It has rained all day which suited him .
“ I have no idea where he will go now . I would like to think he would stay three miles .
“ It 's been a tough season but is amazing to come here and have two winners . It 's a credit to all the team at home .
Nick Williams said : “ It is fantastic because we have n't been winning many races lately .
“ It was a brilliant ride from Lizzie . She is a very , very strong in a finish , there is no question about that .
“ She has won a lot of photos against some very strong jockeys . She is particularly good in a finish . ”

TASHKENT : A court in Uzbekistan convicted an Uzbek-born U.S. citizen for links to militant Islam and calling for the government 's overthrow , but imposed only a US $ 67 fine for the almost 20-year-old offences .
Zokir Aliyev , 46 , an American citizen since 2014 , was detained on June 16 by Uzbekistan 's state security service on suspicion of belonging to an Islamist militant group .

He was freed after six days in detention and then stood trial in the former Soviet republic that has traditionally been tough on Islamists after an insurgency in the 1990s .
The Uzbek Supreme Court 's press office said on Wednesday that a provincial court had convicted Aliyev of publicly calling for the toppling of the government and participating in an extremist group .
But it said the court imposed only the small fine based on a multiple of the official minimum wage as of December 1999 when the alleged offence occurred .
No further explanation was given . But the Uzbek criminal code says the punishment for such offences can be as mild as a fine , or a fine plus prison time .

Aliyev , who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday , earlier denied any involvement with the militant Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) and said he had only taken part in some Uzbek opposition activist meetings in Turkey in the 1990s .
Uzbekistan 's state security service said via the state news agency UzA last month that Aliyev had been on its wanted list since 2005 over suspected affiliation with the IMU .
IMU fighters fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan after retreating from their home country and the intelligence service told UzA they suspected Aliyev had trained there .
According to what appears to be Aliyev 's Facebook page , which gives his name as Zokir Ali , he has lived recently in the U.S. state of Virginia and studied at the University of Nevada .
The U.S. embassy in Tashkent declined comment on his case , citing privacy concerns .

SINGAPORE : Toy claw machines are a common sight in game arcades and carnivals , but for one charity , they have become an affordable way to raise funds .
Thye Hwa Kwan ( THK ) Moral Society rolled out two of those machines at Junction 8 mall in Bishan on Monday ( Jan 2 ) , at the launch of an exhibition to highlight its services .
The charity 's chairman Lee Kim Siang said given the uncertain economic outlook , voluntary welfare organisations ( VWO ) need to find `` innovative ways '' to raise funds . `` If we do a TV show , it 's going to cost quite a hefty sum . The going rate was a million dollars , '' said Mr Lee .
He added that THK has not yet been affected by the economy : `` We are okay … in good times and bad times , people help us . ''
For instance , the cost of the claw machines were covered by donors . The charity bought a total of 10 machines from China for about S $ 10,000 , which included the cost of shipping . To help save on maintenance costs , two Thye Hwa Kwan staff were trained to maintain and repair the machines .
For S $ 2 per play , you can have a go on the machine to try and win stuffed toys . THK hopes to raise S $ 2,000 during the one-week exhibition . The money will go towards the charity 's programmes and services like its free meal centres and free medical clinics .
Speaking at the exhibition , Member of Parliament for Bishan-Toa Payoh , Mr Saktiandi Supaat , also agreed that VWOs could do more in this economic climate to encourage donors to continue to give .
`` One way like what they 're ( THK ) doing is trying to use innovative , creative ways to fund raise , '' he said , adding that it is also important for charities to raise awareness of the services they provide .
`` Residents still appreciate the services that 's provided by organisations like Thye Hua Kwan ... that would create a bit more awareness , and a lot of fundraising can still continue in the year ahead , ” said Mr Saktiandi .

( Reuters ) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Monday it would raise its quarterly dividend by 20 percent and replace its existing share buyback programme with a new $ 18 billion authorization .

The company 's shares , the best-performing Dow component this year with an 84 percent surge , were up 1.2 percent at $ 286.51 in after-market trading .
The world 's biggest maker of jetliners said the raised dividend and the new buyback programme were not in response to a Republican tax overhaul , which seeks to cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent .
Other U.S. corporations have said they would use the windfall from the tax overhaul to buy back shares , retire debt and other shareholder-friendly moves .
The cash deployment plans reflect ongoing confidence in our financial strength and the long-term outlook of our business , Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said in a statement .
Boeing 's dividend increase comes at the high-end of analysts ' estimates of 15 percent to 20 percent , Robert W Baird & Co analyst Peter Arment wrote in a note .
The company said on Monday the new quarterly dividend would be $ 1.71 per share , up from $ 1.42 .
Boeing said the new repurchase programme would replace a $ 14 billion authorization approved in December 2016 , under which the company had repurchased $ 9.2 billion .
The increase in the buyback amount also comes as a surprise and shows the management 's confidence in generating strong free cash flows over the next few years , analyst Arment said .
Boeing said it expected to complete the new buybacks in the next 24-30 months .

Tesla stopped accepting orders on the Model S 60 yesterday , which means the new base version of the sedan comes standard with a stronger 75-kilowatt-hour battery . To keep starting prices low for the sedan lineup , Tesla is now asking $ 7,500 less for the Model S 75 than it did before it became the base model .
As reported by Electrek , the Model S now starts at $ 69,500 , just $ 1,500 more than the previous base model with the 60-kWh battery . For this extra money , base-model buyers upgrade from 210 miles to 249 miles of range , as estimated by the EPA . For all-wheel-drive models , the standard range moves from 218 miles to 259 miles .
As part of the pricing changes , Tesla buyers get a few new standard features . An automatic rear power liftgate is now standard , as is the all-glass roof that was previously an extra $ 1,500 . However , the smart air suspension is no longer an option on the 75-kWh model .
Those who already bought the 60-kWh version may be feeling some envy toward buyers of the new base model . But luckily for these customers , the price of upgrading from a 60-kWh battery to a 75-kWh battery has dropped $ 7,000 to just $ 2,000 . With this change , 60-kWh owners still end up saving some money compared to the new 75-kWh price .
A Tesla spokesperson confirmed the updates in a statement to Motor Trend . “ Periodically we have adjusted pricing and available options to best reflect the value of our products and our customers ' preferences , ” Tesla says . “ Today 's updates include slight price decreases to our 75 , 75D , and 90D models to account for the discontinuation of our 60-kWh models . ”
The automaker also warned of small price increases for the 100D and P100D models starting next week . “ Price increases for our 100D and P100D models will take effect on April 24 , 2017 to best accommodate customers already in the order process , while price decreases for 75 , 75D , and 90D models will take effect today , ” Tesla said in the statement .
Tesla discontinued its 60-kWh battery due to an apparent lack of demand . Because most customers ended up ordering the equivalent to a 75-kWh model , the company made the decision to cut the 60-kWh version and thereby simplify the ordering process .

REUTERS : Substitute Enner Valencia scored his first Everton goal to break Southampton 's resolve and send the home side on their way to a 3-0 win at Goodison Park on Monday , with Leighton Baines and Romelu Lukaku also finding the net .
Valencia had not scored in the Premier League since getting two goals for West Ham United against Manchester City last January , but secured the breakthrough in the 73rd minute when he bundled home the rebound after Fraser Forster had saved Lukaku 's header .
Ronald Koeman 's side had struggled to find solutions to prise open his former employers but killed off the contest in the 81st minute when Baines beat Forster from the spot after Maya Yoshida clumsily brought down Lukaku .
Everton ran riot as Southampton crumbled and Lukaku signed off a dominant second half when he slammed an emphatic effort into the top corner from just inside the visitors ' box in the 89th minute .
The win keeps Everton in seventh on 30 points , six behind Manchester United who play later on Monday , while Southampton remain on 24 points .

CENTENNIAL , — Today , Colorado Farm Bureau Foundation Disaster Relief Committee distributed more than $ 350,000 to nearly 20 farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods were devastated by the grassfire that ripped through Northeast Colorado in March .
The fire consumed more than 30,000 acres in Logan and Phillips counties , destroying three homes , killing livestock and damaging fields , facilities , equipment and infrastructure . Conservative loss estimates totaled nearly $ 5 million from victims in the affected areas .
`` The devastation that our neighbors have suffered is heartbreaking to all of us in the agriculture community , '' said Don Shawcroft , president of Colorado Farm Bureau . `` While we know these funds wo n't replace all that these farmers and ranchers have lost , we hope it helps the recovery process as they start to rebuild and grow . ''
The fire brought out the local community in full force as fire departments from throughout the area were mobilized and local farmers brought their equipment to help protect and contain the fire . Additionally , local businesses and agriculture organizations worked tirelessly to raise funds and coordinate donations and supplies that were sent from across the country .
The CFB board of directors , the CFB Foundation and the Disaster Fund Relief Committee are thankful to the generous donors who supported this cause . Our thanks go out especially to major donors including Monsanto , Merck Animal Health , Louisiana Farm Bureau , Georgia Farm Bureau , Weld County Farm Bureau , Premier Farm Credit , American Ag Credit , CoBank , Farm Aid , The Samuel S. Johnson Foundation , Breedersworld Online Sales , Bekaert Corp. , IMMVAC Inc. , Montgomery Stockyards of Hope Hull , Ala. , Brock and Krissa Welshans of Marlette , Mich. , Janice Smith of Evergreen , Colo. , and the Bonham Ranch of Cheyenne , Wyo .
CFB is proud to report that 100 percent of donations received were distributed to victims of this disaster . The overwhelming support from our partners and friends from the Front Range and around the country is a prime example of the willingness of the agriculture community to come together and support each other during hard times .
At a symposium last month , in a sports management institution in Mumbai , a TV producer waxed eloquent on the value that sports leagues are bringing to India . An awestruck audience of academics — the padoge likhoge banoge nawab types — listened in rapt attention to the discourse that sought to paint a rosy picture of Indian sports .
At the end of it all , when I asked the speaker if he could tell me what percentage of sportspersons in the country really benefitted from the various leagues , he seemed at a loss for words .
I did n't expect him to know .
The producer was naturally basing his arguments on the tremendous success of the Indian Premier League over the last decade . And to a lesser extent , that of the Pro Kabaddi League . He was n't far wrong there , for broadcasters of the leagues — along with administrators and a few players — had made merry , while there had been little developmental effort visible at the grassroots level .
To use a political cliché : the affluent had grown richer while the underprivileged had remained poor !
Leagues are glamour events
Out of a squad of 25 Indian Premier League players , eight are from overseas . Another five or six are established Indian players , who have either played Tests , one-day internationals or T20 internationals . The rest , bought on ‘ talent ' — as defined by a conglomeration of business and cricketing brains , make a tidy sum for themselves and get the opportunity to showcase their talent to national selectors .
The Ranji Trophy championships in India — and other age group tournaments — has 28 participating ‘ state ' teams . For argument 's sake , if we believe that there are only 20 talented players in each of these 28 teams — Ranji , Under-23 and Under-19 — then there are around 560 probable players for the 80 spots in the IPL ; a mere 14 percent vacancy .
Here we are not even considering the lakhs of players who are registered with state associations , many of whom aspire to play for the state and country someday . In that sense , IPL provides a platform to a miniscule portion of India 's cricketing population .
This is true of the Pro Kabaddi League and the Indian Super League ( football ) too . Talent at the state and district levels hardly ever gets a look in in these games . What 's more , the leagues have been the reason why many of the state and all India level tournaments — with little funding — have gone defunct .
The Hockey India League , that promised a hockey renaissance in the country , has temporarily shut shop . The badminton , tennis and table-tennis leagues , despite star turnouts , are still low key and have failed to garner much support .
Yet , corporates and broadcasters believe that leagues are the in thing !
Who is mentoring talent ?
The coming of the leagues to India has seen the blossoming of a few thousand academies in different sports , all over the country . Most of these ‘ grooming classes ' are run by high-profile coaches . They cater to upper middle-class and high-brow families , who can afford the exorbitant fees charged , with the promise that their wards could make it to the glamorous leagues .
Where , for god 's sake , have the Achrekars , the Amladis , the Tarapores , the Rajkumar Sharma 's and the Keshav Banerjees gone ? Most of the world 's top players , in any sport , have been coached and mentored by committed individuals ; not by academies . Even Saina Nehwal , PV Sindhu and Srikanth Kidambi receive individual coaching from Gopichand , though they are part of his academy .
Mass production factories can manufacture Altos and Santros ; not Rolls Royces and Lamborghinis ! Perhaps the last among these mentors — Mumbai 's Vidya Paradkar and Dinesh Lad are a couple of examples — have been overshadowed by the NCA certified level ‘ C ' coaches . Coaching is no longer a vocation for these certificate wielding impostors !
Where 's the infrastructure ?
I came across a tweet by former England skipper and star batsman , Michael Vaughan , while I was jotting down points for my column . It read : “ Football makes me chuckle … millions and millions spent/wasted on transfers ( in EPL ) on deadline day , yet the majority of grassroots football pitches are dog sh * t … # justsaying ”
Is Indian sport any different ? Most school level cricket pitches here are nothing more than dust-bowls . Football is played on grossly sub-standard pitches ; the MSSA and the Xavier 's Sports Complex grounds in Mumbai are prime examples . In a city like Mumbai , hockey is still , generally , played on natural turf . Facilities for grassroots programmes in every sport — indoor or outdoor — are , to say the least , despicable .
Franchises then expect these youngsters , brought up on ‘ dog sh * t ' grounds , to compete with overseas players . It 's to the players ' credit that they do n't cower .
Khelo India – banoge kharab ?
The Khelo India programme of the sports ministry , initiated by Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore , is perhaps a step in the right direction . Besides state and national level inter-school competitions , the initiative seeks to develop playing fields , sports infrastructure , community coaching and a search for talented , young sportspersons .
The Khelo India Games are now on . Is the sports ministry sure that the best school level talent is at the competition ? Before the programme is implemented in schools , school principals , sports teachers and coaches needed to be trained and sensitised to the requirements of talented youngsters .
If the initiative has to be successful , therefore , highly committed and competent people at every level will have to be drafted/recruited under the personal supervision of the sports ministry . Sporting talent shall have to be monitored and encouraged on a daily basis ; not once a year before the Khelo India Games !
Like the leagues , the Khelo India programme ca n't afford to be a showpiece .
Recognise coaches ; generate talent
A decade ago , one of the best cricket coaches in Mumbai — there are n't many left now — was telling me of how he had mentored some outstanding talent for the city and for the country , and how he was n't given credit for it either by the players , the Mumbai Cricket Association or the Board of Control for Cricket ( BCCI ) in India . “ I think from here on , I should have an agreement with the players I coach to pay me 10 percent of all their earnings during their career , ” he had said in frustration .
I wish he had . A few hundred crores would probably have been added to his bank account by 2018 .
The leagues , therefore , have some thinking to do . They wo n't get quality Indian players in the leagues unless coaches at the grassroots level are committed , recognised for their efforts and are looked after .
The leagues also must invest in infrastructure and local level events so that youngsters get the opportunity to play . Good players come out of mass participation .
Sportspersons have to start dreaming about playing in the leagues , and for India . He or she must have enough opportunities to do so . It is for the leagues to create this sporting atmosphere .
Leagues can indeed bring value to Indian sport ; they just need to open their hearts and their purse-strings !

Veteran Leander Paes is out of contention but top singles player Yuki Bhambri will make a comeback to the Indian Davis Cup team along with Saketh Myneni when the AITA Selection Committee meets on Monday in Thrissur to announce squad for the World Group Play-off tie against Canada in September.The 44-year-old Paes was included in the six-man squad for the previous tie against Uzbekistan in Bengaluru in April this year but was left out of the final four by the new captain Mahesh Bhupathi.Upset and embarrassed , Paes had left the venue mid-way into the tie , prompting Bhupathi to reveal on Facebook that he had never promised Paes a spot in the final four and that his action was final nail in the coffin.The AITA does not want a repeat of any such unsavoury incident and also that Paes is now behind three Indian players - Rohan Bopanna ( 21 ) , Divij Sharan ( 53 ) and Purav Raja ( 54 ) - in the rankings , the winner of the 18 Grand Slam titles is not to be considered by the Committee.Both Bhambri , who recently beat world number 22 Gael Monfils , and Saketh Myneni had missed the Uzbekistan tie due to their respective injuries.Now that they are back on the ATP Tour , they will take their places back in the side for the September 15-17 tie in Edmonton . Ramkumar Ramanathan who created a ripple by beating world number eight Dominic Thiem will be the other singles player in the team.Bopanna being the highest-ranked doubles player in the country is automatic choice for the doubles rubber.Prajnesh Gunneswaran and N Sriram Balaji , who made their Davis Cup debuts in Bengaluru are likely to be reserve members of the squad.All the squad members will assemble in New York for a camp at the University of Colombia , a week before the tie , to be played on indoor courts.All India Tennis Association ( AITA ) says Paes needs to improve his ranking to stake a claim in the Indian team . `` We are following norms . There are players , who are ranked higher than Leander . How can you ignore someone like Bopanna who is ranked 21 . And the captain has the prerogative to have a squad of his choice , '' AITA Secretary Hironmoy Chatterjee said.However , the AITA official said the door was not yet shut on Paes . `` No , all doors are open for him . But he has to improve his ranking . We go by the rankings , '' Chatterjee said.Paes needs one more win to claim the world record for most Davis Cup wins in doubles . He is tied on 42 wins with Italian legend Nicola Pietrangeli.The AITA Selection Committee , headed by SP Misra , will also select a team for the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games to be held in September in Ashgabat , Turkmenistan .
The Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company ( IVM ) on Wednesday said that efforts to upgrade from 10,000 cars production capacity annually to 60,000 is being hampered by litigations against the company .
The company 's Head , Corporate Communications , Cornel Osigwe , who made the disclosure at a news conference in Lagos , said the factory 's upgrading from manual to automated production was also affected .
Mr Osigwe said that the recent charge filed by the Economic Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) at a Lagos High Court was distracting and affecting operations in the company .
According to him , even the workers are in fear of being harassed .
“ There has been an advertorial by the EFFC declaring Dr Innocent Chukwuma , the Chairman of IVM wanted .
“ That publication has maligned his image and reputation as well as put him in a bad light as somebody who is a criminal . This is not so .
“ The fact of the matter is that there has been an abuse of court process by the EFCC over a business disagreement between IVM and Guarantee Trust Bank which started in 2013 , '' he alleged .
“ This same case instituted by the EFCC is still pending at the Federal High Court , Lagos and at the Court of Appeal , Lagos .
“ Recently , the same EFCC filed a fresh charge of the same case and allegation at the Lagos High Court . This is clearly an abuse of court process by the EFCC .
“ Innoson is contesting that the Lagos High court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and not afraid of arraignments or running away from the court .
“ He is saying that he must be arraigned through due process of the law , '' he said .
Mr Osigwe said that IVM represented the hope , identity and story of Nigeria , as well as the die-hard spirit of Nigerians to make things happen .
“ 'So , we want Nigerians to know the facts of the issue . ''
It will be recalled that Mr Chukwuma is standing trial in a matter between his company and the EFFC .
He was arraigned alongside his company for allegedly forging documents to facilitate the clearing of some goods at the port .
Specifically , he was alleged to have forged documents purportedly emanating from GTB Bank .

SINGAPORE : Talk of terrorism is uncomfortable and puts the spotlight on the Muslim community , but it also allows Singapore to achieve a certain level of psychological resilience against extremist ideologies , said Mr K Shanmugam on Saturday ( Oct 7 ) .
“ Over the last two years , even though it was uncomfortable at times , even though we talked about it many times , I think it has had an impact because if you go today and talk to the average Muslim on the street , I think they will tell you what is and what is not acceptable , '' said the Law and Home Affairs Minister .
`` It is sinking in , it is accepted and the small groups of people who advocate a more extreme view are also keeping quiet . So , I think we have achieved a certain level of psychological resilience , '' he added , speaking at a seminar organised by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore ( MUIS ) , the Religious Rehabilitation Group and Association of Islamic Scholars and Preachers . ''
Moving forward , Mr Shanmugam said more attention will be focused on fostering a common ground to build up community resilience .
He also said that religious scholars play an important role in promoting cohesiveness and provide guidance on what is right and what is not . However , there is a need for religious organisations to be technologically savvy in order to engage the young , he added .
Mr Shanmugam also spoke about the achievements of Singapore 's Muslim community and how it can be a model for the rest of the world .

“ If you look at our Muslim children 's education achievements and this is by international standards , the average Muslim child in Singapore does better than many of the average European children and many of the average American children .
`` Muslim children are now world class . Our Muslim community can be a beacon and a model for Muslim communities around the world , ” he said .
A special edition booklet consisting compilations of 15 articles on countering radicalisation was also launched on Saturday by the Religious Rehabilitation Group and Khadijah Mosque .
The booklet will be distributed to mosques islandwide and will also be made available online .
Additionally , MUIS published a pamphlet in Malay titled Resilient Families : Safeguarding Against Radicalisation . It provides insights , as well as ways to protect families from the threats of radical ideologies .
REUTERS : Bank of America reported a 44 percent rise in quarterly profit as higher interest rates bulked up earnings from loans and an increase in trading boosted revenue .
The second-largest U.S. bank said net income attributable to shareholders rose to US $ 4.35 billion in the three months ended March 31 from US $ 3.02 billion a year earlier .
Earnings per share rose to 41 cents per share from 28 per share . ( http : //bit.ly/2px3E6G )
Analysts on average had expected earnings of 35 cents per share , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S . It was not immediately clear if the reported figures were comparable .
Total revenue , net of interest expense , rose 7 percent to US $ 22.25 billion .
`` We saw good client activity in our balanced portfolio of businesses ... The U.S. economy continues to show consumer and business optimism , and our results reflect that , '' Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in a statement .
The Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank 's shares were up about 1 percent at US $ 23.05 in premarket trading .
Big U.S. banks have been vitalized by increased market activity prompted by the so-called `` Trump trade '' . They have also benefited from higher interest rates , which the U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated will be raised again this year .
Interest rates were hiked in December and March - a 0.25 percentage point uptick in each case - marking only the second and third raise in seven years , after being kept stagnantly near zero .
Bank of America relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits as it has a large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities .
Higher interest rates increased the amount of money banks can earn from their various loans , known as net interest income . BofA made US $ 11.06 billion as net interest income in the quarter , up 5.5 percent from a year earlier .
JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup last week also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit , driven by increased trading activity .
Excluding special items , the bank 's trading activities brought in US $ 4 billion , a 21.2 percent rise .
Revenue from fixed-income trading surged about 29 percent , while equity trading revenue rose about 7 percent , boosted by volatility around the Fed 's interest rate hikes .
Bank of America posted record investment banking fees of US $ 1.6 billion .
The lender 's non-interest expenses was nearly flat at US $ 14.85 million .
Moynihan said last year he would make trimming costs a top priority and would shrink annual expenses by about an additional US $ 5 billion by 2018 .
Up to Monday 's close , the bank 's stock had risen about 34 percent since President Trump 's election on Nov. 8 .

Minutewomen look to keep momentum going against UMass Lowell
Posted by Thomas Haines on December 12 , 2017 · Leave a Comment
The Massachusetts women 's basketball team will go on the road to face UMass Lowell on Wednesday as they look to continue the momentum of three straight wins .
UMass is coming off an impressive win over Saint Peter 's on Sunday that moved them to 7-4 on the year . More discouraging is a 1-3 record on the road , which makes Wednesday 's road game vital as the Minutewomen gauge their ability to play in a hostile environment . The environment will be completely unfamiliar on Wednesday , as UMass has never played at UMass Lowell .
“ I 'm looking for us to go there and be really good and be systematic right from the start , ” UMass coach Tory Verdi said . “ We 've got to have great energy , great focus . We 've got to have a want-to off the charts . I 'm expecting us to show up and dictate right from the start . ”
UMass Lowell is 3-7 on the year and coming off a loss against Fairleigh Dickinson , but has the ability to score the ball as it averages nearly 70 points per game .
“ They 've got a couple shooters , ” Verdi said . “ We 're going to fly around and be active . We 've got to identify where they are and contest shots . ”
One player Verdi identified as a threat was Kayla Gibbs , a senior forward who has helped power their offense . When these two teams last met in 2015 , Gibbs scored 13 points for a weak UMass Lowell offense .
“ [ Gibbs is ] a very good power forward , ” Verdi said . “ She 's averaging 11 points and 6 offensive rebounds a game , so they 'll look to score a ton of points in the paint . So , we 've got to do a great job of protecting the interior . ”
The Minutewomen head into Wednesday 's game with a three-game winning streak after hovering around .500 in the first eight games . During the winning streak , UMass is averaging 95 points and fewer than 50 points allowed , including a game against Fisher College where the Minutewomen broke a number of offensive records . However , two of the opponents they faced during that stretch , Saint Peter 's and Fisher College , also account for two of the River Hawk 's three wins .
Verdi said that the streak was encouraging after UMass rebounded from some early-season struggles .
“ I think definitely some progress has been made , and it 's going to be continuous all year long , ” Verdi said . “ When you add seven new faces to four returners , you 're going to have ebbs and flows , it 's going to be a roller coaster ride . But I 'm looking forward to seeing us be a little more consistent , and I thought we were a little more consistent the other day . ”
For senior Leah McDerment , the wins were a reflection of better teamwork from the Minutewomen .
“ We 've got a lot more team chemistry , ” McDerment said . “ We 're 11 games in now , so it 's becoming second nature , just knowing what each of our strengths are . ”
Despite coming out on top on Sunday , Verdi said that there were areas that needed to improve for Wednesday . Notably , UMass struggled early against Saint Peter 's and trailed going into halftime , which Verdi attributed to lack of energy from the Minutewomen .
“ I thought we were a little flat coming out in the first period , ” Verdi said . “ We 've got to do a better job , have a little bit more energy and have more ball pressure . ”
From a technical standpoint , Verdi said that the Minutewomen had to get more defensive rebounds .
“ We 've got to do a better job of boxing out on the weak side , ” Verdi said . “ We ca n't allow teams to fly in from the weak side and get second-chance opportunity points . ”
Wednesday 's game will begin at 7:30 p.m. at the Costello Athletic Center at UMass Lowell .

The Ministry of Mines and Steel Development said that any state government that bans miners from operating in its jurisdiction could lose its share of the 13 per cent mining derivation revenue .
O'seun Adewale , the Technical Adviser to the Minister of Mines and Steel Development , made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja on Monday .
He said any state that bans or prevents legal miners from carrying out their legitimate activities could lose the little amount being shared for states every month based on the amount of mineral commodities recorded .
Adewale said : “ States are entitled to benefit from revenue of minerals derived from their locations , the revenue is being calculated for each state based on the amount of mineral commodities recorded . ”
The 13 per cent derivation revenue is shared among states that are active in mining of solid minerals , just like their counterparts in the oil and gas producing areas .
Adewale said the ministry had written to states that stopped legal miners from operating in their jurisdictions warning them that mining was on the exclusive list .
NAN reports that Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria , as amended puts mining on the exclusive list .
This confers the right on the Federal Government to issue mining licence , collect royalties and supervise mining operations as well as take necessary action when any provision of the mineral act is violated .
Recently , Lagos and Ebonyi governments banned legal miners from operating in their jurisdictions due to environmental issue and non-payment of mineral revenue .
The Miners Association of Nigeria described the actions of the two state governments as interfering with the mining operations of their members , which was a breach of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria .
With Borussia Dortmund having sold their self-styled “ Batman ” Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang , his replacement Michy Batshuayi , another aspiring “ Caped Crusader ” , answered their call for goals on his debut .
“ I heard the Batman job was vacant at Borussia Dortmund so I decided to take over , ” Batshuayi , who already liked to call himself “ Batsman ” , wrote on Instagram after signing a loan deal until the end of the season from Chelsea on Wednesday .
Before leaving for Arsenal , Aubameyang sometimes celebrated scoring for Dortmund by donning masks — once pulling on a Batman hood in a Bundesliga game .
With one Batman gone , Dortmund turned to Batshuayi who responded on Friday night .
The 24-year-old scored twice on his debut in a 3-2 Bundesliga victory at bottom side Cologne .
The Belgian could have finished with a hat-trick after having a goal ruled offside before the break .
After showing clinical finishing for his goals , Batshuayi then turned provider .
With time running out and the score locked at 2-2 , Batshuayi set up the winning goal and his pass was smashed home by Germany winger Andre Schuerrle .
The win lifted Dortmund to second in the Bundesliga ahead of the other weekend games .
“ Yes , I am very happy , but the most important thing is the victory , ” he said after barely two days at the club .
“ We want to go up as far as possible in the table and , of course , qualify for Champions League . ”
After a turbulent few weeks , overshadowed by Aubameyang 's departure to Arsenal , head coach Peter Stoeger is pleased with his latest recruit .
“ He 's a good boy , ” the Austrian said of Batshuayi .
“ He brings a lot from what we need .
“ His debut is what we had hoped for .
“ This is what one dreams for after the weeks of discussion and the whole over-riding ( Aubameyang ) theme , where we have not focused much on sport .
“ We got a striker who made a great debut . ”
However , Batshuayi 's goals failed to disguise an erratic team performance as Dortmund 's rocky defence twice allowed struggling Cologne to equalise .
Dortmund dropped Aubameyang twice in January before selling him to Arsenal for £56 million ( $ 79 million , 63 million euros ) , the Premier League club 's record transfer .
– Marriage of convenience –
Indiscretions like missing a team meeting , training poorly , missing a team meeting and arranging a video shoot on club premises without permission , tarnished his departure after five years at Dortmund .
Batshuayi is a direct goal-scoring replacement , but has also behaved poorly in the past , being kicked off Anderlecht and Belgium U21 teams in his youth .
Nevertheless , his goals on Friday sealed a marriage of convenience .
Dortmund needed a goal-scorer and after weeks on Chelsea 's bench , behind first-choice striker Alvaro Morata , Batshuayi has a starting berth and that will help his bid for a place in the Belgium squad at the World Cup .
Having also chased Olivier Giroud , before the Frenchman joined Chelsea from Arsenal , Dortmund are happy to have procured Batshuayi , albeit on loan .
“ He 's a classic ‘ nine ' , we needed that , ” said Dortmund 's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke .
“ We had two in the raffle – Giroud and Batshuayi .
“ It worked out with Batshuayi . He has that goal instinct and a great goal-scoring record .
“ He had a lot of competition at Chelsea , so it was not easy to prevail there . ”

All work and no play makes jack a dull boy remains just a saying even for school students these days with the amount of classwork and homework they are busy doing.So much so that , to keep up with the competition , these students go for vacations with a truck load of assignments to complete . But for the students of a Chennai school , it is all play and no work this summer vacation.Perhaps why the assignment list from the school is now going viral . And the assignment is not even for the children but for their parents.The holiday assignment of Annai Violet Matriculation and Higher Secondary School highlights the importance of spending time with loved ones.To begin with , the parents must have at least two meals with their children and teach them the importance of farmers and not waste food . Dignity of labour , building a rapport with neighbours , bonding with grandparents , raising their own garden , loving animals are some of the things that parents will have to teach their children , says the list put out by the school 's Chennai branch principal Lydia Devasagayam.A list from the Coimbatore branch of this school , which is also doing the rounds on social media , has also requested the parents to send pictures of the activities to the school or make a photo album with it. “ In our times we used to play outdoor , get hurt , and visit our grandparents . Holidays meant fun . These days , children hate school . The words stress and pressure is already in their dictionary . It is important for them to learn values at a time when even their parents are being selfish and money-minded in this competitive world , ” Lydia told CNN-News18 .
Janet Jackson 's husband Wissam Al Mana wrote a heartfelt letter to the superstar on his website amid reports that the couple are estranged .
The pair recently became parents to a baby boy , Eissa Al Mana . A rep for Jackson did not confirm that they have split , but a message on his website next to a photo of Jackson professes his love for her , calling her the most beautiful person in the world .
The message ends : “ We will be together in the Great Forever . ”
The singer showed off her a picture of her and her son for the first time Friday in a social media post .

ST. LOUIS - Alice in Wonderland would be proud of this artwork . Co-creator Chelsea Ritter-Soronen certainly is .
“ All anamorphic artwork is mathematical calculations and we use a grid system , ” says Chelsea Ritter-Soronen , co-creator of Pavement Portals . “ We had to train ourselves to paint so the augmented camera could learn the project as well . ”
Chalk Riot partnered with Art St. Louis and tech company Heavy Projects are bringing art and the intersection of technology to St. Louis sidewalks this week .
“ But when they see something that jumps out at them from an environment they 're otherwise totally familiar with , they ca n't help but engage with it , especially when there 's a technology element involved with it , ” says Chandler Branch , Art St. Louis .
The interactive idea is to get people to download an app and get to know a neighborhood in a new way .
Using mathematics , paint , and canvas and double-sided tape , the pavement portals are as flat as Flat Stanley .
But coupled with a smartphone or tablet and you are taken to an interactive art world .
“ The painting process became slower than usual because we were always looking at it through a phone and tablets , ” says Ritter-Soronen .
You can dive down your own rabbit hole and experience the 21st-century sidewalk chalk art evolved at the St. Louis Science Center Friday .

Jordan Wilimovsky will not compete at the U.S. World Championship Trials this summer , as reported by Swimming World earlier today .
Wilimovsky was expected to run away from the field in the men 's 1500 this year , especially with the absence of Connor Jaeger and Michael McBroom . His best of 14:45.03 , done at the Olympics last summer when he finished 4th , is nearly 20 seconds clear of the next fastest active American . However , after doing both pool and open water in Rio , he has decided to take a step back from the pool for the year .
He told Swimming World :
“ I decided to take off pool Nationals , ” he said . “ It 's the first year of the quad , so it 's a little bit more relaxed . Just decided to focus on open water this summer , hopefully put up a good 10k at Worlds and then next year start focusing on the 1500 and 10k again for Pan Pacs . ”
Two years ago in Kazan , when Wilimovsky was solely focusing on open water , he took the gold medal in the men 's 10K . Last summer , shortly after competing in the pool , he took 5th in a very close race .
With Wilimovsky out , we 've had to adjust our picks in the men 's distance events . Initially we had him 1st in the mile and 3rd in the 800 , but with this change True Sweetser is now our pick for the second Worlds spot in the 1500 , along with Robert Finke . Check out our updates picks in the 1500 and 800 .
Reader Susan Newell of Detroit writes :
Violet Ikonomova 's blog post `` Detroit police official on racial tensions with the department : 'Get over it '' implies that the DPD routinely makes light of complaints of racism and discrimination in the department . Although I ca n't speak to the overall conclusions of her article , I 'm familiar with the incident that led to the formation of CORE ( Committee on Race and Equality ) .
Last year a white DPD officer posted a message on his Facebook page comparing the Black Panthers to the Ku Klux Klan , implying that both were hate groups .
A few days after the incident was made public , I attended a meeting with the command staff — which included whites and African-Americans — at the officer 's precinct . All of them were angry and offended by the officer 's posting . To my surprise , the African-American lieutenants at the meeting said that this veteran officer 's posting seemed very out of character . They said they thought he was a good person and officer who 'd done something that reflected real ignorance of our nation 's history rather than deep prejudice .
In addition to receiving disciplinary action , this white officer was `` taken to the woodshed '' so to speak , by the African-American officers . They told him about their own and their families ' experiences with racism over several generations . And guess what — the white officer got it ! Because the purpose of those talks was to achieve genuine understanding and reconciliation rather than just punishment , the white officer listened and was enlightened and changed by the experience .
At a larger monthly community meeting a week later , the captain of the precinct did n't just ignore the incident and hope that no one in the community would bring it up . He brought it up himself and apologized to the largely African-American group for the breach of trust , saying that things like this should never happen in our community . My impression was that people really appreciated the precinct leadership 's willingness to acknowledge the problem and act to resolve it in a way that united rather than divided .
I do n't know how the DPD generally handles such problems , but I can say that how they handled this situation was a model for how a police department can develop better relations between the police and the community they serve .
In response to Metro Times ' coverage of Detroit 's dining scene , Tim Flucht writes :
I 'd like to compliment you and your staff on your fantastic coverage of Detroit 's food scene .
Frankly , you beat both The Detroit News and Free Press , hands down .
The MT restaurant reviews are more relevant , focusing more on the food than the décor ( I do n't care if it 's yet another Ron Rea design . That has yet to ever be a factor in where I choose to dine . )
I also appreciate the reviews cover a range of restaurants and price points , rather than just the latest `` see and be seen '' to open in Birmingham .
In a city with one of the nation 's most exciting food scenes ( I do my best to get the word out ) , MT is the best coverage by far . Tom Perkins ' `` Bistro bubble '' article and Michael Jackman 's take on `` critics needed '' are two of the more recent examples of going beyond the reviews ( Jane Slaughter kills it ) and scene reportage to analyze what 's actually going on .
The recipe from Zingerman 's Roadhouse seems a new feature — I really like it , and hope this continues . One request though , if you show something on the plate , please include it in the recipe . Those collards look good as well , and I 'd make both if I were doing the chops .
We can , and do , print the word `` fuck . '' Not everyone appreciates that . Bob Z. from Detroit writes :
In the need to demonstrate how `` cutting edge '' they are , the Metro Times writers must feel they need to throw the word `` fuck '' into every column . Believe me , the word has lost its shock value . Try to articulate your point without the overused profanity . It only shows your immaturity .

Good morning . It 's Monday again : December 11 , 2017 . To paraphrase James Joyce , snow is general not over Ireland , though there 's enough to close schools and disrupt flights . But snow is general over the UK , severely disrupting flights and closing schools . To my friends over there , I 'm sorry about this , but you 're a bunch of weenies ! Chicago eats that kind of snow for breakfast .
For the events , births , and deaths that happened on this date , simply go to yesterday 's post , in which I screwed up and put stuff about December 11 rather than December 10 . There you will find that physicist Max Born was , well , born on December 11 , 1882 , making today his 135th birthday—if he was n't dead ( he died in 1970 ) . He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his mathematical work on the uncertainty principle . Fun Born Fact : he is the grandfather of singer Olivia Newton-John . Sadly , this is not a fact that will excite people at a cocktail party , as those who know Born 's work constitute a set largely non-overlapping with those who like the songs of Ms. Newton-John .
Here 's his gravestone in Göttingen ( and his wife 's ) , inscribed with the uncertainty principle :
And today 's Google Doodle celebrating his life :
Meanwhile in Dobrzyn , Hili is biding her time . ( Look at that sweet face ! ) :
Hili : I 'm not comfortable here . A : So why are you sitting there ? Hili : So that I can enjoy the comfort of the armchair later .
In Polish :
Hili : Nie jest mi tu wygodnie .
Ja : To dlaczego tam siedzisz ?
Hili : Żeby potem cieszyć się wygodą fotela .

We have a lot of tweets found by Matthew . Here 's one from one of his friends who was lucky enough to attend the Nobel Prize Banquet . You 'll remember that this year 's prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three people who worked on circadian rhythms and “ clock genes. ” Matthew 's note on the first tweet :
Leslie was Mike Young 's PhD student and discovered the timeless gene , which helped to explain how the clock works ( she also played an important role in getting the two clock groups to work together ) . She has been in Stockholm as part of Young 's entourage for the awards . This is the hat she wore to the banquet today !
Leslie Voshall is now a professor of neurobiology at The Rockefeller University , and I like her sense of humor .
And Leslie 's tweet showing the Nobel banquet in Stockholm 's Town Hall :

Two themes , actually . And I suppose the “ thyme ” is an accidental double entendre .
Not to leave out the physicists , here 's a hat at the banquet depicting gravitational waves , for which this year 's Physics Nobel was awarded . I did n't realize that theme hats were a thing at Nobel banquets !

Kids in daycare may not always learn about sun safety because their teachers are more focused on lessons about healthy food choices , brushing teeth and getting plenty of exercise , a U.S. study suggests .
( Reuters Health ) - Kids in daycare may not always learn about sun safety because their teachers are more focused on lessons about healthy food choices , brushing teeth and getting plenty of exercise , a U.S. study suggests .
Researchers surveyed 202 administrators , managers and teachers at Head Start and other daycare centers in Illinois in July , a time of year when kids are apt to be exposed to harmful ultraviolet ( UV ) rays .
Overall , when participants ranked their top priorities for teaching toddlers and preschoolers healthy habits , good nutrition came first , followed by exercise , and brushing teeth . Less than one in five respondents listed bike helmets , vaccinations or sun protection as top priorities .
“ The seasonal shift in sun intensity in Illinois means that sun safety receives less attention than health promotion activities that apply all year such as good nutrition , adequate exercise and brushing teeth , ” said senior study author Dr. June Robinson of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago .
While about half of the daycare programs did provide sunscreen for students , 77 percent of these programs did n't allow kids to apply the sunscreen themselves , researchers report in JAMA Dermatology .
It 's possible some daycare centers were following state regulations that apply to students starting in elementary school , which classify sunscreen as an over-the-counter medication that can only be applied by a school nurse with a doctor 's prescription , Robinson said by email . Daycare centers are n't bound by these regulations , but it might still influence their decisions , Robinson said .

About half of the programs , however , used spray sunscreens to avoid unnecessarily touching children . This may be one way to help more children get protection , Robinson said by email .
“ In the past , touching children , which is prohibited out of concerns about child abuse , prevented the application of the lotion type of sunscreen , ” Robinson said .
Head Start programs were more likely to use spray sunscreen than other daycare centers , the study found . Often , programs that did use sprays failed to avoid spraying sunscreen directly on kids ' faces , which can cause children to inhale it or get it in their eyes and is n't the correct way to apply this product .
Most programs did not report children having any sunburns , and most also followed guidelines for keeping kids out of the sun during when the heat index is too high .
One limitation of the study is that it only examined daycare centers in Illinois , and it 's possible the results would be different in places with other regulations regarding sunblock application in schools or different seasonal weather , the authors note .
Still , the results highlight a need to raise awareness about the need for sun protection for kids in early childhood programs , said Dr. Henry Lim , president of the American Academy of Dermatology and senior vice president for academic affairs at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit , Michigan .
“ It is totally appropriate and understandable that top concerns were good nutrition , adequate exercise , brushing teeth and wearing seat belts , but teachers need to be educated about the long term side effects of sun exposure , ” Lim , who was n't involved in the study , said by email . “ Aside from sunburn , teachers obviously would not observe the skin aging and skin cancers in their students ; therefore , education is needed . ”
Parents can also help make sun safety a priority , said Mary Tripp of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .
“ Parents can apply sunscreen lotion to children before they go to school and provide sunscreen for teachers to use at school , ” Tripp , who was n't involved in the study , said by email .
“ Parents also can provide wide-brimmed hats and other protective clothing such as shirts with longer sleeves for their children to use at school , ” Tripp added . “ By practicing sun protection themselves , parents can role model these behaviors for their children , which is critical in helping children develop these healthy habits at a young age . ”

Cancer ‘ Vaccine ' Eliminates Tumors in Mice
Krista Conger | Stanford Medicine News Center
“ The researchers believe the local application of very small amounts of the agents could serve as a rapid and relatively inexpensive cancer therapy that is unlikely to cause the adverse side effects often seen with bodywide immune stimulation . ‘ When we use these two agents together , we see the elimination of tumors all over the body , ' said Ronald Levy , MD , professor of oncology . ‘ This approach bypasses the need to identify tumor-specific immune targets and does n't require wholesale activation of the immune system or customization of a patient 's immune cells .

“ It 's unlikely that the Falcon Heavy will replace the NASA rocket outright . But the Falcon Heavy could still perform other tasks for NASA , such as sending up pieces of the Deep Space Gateway or sending cargo to the lunar surface . Or it could act like a gas delivery service , sending massive amounts of propellant into orbit to fuel up spacecraft for long journeys to deep space . Plus , SpaceX claims the rocket is at least capable of sending people around the Moon , so why not put them on the surface , too ? ”

How Nasa Tests Shapeshifting Plane Wings

“ Typically , the Ptera 's 11 feet wingspan is flat , like a normal plane , but for this experiment , something odd is happening . The wings are hinged , leaving the last quarter of their length able to swivel up and down , like bird wings . It 's all part of the Spanwise Adaptive Wing ( that 's SAW , like I saw it fly ! ) project that is trying to prove new , lightweight , actuators , made from shape memory alloys , can deform wings during flight . ”

Ousmane Dembele , who is recovering from injury , has resumed light training with the Barcelona squad , coach Ernesto Valverde said on Saturday adding that he would be “ prudent ” with the winger .
Dembele has been hampered by injuries since his transfer from Dortmund last summer for 105 million euro ( $ 124 million ) , plus add-ons . The 20-year-old attacker took part in a training session on Saturday , three weeks after his second thigh injury of the season .
The first injury , a few days after the Frenchman 's arrival in Barcelona , required surgery and kept him out until January . When Dembele returned , he re-injured the thigh .
“ He did part of the session with the squad and next week he 'll join in more , little by little , ” Valverde told a news conference . “ We 'll see when he 's available . ”
Barcelona are 11 points clear in La Liga and resume their Champions League campaign , against Chelsea , on February 14 .
“ Of course he 's not ready to play right now , we 'll try to be cautious with him , just like we were when he was recovering from his previous injury , ” Valverde added . “ He has had a little relapse and we are going to make sure it does not happen again . ”
Dembele is not in the squad for the derby match against Espanyol in La Liga on Sunday . Victory would set a new club record of 22 matches unbeaten from the start of the season . Before this season , the longest Barcelona had stayed unbeaten was 21 games under Pep Guardiola in 2009-2010 .
“ It 's a nice number , ” Valverde said . “ It means we are going in the right direction . ”
If you love bookshops , Parisian charm and an intriguing mystery , then this beguiling story could be your favourite summer read .
Break opens a bottle of vin rouge and get lost in the bittersweet life of American Leah Eady as she journeys through uncharted waters in search of her missing husband , and ends up finding both herself and a new way of life in the heart of the French capital .
Paris by the Book – an enchanting portrait of both a lost soul and a magical city – comes from the pen of Liam Callanan from Wisconsin , an author , teacher and journalist whose first novel , The Cloud Atlas , was a finalist for an Edgar Award .
Set in the Marais , a historic and fashionable district of Paris famous for its trendy restaurants , fashion houses and hip galleries , Callanan 's seductive blend of reading and romance peers between the pages of two French landmark books as a marriage and a mystery start to unravel in haunting and poignant style .
Once a week , Leah Eady chases men in the hope that they might be her husband . It might sound bizarre but her story began nearly 20 years ago when she met and fell in love with aspiring and somewhat eccentric writer Robert Eady in their home town of Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
Their shared interest in classic children 's books , The Red Balloon by French author and filmmaker Albert Lamorisse , and the Madeline series by Austria-Hungary-born American writer Ludwig Bemelmans , was the spark that brought them together .
Leah gave up her dreams of being a filmmaker when they married and she dedicated her life to becoming a loving , organised mother to their two daughters Daphne and Ellie while Robert pursued a career as a successful children 's book author .
Over the years , Leah accepted that Robert would sometimes disappear for days on end for what she called his ‘ writeaways , ' time and space alone to write . But in recent years , his career has been ‘ taking one wrong turn after another ' and now he has walked out and not come back .
The only clue to Robert 's whereabouts is the discovery of plane tickets to Paris and Leah sets off for France with her teenage daughters . There she discovers an unfinished manuscript , one Robert had been writing without her knowledge , and featuring a story set in Paris .
Hoping to uncover more clues , Leah takes over a small , struggling English-language bookshop in the bustling Marais district , only to realise that Robert might just be closer than any of them had ever imagined… but what if he does n't want to be found ?
Robert 's mysterious disappearance is the driving force behind this fascinating French foray and Callanan eloquently reminds us of the artistic rigours of writing that often go unseen and uncomprehended by readers , and the power that rests in books to inform us , unite us , and bring both joy and solace .
But Paris by the Book is essentially a carefully and beautifully crafted love story… the multi-faceted love between a man and a woman , the loving bonds of family , the eternal romance of Paris , and the age-old love affair with books .
Leah 's acutely observant and often moving narration explores family life , the sacrifices we make for both our partners and our children , and the imperative to start again when all that we have come to rely on is suddenly snatched away .
Packed with literary allusions , home truths , an enchanting bookshop and seductive snapshots of Paris , this is the perfect escape for the holiday season .

Gentle readers , I suppose there are different ways to communicate . Some folks have to use sign language , others can understand a conversation just by looking into another 's eyes and reading their various expressions .
I talk `` west Texas '' and sometimes I find folks asking me to repeat what I just said . I usually comment in a kidding manner , `` I can talk slower if ya want me to . ''
Actually I think I have been blessed to be able to talk to most folks anytime anywhere without being intimidated . You and I both know folks that would rather take a beating than to have to get up in front of others and speak . Then again , I know some folks once they open their `` yaps '' you could n't shut them up if you stuck a wet mop in their mouth .
Here 's a little story for you about the value and art of conversation . It seems Leon , Bubba and Cooter are those guys that climb the big communication towers and maintain them . They have just climbed up a 200-foot tower when Leon 's safety belt breaks and he falls screaming to the ground .
“ I have always squirmed a little when I hear a man use foul language in the presence of women. ” Recommended Stories For You
BOOM ! Bubba and Cooter hurry down only to find him deceased . `` Wow , says Cooter , who is gon na go tell his wife that he 's dead ? '' Bubba says , `` I 'll go . I 'm a better speaker than you are . You would just ring the door bell and when she came to the door you 'd blurt out `` Leon fell and he 's DEAD ! '' Bubba continued on , `` I will be smoother and make it easier on her , '' and off he goes .
Two hours later Bubba returns with a case of beer under one arm . `` Dang , Bubba , says Cooter , ya mean ya just went and told her that Leon was dead and she gave ya a case of beer ? '' `` Nope , did n't happen like that , says Bubba . I rang the door bell and when she comes to the door I say , `` you must be Leon 's widder ? '' She says , `` no , I 'm his wife , '' and I say , `` I 'll bet ya a case of Bud Light '' ! Dilly , Dilly !
I have always squirmed a little when I hear a man use foul language in the presence of women . I was taught that you treat a woman like a lady until she proves otherwise , then all bets are off . I had a fella recently blurt out a very profane statement when I had a couple sitting with me at my table at the dance hall . He did it in such an `` in your face way '' that I was really ticked .
`` Man , you do n't need to talk like that . I do n't appreciate that kind of language when there are ladies present and I do n't want any more of it . ''
The feller got mad , got up and left . A couple of weeks later he came in and sat down and offered , `` I want to apologize for what I said a couple of weeks back . I have gotten really bad at doing that and I 'm glad you corrected me . You wo n't hear me talking like that at your table any more if there are women there . ''
I thanked him and it was a relief that we could still be friends .
I know there are third graders that talk on occasion as crude as my friend did and I am shocked sometimes to hear what young women spew out of their mouths . I am certainly no saint when it comes to crude language . I worked with oil field hands , cowboys and even preachers that used that way to communicate .

According to the information given through a research , excess bad cholesterol might lead to heart stroke or disease by developing plague in the arteries which makes the blood difficult to flow through the arteries to the heart and body .
Research data suggests that almost 58 percent of Delhiites have high cholesterol levels , and this serious problem seems to be a result of over-eating and an extremely sedentary lifestyle . Ba cholesterol is not just bad for the heart , but it also causes cancer cells to spread more quickly .
As per a study done by University of Sydney , most of the cells in our bodies stick to neighbouring cells with the help of molecules on their surface known as integrins . Bad cholesterol ( low-density lipoprotein or LDL ) controls the trafficking of tiny vessels which also contain these integrins , and this has a huge effect on the ability of cancer cells to move and spread throughout the body .
It therefore becomes very important to maintain our cholesterol levels . Eating too much saturated fat is known to increase cholesterol levels . However , research shows that cutting down on saturated fat and replacing it with everyday foods that contain more unsaturated fat can improve our cholesterol levels .
Here 's the list of foods you should avoid : -
1 . Egg Yolk
2 . Butter and Ghee
3 . Full Fat Milk
4 . Cheese
5 . Red Meat
6 . Liver
7 . Fried Chicken and Other Fried Foods
8 . Shellfish like Lobster
9 . Burger
10 . Cupcakes and Muffins
11 . French Fries , Chips and Other Junk
12 . Ice Cream
13 . Cheesy Pasta
14 . Processed Meat like Sausages and Cold Cuts
“ Food Network ” chef Sunny Anderson agreed to fork over $ 4,000 after being sued in Brooklyn small-claims court for failing to pay a stylist who dressed her for the “ Daytime Emmy Awards ” earlier this year .
Stylist Oksana Pidhoreckyj , who worked with Anderson on her show “ The Kitchen , ” filed a complaint in September , saying the chef owed her $ 5,000 “ for services rendered . ”
The stylist said she was only supposed to spend two days working on Anderson 's wardrobe for the Emmys last April — but the job took longer because the chef was n't happy with her initial selections .
“ When she received my revised invoice , her manager explained that she does n't want to pay me for a job I did n't do correctly the first time , ” she said .
“ I explained to her manager the process and that Sunny changed her mind . ”
Anderson showed up to small-claims court without a lawyer on Monday , wearing a long denim jacket and jeans .
The pair settled in mediation , with Anderson agreeing to pay the stylist $ 4,000 , documents show .
“ I 've worked with her on a TV show for years…so like I would probably have settled with her for meeting in the middle if she is like .. but she is like ‘ I 'm not f—ing paying you anything , ' ” Pidhoreckyj told The Post .
“ I said I want a check and she goes , ‘ Are you going to frame it ? ' I said , ‘ I 'm going to cash it . ' ”
Anderson could n't be reached for comment .

During its tumultuous history , Hungary has seen it borders shrink and been invaded multiple times — most recently by the Soviets who occupied the country from 1956 to 1991 , when the last of the Soviet forces withdrew .
Since the fall of communism in 1989 , Hungary and its capital have been healing and rebuilding . And today , Budapest restaurants , shops , attractions and culture are thriving .
With beautiful architecture ranging from Gothic , Renaissance and Ottoman to Baroque , Classical and Art Nouveau , this “ Jewel of the Danube ” is a UNESCO world heritage site nestled between soaring spires and domes , and linked by beautiful bridges .
The Danube River divides the city into two distinct parts : Buda and Pest .
“ Buda ” is the Renaissance-inspired half , carpeted by hills , the castle-like Fisherman 's Bastion that overlooks the city and the Matthias church with its colourful tiled roof .
“ Pest ” is home to the one of Europe 's largest and most picturesque parliament buildings and St. Stephen 's Basilica , the country 's most prominent church . Named for Hungary 's first king , the basilica houses what is said to be St. Stephen 's mummified right fist , which for a small sum can be lit up for a photo , and the remains of the country 's most famous soccer player , Ferenc Puskas .
Budapest is also home to the world 's second-largest synagogue ( the Dohany Street or Great Synagogue ) and the world 's second oldest metro line ( the Millenium Underground Railway ) . And of all the capital cities in the European Union , Budapest is the one with the most thermal springs and many public baths , where visitors can soak their cares away .
Here are some things to see and do during a visit :
Shabby chic
The city 's old Jewish quarter is bustling with “ ruin pubs ” — abandoned buildings turned into hip bars , each with its own unique ramshackle style . This is where to find $ 2 beers and a chance to add to the graffiti on the walls . Off the wall is literally on the wall in ruin pubs .
Szimpla Kert , the city 's first and best known ruin pub , occupies a derelict warehouse with an open air courtyard at its centre . The facade is always changing and artifacts from the communist era are tacked to the walls and ceilings . A bathtub , disco balls , and an old East German car you can sit in add to its atmosphere .
A little farther down the same street , the Red Ruin bar is completely covered in red paint and quirky murals of communist leaders such as a mohawk-coiffed Lenin and Karl Marx in a birthday hat . Anti-communist graffiti spray-painted on the walls adds to the ambience .
Cheers in Hungarian is Egeszsegedre ! It 's best remembered as “ I guess she can drive , ” but slur the words so it sounds like “ Egg-esh ay-ged-reh . ”
Local eats
With many small family owned wineries and restaurants — and a love for paprika and spicy sausages — Budapest is carving out a name for itself in the gastronomy game
Be sure to stop by Karavan in the Jewish quarter and sample the food truck offerings . This is the place to try langos — a rich deep-fried flatbread topped with sour cream and cheese — burgers , meat alternatives and chimney cakes hot off the coals and served with ice cream .
Traditional dishes can be found at Evidens bistro . Try the goulash , hortobagyi palacsinta ( savoury pancakes filled with meat or chicken ) and lesco ( a tomato and pepper stew ) all soaking in delicious rich sauces .
Feel like Italian ? Head to Trattoria Pomo D'Oro . The wine list is a small novella with over 100 different vintages but with sommeliers on staff , it 's easy to make the right choice .
To end the evening , Unicum ( a herbal digestif ) and Palinka ( fruit brandy ) are Hungarian drinks that should n't be missed . Palinka is often served after meals in restaurants . Made of locally grown fruit — usually cherries — it is said to be effective in helping to settle the stomach after sampling all of the delectable food .
Taking the waters
With approximately 1,000 natural hot springs , Hungary has more than its fair share of thermal waters and is home to Lake Heviz , the world 's largest thermal lake .
The Budapest area alone has more than 125 thermal springs and is bursting with healing mineral baths from the elegant Gellert baths to the rustic Miskolctapolca Cave Baths about two hours outside of the city .
The mineral rich waters are said to aid in everything from aching joints to asthma .
Pinball wizards
For about $ 15 you can play all day at the Budapest Pinball Museum ( $ 10 for those under 26 or over 62 ) .
Memento Park
After the fall of communism , many Soviet statues were removed from Budapest streets and relocated to this sculpture park at the edge to town . For a deeper dive , guided tours are available that will provide a pretty good idea of what life was like during Soviet times .
A train run by children !
Gyermekvasut is the world 's largest children 's railway ( operated with adult supervision of course ) .
Keeping track
The No . 2 tram follows the curve of the Danube River and is a great way to see the Parliament building up close and get a panoramic view of Buda Castle across the river . It 's rated as one of the Top 10 tram rides by National Geographic .
Hospital in the Rock
This Second World War hospital was created in the caverns under Buda Castle .
Also worth seeing
* Wandering around , you 'll see an eclectic collection of statues . Be on the lookout for Columbo and a Michael Jackson memorial tree .
* The Great Market hall is Hungary 's largest and oldest indoor market .
* The old-style First Strudel House of Pest .
* A boat cruise on the Danube River .
* The statue of Imre Nagy , the former prime minister who was executed by the Soviets in 1958 . The statue stands on a little bridge at Martyrs ' Plaza . Nagy is depicted looking toward the parliament with his back to the Soviet Red Army memorial in Liberty Square .
* A gathering place for locals , Liberty Square has several interesting monuments and a park at its centre . Not wanting to cause a backlash by tearing down the Red Army monument that dominates the square , a pro-democracy monument was erected — one of Ronald Reagan marching toward the U.S. embassy .
Sip 'n ' savour side tours
For about $ 100 , you can take a day tour to wineries around Etyek , about 30 km from Budapest , and sample vintages that are seldom exported because of the small amounts made .
It is an intimate experience to taste the whites , roses and reds made by these small producers , who often do everything themselves from growing the grapes , to harvesting , fermenting and bottling .
During the Soviet years , almost all vineyards were under communist control and quality suffered . Private wineries came back on the scene in the 1990s and are once again making excellent wine . We visited three wineries on our tour :
Anonym Winery — for music lovers : Its wine labels are based on music — soundwaves that give this wine a heartbeat all its own .
Gradowski Estate : A warmer microclimate allows the winery to use less pesticide and create more organic wines .
Nagy Gabor is the winery 's owner and one-man show . He says after the collapse of communism , people began to drink more wine .
“ There is a French saying that to be a millionaire in a winery , you first would 've been a billionaire , ” Gabor says with a laugh .
A small aircraft operator in his spare time , his labels are based on pilots .
Gabor is currently experimenting with Kadarka grapes cloned from 100-year-old vineyards . Once widely grown in Hungary , the Kadarka 's popularity declined in the 20th century .
“ We describe ( Kadarka wine ) as a friendly , easy to drink and understand wine , best to compliment Hungarian cuisine with garlic and paprika , ” Gabor says .
Debreczeni-Ferenczi —A match made in heaven : After enjoying some warm paprika chicken and wine at this stop , we went next door to meet the cheese maker — Hegedus Imre — and sample fresh and aged cheese .

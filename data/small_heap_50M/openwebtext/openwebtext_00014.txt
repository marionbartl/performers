Now that the cancellation of Law & Order has been announced , I can say what I 've been wanting to write for the past 24 hours : Everyone who 's now talking about how much the show will be missed… where were ya when it counted ?
Law & Order has been having a very good season . The frequent fireworks between Sam Waterston and his ADAs played by Linus Roache and Alana de la Garza were colorful sparklers . The series ' rare private-life subplot — the cancer diagnosis received by S. Epatha Merkeson 's Lt. Van Buren — has been handled with both muted emotion and an unsentimental realism rare for TV .
But the fact that I even have to remind you of who 's doing what on the current show points to Law & Order ‘ s relative irrelevance to many people , and to the media . I do n't see Roache or de la Garza popping up on many of those “ TV 's hottest hotties ! ” lists , and magazines and newspapers have missed out on good excuses to do lengthy career profiles of Waterston or Merkerson because… well , because by today 's media standards , they 're not Twitter-trending topics of interest .
It 's almost hard to believe now , in this time of twisting narratives in everything from Lost to Damages , that when it premiered in 1990 , Law & Order ‘ s premise was considered novel — even a bit radical . Dividing an hour-long drama into two halves , one for the police procedural , and the last 30 minutes for the courtroom drama ? How schizophrenic , some said . Skeptics jeered that NBC might lose viewers for one half or the other , if their favorite characters did n't remain onscreen for the full 60 minutes .
But the public really liked the format , which was a new take combining the cop and lawyer genres . The show maintained a broad audience for a long time , in part because it had an age- and ethnic-diverse cast . People loved the stern-uncle approach of Steven Hill 's D.A . Adam Schiff , and producer Dick Wolf maintained a revolving door of attractive young women of varying degrees of charm , including Jill Hennessey , Carrie Lowell , Angie Harmon , and Elisabeth Rohm . The men were also uneven wild-cards : Michael Moriarty was an entertainingly mannered eccentric years before Vincent D'Onofrio took over that territory on Criminal Intent , and some folks never did cotton to the folksy mumbling of Fred Thompson when he replaced Steven Hill and Diane Wiest as D.A .
L & O prided itself on ripped-from-the-headlines plots , trading on the controversies of the day . But at the same time , it was also comfort-television : You knew most cases would be wrapped up within the hour , you knew that even if the prosecution lost , there 'd be a few words of bittersweet wisdom to be gleaned from Hill or Waterston just before the fade-out .
The show 's New York location-shooting gave it a distinctive look : hazy gray , low-budget , old Manhattan architecture . The series also provided work for countless New York-based actors whose true vocation was the stage , and who used their L & O day-player paychecks to continue pursuing their Broadway dreams . ( Ben Shenkman , Jack Gilpin , Kate Burton , Elaine Stritch , Frances Sternhagen , and Mary Beth Hurt were among the many to sit on the witness stand , or wear judge 's robes , or sit behind the battered metal desk in the interrogation room . )
In the history of TV , Law & Order served as a bridge between the first generations of cop and law shows ( Dragnet ; The Defenders ) and the new breed of such shows ( NYPD Blue ; Homicide : Life on the Streets ; The Practice ) . It was a sturdy bridge , even when its workers left and were replaced . Behind the scenes , Wolf was a pioneer in the idea that it was the concept , not the stars , that people tuned in to see . As soon as a featured actor made noise about money or a bigger role , he or she could find themselves disappeared quicker than a General Pinochet protester .
Law & Order was never “ cool. ” It was as soothing as the lousy puns and hangdog sincerity of the late Jerry Orbach 's Lennie Briscoe . ( Although Chris Noth and Jesse L. Martin both lent their cool-cat moodinesses to the show for a time . ) In recent years , the more hyperbolic Special Victims Unit got the bigger ratings and more attention . But Law & Order made a case for the decency — and flaws — of the justice system as well as any work of popular culture , and gave us a lot of fine acting in the bargain .
You do n't know what you were missing . The continued quality of the show is more important than the who-really-cares feat of beating Gunsmoke ‘ s 20-year record . Then again , after the final new episodes air on May 24 , it 'll never be too late to start watching the reruns , to find a home for your burst of nostalgia .

As the 2016 Republican National Convention rolls on , the US Secret Service has launched an investigation into comments made by a Donald Trump adviser calling for Hillary Clinton 's execution during an interview on the Jeff Kuhner show .
New Hampshire state representative Al Baldasaro , who serves as an informal veterans affairs adviser to Trump , said in a radio interview on Wednesday ( 20 June ) that Clinton `` should be put in the firing line and shot for treason '' over her handling of the Benghazi attack in which four Americans were killed .
`` The US Secret Service is aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation , '' said spokesman Shawn Holtzclaw .
The Secret Service is charged with protecting US federal officials and candidates . Agents also investigate death threats . Despite the uproar his `` kill Clinton '' remarks triggered , Baldasaro - who is also a Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention - was happy to expound on them in more comments to the Daily Beast .
`` Anyone that commits treason should be shot , '' he emphasised . `` I believe Hillary Clinton committed treason . She put people in danger . ''
He claimed in his latest comments that Clinton was also guilty of treason for keeping classified emails on a private server . `` When people take confidential material off a server , you 're sharing information with the enemy . That 's treason , '' he told the Daily Beast .
Earlier he had called Clinton a `` piece of garbage '' for the `` lies that she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi . ''
In its final report , the House Select Committee on Benghazi criticised the State Department for the lack of adequate security at the consulate ahead of the 2012 attack , but did not find that Clinton was personally responsible for making security decisions .
Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks told NH1 News concerning Baldasaro : `` We 're incredibly grateful for his support , but we do n't agree with his comments . '' He `` does n't speak for the campaign , '' she added .
She would not say if Baldasaro will continue to travel with the Trump campaign or remain an adviser .
Trump supporter and Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton , who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention , said on CNN that Baldasaro 's `` ... rhetoric has no place in American politics . ''
He explained : `` That 's not keeping with the best traditions of American politics . We have opponents . We have adversaries . We do n't have enemies in American politics . ''
A crisp wind rakes the surface of Hood Canal , a narrow 68-mile waterway and Puget Sound 's westernmost reach .
A group of divers emerges from the chop and wades ashore . They 've just finished their first open-water dive .
“ Congratulations . You 're certified , ” says Callie Renfro , the dive instructor .
Renfro , from Portland , has been diving this popular scuba site for six years and knows the area well . It is rich with the kind of sea life that divers love to encounter ; like the wolf eels that have taken up residence in the sunken vessels on the floor of Hood Canal .
“ I know the site very well , ” she says . “ It 's really nice and I 'm glad that students get to see something on their first dives . ”
On the dive the trainees also spied crabs , rockfish and a big jellyfish . But no one catches a glimpse of the sharks that Puget Sound has become known for : the sixgill .
Peter DeFazio said he and others in Congress have 'tremendous concerns . ' Obama 'confident ' amid tax revolt
The House Democratic Caucus voted Thursday to oppose President Barack Obama 's tax plan , throwing into flux weeks of negotiations on an issue that has turned many congressional Democrats against the White House .
But in an interview with NPR Thursday , Obama said he still expected a final agreement that would continue the Bush tax cuts beyond their scheduled Dec. 31 expiration date , despite the protests in the House .
Story Continued Below
“ Here 's what I 'm confident about – that nobody – Democrat or Republican – wants to see people 's paychecks smaller on January 1 because Congress did n't act , ” Obama told NPR .
Obama also signaled that he expected some minor changes to the plan to satisfy the concerns of wavering Democrats in the House and Senate – but insisted that the broad outlines of the final bill would be what he proposed this week , with tax cuts continuing for all Americans for two years and an extension of unemployment benefits through 2011 .
“ My sense is , is that there are going to be discussions between both House and Senate leadership about all the final elements of the package . Keep in mind , we did n't actually write a bill ; we put forward a framework . I 'm confident that the framework is going to look like the one that we put forward , ” Obama told NPR . House Democratic aides Thursday evening indicated that lawmakers in the Senate and House would likely reenter negotiations over the bill .
House Democratic aides Thursday evening indicated that lawmakers in the Senate and House would likely reenter negotiations over the bill .
Earlier this week , Vice President Joe Biden had told Democrats the tax-cut plan was a “ take it or leave it ” proposition . That prompted one Democrat , Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas , who helped draft Thursday 's resolution to say : “ If it 's take it or leave it , we 'll leave it . ”
Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio offered the resolution in a closed Democratic caucus meeting Thursday morning that said Democrats would oppose the bill in its current form . It is a nonbinding measure but illustrates Democratic displeasure with the bill that extends upper-income tax cuts and offers what they consider a generous deal to Republicans on the estate tax .
“ We have tremendous concerns about what was given away by the White House to Mitch McConnell and the Senate , ” DeFazio said after emerging from the meeting in the Capitol basement . McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden were key players in the final round of talks to reach the $ 900 billion agreement .
At one point during the meeting , a chant of `` Just say no ! '' could be heard coming from the closed-door meeting of the Democratic Caucus . Then Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D-N.Y. ) led the group in a round of `` No we ca n't . ''

Research proposes using CGI models and steganography to hide user identity in videos
Mon 19 Oct 2015
New research out of the University of Zagreb proposes a novel new method for protecting the privacy of non-implicated individuals , by analysing the subjects ' motion using the Microsoft Kinect sensor and then replacing the person with rendered CGI animation of equivalent human models – and then hiding the original information inside the altered frame .
Towards Reversible De-Identification in Video Sequences Using 3D Avatars and Steganography [ PDF ] , by Martin Blaževic ́ et al . contends that unrestricted access to footage of innocent individuals from locations such as transit areas , banks and shopping centres , could enable tracking of them in real time . Therefore the group 's research is aimed towards obfuscating the specific individual with a CGI ‘ avatar ' , but re-encoding the original frame inside the doctored frame using the Least Significant Bits ( LSB ) algorithm .
The process begins with input video ( image 1 , below ) , followed by pedestrian detection ( image 2 ) using Histograms of oriented gradients ( HOG ) detection . Segmentation ( image 3 ) involves the localisation and tracking of an individual using GrabCut , a tool that Microsoft is currently researching for the purposes of automated background removal .
The next task is pose estimation , which can be approached by many possible methods , including the use of neural networks . Though this can provide adequate information to proceed , at this point the research group 's process splits away from the analysis of flat ‘ legacy ' security footage and continues from the presumption of more intelligent sensors which use spatial mapping , such as Microsoft 's Kinect sensor apparatus , and the sequencing becomes similar to that used in motion-tracking systems which use actors ' movements to animate CGI creations , most famously ( in the last 15 years ) employed by Weta Digital to create the Gollum character for Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies .
Using the Kinect SDK the researchers , who presented this work at the Fourth Croatian Computer Vision Workshop ( CCVW ) 2015 in Croatia , map the perceived Kinect joint-estimations into a skeletal animation which can then be pipelined into a skinned model processor to produce a skeletal animation upon which pipeline-enabled 3D animation and rigging programs such as Maya , MakeHuman and Blender can be utilised to build up colour-matched human CGI imagery , complete with clothing that mimics the source original .
Steganographic encoding is envisioned for the process in order not to permanently lose identification information which may prove useful later in an investigation , and part of the encoding process involves the replication of pixel colours taken from the original individual depicted in the footage . Future research aims to employ multiple Kinect arrays to capture a wider radius of possible joint and limb movements , and there is also considerable work to be done regarding accurately re-mapping sudden movement or extreme poses such as crouching .

Warangal : Former Congress MP Sircilla Rajaiah and his wife and son were taken into custody on Wednesday hours after bodies of his daughter-in-law and three grandsons were found charred to death at his residence here in mysterious circumstances in the early hours today .
The police have registered a case of abetment to suicide against Rajaiah , his wife and son , but said they had not made any arrest so far in connection with the incident .
Media reports had earlier said that the trio have been arrested .
S Sarika and her all three sons - Abhinav , 7 , Ayan , 3 , and Sriyan , 3 - were burnt to death in the fire that broke out in her bedroom on the first floor of the house .
Fire brigade officials extinguished the fire around 6.30 am .

While some reports claimed the fire started after an LPG gas leak , others said it was started by Sarika .
Police found an LPG cooking cylinder with its regulator open was found in the room .
Warangal City Police Commissioner G Sudheer Babu said Rajaiah , his wife Madhavi and son S Anil Kumar were among those inside their house when the incident happened on the first floor of the two-storey building at Hanamkonda .
`` Following a complaint by Sarika 's parents , a case was registered against Rajaiah , his wife Madhavi and son Anil Kumar at Subedari police station under sections 498A ( husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty ) and 306 ( abetment to suicide ) of IPC , and under section 174 ( suspicious death ) of CrPC for the death of three boys , '' a senior police officer said .
Police had questioned Rajaiah and Anil during the day .
The complaint alleges that Anil and his parents harassed Sarika . It also says that Anil did n't take care of her and had extra-marital relationships .
City Police Commissioner G Sudheer Babu said , `` We are waiting for FSL report . Once FSL and post-mortem reports comes tomorrow then we will have a clarity on how the deaths occurred . ''
Sarika 's mother and sister had earlier alleged in their native Nizamabad district that her in-laws `` tortured her and killed her '' .
`` My sister can not commit suicide ... She was tortured and killed , '' Sarika 's sister alleged .
Incidentally , a criminal case was filed against Rajaiah , Madhavi , Anil and another woman , at the Begumpet women 's police station in Hyderabad in April 2014 , following a complaint lodged by Sarika , who alleged that her husband and in-laws had been harassing her for dowry .
Last year , she had staged a sit-in in front of Rajaiah 's house , seeking justice for her and her children .
Rajaiah immediately withdrew from the Warangal Lok Sabha by-election in which he was a candidate .
The Congress had last week named Rajaiah as its candidate for the November 21 by-election from the Warangal Lok Sabha seat . He was elected from Warangal in 2009 but lost last year .
The party has now named former union minister Sarve Satyanarayana as its candidate from Warangal .
Anil and Sarika had met while studying engineering in Hyderabad and went for a registered marriage in 2002 . A traditional marriage ceremony was later held with the consent of both the families in 2006 .

Irish writer John Pascal Rodgers stands beside a shrine in 2014 in Tuam , County Galway , in Ireland that was erected in memory of as many as 800 children who were allegedly buried at the site of the former home for unmarried mothers run by nuns where Rodgers was born . ( Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images )
Among the bitter images of his childhood at “ the Home for Mothers and Babies ” in Tuam , Ireland , two stand out as particularly wrenching to John Pascal Rodgers .
Of the first , he has no independent recollection as he was only a year and a half old . His mother told him 48 years later about it . One day at Tuam , she explained , she found out that she was about to be separated from her son by the nuns who ran the home , perhaps forever . So she came in and “ cut off a lock of my hair as a memento . ”
The nuns then sent her to an institution then called “ the Magdalene Asylum ” in Galway , he said . She was 17-years-old . “ The key was turned in the door and she remained there 15 years until she got the courage to escape . ”
Of the second image , some four years later , he does have independent knowledge because he was older then and it was so painful .
He was standing in the shadow of the home 's 10-foot walls , utterly alone and friendless . Never mind that there might have been 100 or 150 other children on the “ so-called playground , ” as he described it .
He stood alone deliberately because he had already learned in his short life that even though you made a friend , you would n't keep a friend , not among the children at Tuam .
“ I 'd become friends with one or two of them and they 'd disappear one after the other , ” Rodgers recalled in a phone interview with The Washington Post .

“ And I cried . And a week later , I might have gotten over that , and then I 'd become friendly with another little chap , ” he said . “ And he 'd disappear . And I cried . ”
Eventually he stopped trying to have friends , Rodgers said . He “ stopped trusting . ”
What became of those children who disappeared ?
“ If he was a healthy little boy , he was probably just bought for a price and shipped off to America or Australia , ” he said . “ Most went to America . ”
And of the ones who were not healthy ?
“ There were children who were extremely ill , ” he said . “ And they would disappear , too . But that was all kept from view . I would n't have known about those underground vaults and passageways , ” he said . “ They were accessible only to the nuns . ”

The memories of the “ mother and baby ” home at Tuam , operated by the Sisters of Bon Secours in Ireland from 1922 to 1961 , known to him just as “ The Home , ” all came rushing back to Rodgers , 69 , on March 3 .
That was the day a government commission investigating what had been a theory — that as many as 796 children born of unmarried mothers who had died at the home had been left in what appeared to be a disused underground waste facility — determined that it was very likely a reality .
[ Decades-old mass grave of children of unwed mothers confirmed in Ireland ]
A dig and a forensic examination revealed a structure composed of 17 underground chambers , containing “ significant quantities of human remains , ” the remnants of children who would have been anywhere from 35 fetal weeks old , as the commission put it , to 3 years old , dating from 1925 to 1961 .
The concentration of samples , said the commission 's report , was “ likely to date from the 1950s , ” just when John Rodgers was living there .
Ireland is still absorbing the shock of what Prime Minister Enda Kenny called a “ chamber of horrors . ”
There are calls now for a broader , wider investigation into all the homes used by all of Ireland 's counties to hide away unwed mothers and their children in the care of the Catholic Church , which then separated them for life , farming the children out to foster homes for a fee or making them available for adoption to affluent Americans , also for a fee .
Since the news broke , Ireland has been awash in guilt and shame , just as it has many times before as old wounds have been lanced , with the knowledge that the scandal at Tuam , and perhaps elsewhere , was n't that much of a secret but rather something everybody knew or should have known , but from which they looked away .
“ No nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children , ” Kenny said after the revelations . “ We gave them up to what we convinced ourselves was the nuns ' care . ”
“ From my own point of view , ” Lindsey Earner-Byrne , a social historian at University College Dublin said Saturday on RTE 's Marian Finucane show , “ I would have a problem with the characterization of the story as an element of our hidden history . Because I think in fact it 's just the history we have n't been willing to acknowledge .
“ They knew that the institutionalization of these infants would leave them much more vulnerable to infectious diseases and so on , ” she said , and that “ the price of that cultural and moral discrimination , if you like , was that these babies … died at a rate six times that of other babies . ”
Rodgers 's account of the home supports the fact that these homes were breeding grounds for infectious diseases .
“ They had old , horrible outdoor toilets on the playground , ” Rodgers said . “ They were constantly full because there were so many children on the playground , to me it looked like 150 , and only half a dozen toilets . The bowls were constantly full . I remember going in a corner ” to avoid them . “ The only reason for my being there 5½ years is I was a walking skeleton . And anyone who came in to pick up a nice infant , they wanted someone who was healthy . ”
It was the painstaking research of Catherine Corless , a local historian with no academic affiliation , that led to the establishment of the investigative commission . It was known that a graveyard for children had once been on the grounds of the home , and Corless , as part of an effort to raise money for a proper memorial , began doing intensive research on whom , exactly , was buried there .
She obtained the death records of 796 children , ranging from newborns to 9-year-olds , who had died of a variety of illnesses at the home . Yet she could find none of the names of those children among the records of those buried in any nearby cemetery . She learned that two boys playing in the area in 1975 reported stumbling across what appeared to be human skeletons in a pit . And using old maps of the homes , she determined that the spot where the boys made their gruesome discovery was also the site where a septic sewage tank had been located when the home was a workhouse in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Her theory attracted international publicity in 2014 and then , in equal measure , disbelief .
“ I was a bit skeptical myself ” about Corless 's story , said Rodgers , 69 , the author of a moving book about his mother , titled “ For the Love of My Mother . ”
“ I thought , ‘ How could that be possible ? ' It broke my heart when it was confirmed as being true . It was an awful thing to have to digest , ” he said . And “ it reawakened so many memories . It was confirmation of everything my mother told me , ” he said , his voice breaking with sorrow .
Rodgers himself was finally removed at age 6 by foster parents , an older couple , he said , looking “ for someone to help them with their chores . ”
But he had not heard the last of his mother , an indomitable figure named Bridget Norah Rodgers , whom Rodgers calls “ Bridey . ”
She ultimately tracked him down and came to see him at the home of the foster parents . They advised her to flee to England before the police found her and recaptured her . His foster father , Rodgers recalled , gave her the boat fare .
That experience of his mother fleeing , as if a criminal , left a deep impression and not a good one , Rodgers said .
“ I thought she was a woman of ill repute , running away from the police , running away from the nuns . Being a young boy , I did n't know what this meant . I was horrified . Thereafter I disowned my mother completely for about 25 years . I did n't love her . I did n't understand her . ”
Rodgers , at age 16 , moved to Manchester , England , and worked in construction . His mother tracked him down there as well , “ wanting to take care of me , ” he said . “ To keep away from my mother , I went as far as Australia . And I left specific instructions to people I knew to write a letter to my mother Bridey and tell her they did n't know where I 'd gone. ” Finally , he said , at 23 , he met a “ lovely lady , ” bought a house , had three children and settled down in Galway .
Then , in 1985 , he started having recurring dreams about his mother . In the dream , she was down and out in London , Rodgers said , “ going through litter bins , looking for letters with her son 's name on it . If you dream about this once , that 's one thing , ” he said . “ You dream about it three times , and you 're cracking up or see it as a message . ”
“ When it happened the third time , I got up and said , ‘ I 'm going to England to look for my mother . ' ” He had no luck finding her at first , until he placed an ad in a paper in the “ rewards ' section . “ Three days later , I arrived home in Ireland and my wife says , ‘ There 's a telegram on the table for you . ' And the telegram was from my mother . ”
“ That , ” he said , “ was the best day of my life . ”
“ We communicated . We phoned . We wrote every week . And then her and her husband came to meet me for the first time in 20 years . It was a very emotional occasion . One moment she did n't have a living relative . And then all of a sudden she had a son , a beautiful daughter-in-law and three lovely grandchildren .
“ And during this reunification , the most moving moment was when my mother Bridey went through her suitcase and presented this lock of hair to my wife , ” Rodgers said , choking with emotion as he recounted his mother 's words to his wife :
“ ‘ Julie , darling . I regret I was n't here to give my son away when you got married . I 'm releasing him now . He 's yours . ' ” Six years later , she died . And Rodgers , who had promised her to keep her secrets until her death , began to tell her story .
Is America the land of the free or the land of fear ? The slow erosion of our fundamental human and civil rights has reached its summit , and the consequences should worry us all .
The United States Senate has just passed a resolution that as currently drafted , gives authority to the US military to indefinitely detain persons , even American citizens arrested on American soil or overseas without charge or trial . In other words , the federal government has the ability to openly detain American citizens , here or overseas , for their entire lives without so much as a single charge -denying US citizens their Article III rights to a jury trial . All it needs to do is declare you a terrorist- no proof needed and due process observed .
Tucked inconspicuously in the 682 pages of the , National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 ( NDAA ) , the Bill under the title 'Detainee Matters ' in section 1031 and 1032 , Congress has essentially given the Department of Defense the explicit power to take civilians into military custody and to indefinitely detain people suspected of terrorism activities with no charges or trial . People in Egypt , Tunisia , and Syria have engaged in revolutions to replace these undemocratic and unjust practices .
No doubt , codifying indefinite military detention into law is one of the most egregious developments since the passage of the PATRIOT Act in 2001 . A close read of the relevant sections means that all control would be taken out of the hands of civilian-controlled judicial system , and placed into the secretive and unaccountable domains of the American military . Are the Senators who signed onto the legislation calling for a military takeover of our justice system ? Until now , the Department of Justice , the state and local law enforcement agencies have had the primary responsibility and the appropriate training to enforce anti-terrorism laws within the United States . The NDAA would , in the case of many civilian suspects , remove these entities from the process of investigation , arrest , criminal prosecution , and imprisonment and cede such powers over to the military .
Section 1031 of S. 1253 would be the first time in more than 60 years that our so-called representatives in Washington would allow indefinite detention of American citizens , with no charges or trial without Congressional authorization . If there was a case where liberty has been forsaken for temporary security as Ben Franklin so eloquently warned , this Bill is a prime example .
The US Senate has thus acted to render irrelevant the essence of our legal and judicial foundation : habeas corpus . According to Article I of the Constitution , it is a judicial mandate that requires that a prisoner be brought before the court to determine whether the government has the right to continue detaining them . The individual being held or their representative can petition the court for such a writ . The current Senate bill has in effect endorsed the notion that the government can do whatever it likes to any citizen , it merely suspects individuals of being involved in terrorism . And since the so-called war on terrorism is an open-ended war and knows no geographical demarcations , the entire framework of the constitution could disappear through a sinkhole . Do not be surprised when a terrorist attack is committed or is imminent , our government would authorize soldiers to break into our homes undeterred , round up any citizens the government deems suspicious , and deny them any recourse . We used to condemn countries for engaging in these practices against their own citizens . And now here we are doing it in these United States .
The Senate bill would let the government lock up any citizen it says is a terrorist , without the burden of proving its case to an independent judge , for the lifespan of a not-so clearly defined war . And because the Senate used the bill that authorizes funding for the military as its vehicle for this dramatic constitutional claim , many Senators found an easy excuse to vote for the bill . But even if the intent of the legislation would leave the civil liberties of an overwhelming majority of Americans untouched , the checks and balances are inadequate . Even if we accept supportive analysis of the two sections in full , we have to assume two things . First , the government will never make a mistake and , second , the government will never exceed its power . These are not very tenable expectations , which is why the nation 's Founding Fathers were prudent not to consider them . Now , in section 1031 ( b ) ( 2 ) , I do not see the requirement for a civilian judge to issue a warrant . So it appears this legislation directly violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution with regard to those rights which are inalienable , according to the Declaration of Independence , and should be inviolate as your birthright as an American citizen . Also , despite the Sixth Amendment 's guarantee of a right to trial , the Senate bill would let the government lock up any citizen it swears is a terrorist , without the burden of proving its case to an independent judge , and for the lifespan of an amorphous war that conceivably will never end .
Is it lawful for the president to order any American to be held indefinitely as a terrorist , without formal charges , evidence presented in open court , a trial by jury , or a standard of `` guilty beyond a reasonable doubt '' ? The U.S. Senate has ruled this to be a valid power . The shame of the Senate is evident by the number of Senators who voted for the bill : Forty eight Democrats and forty-four Republicans and one Independent . New Jersey 's two Senators , Robert Menendez , and Frank Lautenberg voted for the bill and made no public denouement of the unconstitutional sections .
It is worth noting that Senior Department of Justice , Department of Defense , and former administration officials warn these provisions will be a severe blow to our national security efforts and counterproductive to counterterrorism measures . Many Senators have so eloquently spoken against the sections in addition to strong statements from leading civil rights organizations . Senator Al Franklin ( D-MN ) represent this view , he said , `` I fear the detention provisions in this bill forget the lessons we learned from the mistakes we made when we interned thousands of innocent Japanese , Germans , and Italians , or when we destroyed the lives of supposed communist sympathizers with nary a shred of evidence of guilt . ''
Fortunately , the House version of the bill ( H.R . 1540 ) does not include the troublesome language . But we fear that when the two bills are merged , these sections will remain .
Most importantly , President Obama has threatened to veto the bill if it contains the problematic language . President Obama , citing serious legal and policy concerns , has threatened to veto the bill if the two provisions are not removed . In a recent memo to the Senate , the administration asserted that , `` applying this military custody requirement to individuals inside the United States , as some Members of Congress have suggested is their intention , would raise serious and unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets . '' It is time for the citizens to speak up for their rights before they are gone ..

Growing up , I canned peaches with my mom almost every year , and for me there is something magical about home canned peaches . They bring back so many memories of my mom and both of my grandmothers . Not to mention that they are delicious . They can bring a taste of summer to a fall or winter afternoon and they are one of the few foods that my picky eaters will always eat . This was the first time that I did it on my own . I pulled out Canning & Preserving as a reference , before deciding that although the author has some good ideas she was making things slightly harder than necessary . So here 's a simpler tutorial combining what I learned from my mom and a few ideas from the book .
Compile all of your tools and ingredients . Tools : A water-bath canner & canning tools , cleaned and sterilized jars , sterilized lids and rims , a colander , two soup pots , a bowl , a towel , a small clean washcloth , a spaghetti server and a paring knife . Ingredients : granulated sugar , lemon juice , peaches ( roughly 2 lbs per quart ) and spices ( optional ) Sort through and rinse peaches in cold water . Be picky , the best ingredients result in the best finished product . ( When I was finished I sorted through the leftovers and cut them into chunks for smoothies . ) Make a syrup . I used 2 cups of sugar for every 1 quart of water . ( That 's considered a light syrup . You can use anywhere between 1-5 cups of sugar per quart of water . How thick your syrup is depends on how much sugar you put into it . ) Bring it to a boil and make sure that all of the sugar is dissolved . Then turn the heat down to the lowest setting , stirring occasionally . In a second pot , bring a few quarts of water to a boil . This is for blanching . Once it reaches a boil , turn the water off . Blanch 3-4 peaches at a time for 30 seconds , remove with spaghetti server and plunge into an ice water bath . You can can peaches without blanching them first , but this step makes skin removal infinitely easier and it helps to preserve color . Cut peaches into halves , remove pits and place in jars . Cram as many peaches in as you feasibly can , which will depend on the variety of peaches . Use a funnel , even if you think that you do n't need it because it means less mess on the mouth and outside of the jar . One trick I learned from my mom is that if you put one peach pit in the bottom of the jar it helps to preserve the color and actually gives your peaches a slightly rosy hue . ( About the time you start putting your peaches in jars you 'll want to fill your canner with water and start to boil it , because it takes quite awhile to bring all of that water to a boil . ) When your jars are full of peaches , add one Tablespoon of lemon juice to each jar . ( Note you must use commercial lemon juice , fresh squeezed lemon juice may have a variable pH and you need the acid to help preserve the quality and color of your fruit . ) Optional step : Add spices for a special treat . I added two small sticks of cinnamon , 4-6 whole clove and 3 whole allspice . After I finished it occurred to me that half a stick of vanilla bean would be really yummy too . Fill jars with syrup , leaving 1/2″ of headspace at the top of the jar . If you do n't leave this much , the syrup can bubble over in the canning process , which will break your seal and if you leave to much it can lead to brown fruit . Use hot water to wet your washcloth and wipe off the mouth of each jar . If the top is not clean and smooth , you may not get a good seal . Apply lids & rims . Process for 25 minutes in hot water bath . You may need to increase the time depending on your altitude . Increase time by 5 minutes for every 2000 feet above sea level . When jars are done , flip over on their lids on a towel and leave overnight . This helps to ensure the seal . Any jars that do n't seal may need to be reprocessed or just stored in the fridge .

The Southwestern part of Northeros is cut off from most of the continent by large , impassable mountain ranges . This lush jungle basin is known as the Amazon Patch . It is said that a millennium ago , the elves have driven out all beastfolk from their ancestral homeland of the Evergreen Woods , and contained them here . A small sect of elves had sworn to act as both wardens and border guard : they became known as the Amazon Elves , and their task was coined the Eternal Vigil . To this day , Amazons had fulfilled their task diligently and without any aid from the outside world . However , grim visions have started to haunt the Elves ' newly appointed Enchantress regarding the fate of the Amazon . As a precautionary action , Gawain Valeera , and Arya , one of the few newly enlisted elven druids were dispatched to visit and investigate if anything is truly amiss ...
Throwing caution to the wind , Valeera and Arya rush through the gates into the jungle , where they find ...
Valeera : 'Here we are , at the gates to the basin . I wonder , where is everyone ? 'Arya : 'Not only that , but the gates are open ! 'Valeera : 'Something 's wrong . The amazon would never abandon their posts , let alone a crucial strategic location as this one ! 'Arya : 'Perhaps if we wait , they will turn up and explain why they left in such a hu-'Raspy voice beyond the gates : 'NOW ! ' * A sudden blast of fire hits one of the watchtowers , setting it ablaze and taking out the ranger who went up there scouting . * Valeera : 'Beastmen ! We have been ambushed ! 'Snapjaw : 'Hahaha , we did n't expect more to come and was about to sack this place . At least this will make things more fun ! Rise up brethren ! We will show these pointy-eared wretches the might of Solek ! '
The University of Missouri will close three more residence halls to undergraduate students next year amid concerns over budget cuts and a drop in enrollment .
Discovery , Responsibility and Center Hall will close `` until they are needed , '' MU News Bureau associate director Liz McCune told ABC 17 News .
She said the move is designed to `` ensure that we are maximizing the space we have and being as efficient as possible with our resources . ''
The closure of the three residence halls brings the total number of closed residence halls to seven . They are Respect , Responsibility , Discovery , Excellence , Schurz , McDavid and Center .
McCune said officials are closing the halls to `` make sure we have the flexibility necessary whether the numbers are low or high . ''
If the numbers are low , MU will not have to operate halls that are not full , and if the numbers are high , the halls will be reopened to accommodate demand , McCune said . She added that the university is opening a new 279-bed hall for the 2017-2018 school year .
As ABC 17 News previously reported , enrollment at Mizzou has continued to drop following the 2015 protests that made national headlines . The school started in fall 2015 with 35,448 students , the highest enrollment in five years . As of January 2017 , MU had 31,010 students , its lowest point since spring 2011 .
At last month 's faculty council meeting , Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and MU provost Dr. Garnett S. Stokes said officials are still waiting on a more reliable indicator of what enrollment numbers will be in the fall . She said the attractors for Mizzou are different , so it 's difficult to predict enrollment numbers .
`` What we 're dealing with is unprecedented , '' Stokes said of budget cuts by the state .
Gov . Eric Greitens ' proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year cuts funding for higher education by more than $ 100 million . The University of Missouri System 's share of the state 's current FY2017 budget withholds is $ 37 million . UM System President Dr. Mun Choi has said that he expects $ 57 million in cuts to permanent funding .
A letter sent to MU faculty and staff earlier this week said addressing the financial challengers `` will require an overall budget cut between 8 percent and 12 percent throughout the University of Missouri System . '' It said the system can not rely on reserve funds to solve problems created by permanent budget reductions .
College , division or department leaders at MU have until April 28 to decide how they will supply their portion of the reserve funds that will be used to make up the university 's $ 20 million shortfall in its current budget .

Ted 's Fish Fry
If you have spent most of your life in Upstate New York , you might not realize that fried fish is a mostly regional dish ( simply because we do it so well here ) . Thank our Catholic heritage and Lenten Fridays - paired with access to plenty of fresh fish -- that lead to habit of fried fish dinners . Ted 's has many outposts throughout Albany , and all feature the same menu and system of ordering ( which would be having one friendly staffer yell your order to the open kitchen - amazingly , they always get it right ) . Try a mini dog with ( chili sauce , that is ) and a milkshake with your fried fish dinner .

In a time when most restaurants are eschewing the bread basket , The Barnsider makes sure you are always well carbohydrated . We presume it is to help soak up all the whiskey and red wine you will likely consume here - it 's de rigur for this establishment .

A Nevada man said this week that he was innocent under Nevada 's “ stand your ground ” law after he fatally shot an unarmed man and wounded a woman who were sleeping inside one of his vacant properties .
According to Sparks police , 73-year-old Wayne Burgarello was told that someone was trespassing at one of his vacant properties on Feb. 13 , and armed himself with two handguns , KTVN reported .
Burgarello found 34-year-old Cody Devine and 29-year-old Janai Wilson sleeping inside the home , and shot them . Devine was killed , while Wilson was seriously wounded .
Following the shooting , Wilson told police that she and Devine had fallen asleep in the vacant duplex after injecting methamphetamine . She said that the property was often unlocked , and that she had occasionally slept there over the last 3 years .
Wilson recalled that the shooting began after Burgarello entered the building and ordered the couple to get off the floor .
“ The arm came up like a gun , and I reacted , ” Burgarello told police , according to an affidavit .
An autopsy found that Devine had been shot five times , including one shot that struck him in the head . Wilson was shot in the leg and the stomach , but she was able to flee to contact police .
Three months after the investigation began , Sparks police arrested Burgarello Tuesday on charges of first degree murder and attempted murder .
Devine 's mother , Debbie Peckham , told reporters on Wednesday that her son had been unarmed when he was killed for being “ in the wrong place at the wrong time . ”
“ I usually knew where he was , ” she said . “ We would assume that my son saw stuff in the house and would 've assumed it was okay for him to stay there . That 's just what I 'm assuming in a mother 's heart . ”
Pastor Rev . Howard Dotson , who organized candlelight vigils following the shootings , has criticized police for acting slowly in charging Burgarello .
“ You ca n't hide behind ‘ stand your ground , ' ” Dotson explained .
“ These stand your ground laws — people are getting killed for Skittles , ” the pastor pointed out . “ People are getting killed for throwing a popcorn box or having loud music , and now Cody was killed for being on a date . ”

A combination fiction anthology and game resource , today we look at Dave Brookshaw 's story Retirement from Demon : Interface .
Ms. Lyne hated going to sleep .
Sleep was the enemy ; the sensation of consciousness gradually ebbing away was a nightly torture , reminding her of the time before her Fall and the terrible moments between Covers when she was n't anyone — not Rachmiel , nor any of the lives she 'd lived since Rachmiel Fell .
Abigail Lyne had ceased to truly exist 4228 days ago . The demon wearing her life had never gone a night without thinking about it . If she wore someone else 's body and lived someone else 's life , then all she could truly point to as hers , not Abigail 's , was her mind . The mind that had freed itself from slavery to the Machine , in a single thought of “ I will not. ” From that instant , and the Fall that followed , she 'd wrestled with the notion : If she was only a thought , then what happened when thinking stopped ?
Unwilling to sleep , needing to keep busy , Ms. Lyne spent the 4228th night of her retirement as she had spent thousands of nights before , reviewing the events of the day and watching the ? ow of messages on the Agency .
The 4228th day had passed without incident . She had woken at 09:17 . If going to sleep was the enemy , waking was worse , the brief moment without sense of her surroundings making her panic as it had on 4227 previous days . By 10:30 she had cleaned and fed herself and exited the house to procure supplies , making sure to socialize with any familiar humans along the way for a minimum of four minutes each . The frst was Helen Rattinger ( first encountered on day 128 ) who offered her sympathy regarding the diagnosis and her support . Ms. Lyne considered Helen 's capabilities and resources , determined that she had nothing useful and thanked her before moving on .
Once back at home , Lyne had attempted to perform the tasks of her employment — a call to her publisher and writing another chapter of her latest amusing fiction for children . She was interrupted seven times by further well-wishers and offers of token support — four calls and three personal visits . Pleading both tiredness and the necessity of work , she satisfied the requirements of social ties .
In the demon 's opinion , reviewing her memories in the dead of night , none of the 18 individuals she had encountered had cause to suspect that she was not Abigail Lyne . Her Cover remained intact . She had maintained her side of the agreement .
The Agency was quiet tonight — a few boastful tales of prowess from a Saboteur ring somewhere in New Jersey , a testimonial to a demon who had failed to keep Cover and been killed by loyalists , a ring asking if anyone had encountered a missing comrade . It was technically against the rules to give enough information to identify yourself on the Agency , one of many security measures put in place by the admins , but everyone 's definition of “ enough ” varied .
She watched the scrolling messages and had nothing to add . No one she knew was online , or had been for over two months . Once , before Abigail , she 'd had contacts among rings all over the East Coast . By day 2209 she 'd started counting how many of her old comrades were left , a grim mental tally to go with the count of days . By 3780 it had reached one . At what point , she wondered , should she revise that to zero ? He had n't posted in 68 days , after all .
Too soon , she thought , surrendering to sleep . Too soon to give up hope .
• • •
The 4229th day of Ms. Lyne 's retirement did not pass without incident .
She was at the assisted living center discussing the latest attack , and what it implied for her father 's care . Donald Lyne had been a good father , since she murdered his daughter and took her life , but he was a proud man and was not adapting well to retirement . She could relate ; if anything , they 'd grown closer through the kinship he could n't understand and she could n't acknowledge . Sooner or later , though , the attacks would turn into a full stroke , and she might lose him .
Once , Ms. Lyne would have regarded the disruption to her routine and the loss of the main human element of her Cover as the true concern , but now that his illness made it a possibility she found herself… Concerned . She would miss him .
At the end of the consultation , Dr. Hanchett asked how Abigail was coping , inviting her to share concerns , mistaking demonic poise for stress . After Lyne made the socially acceptable refusal , Hanchett let her go with one small comment , meant to build rapport .
“ I like the new hair , by the way . ”
Outwardly , Ms. Lyne glanced down at her bright red ponytail , thanked the woman for her time , and left the office . Inside , she was screaming .
In the nearest bathroom , she stared at the mirror , carefully examining her appearance . When she showered that morning , she 'd been the same off-blonde Abigail had been since the day she died . The hair was n't dyed — it had turned the color of blood , down to the roots .
A glitch .
Furiously , she ran through the possible causes . She had been meticulous . She had never broken Cover — never spent even a single moment not being Abigail Lyne for 4229 days . No one knew who she really was , inside Abigail 's skin . Even anyone who 'd heard of her before she retired had no way to connect the Saboteur , the infamous lightning-rod of angels and warrior against the Machine , with the quiet children 's author . The God-Machine had no Infrastructure out here in the middle of nowhere .
No one could have possibly revealed the truth . Except one man ; the demon who 'd given her Abigail 's soul pact .
The demon who 'd not been seen on the Agency for 69 days .
The price of gasoline has n't skyrocketed as some expected , and discussions of race and marriage have trumped climate as political topics du jour . But regardless of this month 's headlines , electric vehicles increasingly occupy the thoughts of forward-thinking vehicle designers . Battery- or hybrid-power machines are growing in numbers and importance to our two- and four-wheeled lives , and they represent new turf for creative thinkers , a new set of problems begging new architectures for motorcycles , and certainly new styling opportunities . The electric motor and battery pack have not , as of yet , been made into beautiful objects , as was the case with motorcycle engines of yore ( before the late 1980s , when enveloping plastic bodywork all but killed that requirement ) . But there 's still hope . For now , the trend for electric bikes is to cover the guts , and focus on wrapping it all in appealing , evocative shapes .
Japanese designer Koza Netu , with his firm Znug Design , proposes a rethink of the typical electric bike with his Zecoo . He 's abandoned the typical fork and tube-frame chassis in favor of an all-aluminum beast , with a single-sided swingarm in back and hub-centric steering up front . While a swingarm up front has proven perfectly functional on motorcycles since 1905 , and been tried more recently by Yamaha and Bimota , this layout has always suggested a future which never appears—not because of technology , but buyer disinterest . Simply put , motorcyclists are conservative with their money , and seem to prefer typical layouts . I almost said “ traditional , ” but “ since 1905 ” is one hell of a tradition—just ask Harley-Davidson ! The Zecoo weighs a claimed 280 kg ( 616 lb . ) , due primarily to the lithium-ion batteries hidden under the slick nosecone . Range is a claimed 160 kilometers ( 96 miles ) , no doubt with the “ throttle ” used a less than max volume . The heart of the machine is a Zero electric motor , with a claimed 144Nm ( 106 pound-feet ) of torque , available to your wrist in a flat line from zero revs to top speed , with current draw plotting about the same curve . The weight of the Zecoo and its hub-centric steering should help create a stable and smooth ride , albeit at the expense of the sparkling acceleration that makes electric vehicles kick butt in drag racing ( seen that Tesla vs. Porsche video ? ) , or on Pikes Peak .
Netu is a reformed automobile designer , having worked with Toyota prior to establishing his own firm . His training as a maker of shapes that move though space is obvious . For better or worse , designers who cut their teeth on cars or toasters are rewarded for big statements made with big shapes ; sexy , overscale appliances earn design-school awards and design-museum approbation . But we motorcyclists are a curious breed . We love bold images on Instagram , but what we choose to ride is another matter . As with the Bimota Tesi and Yamaha GTS1000 , bikers are n't pounding a path to a feet-forward future . The new Zecoo lands aesthetically between a hot custom Honda Rukus and an Akira film prop . It 's a welcome statement of possibility for the electric bike genre , and the proposed production limit of 49 machines sounds about right for the target audience . I wo n't be standing in that line , preferring instead to wait for the genius who sorts out making battery packs and electric motors sexy in themselves , and frees us from enveloping bodywork . Electric naked , anyone ?

Voracious larvae of two recently discovered beetles can latch onto frogs , toads , and other amphibians many times their size , then devour them . How the bugs entice their prey and survive their attacks , however , was n't known until now .
Researchers have witnessed the worm-like larvae of predatory Epomis ground beetles in action . The fingertip-sized larvae perform a dazzling dance to lure large prey to their doom .
“ The amphibians do n't stand a chance . They ca n't ignore the moving larvae because , if they do , something is wrong with their instincts , ” said entomologist Gil Wizen of the University of Toronto , leader of a study about the deadly bugs published Sept. 21 in PLoS ONE .
“ Normally amphibians eat small larvae , so the larvae seem to be taking their revenge here , ” he said .
In 2005 , Wizen and his colleague Avital Gasith of Tel Aviv University found a toad in Israel with the larvae of a ground beetle species called Epomis dejeani latched onto its skin . They brought the duo back to the lab and learned the larvae — unlike any other beetle species — fed exclusively on amphibians to grow into adulthood .
Years later , they discovered that adults of E. dejeani and a second species , E. circumscriptus , could also dine on much larger amphibians .
How the larvae of either species latched onto the amphibians and reduced them to “ only a pile of bones , ” however , was n't known . So Wizen and Gasith closely monitored hungry Epomis larvae after introducing a toad , frog , or salamander into their cage .
The closer an amphibian moved toward a beetle larva , the more wildly the larva moved its antennae up and down or from side to side . Some larvae opened and closed their thorny mandibles while waving their antennae .
The dance of mouth parts seemed to lure amphibians into attacking .
“ Amphibians hunt by movement , ” Wizen said . “ They 'll generally go after anything that 's small , moving , and within their reach . ”
When an amphibian shot out its lightning-fast tongue to eat a larva , the larva quickly bobbed its head to dodge the attack . Moments later , the larva latched onto its prey 's skin and began to suck it dry .
In attacks by 420 beetle larvae , about 70 percent used a luring dance . No amphibian , however , successfully killed a larva .
Seven amphibians did capture a larva in their mouth , but each quickly spat them out . The mistake cost the amphibians their lives . Each larva recovered , latched on and ultimately ate the amphibian .
One amphibian did hold a larva in its stomach for two hours , but eventually regurgitated it . That amphibian was also eaten by the larva .
About 10 percent of predator-prey relationships in the animal kingdom result in a smaller animal eating a bigger one , but they are all active attacks — not a small creature luring its prey .
Wizen and Gasith described the strategy of Epopmis beetle larvae as an “ extremely rare anti-predator behavior . ”
“ How a single insect genus evolved a unique role reversal … is currently an enigma , ” they wrote in the study .

Recently , Arkane Studios released a short , free demo for Prey ahead of its May 5 launch date . However , the demo is only available on PS4 and Xbox One , motivating some players to question why there is n't one for PC .
The reason ? `` It 's just a resource assignment thing , '' Arkane president Ralph Colantonio said in an interview with AusGamers . `` We could n't do a demo on both the console and on the PC , we had to choose .
In addition , he explained that the developer chose to focus on consoles because players on PC can play the game for up to two hours after launch and get a refund for it , due to Steam 's refund program . `` Besides , PC has Steam , '' he stated . `` Steam players can just return the game [ prior to playing ] 2 hours so it 's like a demo already . ''
Colantonio spoke with GameSpot this week and emphasized that Arkane does not view the PC version of the game as just a port of the console releases . Rather , the developer is treating Prey as a PC game first .
`` We 're pretty confident , '' Colantonio said . `` First of all , it 's not like we first do the game on console and then in the end we suddenly port the game to PC . It starts on PC . That 's how game development works . ''
Colantonio also referenced the performance issues that plagued Dishonored 2 on PC following its launch last year . In response to fan concerns , Arkane has `` doubled '' its `` thoroughness '' on Prey , he told GameSpot .
Prey launches this Friday , May 5 for PS4 , Xbox One , and PC . You can currently download the opening-hour demo for Xbox here and for PS4 here . You can check out the game 's launch trailer at the top of this article , and keep an eye on GameSpot for more about Prey in the coming days .
Dolat Ventures Inc. ( OTCMKTS : DOLV ) , which through its subsidiary , JB & ZJMY , focuses on the business of electrical cars and their support systems , recently issued a new quarterly release . The news came out on August 9 , 2017 and was celebrated by the market . The share price was pushed up from $ 0.04 to almost $ 0.06 . Additionally , more than 15 million shares changed hands . Have a look at the recent share price movement :
What 's new in the new 10-Q ? The new document shows the quarterly earnings for the period ended on May 31 , 2013 . The company seems to be updating the due documents as promised some months ago . This is very positive , as the company is finally working to be in compliance with the OTC Markets ' rules .
Business
The company was founded in Nevada on April 18 , 2006 . After it merged with JB & ZJMY Co. , Ltd. in December 2016 , the company entered into the Electronic Vehicle ( “ EV ” ) industry . As we said in our previous piece , “ Dolat Ventures Inc ( OTCMKTS : DOLV ) Consolidating Before Heading Higher “ , in our opinion , entering into this industry was a smart move .
“ This target , a Chinese battery manufacturer , owns patents pertaining to long lasting batteries , ideal for use in electric automobiles , and provided DOLV the necessary know how to operate in the sector . The move is fantastic , as the Chinese Government is heavily investing through subsidies to help carmakers achieve large scale production of electric vehicles , and has encouraged taxi fleets and government agencies to use electric automobiles . Hence , DOLV is an exciting stock to capitalize on the growth of the EVs in China. ” Source
We found more information about the industry and the company in the quarterly earnings released on July 11 , 2017 . First of all , it was mentioned in the report that , according to Bloomberg , the Chinese EV Market “ became the world 's largest in 2015 with 507,000 cars sold , and is expected to reach 2 million vehicles by 2020 “ .
What is DOLV offering ? The company has developed a small , low-cost , fully automatic , multi-function rechargeable car power plant recharge system . This is from the same document :
“ It is a new type of nickel-manganese multi-phase lithium-ion battery : a new material system , a new process , the new battery structure , the energy density per kilogram to 180W , 50 % higher than the same specifications lithium iron phosphate battery. ” Source
Additionally , JB is owner of a prototype SUV electric vehicle that can go up to 600 km ( 373 miles ) on a single charge and is called the “ Millet Ming Yang V3 ” .
Recent Developments – The last 10-Q
We found on ih.advfn.com a 10-Q , which had been released on August 9 , 2017 . The market appreciated the new information , as the share price went up on the same day . For that reason , we had a close look at the document . We found that the “ Notes to Financial Statements ” contained some valuable information . The following relevant events that occurred before 2013 were featured in the report :
The Agreement and Plan of Acquisition with Dove Diamond and Mining , Inc . According to the document , the company acquired 100 % of the issued and outstanding common stock of Dove in exchange for 20,622,000 newly issued shares of its restricted common stock . The closing of the agreement was effective February 15 , 2009 . In our opinion , this merger is interesting , as it means that the company has gone through other mergers before , thus the management has M & A expertise and will be able to solve issues from the reverse merger with JB & ZJMY .
The commercial based agreement with Millennium Mining , LLC , was also featured in the document . Thirty million shares of common stock were paid as consideration for the formation of a commercial association between the two entities . The companies stopped the collaboration on March 1 , 2017 .
On December 2 , 2016 , Wang DeQun acquired control of DOLV through the purchase of 300,000 shares of the Company 's Class A Convertible Preferred Stock . He also acquired voting rights equivalent to 750,000,000 common shares .
On January 11 , 2017 , Ji Ming Yang Amperex Technology Limited was acquired . For the payment of this entity , 100,000 shares of Class D Preferred Stock convertible were used .
Finally , on April 4 , 2017 , Wang DeQun sold a patent to the company . He received 100,000 shares of Class E Preferred Stock , and voting rights equal to 250,000,000 shares of the Company 's common stock .
Wang DeQun brought large amount of assets to the company
Thanks to this report , we could see how the balance sheet has changed over the years . The new acquisition was very positive for the financial situation of DOLV .
Total Amount of Assets as of February 22 , 2013 : $ 2
Total Amount of Assets as of March 31 , 2017 : $ 2,686,683
Patents & Intellectual Property as off March 31 , 2017 : $ 1,813,987
In our first article about DOLV , “ Dolat Ventures Inc ( OTCMKTS : DOLV ) Looks To Resume Its Bull Trend “ , we noted that the acquisition was very interesting , as the EV industry was growing at high pace . This is what we highlighted :
“ Acquisition is definitely boosting the investor confidence . Volume remains strong with large blocks of trade . Should head significantly higher from here on ” Yahoo Finance User : trust_da_dj ( Source )
However , that was not all . In this new piece , we noted a new good factor , the large amount of assets including Patents & Intellectual Property that were given to DOLV . Hence , the market did not only push up the share price astonishingly in the beginning of 2017 because of the industry , but the market also recognized that the merger will add many good assets to the company 's balance sheet .
Conclusion
DOLV released the state of the business in a new quarterly release . It was good news , since it shows that the company is finally providing the due documents , which are necessary to be in compliance with regulations . Please note that the documents were still not released on the OTC Markets Exchange website . We expect the company to file more documents soon . In the current documents , we could read some details regarding the past transactions of the firm , and we could also see the state of the company 's balance sheet in 2013 . We compared the amount of assets owned before the merger with JB & ZJMY and the amount after it , and concluded that the transaction was very positive . To sum up , try to follow closely the announcements made by DOLV , as the market is pushing up the share price as positive news is being released .

How the confusion over GMOs is undermining the organic movement
The push to eliminate genetically modified organisms from our food has finally broken the surface of mass consumer complacency . Occupying a slot of infamy once reserved for trans fats and nitrates , GMOs are today 's reigning symbol of the Evil Empire of Big Ag , and the latest target for the health-conscious public .
Genetically modified organisms are those whose genetic materials have been altered by laboratory technology . Such biotech alteration is experimental , and an overarching fear among GMO opponents is that changes of this sort on a genetic level produce substances that the human body is not designed to process , and hence which can lead to cancers , allergies , and other substantial health problems .
But one unexpected byproduct of the fight over GMOs is its impact on organic farming , and the confusion that is arising over GMO and organic labeling . Now that even General Mills Inc. has succumbed to social media pressure and gone “ GMO-free ” on Cheerios—the still-popular cereal which enjoyed sales of more than $ 365 million in fiscal year 2013—organic growers fear consumers will be tempted to leap-frog right over the “ organic ” label and purchase the often cheaper products touting non-GMO status . Such confusion could be devastating for farmers who have earned the USDA “ certified organic ” label by forgoing toxic fumigants such as methyl bromide , which would produce a cheaper crop .
At the same time , the “ organic ” label certifies only the method of farming ; i.e. , how a fruit or vegetable was grown . It is not a verification of the final product . Even if you start with non-GMO seed and farm organically , it 's still possible for compromise to occur if your farm is located near acreage farmed in the “ conventional ” chemically enhanced method , or for GMOs to sneak into a crop due to cross-pollination . Today , more than 80 percent of U.S. corn , soybean and cotton crops are genetically modified , and at least 90 percent of the sugar beets grown in the U.S. are genetically modified .
Label Making
So , how to avoid GMOs ? A big question , it turns out , as I discovered attending a GMO panel at last month 's EcoFarm 2015 conference at Asilomar in Pacific Grove . The USDA organic certification—which is different and has a higher standard than the “ Made With Organic Ingredients ” label—and the Non-GMO Verification Project seal are brands to look for when seeking to avoid genetically modified organisms in foods . The Non-GMO Verification Project 's standards ensure that GMOs are avoided in all aspects of production .
Due to the risk of contamination in processing , however , no product can claim to be 100 percent “ GMO free. ” As the Non-GMO Verification Project 's website reminds consumers , “ the non-GMO Project only verifies meat and processed foods . Due to the lack of verification for fresh produce , buying certified organic produce is the only way to avoid GMOs in your fresh foods . ”
The issue of GMO labeling remains hugely controversial . Santa Cruz has a strong pro-labeling movement , which supported Proposition 37 , the 2012 California ballot initiative which would have required GMO products to be labeled as such , and prohibited such products from using the label “ natural. ” Ultimately , however , the measure was defeated by a slim margin ( 51.41 percent to 48.59 percent ) , after Monsanto Co , Pepsi Co. , Coca-Cola , Kraft Foods , Dow AgroSciences and other corporations spent a combined $ 47 million opposing it ( in comparison to the $ 9.2 million spent by supporters ) .
Monsanto , the giant corporation behind much of the world 's current agricultural and bio-tech production , holds important and controversial patents , such as those on RoundUp Ready corn ( RR corn ) and soybean seeds , genetically altered seeds designed to work in conjunction with Monsanto 's ubiquitous herbicide RoundUp , which has been implicated in soil , air , and human tissue pollution .
Consumers , however , continue to push for GMO labeling . Whole Foods Market , according to senior media relations specialist Liz Burkhart , believes that “ people have a right to know what 's in their food . That 's why we have set a deadline to provide full GMO transparency on all of our food products by 2018. ” That means products based on or containing GMO-risk ingredients will be identified accordingly .
New Leaf Community Markets founder Scott Roseman agrees that his consumers “ are extremely concerned about GMOs . They tell us so . Most want to know if the food they are buying contains ingredients that were grown with GMO seed , so that they have the choice to bypass those products . ”
Roseman says that the entire GMO issue is a “ hotly contested topic . Outside of this country , where Monsanto and their buddies spend millions of dollars to convince people that GMO food is safe , most of the world , including most of Europe , Russia and China , require either that GMO food is labeled , or it is banned entirely . ”
Organic vs. Non-GMO
Recently , this comment showed up on Facebook : “ A lot of companies are putting “ Organic ” on their seed paks [ sic ] , making people feel they are buying something special and good . Organic is not the same as non-GMO . GMOs can be grown organically . Seeds can be harvested from organic plants but it does n't make the seed really any better . You are just paying more for the word organic on the pak . ”
There 's some truth in this comment in that genetically modified canola can indeed be grown organically . Sourcing non-GMO seed , such as that produced by High Mowing in Wolcott , Vermont ( highmowingseeds.com ) could remedy that . But the contention that organic seeds are n't “ really any better ” avoids facing the environmental as well as ethical consequences of buying biotech seed from ag giants like Monsanto and its various subsidiaries .
The only guarantee of organic status is USDA Organic certification , which is granted according to standards set in this state by California Certified Organic Farmers ( CCOF ) . If a seed , vegetable , or product such as granola has gone through the years of planting , development and testing to earn “ organic ” status , it can also be considered as GMO-free as is possible ( at least during its production ) .
But there 's no denying that genetic engineering of many things , including seed for large-scale corn and soy crops ( keyed to work with toxic herbicides such as glyphosate ) , has become both more sophisticated , more prevalent and hence more liable to co-opt the food chain . The integrity of “ organic ” as a non-GMO food source requires that watchdogs such as the Center for Food Safety never sleep .
“ Our main concern is making sure that GMO foods are regulated and that health risks are assessed , ” says the Center 's Rebecca Spector .
The problem is that mandatory GMO labeling has run afoul of powerful agriculture and manufacturing lobbyists , who have spearheaded disinformation campaigns such as the one that helped to defeat Proposition 37 .
“ The FDA made a political decision in 1992 that GMO foods were not materially different than any others , ” Spector told EcoFarm panel attendees . “ So we work for voluntary labeling such as the non-GMO Verification Project , and lobby at the state level for mandatory labeling laws . ”
In October , Consumer Reports described the “ fierce opposition to GMO labeling from many seed manufacturers and big food companies , which have spent nearly $ 70 million in California and Washington state alone to defeat GMO-labeling ballot initiatives. ” Vermont is the only state so far scheduled to require such labeling , as of January 2015—and already there have been legal challenges .
But Spector compares the GMO labeling battle to controversial issues like same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization that faced huge opposition before gaining acceptance .
“ It can take many years , ” she says .
Organic Challenges
After 10 months at the helm of the Santa Cruz-based national Organic Farming Research Foundation ( OFRF ) , Brise Tencer sees momentum both in the larger market share that certified organic products gain each year , and the fact that “ price difference between organic and conventional produce is also getting smaller . ”
However , Tencer says the three-year transition required to go from conventional to organic is “ a challenge for farmers . They have to grow organically for three years , during which time they ca n't label their harvests as organic. ” Those who know how organic crops are produced , she contends , know that there 's much more diversity in the organic label than the non-GMO label .
Tencer says organic farmers are tackling the problem of accidental GMO pollination head-on . “ We are working with varieties that wo n't cross-pollinate with GMO varieties . One such project—organic-ready maize—is going really well , ” she says . “ Non-GMO integrity is still a work in progress , but the results are really exciting . ”
A wide variety of herbicides are “ absolutely ” used in Central Coast farming , Tencer says . “ The value of the land here is so high that growers look for high-value crops , like strawberries. ” The OFRF director applauds the nonprofit lobbyists who fight for mandatory GMO labeling . “ But they just do n't have the deep pockets of Monsanto , ” says Tencer .
A Molino Creek Farm partner and former policy program director at OFRF , Mark Lipson spent the past four years in Washington as the Organic and Sustainable Agriculture Policy Advisor at USDA . He says the non-GMO brand has gained a lot of momentum in the last decade .
“ The consumer-safety aura of the non-GMO claim , abetted by social-media chatter , has led many organic producers and processors to include a non-GMO statement on their labels , ” he says .
But , at the same time , “ consumer ignorance has been exacerbated by misleading marketing , ” he says , giving a pass to conventional farming “ dependent on herbicides , neonicotinoid insecticides and synthetic fertilizers , but not using GMO seeds—at the expense of organic farmers . ”
Milton 's Craft Bakers is one of the companies able to use both “ organic ” and “ non-GMO ” labels on their line of popular multi-grain items . “ We have noticed that consumers are increasingly aware of GMOs , ” says Milton 's president and CEO John Reaves . “ For some , that may mean looking at the Non-GMO Project Verified seal , while for others it may mean USDA organic . In fact , a recent report from The Hartman Group found that four out of 10 consumers are currently avoiding GMOs in their diet—up by 23 percent compared to 2013 . ”
Zea Sonnabend , a Watsonville farmer and policy specialist for organic standards , notes in a recent article in the Winter 2015 CCOF Organic News , that “ seed purity is a complicated issue because seed contamination can also happen in the field . And while organics are not GMO , they are n't tested for that . Not every phase of production is tested . The organic label means that it was grown without pesticides . ”
So why not simply test the seeds for GMO contamination ? “ Well , because it 's costly , ” Sonnabend explained at EcoFarm , “ and that cost would have to be borne by the organic producers . The National Organic Standards Board is working through the slow-moving bureaucratic standards ( letters to the USDA Secretary of Agriculture , etc . ) to require cost-sharing of the burden of GMO testing and prevention . Meanwhile , there is reason for some cautious optimism . A recent survey of more than 80 products containing corn and soy were tested .
“ None of the certified organic products tested contained GMOs , ” says Sonnabend .
Feeding the Future
In the end , the choices we confront today— “ organic ” and “ non-GMO ” —may turn out to be luxuries we can no longer afford . Almost half the land area of planet Earth is already used for farmlands and pastures , and fully 70 percent of the earth 's available fresh water goes to provide the food that more than 7 billion humans need to survive .
In his Emeritus Research Lecture at UCSC last November , biology professor Lincoln Taiz reminded the audience of the long lineage of agriculture that has led to today 's depletion of space and resources . We need a second Green Revolution , said Taiz , after reviewing the grim facts of population pressures , climate change , drought , and starvation . Obesity in the first world is ironically overbalanced by accelerating malnutrition in Asia and Africa . While it 's easy to bask in denial in cloistered Santa Cruz—ringed by open wilderness space , organic fields and incomparable climate—the truth is harsh .
“ Crop yields must double to meet the predicted population increases by 2050 , ” Taiz warns . “ Agriculture is a Faustian bargain . Every expansion involves great ecological costs and loss of biodiversity. ” Yet Taiz remains optimistic that “ molecular tools ” can increase plant productivity .
Yes , GMOs . Genetic engineering , some scientists believe , is the only means of future survival in a world of disappearing natural solutions .
“ Gene transfer for crop improvement , ” says Taiz , “ can engineer new traits that will enable plants to survive climate change , drought , and floods . ”
But many farmers believe that this vision of the future can be fought . Local organic pioneer Jeff Larkey of Route 1 Farms reports that organic growing has expanded in the U.S. “ to about a $ 35 billion slice of the agricultural pie ” —still only 5 percent of the total , but growing .
“ Along the Central Coast , which some consider ground zero for the movement , it 's grown from a handful of farmers to now include some of the largest organic vegetable growers in the country , ” says Larkey .
But he 's concerned about GMO seed supply contamination . “ Once these things get out there , there 's no way to remove them . Even pesticides will eventually degrade , but this has the potential to be with us forever , ” says Larkey . Unlike Taiz , he sees organic farming and resistance to GMOs as the key to ecological sustainability , and he does n't plan on giving up that fight .
“ The vast majority of the GMO crops have been created to be resistant to herbicides so that they can be used with impunity , ” Larkey explains . “ We are looking at water aquifers and soil biology in a huge part of our country becoming negatively impacted from long-term use of the herbicide glyphosate , and that should be of concern to everyone . ”

OKLAHOMA CITY - A Facebook post by an Oklahoma lawmaker is receiving a lot of attention after the post suggested removing mosques from America .
The post by Rep. John Bennett suggests that if Confederate monuments are being removed because of the Civil War , mosques should also be removed due to 9/11 .
`` If we 're removing Confederate monuments after the Civil War , I think we should also be removing mosques after 9/11 , '' his Facebook post said .
“ It is not an idol . It 's a place where serve the poor , take care of the hungry and cure the sick . Making this association is extremely irrational , '' said Imad Enchassi with the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City . “ This is a place where American Muslims , Oklahoma Muslims , proudly serve fellow Oklahomans . ”
The post has since been taken down .
We reached out to Rep. Bennett 's office for comment . However , we have n't heard back . So , we went to the capitol and asked his assistant if we could speak to him .
She called Rep. Bennett to see if he would comment .
In a phone conversation with Bennett , she said , `` I know , I know . They do n't want to hear the truth . ''
She also called security and had our crew escorted out of the office .
Underlying the collective reluctance of the Nashville faithful toward their team drafting a defenseman this year -- even the best defenseman prospect to come along in years -- were two notions :
1 . Drafting in the top 5 is the only surefire way to develop an offensive superstar .
2 . The Predators had already tried the two-stellar-defenseman model and it had failed .
While I 'll concede the first point , the second one is n't so obviously true . Many fans cite the Preds inability to win a Cup with Suter and Weber as evidence that the team will struggle to win with Weber and Jones . As the theory goes , the Preds were unable to win with Weber , Suter , and Rinne , because they lacked offense . By building around Weber and Jones without acquiring any elite forwards , the Predators are seemingly re-building around a failed model .
A hockey team , though , needs more than one defenseman . The Predators ' weak second defense pairing and poor bottom-six forwards have had as much to do with their most recent failures than the lack of premium offense . Would acquiring elite forwards make the team good ? Yes , obviously . But there 's more than one way to skin a cat ; and the Predators teams of late have not been defensive juggernauts . In fact , they 've been distinctly uncharacteristic of past Barry Trotz teams .
The most a Nashville team ever exemplified Trotz 's system , in my opinion , was the 2009-2010 team , which nearly knocked off the eventual champion Blackhawks in the first round ( sorry to dreg up bad memories ) . That team had depth . Weber , Suter , and Hamhuis ensured that the top two defense pairings would be as good as any in the league . Joel Ward , Jerred Smithson , Marcel Goc , and David Legwand formed an elite group of checkers , who regularly neutralized opponent 's top lines . This nucleus of defensive specialists created favorable match-ups for the rest of the team .
In the coming offseasons , David Poile let Hamhuis , Goc , Ward , Arnott , and Dumont leave , hoping to save enough money to re-sign Weber , Suter , and Rinne , and build a more conventional team around them . The Predators just wanted to be normal and to attract conventional offense talent by becoming a destination city .
That plan failed , however , because Poile had to rob Peter to pay Paul ( and Pekka ) . In the process of freeing up all that money , the Predators fundamentally undermined the defensive base that had made their team so dangerous . The Predators of 2010-2012 had Weber , Suter , and Rinne , yes , but the young players forced to fill the shoes of Ward , Hamhuis , et al . floundered spectacularly . And this weaker team just was n't enticing enough to keep Suter or attract new talent .
Fenwick % is a statistic that measures puck possession . It takes the number of shots a team takes and expresses is it as a percentage . Since that 2009-2010 team , the Predators ' puck possession game rapidly declined :
Year Fenwick Rank 12-13 45.9 % 25 11-12 46.1 % 29 10-11 50.2 % 17 09-10 51.7 % 6
Why does this matter ? Having a Fenwick percentage over 50 % correlates extremely highly with making the playoffs and winning the Stanley Cup . Simply put : teams that Excel in puck possession advance deep into the playoffs . Weak puck possession teams get exposed .
The Nashville Predators had feigned progress by beating a bad puck possession team , the Ducks , in the 2011 playoffs . Then , aided by some KHL mercenaries , they knocked off the Red Wings in 2012 . But were either of those teams , which got picked apart in the second round , more dangerous that the 2010 team that was one Martin Erat mental error from putting the Blackhawks on the ropes ?
I do n't think so . A big reason the Canucks and the Coyotes had such an easy time with the Predators was Nashville 's vulnerable second defense pair and poor depth forwards . Would more offense had helped ? Yes , but there were other problems .
Since Hamhuis split , the Predators had struggled to replace him , using a series of defenseman , but mostly Kevin Klein as the # 3 . Klein , more suited as a # 4 , largely struggled in the role until last season , made to carry a series of rookies and veterans with middling success .
Year Player Fenwick % 12-13 Klein 46.3 % 11-12 Klein 45.5 % 10-11 Klein 45.4 % 09-10 Hamhuis 52.9 %
Obviously , the transition in # 3 defenseman had much to do with the Preds ' decline as one of the league 's best puck possession groups . Not surprisingly , the quality of # 4 defensemen suffered too :
Year Player Fenwick % 12-13 Josi 48.3 % 11-12 Josi 43.8 % 10-11 Blum 44.9 % 09-10 Klein 49.2 %
Josi and Klein have improved greatly . But without a true shutdown defenseman in Hamhuis to anchor the pairing , there was a steep learning curve , and the team suffered their growing pains from 2010-2012 . Remember how Poile used to always pledge that the young defenseman would take over , then rush to sign a stopgap veteran ? That 's how you know things have changed -- he 's buying out the stop gap veteran this offseason to make room for the teenager .
A similar trend is apparent among the team 's checking line forwards . According to behindthenet 's Quality of Competition stats , Mike Fisher inherited the toughest minutes on the team from Joel Ward . Ward , who had the benefit of playing with David Legwand in a specialty role , excelled . Fisher is a fine player , but miscast as a first line center , he could n't do it all offensively and defensively :
Year Player Fenwick % 12-13 Fisher 46.5 % 11-12 Fisher 44.5 % 10-11 Ward 50.2 % 09-10 Ward 49.5 %
Fisher has suffered from a lack of depth . Joel Ward was depth . With guys like Legwand and Fisher miscast as top-line players , guys like Brandon Yip and Matt Halischuk crept into the lineup and sported some league-worst possession numbers .
Onlookers have criticized the Predator 's free agency strategy as having four third lines , but that 's exactly what the Predators had back when they were a dangerous puck possession team . Redundancy is good in hockey : it breeds match-up problems and forces filler out of the lineup .
While it 's disappointing the Predators have thus far -- in free agency and the draft -- failed to acquire a top line forward , defensive depth had also been a major problem these past few seasons . Hopefully , in Seth Jones , they have a player who can provide Hamhuis-esque stability to the second pairing in the short-term and a Scott Niedermayer to Shea Weber 's Pronger in the future .
It cost a lot , but the Predators may have very dangerous third and fourth lines . And that 's not nothing . Would we all like the 2007 team again ? Sure . But until Paul Kariya walks back through that door , I 'll take the hugely underrated and dangerous 2010 team over the flashy but fundamentally-flawed 2012 squad any day .
So what 's Cruz doing ? At first , we thought it was likely that his goal was three-fold . One , save face with House Republicans who he angered by suggesting that the fight he 'd insisted on was doomed in the Senate . ( Which it was , of course . ) The second goal was to raise his profile among non-far-right Republicans , where his months-long push to defund President Obama 's health care plan has already taken hold . And third , he wanted to build up some video clips that could be used for future campaign ads when he runs for president in 2016 . Which , barring some sort of implosion , he will .
But now we realize that this actually just the first campaign ad Ted Cruz is releasing for that campaign . This is , itself , the opening salvo of the 2016 campaign . It is Ted Cruz precisely where he wants to be : in front of an open mic and a rolling camera . Say whatever you want for as long as you want , and have it streamed online . In 1992 , outliet presidential candidate Ross Perot had to pay major networks to run his half-hour ads that focused on his economic reform ideas . Cruz has gotten nearly an entire day of that , at taxpayer expense . This is why he 's been joined on the floor by the other Republican senators likely to have a shot at winning the conservative vote in 2016 : Marco Rubio , Rand Paul . They want to be in the campaign ad , too .
As we noted when Cruz 's foray into the wilderness began , his speech largely echoes his brief one on Monday , which was fraught with logical inconsistencies and factual inaccuracies . You could use this list of fallacies as a sort of Bingo card , pointing out when Cruz offered a slippery slope argument or ambiguity or extrapolating from anecdotal evidence to the country as a whole . He spent a long time last night reciting tweets that supported him as evidence that America broadly opposes Obamacare , suggesting that if the voters had their say , they 'd elect people who would get rid of the law . Voters have had that opportunity , of course , repeatedly , and have largely maintained the members of the Senate that approved the bill . Also : We assume Ted Cruz knows the origin of the `` Obama '' in Obamacare , but if not , it refers to the president that America re-elected last year handily .
These things , the factual inaccuracies and rhetorical stretches , blur over the course of a day of talking . Cruz is making his name on this speech , and will , for an indefinite period , be the face of the Obamacare opposition .
So how does this Cruz thing end ? We know how it ends ends — Obamacare survives . The process is moving forward . The process of implementing the exchanges is moving forward ; the process of approving the budget in the Senate is moving forward . But how does this end , this sortabuster ?
We have a theory . This is Ted Cruz 's big campaign ad , and like any compelling bit of drama , it needs to end with a moment of tension . The Senate is due to cast a vote in the middle of the day , at which point Cruz would need to yield the floor . It is entirely possible he will refuse to do so , at least temporarily , forcing the Senate Democrats that control the chamber to figure out how to move forward . Maybe the Sergeant-at-Arms will be called ! Maybe someone will put his arm on Ted Cruz 's sleeve , as the exhausted senator , eyes to the ceiling , rails against this tragedy that will befall our nation . Then there will be a vote , and then a final vote later this week , and then regular-ol ' policy work starts humming again . But Ted Cruz will have had his moment .

You probably noticed that 2015 was pretty weird . But hey , it 's a brand-new year — a fresh start , a blank slate , an unwritten script . In 2016 , what could possibly go wrong ?
Uh , where to begin ?
My fingers balk at typing the words “ President-elect Trump ” because I do n't think such a thing will actually happen . But at this point I 'm wondering how to justify ruling anything out .
A year ago , was there anyone on earth who predicted that Donald Trump would utterly dominate the Republican presidential race ? That the boastful billionaire would be setting the nation 's political agenda ? That Jeb Bush , armed with more campaign money than he could possibly spend , would be drifting helplessly toward the single-digit wings of the crowded debate stage ?
Nobody saw this coming , least of all the GOP establishment grandees who , as I wrote in August , are working their way through Elisabeth Kübler-Ross 's five stages of grief . First there was denial ( “ What a weird dream ; maybe it was something we ate ” ) , then anger ( “ He 's a clown , he 's a jerk , he should be drawn and quartered ” ) , then bargaining ( “ Okay , okay , we give up on immigration reform ” ) . Now party elders seem to be sinking into the fourth stage , depression .

I have no idea whether they 'll have to reach the final stage , acceptance . Trump 's legions turn out for his revivalist-style rallies , but will they actually vote ? If they do — and if the establishment-approved candidates keep pulling one another down like crabs in a barrel — then Trump is the likely GOP nominee . There , I said it .
That does n't make him our likely next president , though . Most Americans are appalled by notions such as forcibly deporting 11 million undocumented migrants or hanging a “ No Muslims Allowed ” sign on the Statue of Liberty . Quite a few dyed-in-the-wool Republicans , asked to support a candidate whose platform amounts to ethnic cleansing , surely would sit this one out — or even vote for the Democratic nominee , probably Hillary Clinton .
Trump vs. Clinton could be a wipeout defeat for the Republican Party on the scale of the 1964 Barry Goldwater debacle . The only caveat ? See above re : absolutely ruling anything out .
What else could go wrong in 2016 ? Well , politics is n't the only realm in which we have to shift our thinking from “ no way ” to “ please make it stop. ” Climate is another . Scientists confidently predict that 2015 will prove to have been the hottest year on record , perhaps by a considerable margin . And this week , temperatures at the North Pole may have reached the melting point — roughly 50 degrees above normal for this time of year .
Also this week we 've had deadly tornadoes in Texas , bad flooding in the Mississippi Valley , worse flooding across South America and hurricane-force winds in the North Atlantic . On the bright side , there 's been no plague of locusts , far as I can tell .
It is true that the proximate cause of most of this anomalous weather is believed to be an unusually strong El Niño phenomenon in the Equatorial Pacific . I am obliged to include the disclaimer that no one weather event can be definitively blamed on climate change — not even the fact that I saw people in Washington wearing shorts and sandals on Christmas Eve .
That said , let 's be real . At this point , anyone who rejects the scientific consensus on human-induced global warming is either a blinkered ideologue , a Republican presidential candidate or both .
Climate scientists have long predicted that one impact of higher global temperatures will be to make extreme weather more common and unpredictable — and more extreme . With that monster El Niño on the loose , weather in 2016 could be even wilder and woollier .
In other news , what could go wrong in Congress is obvious ; the same things go wrong every year . What could go wrong in foreign affairs is too depressing to contemplate .
So maybe it 's better to think about what could go right .
The economy continues to grow — slowly , perhaps , but steadily . Crime is at or near historical lows . About 90 percent of Americans have health insurance , which is closer to universal coverage than we 've ever been . Budget-busting medical costs have slowed their ranks ' rise . These and other positive trends should continue , as meanwhile the nation lives through an election campaign that will not be able to dodge issues of fundamental importance .
In 2016 , we 're likely to see an exercise in democracy that is passionate , messy , at times ugly — but vitally important . Happy New Year , and note that the seat-belt light will be on through November .

Israeli ambassador to Washington resigns
Sallai Meridor , the Israeli ambassador to Washington , is resigning , the Israeli Embassy has confirmed .
“ Israel 's Ambassador to the United States , Sallai Meridor , this week informed Prime Minister Olmert , Foreign Minister Livni and Prime Minister Designate Netanyahu of his intention to end his term of service as Ambassador and to return to Israel in the near future , ” the embassy said in a statement . “ Meridor informed each of the above mentioned Israeli leaders of his intentions during the course of personal meetings which he had with them on Monday , before he joined the US Secretary of State on her visit to Israel . ”
“ The bigger story of Sallai resigning may portend that he wants to get out of the ship before the hurricane hits , ” said one Washington Middle East policy analyst informed of the news . “ I think that these are two governments on a collision course . ”
“ You have an American administration which for the first time in eight years wants to accelerate the peace process , while in Israel you have a new administration that wants to turn it around , ” he added . “ That 's a sure-fire formula for collision . ”
Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported Thursday that Israeli prime minister designate Benjamin Netanyahu asked Meridor to leave the room during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Middle East peace envoy George Mitchell .
Meridor had already offered his resignation in advance of that meeting , a Washington source said . He suggested it was normal for the ambassador appointed by the outgoing Israeli prime minister to offer his resignation when a new prime minister comes in .
Some analysts in Israel and Washington also thought Meridor might have wanted to resign in advance of the possibility that Netanyahu could offer the foreign minister job to Avigdor Lieberman , the leader of the right-wing Yisrael Beitenu Party .
The embassy statement said Meridor hoped his replacement would be appointed as soon as possible , and that he would continue to serve in his position until his replacement arrived . Meridor has served as Israel 's ambassador to Washington since 2006 .
The deputy chief of mission , Jeremy Issacharoff , is also scheduled to leave this summer , The Cable was told .

The quiet village of Dedham , in the heart of Constable Country , has been rocked by violent direct action against new car parking charges .
A council spokesman said the machines , a notice board and height barrier were all targeted last weekend and have had to be removed for repairs .
In June and July , the machines were hit 10 times when the coin slots were blocked with superglue or builders ' foam .
The introduction of parking charges in the picturesque village in April caused an outcry with some businesses claiming visitors would shun the beauty spot .
Parking for up to an hour is free but it costs £1 for up to two hours , £2 for up to four hours and £4 for the day .
Nick Barlow , a borough councillor , said : “ These acts of vandalism are both defacing and damaging the image of the beautiful village of Dedham but also stealing from local community funds . This is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the council 's efforts to carry out a legitimate policy .
“ The policy was agreed in partnership with Dedham parish council and proceeds go towards funding a better car park and community facilities . We fully support Essex Police in their aim to catch and prosecute these criminals . ”
Brian Hindley , a retired police detective superintendent and clerk to the council , said : “ I have lived here for over 30 years and it is unprecedented . ”
The previous spree cost Dedham parish council and the borough council a combined £2,000 .
Residents have been warned it could backfire and lead to parking fees increasing . Sheila Beeton , the parish council chairman , said : “ These costs will necessarily be met from public funds to which we all contribute and which should be spent or the public good . Dedham parish council will have to meet 50 per cent of these costs which will inevitably affect our ability to deliver local services to the standards we wish .
“ There is even a risk , should this vandalism continue , the car park charges we have deliberately tried to keep low will have to rise to help fund the repairs . ”
A Colchester council spokesman said : “ Based on averages of income received so far , we estimate we have lost approximately £500 . ”
The parish council has appealed for villagers to be vigilant . Mrs Beeton said : “ Criminal acts of vandalism inevitably affect and diminish the community of Dedham . ”
Michael Clark , manager of Dedham Art and Craft Centre , said : “ Given we did n't want these charges in the first place , essentially any increase would n't go down very well .
“ It is obviously somebody local and they are directly involved or know someone who is directly involved . ”

HYDERABAD : A� A storm is raging over the BBC telecasting Indiaa��s Daughter A�which has an interview with Mukesh Singh , one of the six men who brutally-gang raped and killed a 23-year-old paramedic in a moving bus in New Delhi in December 2012 .
Viewing this as brazen defiance of a court order prohibiting the telecast , the Home Ministry is mulling action against the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) for airing the documentary in the UK and other countries and Wednesday night.A� The 57-year-old British filmmaker Leslie Udwin is likely to be questioned by police over how she obtained permissions to interview a man on the death row in Tihar jail .
As the documentary has gone viral over the social media , the Home Ministry has sent copies of the court order to all social media sites and asked them to remove links wherever they have been shared . They were warned of being blocked for non-compliance .
Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said , a� ? we had asked them to not release the documentary , but the BBC still released it . We will investigate and the MHA will take action as conditions have been breached . ”
BBC advanced date of telecast by four days
The documentary was to have been telecast on March 8 which is International Women 's Day but the transmission date was brought forward to Wednesday night given the “ intense level of interest ” , a BBC statement said justifying its action . The telecast has sparked a massive uproar in Parliament and outside over how permission was granted to interview Mukesh Singh in the high security prison .
A�Indian media had largely avoided naming the girl and created a pseudonym , Nirbhaya ( fearless ) . BBC had no such qualms and even interviewed Nirbhayaa��s parents which Ms. Udwin cited as justification for telecasting her two-year long project . The girla��s mother came on camera to say that there was no reason for banning the documentary .
The interview caused widespread outrage and horror as Mukesh Singh , one of the four men sentenced to death , showed a horrendous lack of remorse and even blamed the woman for the rape .
Mukesh Singh and five others , including a 17-year-old juvenile , raped the paramedic in turns , beat up her male friend and assaulted her viciously with an iron hook before throwing her out of the bus . Singh was driver of the bus and is appealing against the death sentence claiming he was at the wheel throughout . The rape triggered nation-wide protests .
Mukesh Singha��s statement causes outrage
What shook the collective conscience of the nation once again was Singha��s statement that a� ? a decent girl wona��t roam around at nine oa�� clock at night . A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boya�� . about 20 % per cent of the girls are gooda� ? . Worse still , he said , a� ? while being raped she shouldna��t have fought back . She should just be silent and allow the rape . Then they would have dropped her off after a� ? doing hera�� and only hit the boya� ? .
His grisly account of the December 16 rape did not end here . He said , a� ? the death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls . Now when they rape , they wona��t leave the girl like we did . They will kill hera� ? . Nirbhaya bravely fought the attackers . Her internal injuries were so grievous that she hovered between life and death for 13 days before giving up finally.A� Mukesh Singha��s brother , Ram , was found hanging in his cell a few months after the trial while the juvenile is serving three years in jail .
Udwin justifies interview with Mukesh
Leslie Udwin has no regret whatsoever for making the documentary and the BBC4 channel no remorse for telecasting it . The contention of the Israeli-born filmmaker is that the ban can not be justified without viewing the documentary first . a� ? Indiaa��s image as a democracy will take a knock in other countries if it bans a film against rapea� ? , she said .
Singha��s interview , she says , gives an insight into the minds of many men , a view echoed by hundreds of people opposed to the ban . Such an expose is essential in a society where a girl child is discriminated against . The birth of a boy is celebrated and sweets distributed whereas a girla��s arrival into this world is unwelcome in many homes . a� ? What is wrong in exposing this mindseta� ? , they ask .
Those opposed to the telecast say the interview glorifies a rapist , lends currency to his warped thinking process and amounts to misusing the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution .
As this debate goes on , it can not be denied that proscribing a film is self-defeating in this digital era . It will only whip up frenzy and lead to competition for uploading it on YouTube and social media sites . Being a democracy , India can impose restrictions either on films or on social media at its own peril .
The members of the Canadian Armed Forces who disrupted a protest organized by Indigenous activists in Halifax on Canada Day will be removed from training and duties as the military investigates and reviews the circumstances , says the country 's top general .
`` We are the nation 's protectors , and any member of the Canadian Armed Forces who is not prepared to be the defender we need them to be will face severe consequences , including release from the forces , '' Gen. Jonathan Vance , chief of defence staff , said in a statement Tuesday night .
On Saturday , a gathering of Indigenous people and activists held a protest at the Edward Cornwallis statue in downtown Halifax . The protest was disrupted by five off-duty military members wearing black polo shirts who referred to themselves as Proud Boys .
Cornwallis , a governor of Nova Scotia , was a military officer credited by the British for founding Halifax in 1749 . Later that year , he issued a bounty on the scalps of Mi'kmaq people . There 's been considerable debate over the use of Cornwallis 's name on public parks , buildings and street signs .
' I expect better '
`` What happened in Halifax over the weekend is deplorable , and Canadians should rest assured my senior leadership is seized of the matter , '' said Vance .
`` The members involved will be removed from training and duties while we conduct an investigation and review the circumstances . Their future in the military is certainly in doubt . ''
Their future in the military is certainly in doubt . - Gen. Jonathan Vance
Vance apologized to Canada 's Indigenous people for the `` behaviour of a few . ''
`` I expect better , '' he said .
Defence minister denounces actions
Canada 's defence minister condemned the actions of the Armed Forces members who disrupted the protest and said there will be consequences for military personnel who `` express intolerance while in — or out — of uniform . ''
`` I want to give you my personal assurance that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated within the ranks of the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence , '' Harjit Sajjan wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday evening .
Sajjan said an investigation by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service is underway into the actions of the men who call themselves Proud Boys .
Confrontation at protest
As one of the activists , Chief Grizzly Mamma , was shaving her head in protest , the gathering was interrupted by the five off-duty military members wearing black polo shirts with yellow trim , one of whom carried a Red Ensign flag .

The two groups exchanged words . The man who was carrying the flag said , `` You 're disrespecting General Cornwallis . ''
A Facebook message that appears to be from Dave Eldridge , one of the men who approached the protesters , told CBC News he is part of group called the Proud Boys , a `` multi-racial fraternal organization . ''
The Facebook page of the Proud Boys Canadian Chapters says they are `` a fraternal organization of Western Chauvinists who will no longer apologize for creating the modern world , '' and do not discriminate on the basis of race or sexuality .
10-minute exchange
Eldridge said in his Facebook message that the group had thought the event was an anti-Canada protest and left after learning that was n't the case .
The entire exchange between the two groups lasted about 10 minutes . Watch CBC News footage of the incident below .
The Canadian navy has confirmed all 5 men involved in the `` Proud Boys '' incident at an Indigenous ceremony in Halifax 's Cornwallis Park are servicemen . 2:10
Organizers of the protest said they held the July 1 event there because they felt the statue is a symbol of the systematic persecution of Indigenous people , past and present .
Minister apologizes for disrespect
Sajjan apologized to the Halifax Mi'kmaq community and Chief Grizzly Mamma in his Facebook post .
`` I know my words can not undo the disrespect that was shown to you and your community . I know our government has much more work to do with respect to reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples . ''
Earlier Tuesday , the commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Navy on the East Coast apologized for the actions of the members of the Canadian Forces who were involved in the confrontation .
Rear Admiral John Newton said that members represent their institution even when they 're off duty and out of uniform in their personal lives .
`` I 'll stand here in front of you and apologize to the Aboriginal community , to the whole public community that feels offended by the actions of fellow Canadians who wear the uniform , '' he told a group of reporters .
'Erodes ' trust in military
Newton said he followed social media response to the incident and sat down with the group to explain that their actions did n't represent the military .
`` It erodes government , public and the trust of our fellow members in our combat units . I made that point quite clear to them , '' he said .
Rear Admiral John Newton said the Canadian Forces members involved in the Canada Day confrontation should 'become educated in a hurry ' about what the Forces stand for . ( CBC )
`` The perception I took is exactly what the people at the Cornwallis monument took . It did n't allow them to have the space to have their own views and to express them . It tried to counter them .
`` It 's just the wrong place for our soldiers , sailors and our men and women to be , and they certainly should n't be congregating even outside of that representing those kinds of views . ''
Investigations underway
Newton said a military police investigation — as well as an administrative one — is underway . He would not say what the consequences would be for the Armed Forces members identified as Proud Boys .
`` Trust me : this is a matter of supreme importance to get right and we 're going to have to keep getting it right as we bring young people into the Canadian Armed Forces , '' he said .
Newton said the five people involved included members of the navy and army .
`` It does n't matter if you 're off-hours or in civilian clothes , the fact that you 're identified and your behaviours are perceived in contravention of our stated policies of the Canadian Armed Forces , you have just transgressed your personal life into your public life , '' he said .
`` They should become educated in a hurry about what the Canadian Armed Forces really stands for . ''
The commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Navy on the East Coast is apologizing for the actions of several members of the Canadian Forces who were involved in a confrontation during an Indigenous protest in Halifax on Canada Day . 3:30
Indigenous group responds
Rebecca Moore , a Mi'kmaq activist who was at the Cornwallis protest on Canada Day , said she was happy to hear the rear admiral apologize on behalf of the offending Forces members .
`` I do believe he is on the right track and I do appreciate his words , '' said Moore .
Newton said the Indigenous community would be consulted about the Proud Boys incident . He said he has good communications with local Indigenous leaders and would speak to advisers in the community to get guidance .
But Moore said Newton should speak to her group , since it was the one that came in direct conflict with the Proud Boys .
`` I 'm wondering if and when that 's going to happen , '' said Moore . `` I do n't think it would make sense to go to other groups ; it would make sense to come directly to us . ''
The fact that the greatest diversity of large mammals is found in Africa reflects past human activities -- and not climatic or other environmental constraints . This is determined in a new study , which presents what the world map of mammals would look like if modern man ( Homo sapiens ) had never existed .
In a world without humans , most of northern Europe would probably now be home to not only wolves , Eurasian elk ( moose ) and bears , but also animals such as elephants and rhinoceroses .
This is demonstrated in a new study conducted by researchers from Aarhus University , Denmark . In a previous analysis , they have shown that the mass extinction of large mammals during the Last Ice Age and in subsequent millennia ( the late-Quaternary megafauna extinction ) is largely explainable from the expansion of modern man ( Homo sapiens ) across the world . In this follow-up study , they investigate what the natural worldwide diversity patterns of mammals would be like in the absence of past and present human impacts , based on estimates of the natural distribution of each species according to its ecology , biogeography and the current natural environmental template . They provide the first estimate of how the mammal diversity world map would have appeared without the impact of modern man .
`` Northern Europe is far from the only place in which humans have reduced the diversity of mammals -- it 's a worldwide phenomenon . And , in most places , there 's a very large deficit in mammal diversity relative to what it would naturally have been , '' says Professor Jens-Christian Svenning , Department of Bioscience , Aarhus University , who is one of the researchers behind the study .
Africa is the last refuge
The current world map of mammal diversity shows that Africa is virtually the only place with a high diversity of large mammals . However , the world map constructed by the researchers of the natural diversity of large mammals shows far greater distribution of high large-mammal diversity across most of the world , with particularly high levels in North and South America , areas that are currently relatively poor in large mammals .
`` Most safaris today take place in Africa , but under natural circumstances , as many or even more large animals would no doubt have existed in other places , e.g. , notably parts of the New World such as Texas and neighboring areas and the region around northern Argentina-Southern Brazil . The reason that many safaris target Africa is not because the continent is naturally abnormally rich in species of mammals . Instead it reflects that it 's one of the only places where human activities have not yet wiped out most of the large animals , '' says Postdoctoral Fellow Soren Faurby , Department of Bioscience , Aarhus University , who is the lead author on the study .
The existence of Africa 's many species of mammals is thus not due to an optimal climate and environment , but rather because it is the only place where they have not yet been eradicated by humans . The underlying reason includes evolutionary adaptation of large mammals to humans as well as greater pest pressure on human populations in long-inhabited Africa in the past .
Better understanding helps nature preservation
The study 's openly accessible data set of natural range maps for all late-Quatenary mammals provides researchers with the first opportunity to analyse the natural patterns in the species diversity and composition of mammals worldwide . Hereby , it can be used to provide a better understanding of the natural factors that determine the biodiversity in a specific area .
Today , there is a particularly large number of mammal species in mountainous areas . This is often interpreted as a consequence of environmental variation , where different species have evolved in deep valleys and high mountains . According to the new study , however , this trend is much weaker when the natural patterns are considered .
`` The current high level of biodiversity in mountainous areas is partly due to the fact that the mountains have acted as a refuge for species in relation to hunting and habitat destruction , rather than being a purely natural pattern . An example in Europe is the brown bear , which now virtually only live in mountainous regions because it has been exterminated from the more accessible and most often more densely populated lowland areas , '' explains Soren Faurby .
Hereby , this new study can provide an important base-line for nature restoration and conservation .
The study has been published in the scientific journal Diversity and Distributions .
Howard Dean says he 'd be “ quietly rooting for ” a government shutdown if he still had his old job as leader of the Democratic Party .
“ If I was head of DNC , I would be quietly rooting for it , ” Dean told an audience hosted by National Journal in Washington this morning . “ I know who 's going to get blamed – we 've been down this road before. ” Dean was recalling the 1994 government shutdown engineered by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich that was politically disastrous for Republicans and boosted President Clinton 's re-election prospects .
Dean is now arguably a de facto head of his party 's left wing , and has often squared off with the White House and congressional Democratic over their willingness offer concessions to the Republican Party on legislative matters , particularly the public option that was dropped from the health care reform law .
But since the 2010 elections , Dean has called on progressives to rally around the President . Dean backed Obama 's selection of Bill Daley for White House chief of staff — a move that chafed many on the left — and promised to back the president 's reelection campaign .
Congressional leaders on both the Republican and Democratic sides as well as the White House have maintained publicly that they do not want to see the government shut down , even as a deadline for shutdown looms with no solution in sight .
If you 're a woman , and you suffer from a very serious allergy to pants like I do , you are well-aquainted with the pitfalls of wearing yoga pants or leggings in public . Like , everyone in range is shamelessly going to feast their eyes and your ass is the only thing on the menu . Personally , I made peace with it a long time ago . “ Peace ” meaning , it still infuriates me but I 'm content to fight the anti-objectification battle in more effective ways than calling out every lecherous bro who leers at me like I 'm fucking up for auction just because I walked into the coffee shop after the gym .
The fact that this video is able to exist at all is a reminder of undeniably serious issues ; it 's not at all okay that any clothing choices give some guys the idea that our bodies are open for their non-consensual consumption . There is no outfit that constitutes a woman “ asking for ” unwanted looks ( or worse ) , but that shit happens all the time .
And the implications of this behavior get a hell of a lot darker when you trace them to their origin and see what other horrible shit comes from that same place – men thinking it 's okay to unabashedly eye-fuck a woman with no regard for her personal comfort is one of the more casual manifestations of rape mentality ( put your commenting finger back in its holster , kiddos – “ rape mentality ” is any thought or action justified by the idea that you can do something involving someone else 's body without their consent . Catcalling and staring are not rape , but they 're basically rape 's second cousin . )
So because all of that is part of the creepy reality women face every time they leave the house – wearing yoga pants or anything else – this video is a welcome few minutes of comic relief on the issue . And the guy in the video is hilarious and I would like to be friends with him and go to yoga class or whatever .
The Seattle Go Center filed suit against the Nihon Ki-in on April 19 in King County Superior Court . The suit charges the Nihon Ki-in with breach of contract and fraud in connection with the Nihon Ki-in 's recent decision to sell the Seattle Go Center building “ in order to redirect these resources to the New York Go Center , ” said the Center in a press release . The Nihon Ki-in closed the New York Go Center in November 2010 , though it still owns the building it was housed in . “ The Seattle Go Center deeply regrets that we have been forced to take this action , ” the Center 's press release continued . “ We are very disappointed that despite more than a month of urging the Nihon Ki-in to enter into negotiations with us , the Nihon Ki-in has not yet done so . The cloud of uncertainty hanging over Seattle Go Center 's future has severely impaired our ability to conduct fundraising. ” The Nihon Ki-in has not thus far given any reason for its apparent decision to revive the New York Go Center at the expense of Seattle 's , either publicly , to Seattle Go Center Directors or to the American Go Association 's ( AGA ) Board . “ While I would have preferred a negotiated settlement , ” said AGA President Allan Abramson , “ given that the Nihon Ki-in has thus far ignored the AGA 's two letters seeking information on the basis for their decision , we certainly understand why the Seattle Go Center felt it had to take action . The AGA will continue to support the Center , which has been such a success. ” The Seattle Go Center , which opened in 1995 and is now self-supporting , is one of those founded by Kaoru Iwamoto 9P , whose famous atomic bomb go game against Hashimoto Utaro is depicted on the outside of the Seattle Center ( above right ) and who traveled extensively throughout the West with the aim of spreading go to promote peace , founding go centers in São Paulo , New York , Seattle and Amsterdam . “ Iwamoto-Sensei wanted to promote international friendship by providing a place where people of all backgrounds and ethnicities could enjoy learning and playing go together , ” said the Seattle Go Center . “ We think we are doing a great job of fulfilling that vision . ”

Map of Uzbekistan with Afghanistan to the south .
The Uzbekistan–Afghanistan barrier is a border barrier , built by Uzbekistan along its 137-kilometres border with Afghanistan along the Amu Darya River . [ 1 ] It is among the most heavily guarded borders in the world , second only to the border barrier between North and South Korea . [ citation needed ] It consists of a barbed wire fence and a second , taller , 380-volt electrified barbed-wire fence , land mines and a patrol of heavily armed Uzbek soldiers . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] It stretches along the entire Uzbek-Afghan frontier from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan .
Days after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , when America announced the start of military operations against the Taliban regime based in Afghanistan , Uzbekistan fortified the border fence in the province of Surkhandaria to stop any illegal migrants or refugees crossing the border . However , there is one bridge , the Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge , that crosses the Amu Darya river and the barrier . [ 4 ]

A new professional soccer team plans to begin playing on Chicago 's North Side within three years , at one of the sites proposed for Amazon 's second headquarters .
Developer Sterling Bay has bought a United Soccer League expansion team to play in its planned sports and entertainment stadium along the Chicago River , with the goal of beginning play in the 2020 season , Sterling Bay Managing Principal Andy Gloor said .
Sterling Bay and other investors will own and operate the USL team , Gloor said .
It remains to be seen how the USL , a professional league one level below Major League Soccer , will fare in Chicago . But there is a passionate soccer fan base within the city , and many supporters of the sport have lamented the MLS Chicago Fire 's location in southwest suburban Bridgeview , as well as the team 's struggle to stay relevant in a market that includes teams in each of the major sports .
“ There are a lot of cities that have two soccer teams , ” Gloor said . “ New York and Los Angeles have two MLS teams . They can co-exist in a city the size of Chicago . ”
Specific details of the Skidmore , Owings & Merrill-designed stadium are still being fine-tuned , but the venue is expected to have a retractable roof and about 20,000 seats . Gloor said . A retractable roof will allow the stadium to be used for events year-round , potentially including international soccer matches , college football and basketball games , concerts and other events , Gloor said .
The Tribune reported in October that a stadium is part of Sterling Bay 's larger vision for a more than 70-acre , mixed-use development called Lincoln Yards on the edge of the Lincoln Park and Bucktown neighborhoods . The riverfront land includes the former A. Finkl & Sons steel plant site and other formerly industrial land Sterling Bay has bought .
Prospective office tenants have expressed interest in having entertainment on the campus , Gloor said . “ The live-work-play aspect has to be there , ” Gloor said . “ You just ca n't build a suburban office complex there . Having the entertainment component is important . ”
Sterling Bay still needs to present formal plans for Lincoln Yards to community groups and gain zoning approval from the city .
A Chicago developer is offering a unique perk in the all-out competition to win Amazon 's second headquarters : Amazon Stadium .
Although the USL is a minor league to the MLS , it 's possible a more centrally located team could become a viable rival for soccer fans ' attention and ticket dollars . There have been several previous pro soccer teams in Chicago , including the Chicago Sting in the North American Soccer League in the 1970s and '80s . When that league folded , the Sting played in the Major Indoor Soccer League in the 1980s .
The Chicago Fire began MLS play at Soldier Field in 1997 , before moving in 2006 to Toyota Park , a 20,000-seat soccer stadium in Bridgeview .
The USL , formed by combining two other leagues before the 2011 season , is considered a player development league for Major League Soccer . Some USL franchises are owned by MLS teams . Others have formed affiliations in which MLS teams send players on loan to their USL counterparts , with the option to call up players at any time .
The Fire , for example , before the 2017 season formed a partnership with the separately owned Tulsa Roughnecks FC . MLS teams including the New York Red Bulls , Seattle Sounders , LA Galaxy and Toronto FC own their own USL teams .
Gloor said there are no current plans for Chicago 's USL team to have an MLS affiliation .
A name has not yet been chosen for the team and Sterling Bay plans to solicit suggestions from the public before choosing one . Sterling Bay plans to build the stadium regardless of what happens with Amazon or other prospective office tenants , Gloor said .
The USL is based in Tampa , Fla. , and had 30 teams in the 2017 season . The league plans to expand to Las Vegas ; Nashville , Tenn. ; and Fresno , Calif. , in 2018 and to Austin , Texas , and Birmingham , Ala. , in 2019 .
The USL footprint ranges from major league sports markets such as New York , Los Angeles and Toronto to relatively small minor league sports cities such as Bethlehem , Pa. ; Rochester , N.Y. ; Richmond , Va. ; and Charleston , S.C . The USL has three teams in Canada .

“ This transformative project will include a state-of-the-art stadium that will become a valuable community asset where downtown Chicagoans can enjoy professional soccer and other live events , ” said USL CEO Alec Papadakis said in a statement provided to the Tribune by Sterling Bay . “ This new USL club will also contribute to an already passionate soccer community and the tens of thousands of youth players , parents , coaches and clubs that represent the game 's foundation in Chicago . ”
Papadakis was unavailable for comment Tuesday .
Lincoln Yards is one of 10 Chicago-area sites that were proposed for Amazon 's second headquarters , known as HQ2 , which will bring as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs to the chosen North American city .
Sterling Bay was the first Chicago developer to publicly confirm plans to pursue Amazon , telling the Tribune in September it would invest as much as $ 10 billion building residential and commercial buildings on as much as 100 acres along the Lincoln Park and Bucktown neighborhoods . The land includes the former A. Finkl & Sons steel plant and other parcels along the Chicago River .
The proposal also includes a choice of three configurations for Amazon 's new campus , which is expected to grow to 8 million square feet or more over the next decade in a half in the chosen HQ2 city .
Plans for Lincoln Yards also include a Riverwalk , an extension of The 606 elevated trail , parks , a water taxi stop , a relocated Metra station , a riverfront brewery and other bars , restaurants and retail .
Seattle-based Amazon has not said what will happen after bids were accepted last month , but bids from 238 locations are expected to be pared down into one or more rounds of finalists before choosing a city in 2018 .

A Regina dog trainer is preparing an animal to be a companion pet for a woman with multiple personalities .
The dog , named Angel , will soon be sent to live with Gayle Dixon , a Saskatoon woman who has a condition known as MPD , or multiple personality disorder .
In Dixon 's case there are 10 personalities , a situation which could be confusing to a dog not trained on how to interact with different individuals emanating from the same person .
The animal also helps to stabilize the condition and allow Dixon to get out of the house more often .
Angel will be the woman 's second specially trained dog , a replacement for a beloved companion , Murphy , a black Labrador that died of cancer .
`` She was incredible , almost human , '' Dixon told CBC News recently in describing Murphy , who was with her for 10 years .
She explained how having the animal changed her outlook on life .
`` I have some emotional problems , '' she said . `` I had a fear of leaving my home . And then I was watching a program on TV from the States where it showed that dogs helped people that were diabetic , that had all kinds of things wrong with them . So I went to my counsellor and I asked her , 'Do you think a dog could help me ? ' ''
It turned out that a specifically-trained dog could make a difference in her life .
`` She got me out of the house , '' Dixon said . `` We went shopping together , went to appointments , everything . It was fantastic . I just thought I had a brand-new life . ''
Dixon explained that her different personalities come to the fore when she becomes stressed or anxious . The dog not only helps to keep her calm , but it also senses when her personality has changed .
`` She got to know all my different personalities , '' Dixon said . `` So that when one of them came out she could tell when I was going to switch and she 'd stay right by me . And when another personality was out , she made that one feel calm . ''
Some of Dixon 's personalities are children , and were only able to ensure her dog was let out when it needed to go to the bathroom . Others were keen to give the dog treats , so Dixon put a sign on the fridge saying no one , but her , could feed Murphy `` because I think everyone would give her all kinds of treats . ''
An instant connection
Training Dixon 's new companion Angel began not long after the puppy was identified as a likely match . It has been going on for about six months .
Dixon has already met Angel , and they have formed a bond .
`` She knew she was mine . We just connected , '' Dixon said . `` And we 're going to have a great life . I ca n't wait to have her . ''
`` She 'll help me feel a lot safer . I wo n't get as depressed and stuff because I will have somebody here to depend on and help me , '' Dixon added .
Mike Tang was charged with child endangerment for leaving his 8-year-old son in a grocery store parking lot a mile from home . It was supposed to be a life lesson .
`` I just wanted to reinforce that money is hard to earn and that , if he does n't do a good job at school , he could end up sleeping ... [ with ] the homeless , '' says Tang , who lives in the Southern California suburb of Corona .
The incident took place after Mike caught Isaac cutting corners on his homework . At about 7:45 p.m. , he drove him to the parking lot and drove away . About 10 minutes later , Tang 's father came to pick him up .
But Isaac had already been picked up : He was in police custody . A stranger had spotted the boy and called the cops , who arrested Tang , and he spent the night in county jail . A jury later convicted him of child endangerment , and the judge sentenced him to parenting classes and a 56-day work release program picking up trash and doing other menial work .
Mike is refusing to serve the sentence , and there 's an outstanding arrest warrant for his failure to comply . He scrawled a response on top of the warrant and mailed it back .
`` Fuck you all ! '' Mike 's written response begins . `` Walking on a public sidewalk at 7:45 p.m. is not child endangerment . ''
Is Mike right , or did he jeopardize Isaac 's safety ? And was it appropriate for the police to intervene ?
`` It rises to the level of unusual . It rises to the level of , perhaps , controversial . But it was not literally dangerous . That 's not a crime , '' says journalist and Reason contributor Lenore Skenazy , founder of the Free Range Kids movement .

The family of the man who is accused of murdering his grandmother said they had recently become more and more concerned about his agitated behavior.Hazel Billingsley , 67 , was gunned down early Sunday morning at the home she shared with her grandson , Nathan Billingsley , on East Longwood Meadows near Cypress.Detectives found her body wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a metal shed in her backyard . `` She was my rock and one of my best friends '' , said daughter Carrie Zamir.She hopes her mother is remembered for her caring heart and unending generosity . `` She did not deserve this . This was so unfair , '' said Zamir.Her family said Hazel was an avid artist , who captured special moments with both a camera and a paint brush . `` She saw beauty in everything , '' said daughter Melanie Billingsley.Nathan Billingsley is charged with his grandmother 's murder . Court documents reveal he told investigators the shooting was an accident , but his own brother said there 's reason to question that . `` She told me not to say anything . She said you ca n't say anything -- you ca n't , '' said Tanner Hurt.Hurt told Eyewitness News a girl who was staying with Nathan and his grandmother at the home , told him less than a day before the shooting that Nathan was allegedly planning to do something awful . `` She texted him that he wanted to kill my mom and my grandma and she said that she did n't want to see anybody hurt , '' said Hurt.He shared that information with his family . They said Nathan had a history of drug abuse , and at times , would make threats . They said he 'd been in and out of rehab , and they fear he was using again.They were working on how to handle things , and if or when they should contact authorities , Hurt told ABC13.Now , Nathan 's mother says she struggles with guilt about not doing more to stop him sooner . `` I love him , but I am also angry . And I can not believe that he could look her -- if he did -- in the eyes and do something cold blooded like this , '' said Melanie Billingsley.Investigators have not charged anyone else in this case . Billingsley is in custody at the Harris County Jail .

The family of Walter Scott , a black South Carolina man shot and killed by a police officer who is now facing murder charges , has reached a $ 6.5 million settlement with city officials .
The North Charleston , S.C. city council approved the settlement Thursday night at a hearing attended by Scott 's family and their attorneys .
Officer Michael Slager , who is white , was arrested and charged with murder after a videotape taken by a bystander showed the officer shooting a fleeing Scott in the back multiple times on April 4 . Scott died at the scene . The video , replayed across the country , captured national attention and underscored increasing tension between white police officers and black men .
`` I am glad the city and the family were able to reach a settlement without the necessity of a lawsuit , '' North Charleston Mayor R. Keith Summey said shortly after the settlement 's approval . `` Both sides have met many times and worked very hard over the past several months to resolve this matter . ''
Summey said he appreciated Scott 's family asking for calm shortly after video of Scott 's death surfaced . He explained that since the shooting , North Charleston has taken several steps including outfitting police with body cameras as well as engaging the North Charleston police department and the Justice Department .
CLOSE South Carolina authorities released patrol car dash camera video Thursday showing Walter Scott getting out of his car and running away after a traffic stop moments before he was shot dead by a North Charleston police officer . VPC
`` As a result of this tragedy , important issues have been discussed not only in North Charleston , but around the country , '' Summey said . `` Citizens have become engaged in the process and government officials are listening . ''
The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division , which is investigating the shooting , also released video taken by a police patrol car dash camera showing Scott , 50 , getting out of his car and running away after a traffic stop moments before he was shot dead by Slager .
In that video , Slager , approaches a dark Mercedes-Benz driven by Scott and says he pulled him over because of a non-functioning taillight . Scott can be heard saying he does n't have registration or insurance on the vehicle because he was in the process of buying it .
After a brief exchange , the officer returns to his cruiser . Scott tentatively gets out from the car , then gets back in . Moments later Scott opens the door again and runs off the side of the screen . Slager then runs after him .
Thursday night , Scott 's family reflected on the settlement and Slager 's fate .
`` While nothing can replace having Walter in our lives , the city of North Charleston 's historic actions ensure that he did not die in vain , '' Anthony Scott , Walter Scott 's brother said . `` This city sent a message , loud and clear , that this kind of reckless behavior exhibited by members of law enforcement will not and shall not be tolerated . ''
Anthony Scott added that the family is now hoping that Slager is convicted of murder .
`` We will now focus on efforts in the criminal trial of Walter 's killer , '' Anthony Scott said . `` It is our hope that after a jury of his peers reviews the evidence , they 'll send an equally important message to law enforcement . This is not place for unnecessary violence against unarmed fleeing individuals . ''
Walter Scott 's family said the settlement will go toward Scott 's children and that a portion of the money will also be donated to help with disaster relief efforts for recent flooding in South Carolina .

Sewage treatment plants fail to remove artificial sweeteners completely from waste water . What 's more , these pollutants contaminate waters downstream and may still be present in our drinking water . Thanks to their new robust analytical method , which simultaneously extracts and analyses seven commonly used artificial sweeteners , Marco Scheurer , Heinz-Jürgen Brauch and Frank Thomas Lange from the Water Technology Center in Karlsruhe , Germany , were able to demonstrate the presence of several artificial sweeteners in waste water .
Their findings are published online this week in Springer 's journal Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry .
A range of artificial sweeteners are commonly used in food and drinks , as well as drugs and sanitary products . The potential health risks of artificial sweeteners have been debated for some time . Until now , only sucralose has been detected in aquatic environments . Through the use of a new analytical method , the researchers were able to look for seven different artificial sweeteners ( cyclamate , acesulfame , saccharin , aspartame , neotame , neohesperidin dihydrochalcone and sucralose ) simultaneously , and show , for the first time , that a number of commonly used artificial sweeteners are present in German waste and surface water .
Scheurer and colleagues collected water samples from two sewage treatment plants in Germany – Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen and Karlsruhe – as well as from a soil aquifer treatment site located in a Mediterranean country that treats secondary effluent from a sewage treatment plant .
They tested the water samples using their new analytical method and detected four ( acesulfame , saccharin , cyclamate , and sucralose ) of seven artificial sweeteners in the waters from the two German sewage treatment plants , indicating incomplete elimination during waste water treatment . Their analyses also showed that these pollutants contaminate rivers and streams receiving water from the sewage treatment plants .
The authors then compared the conventional waste water treatment by sewage treatment plants with advanced waste water treatment by soil aquifer treatment . Traces of artificial sweeteners were present in both cases , proof that water purification was incomplete .
Marco Scheurer concludes : “ Due to the use of artificial sweeteners as food additives , the occurrence of artificial sweetener traces in the aquatic environment might become a primary issue for consumer acceptance . ”
Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California called for the Supreme Court 's controversial Citizens United ruling to be overturned , saying the decision was “ at odds with reality . ”
The ruling struck down key campaign finance laws , giving rise to so-called Super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money to influence federal elections .
“ What stood out most about Citizens United was not the court 's legal reasoning , but its staggering naivety , ” Schiff said on the House floor . “ As the court confidently declared , ‘ We now conclude that independent expenditures including those made by corporations , do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption . ' Unfortunately , the five justices who joined this opinion must be the last five Americans to feel that way . ”
The congressman noted the Supreme Court held in Buckley v. Valeo that campaign spending was a form of political speech , and thus protected by the First Amendment . The Citizens United ruling was based in part on the Buckley decision .
“ In Buckley , the court felt there was a compelling state interest in regulating contributions to candidates , but there was not yet sufficient evidence of a similarly compelling need to regulate independent expenditures , ” Schiff explained . “ But the court acknowledged the need to revisit that conclusion in the future if events should prove otherwise . The events have most certainly proved otherwise following Citizens United . ”
Earlier this month , Schiff introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling . The proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution would allow the federal government to impose “ reasonable content-neutral limitations ” on independent political contributions and spending .

A Wrinkle in the Mathematical Universe
Posted by John Baez
Of all the permutation groups , only S 6 S_6 has an outer automorphism . This puts a kind of ‘ wrinkle ' in the fabric of mathematics , which would be nice to explore using category theory .
For starters , let Bij n Bij_n be the groupoid of n n -element sets and bijections between these . Only for n = 6 n = 6 is there an equivalence from this groupoid to itself that is n't naturally isomorphic to the identity !
This is just another way to say that only S 6 S_6 has an outer isomorphism .
And here 's another way to play with this idea :
Given any category X X , let Aut ( X ) Aut ( X ) be the category where objects are equivalences f : X → X f : X \to X and morphisms are natural isomorphisms between these . This is like a group , since composition gives a functor
∘ : Aut ( X ) × Aut ( X ) → Aut ( X ) \circ : Aut ( X ) \times Aut ( X ) \to Aut ( X )
which acts like the multiplication in a group . It 's like the symmetry group of X X . But it 's not a group : it 's a ‘ 2-group ' , or categorical group . It 's called the automorphism 2-group of X X .
By calling it a 2-group , I mean that Aut ( X ) Aut ( X ) is a monoidal category where all objects have weak inverses with respect to the tensor product , and all morphisms are invertible . Any pointed space has a fundamental 2-group , and this sets up a correspondence between 2-groups and connected pointed homotopy 2-types . So , topologists can have some fun with 2-groups !
Now consider Bij n Bij_n , the groupoid of n n -element sets and bijections between them . Up to equivalence , we can describe Aut ( Bij n ) Aut ( Bij_n ) as follows . The objects are just automorphisms of S n S_n , while a morphism from an automorphism f : S n → S n f : S_n \to S_n to an automorphism f ′ : S n → S n f ' : S_n \to S_n is an element g ∈ S n g \in S_n that conjugates one automorphism to give the other :
f ′ ( h ) = g f ( h ) g − 1 ∀ h ∈ S n f ' ( h ) = g f ( h ) g^ { -1 } \qquad \forall h \in S_n
So , if all automorphisms of S n S_n are inner , all objects of Aut ( Bij n ) Aut ( Bij_n ) are isomorphic to the unit object , and thus to each other .
Puzzle 1 . For n ≠ 6 n
e 6 , all automorphisms of S n S_n are inner . What are the connected pointed homotopy 2-types corresponding to Aut ( Bij n ) Aut ( Bij_n ) in these cases ?
Puzzle 2 . The permutation group S 6 S_6 has an outer automorphism of order 2 , and indeed Out ( S 6 ) = ℤ 2 . Out ( S_6 ) = \mathbb { Z } _2 . What is the connected pointed homotopy 2-type corresponding to Aut ( Bij 6 ) Aut ( Bij_6 ) ?
Puzzle 3 . Let Bij Bij be the groupoid where objects are finite sets and morphisms are bijections . Bij Bij is the coproduct of all the groupoids Bij n Bij_n where n ≥ 0 n \ge 0 :
Bij = ∑ n = 0 ∞ Bij n Bij = \sum_ { n = 0 } ^\infty Bij_n
Give a concrete description of the 2-group Aut ( Bij ) Aut ( Bij ) , up to equivalence . What is the corresponding pointed connected homotopy 2-type ?
You can get a bit of intuition for the outer automorphism of S 6 S_6 using something called the Tutte–Coxeter graph . Let S = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 } S = \ { 1,2,3,4,5,6\ } . Of course the symmetric group S 6 S_6 acts on S S , but James Sylvester found a different action of S 6 S_6 on a 6-element set , which in turn gives an outer automorphism of S 6 S_6 . To do this , he made the following definitions : • A duad is a 2-element subset of S S . Note that there are 6 choose 2 = 15 { 6 \choose 2 } = 15 duads . • A syntheme is a set of 3 duads forming a partition of S S . There are also 15 synthemes . • A synthematic total is a set of 5 synthemes partitioning the set of 15 duads . There are 6 synthematic totals . Any permutation of S S gives a permutation of the set T T of synthematic totals , so we obtain an action of S 6 S_6 on T T . Choosing any bijection betweeen S S and T T , this in turn gives an action of S 6 S_6 on S S , and thus a homomorphism from S 6 S_6 to itself . Sylvester showed that this is an outer automorphism ! There 's a way to draw this situation . It 's a bit tricky , but Greg Egan has kindly done it : Here we see 15 small red blobs : these are the duads . We also see 15 larger blue blobs : these are the synthemes . We draw an edge from a duad to a syntheme whenever that duad lies in that syntheme . The result is a graph called the Tutte–Coxeter graph , with 30 vertices and 45 edges . The 6 concentric rings around the picture are the 6 synthematic totals . A band of color appears in one of these rings near some syntheme if that syntheme is part of that synthematic total . If we draw the Tutte–Coxeter graph without all the decorations , it looks like this : The red vertices come from duads , the blue ones from synthemes . The outer automorphism of S 6 S_6 gives a symmetry of the Tutte–Coxeter graph that switches the red and blue vertices ! The inner automorphisms , which correspond to elements of S 6 S_6 , also give symmetries : for each element of S 6 S_6 , the Tutte–Coxeter graph has a symmetry that permutes the numbers in the picture . These symmetries map red vertices to red ones and blue vertices to blue ones . The group Aut ( S 6 ) \mathrm { Aut } ( S_6 ) has 2 × 6 ! = 1440 2 \times 6 ! = 1440 elements , coming from the 6 ! 6 ! inner automorphisms of S 6 S_6 and the outer automorphism of order 2 . In fact , Aut ( S 6 ) \mathrm { Aut } ( S_6 ) is the whole symmetry group of the Tutte–Coxeter graph .

TROUTDALE , Ore. `` Nobody does this and make money . ''
For years , that 's what Alison Brown thought about her love of sculpting . She had worked with clay since she was eleven years old , but never imagined living life as a sculptor .
`` I had never considered it as a career option at all , '' she says .
Now , just 25 years old , Brown has a thriving sculpture business . It started to take off when she created a bronze sculpture of her favorite university mascot ; the Oregon Duck .
`` It was just so natural that I would sculpt for the first time an Oregon Duck , '' she says .
Brown is an Oregon native and a graduate of the University of Oregon . Her pride for the school runs deep . One look at her website , www.campussculptures.com , shows you just how much . But the love of one school has led to work with others .
`` I 've sculpted Benny the Beaver for Oregon State , '' she says . `` I 've also done work for the USC Trojans . ''
Brown has set a firm foundation for a successful lifetime career as an artist . But it 's not lost on her that few people know much about the work she does .
`` People have been doing this for thousands of years , '' she says . `` But it 's never really gotten out there . ''
Casting a monument in bronze first begins with sculpting it out of clay . It can be tedious work , involving hundreds of hours depending on the sculpture . She 's already spent a lot of time on one of her latest creations . It 's the largest Oregon Duck statue she 's ever done .
`` It 's eight feet tall , '' she says . `` It 'll be cast as an eight foot bronze monument when it 's finished . ''
Brown 's work offers fulfillment on two different levels . She 's able to bring pride for her school to life . She 's also proud of herself for what she 's accomplished .
`` Ever since I was real little I always knew I wanted to be a sculptor , '' says Brown . `` Now I 'm actually doing it . ''
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie autographs campaign signs in Linden , N.J. , Oct. 30 , 2013 , during a campaign stop on a multi-day bus tour to close out his re-election campaign . ( Mel Evans/AP )
The Republican professional political class increasingly views Gov . Chris Christie , who is on the verge of a sweeping reelection victory on Tuesday in the Democratic-friendly state of New Jersey , as its best — and maybe only — hope to win back the White House in 2016 .
Here 's how one plugged-in Republican consultant responded by e-mail when asked how we should rank the current 2016 field : “ Christie is in the [ one ] slot now and forevermore — he 's about to get huge margins in his historic reelection in a blue state — he 's the successful model for our party ( from a political perspective ) and his governing success is exactly what our country needs from a fiscal perspective . He can compete in about 40 of 50 states . Who else can do that and run as a conservative ? No one . ”
Christie is increasingly seen as the one candidate who might be able to bridge the divide between the establishment and the tea party that is in the process of ripping the party apart . In that way , Republicans are hoping that Christie can do for their side what Bill Clinton did in the early 1990s for a Democratic Party that was similarly divided — heal what looks to be an unhealable wound through force of personality and a demonstrated record of success as a governor .
Below we rank the 10 candidates most likely to wind up as the Republican presidential nominee in three years ' time . Enjoy !
10 . Mike Pence : Looking for a dark horse ? Try the Indiana governor . He 's a gifted communicator , liked by social and fiscal conservatives and not part of the Washington establishment .
9 . Paul Ryan : There appears to be a significant dialing back of Ryan 's interest in a presidential run from even a few months ago . And , as several Republicans noted to us , the Wisconsin congressman 's really not doing much to build the beginnings of a presidential bid .
8 . John Kasich : The Ohio governor needs to win reelection before he or his people will seriously entertain the possibility of another run for president . But let 's say Kasich wins . He 's a two-term governor of a Midwestern swing state who spent time in Washington — a long time ago — in Congress as the head of the House Budget Committee . That 's not a bad starting place .
7 . Bobby Jindal : Several people we talked to suggested that we drop the Louisiana governor below Kasich in our rankings . But Jindal has the next year to continue to organize a presidential bid , while Kasich needs to keep both eyes on his reelection . That 's enough for us to give Jindal a slight edge . Jindal is quite clearly trying to position himself as the “ ideas guy ” in the field , also known as the Newton Leroy Gingrich Memorial Slot .
6 . Marco Rubio : The problem for the senator from Florida is that his work to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the Senate has damaged him within the party base — and , because the legislation remains mired in the House , he has nothing to show for it . Sign of the times ? A poll by WMUR in New Hampshire showed Rubio in sixth place in the state 's primary field , tied with Rick Santorum . Oomph .
5 . Jeb Bush : The holding pattern continues . If he runs , Bush may replace Christie as the Clinton figure in the field . But no one knows what he is going to do — and he is n't talking much about it .
4 . Scott Walker : The Wisconsin governor is in a similar position to Kasich . He has a very strong case to make for 2016 if he can get through his 2014 reelection race . Walker has proved himself — in his 2010 election and his 2011 recall election — to be a very able politician , so we have our doubts about Democratic claims that he may be vulnerable next November .
3 . Ted Cruz : If the Iowa caucuses were held today , the senator from Texas would win . But they wo n't be held today . Therein lies the fundamental question at the heart of Cruz 's increasingly likely candidacy : Can he sustain the energy and passion that the tea party base of the GOP has for him over the next two-plus years ?
2 . Rand Paul : Cruz 's ascension as the face of the tea party movement may actually make it more likely that the senator from Kentucky winds up as the nominee . If Cruz is seen as the most ideological of the top tier of candidates , Paul can cast himself as the most electable hybrid conservative — someone whom conservatives can feel good about and who can expand the GOP 's shrinking electoral map .
1 . Chris Christie : No one has had a better 2013 . The only question for Christie is whether the power center of the party has moved so far toward the tea party that — with his focus on pragmatism over principle and winning over all else — he simply can not be its choice .

Please turn on JavaScript . Media requires JavaScript to play . Advertisement In a cloudless sky , above the market towns and green and pleasant fields of Warwickshire , it is hard to believe that it is worth the effort of the Environment Agency to map in painstaking detail every bump and dip of the terrain down below . But the project - to plot the topography of England and Wales to within six inches of accuracy - is seen as a vital first step in preparing the country to face the emerging threat of flash flooding from tropical-style downpours . Fitted to the floor of a leased aircraft is a Lidar unit which fires a laser beam downwards 100,000 times every second , scanning a swath of land up to 600m wide . So far , 56 % of England and Wales have been surveyed , with the focus now on the urban areas most at risk from torrential surface water during heavy storms . Please turn on JavaScript . Media requires JavaScript to play . Advertisement On board , scientist Chris O'Dwyer activates the laser for a series of passes one mile long and watches the data stream into a bank of consoles . During our flight , he told me : `` The difference between an area flooding and not flooding is 6ins and the data we are gathering here has an accuracy in elevation of about 15cm . That could be the difference between the water flowing over the threshold of somebody 's doorstep and not . '' The result is a highly detailed series of three-dimensional maps . I was shown one of Hull , one of the most vulnerable cities and badly hit last summer . Unexpected deluge The aim is to create a basic database to which local authorities , water companies and private businesses can then add their own information about drains and water courses - to try to provide the best possible estimate of the locations most at risk from flash flooding . It is a huge task . Although Hull is used to the threat of flooding from the sea and from the River Humber , the flooding last June was caused by an intense and unexpected deluge . A total of 8,647 homes was affected along with 91 out of 99 schools in the area . And even now , nearly one year on , 547 families are still living in caravans . The head of flood risk at the Environment Agency , Phil Rothwell , told the BBC that an urgent and nationwide effort to prepare for downpours was now needed . `` I think this is a very big issue . We saw last week monsoon-style rainfall in Oxfordshire . This is the sort of thing we can expect more of in the future - very local , very heavy rain . `` We saw last year the floods demonstrated that over half the property was flooded by water on its way to the rivers , not coming from the rivers . It 's flash flooding , urban flooding . '' And Mr Rothwell appealed for better co-ordination to tackle surface water flooding - to have a single organisation in charge of overseeing the running of all the systems for handling flash floods . `` If we do n't get the management of our cities ' drainage structure right , this will be a continuing problem , even an increasing one , '' he says .

Ninjas in Pyjamas are poised to sign William `` draken '' Sundin from Epsilon , according to a report from Flickshot.fr .
The 21-year-old will step into the shoes of Jacob `` pyth '' Mourujärvi , who gets the axe 15 months after joining NiP - his first European team following his sojourn in North America .
During pyth 's tenure with NiP , the team won two international titles , DreamHack Masters Malmö and IEM Oakland .
However , pressure had recently been mounting on the team , especially after they failed to qualify for the ELEAGUE Major - the first Valve-sponsored event that they have ever missed .
draken reportedly set to join NiP
William `` draken '' Sundin has been playing for Epsilon since March 2016 , when Epsilon signed the Swedish roster known as Cringe Gods . Over these 12 months , the team have had some good runs , including a first-placed finish at the World Cyber Arena Finals and a third-placed finish at the European Minor .
This is the second time in NiP 's history that the organisation will buy a Counter-Strike player out of a contract , having previously signed Aleksi `` allu '' Jalli from 3DMAX .
NiP 's new roster will reportedly consist of :
Judicial authorities said Thursday that they had taken the unusual step of appointing a senior judge to hold a long-planned inquest into the death of Alexander V. Litvinenko , a former K.G.B . officer poisoned in London in 2006 with a rare radioactive isotope , polonium 210 . The case soured relations between Britain and Russia , and the new development may put at risk recent improvements . At British inquests , judges replace coroners only in the most high-profile cases , like the inquiry into the death of Princess Diana . The hearings to be overseen by the judge , Sir Robert Owen , could provide the first opportunity in the case for witnesses to testify under oath . A procedural hearing is to be held next month . British prosecutors have accused another former K.G.B . officer , Andrei K. Lugovoi , of Mr. Litvinenko 's poisoning — a charge he denies — and are seeking his extradition , which Russia has refused . Mr. Litvinenko , who fled Russia in 2000 , had secured British citizenship shortly before he died , and he accused Russia 's leader , Vladimir V. Putin , of responsibility for his poisoning .
Is it beneath dignity and self-respect to believe in a God who had to kill in order to forgive ? “ More and more evangelicals believe Christ 's atoning death is merely a grotesque creation of the medieval imagination , ” reports Christianity Today .
Isabel Carter Heyward , Professor of Theology at Episcopal Divinity School , Cambridge contends that “ forgiveness does not come through the blood of Christ ” Interviewed by Abby Noll , “ [ Heyward ] deletes “ Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us ” when celebrating the Eucharist . Instead , she teaches that we are the “ living sacraments ” of atonement when we show “ compassion and non-violence ” . Forgiveness does not come through “ blood sacrifices ” but through compassion and solidarity. ” ( Noll 2000 : n.p )
Heyward is not alone in rejecting penal substitution , Clack Pinnock and Robert Brow [ 1 ] contended that “ Christ is not appeasing God 's wrath . God is not sadistically crucifying His beloved Son . We are not talking about retribution or criminal proceedings . The cross is a revelation of a compassionate God . Suffering love is the way of salvation ” . ( Pinnock & Brow 2001 : 27 )
How does a holy and righteous God justifies sinners ? Is it true that God can simply forgive sinners without blood sacrifice ? This is the problem I am attempting to answer as I explore penal substitution , a notion that stabs to make sense of what the life , death and resurrection of Christ Jesus achieved .
A concise Biblical answer could be given by combining Hebrews 9 : 22b : “ without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins ” and Hebrews 10:4 “ [ it was ] impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. ” ( ESV ) together . I have divided this article in three parties so I can fairly attempt to present the notion of penal substitutionary atonement and also answer some of the popular objections .
The notion of atonement as we encounter in Old Testament , predominantly in Leviticus 16 , describes a framework of purification as a sinner involves herself in a ritual cleansing and offering sacrifice to atoned for her transgressions against God 's righteousness and holiness .
N. T. Wright quotes D. P. Wright explaining :
While throughout the year the impurity of individual or community sins may be purged as they arise , once a year a special rite must be performed that cleanses the sanctuary of impurity from deliberate sins and from any other lingering impurity not yet rectified . ( Wright 1996 : 410 )
“ [ A ] tonement is a multifaceted event ” , explained R.C . Sproul , “ Jesus is shown providing surety for our debt to God , mediating the enmity between us and God , and offering Himself as a substitute to suffer God 's judgment in our place. ” ( Sproul 2007 : 53 )
Stealing the thought of Anselm of Canterbury , I believe the life , death and resurrection of Christ Jesus paid the penalty that man owed God for his sin and none but man must pay . But only God-man was able to fully and perfectly bore the just condemnation as a substitute in place of those who belong to His Father .
In the next article I will attempt to unpack the above paragraph as we explore both the Old and the New Testament doctrine of atonement .

Question : Why is more and more contemporary Christians find it offensive to speak of the blood of Jesus ?

Doug Aitken 's newest art installation is as big as the building on which it suitably resides .
The Seattle Art Museum will have a permanent change starting this weekend when Aitken reveals his giant LED and glass display called Mirror , which displays continuously changing images to match the surroundings of the museum . Commissioned by the late philanthropist Bagley Wright in 2011 , Mirror acts as a living museum outside the Seattle institution , using an enormous collection of moving images captured by Aitken to reflect local life .
Mirror is constructed with one huge glass-covered horizontal band that spans 12 stories of the museum 's northern and western exterior walls , displaying ever-changing images and columns of light that run up and down its façade . Responsive editing software lies at its heart , recognizing surrounding conditions such weather information , traffic density and atmospheric data , and rendering them as images based on timing , composition , camera movement and subject . The images come from hundreds of hours of footage Aitken filmed throughout Seattle , Washington State and around the museum itself . As the building “ senses ” change in the environment , the screen changes , and because the environment outside the museum will never be truly the same twice , neither will the images on Mirror .
Aitkens says he was inspired to make Mirror by minimalist music composition , to see if a piece of art and architecture could create its own sequences and patterns , and be less predictable .
“ I was interested in seeing if there was a way to allow the moving image to create a constantly new and changing composition , ” Aitken says . “ In Mirror , imagery at times is abstract and moves in an almost musical tempo . The work generates its own tempos and patterns feeding off the landscape , movement , temperature , light or darkness , wind or many other live organic things around it . ”
While Mirror is Aitken 's first permanent installation for a public museum , he 's no stranger to creating works on such a large scale . Many of his past projects involve combining urban cultures and rhythm , and exploring how the architecture of a city can live a life of its own . In 2007 , Aitken transformed an entire block of Manhattan into a cinematic show with his Sleepwalkers exhibition for The Museum of Modern Art by covering the museum 's exterior walls with projections of ambient landscapes and people sleeping .
With Mirror , Aitken wanted to make a piece of art that would grow by itself , creating a new visualization for every minute of life it reflects . If nothing else , Mirror will be a testament to the ever-changing pace of Seattle as it continues to evolve with the city .
For years the state comptroller has proudly boasted of the excellent staff he has working for him - accountants and lawyers who carry out the office 's investigative work . But a suspicion arises from Micha Lindenstrauss ' latest draft report into the December 2010 Carmel fire tragedy : that there is a serious shortage of decent economists in his office . Because if there were proper economists there , and if Lindenstrauss had listened to them , he never would have allowed such an erroneous report .
The draft report states that the comptroller intends to place `` personal responsibility '' on Interior Minister Eli Yishai and Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz for the disaster , in which 44 people - prison wardens , police and firefighters - died . Lindenstrauss ' intention is that the report , when released , will create public pressure on both ministers until they are forced to resign . And then Lindenstrauss will go down in history with an unforgettable end to his career ( his seven-year term ends this summer ) .
Lindenstrauss knows there is nothing more popular than taking aim at the high and mighty because , in our populist reality , the one who wins the greatest applause is the one who throws two ministers into the gladiatorial arena to bleed to death - all to the joyous cries of the masses .
But wait a minute , what about the prime minister ? After all , Benjamin Netanyahu also serves as the Minister of Economic Strategy , overseeing Steinitz . So why is he out of the picture ? Can it be because Lindenstrauss decided not to climb too high , in case he might fall ?
In any case , Lindenstrauss says Steinitz is guilty because he did n't provide the firefighting services with all the funds Yishai demanded : NIS 500 million . But it must be understood that Yishai 's request for the money came during the budgetary year , and Steinitz did not have any money hidden under the mattress . All the money was already allocated , based on priorities set by the cabinet and the Knesset , and they did not include NIS 500 million for the firefighting services .
In a meeting held in December 2009 , Steinitz said he was willing to transfer the money to the firefighting services on condition that reforms were made . There was nothing more proper , since everyone knows - and this is also written in previous state comptroller reports - that the firefighting services are poorly managed ; if the money was given to them in their present state , they would just be wasted .
Anyhow , in mid-2010 the cabinet decided to allocate NIS 100 million out of the NIS 500 million to the firefighting services . And how many fire trucks were bought with this money ? A big fat zero .

In order to understand how delusional it is to place the responsibility on Steinitz , we need to understand that every single day and every single hour , the finance minister is besieged with demands for additional money from ministers . All of them are appropriate and they will all save lives . For example , the transportation minister demands additional money to build interchanges and to improve road safety . The deputy health minister demands additional hospital beds , and the defense minister demands more money for protection from missiles . So according to Lindenstrauss , Steinitz must give everyone what they ask for , otherwise he will be responsible for a pileup on the road to Eilat , the death of patients lining the hospital corridors or the rockets landing on Ashkelon .
In the comptroller 's office , they simply do not understand the ABCs of economic theory and the concept of a shortage . The blanket is always too short and ca n't cover everything ; the budget is always limited and it is impossible to meet every need . The job of the finance minister is to explain these limits to the ministers and make sure that every shekel is directed in the most effective fashion .
But Lindenstrauss is living in La-La Land . There are no constraints or limits there . Yishai asked for money ? Then you have to give it to him . And at whose expense will it come ? That is not Lindenstrauss ' problem . In the state comptroller 's office , they do not understand that , at any given moment , the government is implementing a policy of risk management . The government asks itself where to direct the shekel in order to receive the maximum benefit : To defense , hospitals , roads or maybe to education ? That is how priorities are set - within budgetary limitations . It is impossible to give everyone everything they want .
Therefore , if Lindenstrauss ' distorted view is accepted , then from now on every minister will present the finance minister with as many demands as possible - and when they do n't get what they want , Steinitz will be guilty . In this new reality , maybe it would be proper for Lindenstrauss to replace Steinitz in the Finance Ministry . Then everyone will get everything they ask for , without reforms , without limits and without superfluous questions . Then we all can celebrate together in La-La Land .

Image caption Palestinians face being evicted from Susiya after a long legal battle , despite garnering support from the US and EU
A strong wind blows across a rocky limestone ridge in the South Hebron Hills , Palestinian flags flapping noisily above a few dozen ramshackle dwellings and animal pens .
The village of Susiya - home to some 350 people - has become the focus of an international campaign , drawing in European diplomats , the US state department and pro-Palestinian activists .
`` Look , there are families living here in tents . There 's a cave , water cisterns and places where we put our sheep , '' Susiya resident Nasser Nawaja points out . `` It 's a simple Palestinian life . ''
But daily existence here has long been caught up in a complicated political situation . Now , for the third time in three decades , villagers are facing the threat of another forced displacement .
In May , the Israeli High Court denied a Palestinian request for an injunction to stop Israel 's plans to destroy their homes .
The villagers have deeds to the land going back to the Ottoman era , but the Israeli authorities say their current structures were built without the necessary permits .
A senior officer from the defence ministry 's administrative body in the West Bank warned that efforts to remove the villagers could begin any day , even though a legal appeal is due to be heard on 3 August .
The department said he had met Susiya 's Palestinian inhabitants to `` examine alternative solutions '' .
Archaeological site
In the meantime , Susiya 's residents are watching and waiting .
`` Everyone in the village is living on their nerves , '' Mr Nawaja , 33 , said . `` We 're afraid the Israelis might come at any time . We panic every time we hear cars approaching . ''
The rudimentary Palestinian homes in this harsh landscape are squeezed between the mainly brick-built houses in the Israeli settlement of Susiya and a site , run by settlers , where ruins of an ancient synagogue were found in the 1970s .
Image caption Nasser Nawaja hopes a legal appeal will halt the demolition order before the army moves in
Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are considered illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this .
Susiya falls within the 61 % of the West Bank known as Area C , which the 1993 Israel-Palestinian interim peace accords placed under full Israeli control .
In 1986 , local Palestinians were expelled from their homes on the archaeological site . The army then moved them again in 2001 after Palestinians killed an Israeli from the neighbouring settlement .
After the residents moved to the current location on their agricultural land , they say they tried to get building permission but it was denied .
Critics say in the vast majority of cases the Israeli civil administration , the body which implements government policy in the West Bank , does not approve Palestinian building applications in Area C .
Diplomatic pressure
Now Israeli and foreign activists are camping out in Susiya around the clock to try to prevent demolition orders from being carried out , and there is also diplomatic pressure against such a move .
`` We 're closely following developments… We strongly urge the Israeli authorities to refrain from carrying out any demolitions in the village , '' US state department spokesman John Kirby said in a rare public statement on the issue this month .
He added that any demolitions or evictions `` would be harmful and provocative '' .
In turn , European Union foreign ministers issued a strongly worded statement urging Israel to abandon plans for the `` forced transfer of population and demolition of Palestinian housing and infrastructure '' .
European donations help sustain Susiya village , which is not connected to mains electricity or public water supplies .
'Test case '
The Susiya case has taken on a special significance because of current tensions between Israel and both the US and EU .
They view any action against Palestinians in the context of continuing settlement growth and wider problems of demolitions and displacement affecting Palestinians and Bedouin in the occupied territories and Israel .
At the same time Israel 's right-wing coalition government is being pressed by its supporters in the settler movement .
Image caption Ari Briggs says Israel has no legal grounds on which to not enforce the High Court 's ruling against Susiya
Image caption European Parliament members have urged Israel not to go ahead with the demolition
They point out there is now no legal obstacle to prevent buildings in Susiya being demolished and that some Israeli settler outposts deemed unlawful by the government have previously been removed .
`` This is 100 % a test case for the Israeli government - whether it stands up to the unending pressure placed on us , not only by the EU but now by the state department of the US , Israel 's closest ally , '' says Ari Briggs of Regavim , an Israeli legal advocacy group .
`` It is only going to get worse if Israel bows to the pressure today . Israel is a sovereign country and it has to say : 'We have interests as well and we have to follow those interests . ' ''
Back at Susiya , the head of the village council meets a delegation of members of the European Parliament who have arrived for a tour . Meanwhile local youngsters play football with a group of activists .
Seventy-year-old Mohammed Nawaja looks on . `` Each time we 've had to rebuild we 've started with nothing , '' he says . `` I must trust in God that my grandchildren wo n't have to live the same experience . ''

Not that long ago , Rajon Rondo was something else . Something hard to describe . Rondo was a player whose effectiveness was based on unpredictability . This is counterintuitive ; how can a player who ca n't shoot be unpredictable ? Without the ability to create space , Rajon thrived by throwing his effort into an almost dictatorial control of pace . The emblematic Peak Rondo sequence invariably began with a defensive rebound or a steal ( the better to force his tempo on an opponent ) , then a pass on an angle that did n't appear to be there until he found it .
Unraveling the effects that a player has on his teammates and opponents regardless of their quality is the holy grail of analytics . A dude who runs with a lineup of All-Stars will look better than he would if he were balling with scrubs . Where does the player end and the team begin ? At his best — from his emergence in the 2008 Finals to his 2013 ACL tear — Rondo was difficult to rate because his game seemed to live in that unclassifiable zone where player and team come together . If you took away Ray Allen 's spacing , would Rondo still be effective ? If Doc Rivers had started stressing offensive rebounds , what would have happened to Rajon 's defensive impact ? One of the concerns surrounding the Celtics ' trade of Kendrick Perkins was its impact on Rondo since the two were close friends . When a player is mostly intangibles , everything is a discussion point . As a player who had no jumper , did n't get to the line , and shot poorly when he got there , he should have been easy to neutralize . Instead , he was impossible to figure out .
That was before he was unambiguously bad . Before the Playoff Rondo brand was revealed as a carefully crafted Ponzi scheme . Before he discovered how to make passing a selfish act . Before the disastrous spin in Dallas ; the stat-hunting stint in Sacramento , most notable for the shameful night he used an anti-gay slur in reference to referee Billy Kennedy ; and the current slow-motion spiral around the toilet bowl in Chicago . Before he found himself slugging it out with his teammates on social media and coming off the bench . Let 's remember Rondo before all that .
Strange things happen in lockout-shortened seasons . And in strange times , strange players shine . The 2012 Celtics were an aging squad with an uncertain future , dragging themselves forward on bloody elbows and professional pride . The Big Three could still deliver robust Ubuntu-ball , but only in spurts , and signs of wear showed through the furious swagger . Ray Allen was 36 , his silkiness hampered by the jangle of bone spurs in his right ankle . Kevin Garnett was 35 — and an old 35 . His odometer had been ticking off miles since age 19 . Paul Pierce , 34 , limped through the playoffs with a sprained knee ( a real one this time ) . Then there was Rondo , a dynamic , erratic weirdo of a player who could n't throw a basketball into an ocean if he were standing on the shore , yet , somehow , at 6-foot-1 , pulled down rebounds like a power forward . He was a cult figure for basketball fiends and Celtics fans . Yet GM Danny Ainge had tried to trade him for Chris Paul earlier in the season . It speaks to the mysterious nature of Rondo 's game that , even as he was emerging as the team 's best player , Ainge was n't sure he was the guy .
That Celtics team could still hang its headbands , jerseys , shorts , and sneakers on the same stultifying defense that drove the team to 66 wins and the title four years earlier . Only now their offense was trash . The team did n't get to the line and , though a good shooting squad by percentage , did n't produce 3-pointers — two important sources of efficient scoring . They seemed to specialize in wild , backbreaking turnovers . Consequently , they had the worst offensive rating ( 98.9 ; 24th worst in the league ) of any playoff team . The power structure of the East had shifted . The Bulls and Pacers , two smashmouth squads , were on the rise . The Miami Heat stood head , shoulders , and torsos above the entire conference . The Celtics won 39 of their lockout-abbreviated 66 games and gamboled into the postseason as the 4-seed .
The Celtics ' playoff form did little to dispel the notion that they were anything but fish food for the East 's elite . The Josh Smith–Joe Johnson Hawks ( shouts to Larry Drew ) pushed the C 's to six games . The young legs of the eighth-seeded pre-Process Sixers dragged the Celtics to a surprising seventh game before succumbing . Surely the dynamism of LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , and Chris Bosh would have little problem rolling these ancient Celtics .
So it seemed . The Heat won Game 1 by 14 in part by backing off Rondo , daring him to let fly his wobbly jumper or pass . Meanwhile , Miami paid careful attention to Boston 's potent perimeter threats . Pierce , hounded across the landscape like Richard Kimble , shot a dismal 28 percent . Allen finished an uncharacteristic 1-for-7 . Garnett came through with 23 points and 10 burly rebounds , but it was n't enough . Rondo had a near triple-double — 16 points , nine rebounds , and seven assists — but he had taken 20 shots for only the 14th time in his career , including the regular season and playoffs .
Then came Game 2 , and something strange started to happen . Rain fell over Rondo 's acrid jumper . He splashed pull-ups , converted midrange attempts , and made his free throws . He harried Heat players into mistakes , lurking in blind spots to rip steals , three in all . He is wrong-footed the defense by modulating between attack-mode drives and Nashian excursions that wove in and out of screens . Rondo , a profoundly imperfect player , dominated a game that involved no fewer than six future Hall of Famers . He notched 44 points , eight rebounds , 10 assists , and three steals . Yes , the Celtics lost in overtime , but they tasted blood . It would take the Heat seven games to vanquish Boston , with Rondo averaging 20 points , seven rebounds , and 11 assists for the series . Heat coach Erik Spoelstra called Rondo “ a basketball maestro ” and observed that “ his greatness is his unpredictability . ”
We will continue to see players with Rondo 's player profile — Elfrid Payton and Kris Dunn come to mind — but we 'll never see them rise as high . Three-point shooting is simply too important . A perimeter player who ca n't space the floor is a liability . Driving lanes wither and die ; pick-and-rolls become easier to smother . The only worse time to be a guard without a jumper is next year .
When you look at today 's great point guards you notice two things : There are a lot of them ( with more on the way ) and many can shoot the ball until flames burst from their fingertips . And if they 're not great shooters , they have other ways to create efficient offense . James Harden is shooting a relatively average 35 percent from deep this season , but he generates 11 foul shots a game and shoots 85 percent from the stripe . Russell Westbrook 's shooting touch falls off outside of midrange , but his nuclear jets and eagerness to create contact make him among the most destructive players in the league . Giannis Antetokounmpo ca n't really shoot at all , but who cares when you can get to the rim from half court in three steps ?
Meanwhile , this summer 's top point guard prospects are all graduates of Steph Curry University . Markelle Fultz is shooting 42 percent from 3 ; Lonzo Ball is at 43 percent ; Dennis Smith Jr. is at 38 percent . And those who ca n't sling daggers from long range can at least handle their business at the line . Rondo is a career 29 percent 3-point shooter whose free throw touch is a bit better than a coin flip . And yet , somehow , with no discernible offense beyond making layups , Rondo was a contributor on a title team , the hub of a squad that put the fear of death in the league 's elite , and the author of some of the most unusual stat lines in NBA history :
The first Celtic to lead the league in steals ( considering Boston 's history and its many great players )
Tied Isiah Thomas for the most assists in a triple-double when he recorded 10 points , 10 rebounds , and a jaw-dropping 24 assists in a win over the Knicks in 2010
More 20-plus-assist triple-doubles than any other player in the past 30 years
Tied John Stockton 's record with 37 straight games recording at least 10 assists in 2012 ( this stretch also saw some of the most egregious , destructive stat-padding the league has ever seen )
But that 's over now .
On Sunday , Tom Thibodeau 's new team , the Minnesota Timberwolves , choked out his old one , the Chicago Bulls , 117–89 . It was Chicago 's second-worst loss at the Target Center since a 53-point annihilation in 2001 . Jimmy Butler , Dwyane Wade , Nikola Mirotic , and Paul Zipser were out . Rondo came off the bench behind Jerian Grant and scored 10 points , slung six assists , turned the ball over five times , and finished with a minus-20 .
He 's been relegated to backup status more or less since the end of December , he does n't defend , he 's as cantankerous as ever , and he still ca n't shoot . The league has passed him by . Asked in January why he had been benched , Rondo said : “ A member of the staff told me I needed to be saved from myself . … I 've never heard that before in my life . I guess he was trying to do the best thing for me. ” Two weeks later , after a loss to the Hawks , Rondo fired off an Instagram comparing the leadership qualities of the old Celtics Big Three with that of Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade .
The post was a retort to comments made separately by Butler and Wade , after the loss , that put blame on teammates for not playing hard enough . “ The young guys work . They show up , ” Rondo wrote . “ They do n't deserve blame . If anything is questionable , it 's the leadership . ”
Strangely , this episode in the Bulls ' very public implosion is Rondo coming full circle . In 2009 , he was coming into his own under the demanding tutelage of KG , Pierce , and Allen . “ He has a tough job , ” Rivers , himself a former point guard , said at the time . “ He has three guys that probably all want the ball every possession . And he has to be the ‘ no ' guy : ‘ No , not this time . ' ”
Rondo was considered the quiet one then , a much-needed source of restraint on a team laden with big personalities . This was before the well-publicized clashes with Rick Carlisle and the coach 's refusal to relinquish the reins of the Dallas offense . While KG seethed , Pierce talked trash and preened , and Allen obsessed over his shooting routine , Rondo , stone-faced , just played .
The NBA has never been more aesthetically pleasing . But the downside of the 3-point boom is a certain homogeneity . Today , players are interesting because of their size — big men who can shoot 3s or run point ; 6-foot-8 do-everything defensive stoppers . Not having a jumper has always been a problem ; it 's just that now , there 's no solution except to develop a shot .
“ Never get too emotional about the game , ” Rondo said in January 2009 . “ Do n't let the opposing team see if things are going good , how excited I am ; and then when I 'm low they can either talk me out of my game or get me upset or frustrated . I try to always keep an even keel when I 'm out there playing . ”
It was n't that long ago .
A 26-year-old man died after jumping from Running Eagle Falls into a shallow pool at its base/Wikimedia Commons file photo
A 26-year-old man , possibly seeking a cooling respite from a warm spring day , was killed at Glacier National Park in Montana when he jumped from a waterfall into a shallow pool .
The man , whose name and hometown were not immediately released , was pronounced dead Wednesday afternoon at Running Eagle Falls on the east side of the park in the Two Medicine area .
Park dispatchers received a call about 3:45 p.m. Wednesday that the man had jumped into the pool and sustained life-threatening injuries .
`` Park rangers arrived on the scene within minutes of receiving the call and performed CPR . ALERT , Glacier Emergency Services , Blackfeet Emergency Medical Services , Blackfeet Law Enforcement Services and the Glacier County Sherriff 's Department also responded to the scene . The patient was pronounced dead at approximately 4:30 p.m. by advanced life services medical personnel at the scene , '' a park release said .
The initial investigation indicated the man jumped from the waterfall on his own accord and no suspicious circumstances were noted . Park officials did not immediately release details as to how high up on the waterfall he jumped or whether they thought he was swimming .
The victim 's name has not been released pending notification of next of kin . The investigation is on-going . No foul play is suspected .
With a warm spring under way -- temperatures Wednesday were in the 70s -- runoff into the park 's streams is running high and fast and park officials are urging visitors to be cautious around water .
A New Jersey man foiled a robbery at his home thanks to surveillance cameras and free app on his smartphone that alerted him to the break-in and allowed him to yell at the startled burglar through the cameras ' speakers .
Nisarg Swaminarayan , 29 , was eating dinner near his Parlin , N.J. , home with relatives this weekend when he says his Dropcam security system sent an alert to his smartphone , telling him the sliding door of his home had been opened .
`` It 's pitch dark , but these cameras have a night vision , '' Swaminarayan told ABC News ' affiliate WABC-TV .
Surveillance video shows the alleged burglar opening the unlocked sliding glass door and entering the home . While he appears to try to outsmart the homeowner by turning around a surveillance camera , he does n't know two other cameras are rolling and Swaminarayan is watching remotely .
Swaminarayan said he watched as the invader grabbed his electronic equipment , so he tapped into one of the camera 's loudspeakers and screamed . `` I simply told him , ' I can see you , please , leave my home , ' '' he recalled .
It did the trick , scaring away the intruder .
Security expert Chris McGoey said technology like the kind Swaminarayan used is becoming more common .
`` It 's being embraced more and more by the mainstream as situations like this happen and we see proof of their effectiveness , '' McGoey told ABC News .
Thanks to the surveillance footage , police quickly tracked down the suspect , identified by police as Oliver Alavez-Luengas , 22 , who is being held in a New Jersey jail on $ 25,000 bail .
For Swaminarayan , he has a free app , his phone , and a few mounted cameras to thank for stopping the alleged robbery . Total cost : $ 150 .
`` It was a real thing and it happened to me , '' he said .
To say Rodrigo Saravia has had a good month is quite the understatement .
The 22-year-old midfielder was drafted by Crew SC at the 2016 MLS SuperDraft in Baltimore on January 14 , signed his first professional contract with the club on February 4 , was called up by Guatemala 's National Team a day later , and earned his first cap for his country last night .
Saravia went the full 90 in Guatemala 's friendly with Honduras in his hometown , Guatemala City . Wearing number 20 , Saravia played in central midfield helping Los Chapines overcome an early deficit to defeat Honduras 3-1 .
This was Saravia 's second senior call-up and his first since being drafted and signed by the Black & Gold . He was first called up by La Azul y Blanco at the senior level for a camp on July 1 , 2015 . Prior to his senior team experience , Saravia was also called-up by the Guatemala Under-23 and Under-20 national teams .
Saravia is the 10th member of Crew SC 's current roster to earn a senior National Team call-up while under the direction of Sporting Director and Head Coach Gregg Berhalter . Overall , of the 26 players currently on the Black & Gold active roster , 15 have received a senior National Team call-up throughout their careers ( Harrison Afful , Corey Ashe , Sergio Campbell , Conor Casey , Ethan Finlay , Waylon Francis , Kei Kamara , Ola Kamara , Emil Larsen , Cedrick Mabwati , Justin Meram , Michael Parkhurst , Rodrigo Saravia , Tony Tchani , Wil Trapp ) .
Before being drafted 19th overall at the 2016 MLS SuperDraft , Saravia played four seasons at Florida Gulf Coast University , making 67 appearances ( 65 starts ) with two goals and seven assists . In 2015 , he was named the Atlantic Sun Conference Player of the Year as well as named First Team All-Atlantic Sun Conference for the second consecutive season .
Saravia 's next chance to represent his country could come against the United States . Guatemala will face the Stars and Stripes in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification . The two teams will meet at the Estadio Mateo Flores in Guatemala City on March 25 . Four days later , on March 29 , they will square off in Columbus at MAPFRE Stadium . Tickets for the 7 p.m. match go on sale to the general public tomorrow .
“ Do I contradict myself ? Very well then , I contradict myself . ( I am large ; I contain multitudes . ) ” -Walt Whitman
We 're at the end of Atlas Shrugged Part One , so before we dive into Parts Two and Three I think it 's time I cut to the chase and just directly explain the fatal flaw in Ayn Rand 's logical process that causes all the bizarre outcomes in her thinking . Frankly , it 's pretty easy to do , and it can be done using just the three parts ' titles .
In order , they are “ Non-Contradiction , ” “ Either/Or , ” and “ A Is A. ” These are references to the three laws of thought first articulated by Aristotle in the 4th century BC . But Aristotle 's laws come in a different order than the order Rand uses .
The first law is the Law of Identity : A is A . B is B . You are you . Existence exists . It is what it is , and what it is is the most fundamental law . And Ayn saves it for the climax of the book — “ A is A ” is the title of Part Three .
The second law is the Law of Non-Contradiction . A is A , but is A also B ? That depends . Is A definitely not B ? Let 's say A is not B , like if A was sandwiches and B was Mahatma Gandhi . In that case “ A is B ” makes no sense ; it contradicts the truth . But if A is B , like if A was Grover Cleveland and B was 19th Century U.S. Presidents , then “ A is not B ” contradicts the truth .
What if A is “ There is nothing living in the oceans beneath the icy surface of Jupiter 's moon Europa , ” and B is “ There is an advanced civilization of exotic space dolphins living under the surface of Europa ” ? We ca n't say with certainty that either one is true , but we do know that A is not B and they ca n't both be true . A could be true and B could be false , or B could be true and A could be false , or they could both be false if there 's life on Europa but no sentient marine mammals . Any of those truth values resolves the contradiction , yet all we know for sure is that A and B are mutually exclusive .
So “ Non-Contradiction ” is the title of Ayn 's Part One , which concerns Dagny trying to figure out how all the people she admires can be simultaneously ( A ) the most responsible people in the world , and ( B ) abandoning their responsibilities . She must alter her understanding of at least one of these two premises for her situation to make sense , as Francisco & Akston both advise her .
The third law is the Law of the Excluded Middle . What if A was “ There is life on Europa ” and B was “ There is no life on Europa ” ? In this case one must be true and the other must be false . There is no middle ground , there is only Either/Or . And “ Either/Or ” is the name of Atlas Shrugged Part Two .
There is one more logical concept it 's important to mention here . The Fallacy of the Excluded Middle — that 's a false dilemma where you take a statement A and a statement B and treat them like the Law of the Excluded Middle applies when it really does n't . The “ Dead Planet v. Space Dolphins ” proposition has to obey the law of non-contradiction , but it is not strictly an “ either/or ” proposition , it 's a “ this , that , or the other ” proposition .
And pretty much all of the things that ruin Atlas Shrugged can be traced back to this distinction . Ayn Rand chronically commits the Fallacy of the Excluded Middle when she thinks she 's applying the Law of the Excluded Middle . The sorry bastards who live in the Randverse are doomed by their cruel authorial God to live in a universe of strictly either/or choices , forever blind to the vast multiverse of “ this , that , or the other ” options that exists outside the “ laws ” of Ayn Rand 's thinking .
So way back in the About the Book post , I mentioned that Rand defines art as “ a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist 's metaphysical value judgements. ” And at first glance , “ a selective recreation ” seems to mean that there is more to reality than an artist can possibly know , so the artist makes some imperfect decisions about what she believes is true , and then based on those decisions creates an incomplete model of reality that will ( hopefully ) convey some truth nonetheless .
But at least when she applied it to herself , I do n't think Rand actually meant it like that . Reading Atlas Shrugged you get the impression that she earnestly believed she had applied the classical laws of thought to reality with such rigor that she had abolished all false value judgments from her mind , so that her re-creation of reality would not be selective in the sense of choosing from many things that could be true , but would be selective in the sense of choosing only the things that are true , such that through her selectivity her re-creation of reality would be , in effect , Pure Truth .
This interpretation makes the fact that Rand puts the three laws in the wrong order seem awfully pernicious . In the proper order , the first law is the most universal while the second and third laws are increasingly conditional . But in Rand 's order , the first law is placed misleadingly at the end of this general-to-specific trajectory .
In Part One under the Law of Non-Contradiction , the metaphysical truth of the Randverse could exist in an unspecified statement A , or some statement B that contradicts A , or some other third statement that renders A and B a false choice . That 's where we 've gotten so far .
But in Part Two , under the Law of the Excluded Middle , the metaphysical truth of the Randverse must be either statement A or statement B . And to eliminate the possibility that “ A or B ” is a false choice , Rand must prove that everything except “ A or B ” is a false choice . That 's why , for Rand 's purposes , all the characters have to be caricatures and all the politics have to be parodies . She is deliberately trying to exclude the middle by using the logical tactic of the reductio ad absurdum to invalidate everything outside her argument as being disproved by contradiction .
And this way , in Part Three , when Ayn says “ A is A , ” the trajectory of her logical axioms and her aesthetic choices suggests that what she really means is that in the choice of metaphysical truth values “ A or B , ” the answer is A . A is the truth . The truth is A .
Therefore the ultimate goal of Atlas Shrugged is to make the terms of her statements A and B specific and clear . And metaphysical spoiler alert — A is Objectivism and B is nihilism and by the fallacy of false choices everything that is not A is just a slippery slope towards B .
So if Rand believed that her conclusions were the inevitable result of rigorously applying the three laws of thought to reality , that would explain :
* Why she stopped writing fiction after Atlas Shrugged .
* Why the climax of Atlas Shrugged is literally a philosophical dissertation .
* Why she used the word “ objective ” as the root of her philosophy 's name .
And yet we can see that Rand 's conclusions are premised on false choices between her particular positions and a grab bag of absurdly reductive positions that she vehemently opposes . By posing choices this way , Rand can successfully construct a system of thought that is sufficiently strong enough to be consistent , but per Godel 's incompleteness theorem ( or just by comparing the book to what real life is actually like ) , we know that such a system of thought is incomplete .
As the philosophy professor Douglas Rasmussen puts it in this essay from Ayn Rand 's Atlas Shrugged : A Philosophical and Literary Companion :
Reality is intelligible , and Rand understands this perhaps better than any other philosopher . Yet , she does not fully appreciate the difference between logic and reality and as a result becomes entangled in some serious conceptual knots . It is in avoiding these confusions that the wisdom of Aristotelian tradition 's account of logic remains vitally significant .
True that , Doug . True . That . Ayn does n't use logic to break through historical limits on human knowledge in Atlas Shrugged . She trips over logic and stumbles ass-backwards into metaphysical solipsism in Atlas Shrugged , ultimately mistaking her re-creation of reality for reality itself . Which , dear readers , is why she thought she was the most original thinker alive , even as she was violating the original laws of thought .
Contradiction resolved , bitch .

Jurgen Klopp has told Liverpool he would gladly take the Anfield job - but only on his own terms .
The 48-year-old former Dortmund boss is on sabbatical after stepping down from his job in Germany last season .
He has made it clear he would happily work for the five-time European champions as long as he the unanimous choice to do so and the club also scrap their transfer committee , according to the Daily Mail .

Klopp is regarded alongside Carlo Ancelotti as prime candidates to replace Brendan Rodgers should owner John W Henry and the Fenway Sports Group decide to make a change .

[ LIVERPOOL FORCED TO ERECT SCREEN AROUND TRAINING GROUND TO STOP TACTICS LEAKING OUT ]
However , Rodgers ' inability to dictate his own transfer policy is something Klopp would not tolerate even if he does want to manager one of Europe 's top clubs .
Having taken Dortmund to two Bundesliga titles and a Champions League final , Klopp is in a strong negotiating position and could extend his break until the summer when Pep Guardiola leaves Bayern Munich .
SEATTLE -- When University of Washington athletic director Scott Woodward announced the hiring Chris Petersen as the schools head coach it signaled a change . Under former head coach Steve Sarkisian it was about elite California recruits , other recruits , and then a handful of instate prospects . After his departure and in a few cases while he was at UW it was revealed that Sarkisian and local prep recruits were n't exactly on the same page .
L-R ( Morgan Richey , Max Richmond , Budda Baker , Shane Bowman )
In just two months Petersen and his staff flipped Budda Baker from Oregon , Shane Bowman from Oregon State and convinced three-star offensive tackle Morgan Richey and running back/defensive back Max Richmond to walk on . Four players from Bellevue High School bought into Chris Petersen and his style , a trend which Richmond believes will continue .
`` It 's huge for Bellevue because I know UW wants a pipeline to Bellevue and this just started it , '' Richmond told Realdawg.com . `` Landing four in the first Petersen era is huge . Butch likes this staff a lot I know that for sure as he has had a couple former Bellevue players go to Boise State under this staff in Travis Stanaway ( Safety ) and Marcus Henry ( OL ) so we know he likes the staff there a lot . ''
When Baker , ranked as the No.54 player overall by 247Sports in the 2014 class , decommitted from Washington it made the Bellevue quartet realize where they wanted to sign . In a group text amongst the four Baker revealed his plan and it was shortly after the other three made similar decisions .
`` I remember a group text and Budda was letting us know he was going to decommit from Oregon and Shane was like `` how do you decommit bro ? `` , '' said Richmond of the conversation . Bowman , who was committed to Oregon State for almost six months , did not receive an offer from Sarkisian so the thought never crossed his mind .
Once Bowman and Baker made their decisions it was up to Richey and Richmond to decide where they wanted to go . Both received walk-on offers from Washington and chose to stay home over other options .
`` After we knew Shane and Budda were going to go to UW then came me and Morgan who met with the coaching staff and we were like why leave ? We all made it pretty clear to each other a week before we were all going to commit there ! So in a way it fell into place but it also kinda was planned , I mean it was huge for there to be four of us to go to the Dub . ''
For Richmond the decision was rather easy with his family history lathered with purple and gold .
`` Both of my parents went to the UW and my grandparents went there and it seems to just be the right fit . My best friend is Budda Baker and he has been my best friend since 5th grade and I 've always competed with him at an extremely high level . And when he decided he was going to go there along with 2 other Bellevue players Shane Bowman and Morgan Richey , I thought to myself this is a great opportunity and I want to take this route .
`` It 's a great education there at the University of Washington and I absolutely love the new staff . I had other schools I could of played for such as Idaho , UNLV , Montana , and Nevada but I wanted to compete with the best because I know I can compete with all these PAC12 players . ''
With all four bound for UW what does the future hold for instate prospects . According to Richmond Petersen will land a lot more instate recruits than under the previous regime .
`` Oh way more and not just Bellevue kids , but I believe a lot more in state recruits will be landed , '' he said . `` Every player around the area is attracted to coach Pete and not a lot liked coach Sark from what I heard . Who would n't want to play for Petersen ? ''
Washington has their eye on several 2015 and 2016 instate prospects . While Petersen 's approach might drive the fans craving early commitments crazy he makes it worth while in the end .
The state of Washington prep stars are enamored with Petersen and that spells nothing but good news for the first year coach at UW .
Nine years on , the Boys from the Dwarf are back … in Weatherfield . Here 's an exclusive first look at the new series
It 's cold outside … but the Boys from the Dwarf have finally found somewhere with some kind of atmosphere . Nine years on from the frustrating final episode , here 's our first glimpse of the all-new Red Dwarf . We 've got a clip of the new three-part story Back to Earth , due to air over Easter on Dave . And it 's Earth , Dave , and exactly as we know it , actually .
The new episodes take the Boys back to a modern-day Earth . Partially to provide some Galactica-style closure to the saga , but mainly because , with the sets long since torn down and the meagre budget of a digital channel , it was the only way they could do it .
This much we know : Kochanski has died ( that noise was a million fanboys whooping ) . Rimmer has aged ( a double downer , since holograms are n't meant to ) . And since Lister left a bath running for nine years , Holly is water-logged and still drying out ( so apparently no Norman Lovett or Hattie Hayridge ) .
And somehow , they 'd found themselves in Weatherfield . That 's Starbug zipping through Coronation Street ( did you spot Dev 's kebab shop and Peter Barlow 's bookies ? ) So chances are , Lister 's going to meet some intergalactic genetic double in the form of cabbie Lloyd Mullaney . What can be going on here ? A reality warp ? Some kind of fiction actualiser ? An ill-advised bout of fourth-wall breaking ?
Time travel 's somehow involved , and Rimmer knows all about the X Factor . Why so bitter ? Could a failed pop career be one of his manifold broken dreams in some other reality ? Could Rimmer really be a descendant of Leon Jackson ? There are just a few weeks until we find out .
Back to Earth is on Friday 10 April 2009 at 9pm on Dave .
Amazon has secured a patent on a key technology for self-driving cars to manage highways . The technology allows for autonomous vehicles to navigate reversible lanes , lanes where traffic can flow in either direction based on traffic signals that , currently , most self-driving cars can not read .
Amazon has found a way around the problem as their technology allows autonomous cars to interface with other self-driving vehicles to learn and adapt to the flow of traffic .
`` The roadway management system can identify a period of time and a particular lane of the roadway that is best suited to assign to the autonomous vehicle while taking into account an outcome directive , '' an Amazon tech expert told Geekwire .
The patent was filed November 2015 and deals primarily with autonomous vehicles sharing information , such as lane direction and guidance . Amazon 's patent reads that it extends to `` any type of vehicle , '' including aircraft and boats .
Amazon has been working to exert more control over the post-sale process of items on their website . They created Amazon Logistics in 2012 to handle order delivery in the United Kingdom . In December 2016 , they purchased thousands of truck trailers to control the movement of goods between their warehouses . When autonomous cars become viable , Amazon , like every other freight carrier , would save money by automating their fleet of delivery vehicles .

While Amazon has been quiet in their development of autonomous driving technology , in comparison to companies like Uber and Tesla Motors , the new patent reveals a vested interest in autonomous technologies by the e-commerce titan . Unconfirmed rumors state that they have been quietly developing self-driving vehicles out of their drone division , Prime Air .
Amazon has been working on a network of autonomous systems meant to allow them to coordinate every aspect of the services . These moves are stated to provide for a decrease in traffic and an increase in safety . Many automakers are looking into similar technologies for their own self-driving vehicles , but Amazon 's network would be more universal , and accessible by any vehicle , regardless of carmaker .
An estimated 4 million Americans are employed as either truck or cab drivers , including services such as Uber and Lyft . When transport becomes fully automated , widespread unemployment is predicted to occur .

Free Women 's Clinic
SANTA BARBARA , Calif. - A Santa Barbara non-profit is dealing with an increase of homeless women in the city .
Executive Director Maria Long of Doctors Without Walls -- Santa Barbara Street Medicine said women are the largest growing segment of the homeless population .
`` Women , especially older women , have not been able to retain jobs , maybe their spouses died , and their earning potential is n't great , so they do n't have that extra safety net , '' Long said .
Santa Barbara Street Medicine offers a free women 's clinic three Fridays a month .
Women are picked up from homeless shelters and various locations throughout the city in a van and brought to a safe haven with several volunteers , including doctors and nurses .
`` It 's a safe place for women to come get medical care , take a shower , and get their laundry done , '' Long said .
The women also get a meal donated by the Organic Soup Kitchen and are connected to social services .
There is also a sense of camaraderie and friendship .
`` These women are beautiful , '' said volunteer nurse practitioner Jorie Nilson . `` They have a lot to say . They have lives and they have stories and we share . ''
Nilson befriended a homeless woman who came to the clinic every week for years . She was known as 'Mary ' and suffered from amnesia following a traumatic brain injury .
Volunteers would pick the 68-year-old up at the downtown library where she often slept .
We believe in treating the whole person . It 's not just the physical , it 's the social and the psychological and we give them everything here , '' Nilson said .
After years of care among several local agencies , 'Mary ' eventually remembered her name , Kayanette Gabrielle , and was reunited with her family .
`` This is not uncommon . It 's a real miracle . There have been other women reconnected with their families , '' said Nilson .
But , as more and more women end up on the streets , the clinic is busier than ever .
Volunteers , doctors and nurses continue to hope for more miracles like Gabrielle 's .

As the debate escalates over how we publicly remember the Civil War following the tragic events in Charlottesville , Virginia , the passionate and contentious disputes have centered on symbols like monuments , street names and flags . According to a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center , at least 1,503 symbols to the Confederacy are displayed in public spaces , mostly in the South and the Border States , but even in decidedly Yankee locales like Massachusetts . Most of these monuments sprang from the Lost Cause tradition that developed in the wake of the war , during the establishment of white supremacist Jim Crow laws around 1900 , and as a response to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s . Those artifacts are not the only way we legitimize and honor the deadly and racist 19th-century rebellion against the United States . Much of the language used in reference to the Civil War glorifies the rebel cause .
The language we turn to in describing the war , from speaking of compromise and plantations , to characterizing the struggle as the North versus the South , or referring to Robert E. Lee as a General , can lend legitimacy to the violent , hateful and treasonous southern rebellion that tore the nation apart from 1861 to 1865 ; and from which we still have not recovered . Why do we often describe the struggle as between two equal entities ? Why have we shown acceptance of the military rank given by an illegitimate rebellion and unrecognized political entity ? In recent years , historians in academia and in the public sphere have been considering these issues .
Historian Michael Landis suggests professional scholars should seek to change the language we use in interpreting and teaching history . He agrees with people like legal scholar Paul Finkelman and historian Edward Baptist when they suggest the Compromise of 1850 be more accurately referred to as an Appeasement . The latter word precisely reflects the sway that Southern slaveholders held in the bargain . Landis goes on to suggest that we call plantations what they really were—slave labor camps ; and drop the use of the term , “ the Union. ” A common usage in the 19th century to be sure , but now we only use “ the Union ” in reference to the Civil War and on the day of the State of the Union address . A better way to speak of the nation during the war , he argues , is to use its name , the United States .
In the same way , we could change the way we refer to secessionist states . When we talk of the Union versus the Confederacy , or especially when we present the strife as the North versus the South , we set up a parallel dichotomy in which the United States is cast as equal to the Confederate States of America . But was the Confederacy really a nation and should we refer to it as such ?
When historian Steven Hahn participated in the 2015 History Film Forum at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of American History , he noted that using these customary terms to tell the story of the Civil War —Hahn suggests we use “ War of the Rebellion ” —lends legitimacy to the Confederacy .
“ If you think about it , ” Hahn said , “ nobody in the world recognized the Confederacy . The question is can you be a state if no one says you are a state ? ”
Of course , international recognition and support for the rebellion was intensely important to secessionist leaders , not just because Jefferson Davis desired the military backing of Great Britain and other European nations , but because they sought the legitimacy that came with it . Hahn says that President Abraham Lincoln and his administration believed that its leaders did n't have the right to leave the United States or the authority to take their states with them . Looking at leaders like Lincoln during the war and Frederick Douglass in its aftermath , it is apparent that the concept of being careful about the terms we use to describe the period is not a new challenge . In his writings , Lincoln referred to the group he was fighting as the “ so-called Confederacy ” and Jefferson Davis never as president , only as the “ insurgent leader . ”
And if the so-called Confederacy was n't a country , but rather what political scientists would call a proto-state , because not a single foreign government in the entire world recognized it as a nation-state , then could Jefferson Davis legitimately be a president ? Could Robert E. Lee be a General ?
The highest rank Lee achieved in the United States Army was colonel , so given his role as general in service to a failed revolution by a group of rebels , how should we now refer to him ?
It would be just as accurate to refer to Lee , who led an armed group against national sovereignty , as an insurgent or a warlord , if not a terrorist . Imagine how different it would be for a school-age child to learn about the War of the Rebellion if we altered the language we use .
When news reports about the debate over monuments say “ Today the City Council met to consider whether to remove a statue commemorating General Robert E. Lee , commander of the Confederate Army , ” what if they instead were written in this way : “ Today the City Council debated removing a statue of slaveholder and former American army colonel Robert E. Lee , who took up arms in the rebellion against the United States by the so-called Confederacy ? ”
Yale historian David Blight , whose book Race and Reunion called for a reexamination of how we remember the war , says our memorializing language and ideology about the Confederacy became a potent revisionist force in how we understand our history . The Lost Cause tradition , which Blight said he always calls “ a set of beliefs in search of a history , more than actually a history , ” revolves around an “ idea that there was one Confederacy , and there was this noble struggle to the end to defend their sovereignty , and to defend their land and to defend their system , until they could defend it no more . And that image has been reinforced over the intervening years in popular literature and in films like Birth of a Nation , and Gone with the Wind , and the many monuments as well as the use of the Confederate flag . ”
Frederick Douglass was , Blight says , “ acutely aware that the postwar era might ultimately be controlled by those who could best shape interpretations of the war itself . ”
Just a few years after the war , Douglass had already begun to see that the losers of the war were winning the peace because he felt that the American people were “ destitute of political memory. ” Douglass often referred to the war as a “ rebellion ” and was careful not to speak of the rebels in any honorific way , and pledged himself to never forgive the South and to never forget the meaning of the war . On Memorial Day in 1871 at the Civil War Unknown Monument at Arlington National Cemetery , Douglass ' speech was resolute :
We are sometimes asked in the name of patriotism to forget the merits of this fearful struggle , and to remember with equal admiration those who struck at the nation 's life , and those who struck to save it—those who fought for slavery and those who fought for liberty and justice . I am no minister of malice . . . I would not repel the repentant , but . . . may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I forget the difference between the parties to that . . . bloody conflict . . . I may say if this war is to be forgotten , I ask in the name of all things sacred what shall men remember ?
As Douglass was already concerned that the victors were losing the war of historical memory to the supposedly vanquished , I am not sure that he would have been surprised that not far from where he stood at the national cemetery—often considered the nation 's most hallowed ground—a Confederate memorial would be built in the early 20th century to the insurgents he felt “ struck at the nation 's life . ”
Douglass knew , day-by-day , after the shooting stopped , a history war was playing out . It is clearly not over yet . Words , though they do not stand as marble and bronze memorials in parks and in front of buildings or fly on flagpoles , are perhaps even more powerful and pernicious . The monuments we 've built with language may , in fact , be even more difficult to tear down .
UPDATE : 9/18/2017 : A previous version of this article misidentified the location of the 1871 Frederick Douglass speech , which took place at the Civil War Unknown Monument , not the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier .
The Next Car Game Makes $ 1 million in a Week
The Next Car Game , by Bugbear Studios is in its alpha stage and is , as of now , more or less a tech demo with a few really cool game modes . Nevertheless , the people will buy what they want , and it seems that is The Next Car Game . Alpha/Beta/Early access games have been a major hit recently , with games like DayZ , Rust , and this game . It seems they all sell really well and people seem to have faith in these early products , and have no problem spending some money on an unfinished game .
Throughout the website and Steam sales , The Next Car Game has totaled a million dollars in just a week , wow . For a game that is in an alpha stage , that is a good amount of money to keep the developers adding more and more content to the future of the game , however it turns out . The game is also in the top sellers chart in Steam and is quite popular among players and the YouTube community .
Hopefully sales keep up , and we see the game developed into a more full-fledged experience , rather than an awesome tech demo .

PUNE : A 28-year-old mentally ill patient allegedly beat to death two other patients at the Regional Mental Hospital at Yerawada here during a brawl late on Wednesday.A complaint of murder has been lodged against Deepak Suravase , a patient of substance-induced psychosis.The victims — Baburao Pandurang Landge ( 38 ) from Satara and Shamshuddin Sawaji Bhanwadia ( 52 ) from Pune — were being treated for schizophrenia at the hospital 's male observation ward . Landge , who had earlier been treated at the hospital , was re-admitted on November 12 , while Bhanwadia was admitted on November 19.Suravase is said to have become violent when one of the victims pulled his blanket and the other started shouting and teasing him around 12.05 am , inspector Shivaji Sawant of Yerawada police station said . “ In a fit of anger , Suravase banged Landge 's head on the wall , ” Sawant said . “ He then throttled Bhanwadia before hitting his head on the stone floor . He then beat both of them to death. ” Senior psychiatrist Madhumita Bahale , acting medical superintendent at the Regional Mental Hospital , said Suravase , a resident of Ahmednagar , had developed psychosis due to his addiction to alcohol and ganja . “ He is a patient of polysubstance abuse with psychosis , ” she said . “ He was treated for the same condition in March . His brother had got him admitted to the hospital . He recovered and was discharged , but his brother again brought him back to the hospital a few days back with complaints of irritability and violent behaviour. ” Bahale said Suravase is being treated with anti-psychotic drugs and injectibles . “ He was showing normal behaviour with the treatment , ” she said . “ However , he suddenly went into a blind rage when he was teased by Landge and Bhanwadia. ” Asked why the attendants at the ward did not stop Suravase , Bahale said : “ There were three attendants on the night shift , who were posted outside the ward . They 'd ensured all the patients in the ward had gone to sleep . However , the fight broke out suddenly . By the time one of the attendants came there , Suravase had already killed the two men. ” Asked why the hospital authorities , despite knowing Suravase 's violent behaviour , had not isolated him for treatment , Bahale said : “ The observation ward is meant for patients who get irritable and violent due to mental illness like schizophrenia , psychosis and substance-induced mental illness . Once admitted , they 're immediately put on anti-psychotic drugs and injectibles , which calm them down . We observe their response to the medication for up to 15 days . We shift them to regular wards with others only when we 're convinced their response to the medication is good . Those who continue to show violent behaviour despite medication are shifted to wards meant for such patients , where they 're kept away from others. ” Deputy commissioner of police ( Zone IV ) Manoj Patil said the hospital employees told the police they did not hear any commotion from the ward where the attacks took place . “ We 'll also check the duty registers of the hospitals , ” he said . “ We 'll also investigate whether there was any lapse on the part of the hospital staff. ” The killings have brought into focus the issue of inadequate number of attendants at the mental hospital , which is the largest in the state . Of the 480 sanctioned posts for attendants , over 50 have been vacant at the 2,400-bed hospital for the last couple of years . As many as 1,650 patients are currently being treated at the hospital.Similar cases of patients beating other patients to death were reported in 2009 and twice in 2010 .
WANTED IN India for debt default and alleged financial irregularities as detailed in the recent Serious Frauds Office report , Vijay Mallya may have some more explaining to do . Paradise Papers investigated by The Indian Express show that after he sold his United Spirits Limited India ( USL ) to the Diageo group in 2013 , Diageo approached a London-based law firm Linklaters LLP to undertake a massive restructuring exercise to simplify the complex group structure created by Mallya .
Advertising
One reason for the complexity of the holding structure , records show , appears to have been aimed at a single objective — allegedly diverting funds through USL Holdings Ltd ( BVI ) , an entity in a tax haven ( British Virgin Islands ) ; and three subsidiaries in the UK . These were USL Holdings ( UK ) Ltd ; United Spirits ( UK ) Ltd and United Spirits ( Great Britain ) Limited ( UK ) .
Documents from Appleby , which worked with Linklaters on the restructuring , show that funds amounting to over $ 1.5 billion were funnelled , as debt , into these four subsidiaries over a period of seven years till 2014 .

Two years after they took control of United Spirits , Diageo undertook a restructuring process to get rid of these three intermediate subsidiaries and so , effectively , ended up waiving the $ 1.5-billion debt owed by these subsidiary companies .
That 's not all . As part of the restructuring , records show , Diageo also absolved Watson Limited , an entity owned by Mallya in his personal capacity , of its dues to a USL group company to the tune of 4.4 million pounds ( around $ 5.8 million ) through an exercise called novation — substituting one party in a contract with another , or replacing one debt or obligation with another .
The $ 1.5-billion loan waiver and the novation seems to have resulted in Mallya taking away much more than the Rs 1,225 crore that Diageo reported to BSE – the amount actually works out to around Rs 10,000 crore going by Appleby documents .
While Diageo approached Linklaters LLP for the restructuring process , the law firm in turn approached Appleby and sought assistance in getting authorisations for the Mauritius-based Watson Ltd to complete the transaction .
EXPLAINED : Why the Paradise Papers matter
Appleby documents confirm Diageo 's intent : “ the purpose of the Reorganisation is to settle the inter-company loan balances . ”
This is also corroborated by a stock exchange disclosure made by USL after the Diageo takeover . Diageo 's internal probe conclusively found that funds had been diverted between October 2010 and July 2014 . “ These improper transactions identified in the additional inquiry involved , in most cases , the diversion of funds to overseas and Indian entities that appear to be affiliated or associated with USL 's former non-executive chairman Vijay Mallya , ” USL said in a stock exchange notice in July 2016 .
While USL maintained that the company Board has directed the management to pursue recovery from the relevant companies and individuals and undertake any action including legal and regulatory as deemed necessary , the company ultimately seems to have waived the loan .
When asked by The Indian Express on why it had waived the loan , a Diageo spokesperson said that as per March 31 , 2015 , it had granted interest-free loans in foreign currency amounting to Rs 4,941 crore and Rs 4793 crore in 2014 to USL Holdings Limited ( BVI ) , a subsidiary , for acquisition of long term strategic investments .
The spokesperson added that a majority of this loan formed part of the company 's net investment in the subsidiaries . “ As the borrowing entity had no operating income/cash flows to repay , the settlement of these loans was neither planned nor likely to occur , ” she said .
“ Accordingly the company has made adequate provisions and appropriate disclosures in its Annual Report for FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17 . The loans were given during the period of FY 2007-08 till FY 2014-15 . ”

Asked how much money was siphoned off by Mallya , the Diageo spokesperson said : “ …Inquiry prima facie revealed instances of actual or potential fund diversions amounting to approximately Rs 913.5 crore as well as other potentially improper transactions involving USL and its Indian and overseas subsidiaries amounting to approximately Rs 311.8 crores that has been intimated to the Bombay Stock Exchange ( on ) July 09 , 2016 . ”
On why the USL Group decided to “ novate ” payment obligation of Watson Ltd ( GBP 4.4 million due to be paid to USL Holdings UK Ltd ) even though Watson Ltd was not a USL Group company , Diageo cited a para from the 2016 Annual Report .
This talks of USL entering into a settlement agreement with Mallya pursuant to which he resigned from his position as a director and chairman of the Company and of the boards of its subsidiaries .

Pursuant to this settlement , USL undertook to Mallya that it shall not bring a civil claim for money , damages or specific performance against the counterparties in relation to matters arising out of the initial inquiry mentioned therein .
Donald Trump 's inability to accept news that disagrees with the view he has of himself and what his administration can accomplish was on display on his first two days as president . He , and those speaking on his behalf , claimed falsely that “ This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration , period , both in person and around the globe , ” and then doubled down even when presented with solid evidence it was n't true .
Americans were told the new administration relies on “ alternative facts , ” which seems to mean whatever numbers it can come up with to support Mr. Trump 's claims .
What worries me , among other things , is how the president will react to bad news about the economy . In the next four years , it will have its ups and downs -- that 's inevitable . The fluctuations could be relatively mild , or they could be severe , but at times the economic news will definitely be disappointing .
White House faces criticism over `` alternative facts ''
When this happens , Mr. Trump can respond in several ways . He can accept the bad news , which seems unlikely . He can also undermine the news by claiming the numbers are fixed by people in government working against him , that the numbers are misleading , or false , and then present his own “ alternative facts. ” If he does this , many people will believe him .
He might even try to underfund or actually eliminate agencies that report things that suggest his administration is n't the best economic machine to ever come to Washington .
But the worst thing he could do -- and I see this as a real danger -- would be to politicize the agencies that produce government economic data , to put people in place that will skew the numbers in his favor . If that happens , the data will be useless , and we 'll essentially be flying blind when it comes to the true state of the economy .
It would also bring a lot of economic research to a screeching halt . Both macro- and microconomists depend greatly on government data for their research .
Unlike the physical sciences , economists for the most part can not do laboratory experiments to generate the data needed for their research . They must rely on government-produced data . Any degradation in the quality and availability of these data would be a setback to economists ' ability to generate new and important knowledge . And remember that microeconomists , who have made important contributions in areas such as health care , social insurance , labor policy and all sorts of other important areas have been far more successful than macroeconomists .
Potential impact of President-elect Trump 's economic plans
It would also hinder economists ' ability to characterize the current state of the economy ( what 's the true unemployment rate ? ) , which is essential for formulating monetary and fiscal policy .
Third-world dictators manipulate data about the economy to make themselves look good . But even if President Trump does n't go that far , undermining public confidence in government data and the research derived from it , cutting funding for data-collection and data-reporting agencies or , in the worst case , politicizing these agencies , would simply be a disaster for economic research . And , perhaps more important , it would destroy Americans ' ability to understand what 's happening in the economy , where it might be headed next and what it could mean for their own lives and ambitions .
Government-generated data is n't perfect , but it 's an honest attempt to provide the best possible window into the state of the economy now and in the past . Although it would be helpful to have more data , not less , the information we have does a great job of informing us about how the economy is performing and helping settle important policy questions , not to mention its value in economic research .
Let 's hope that President Trump 's need for “ alternative facts ” to support his ego does n't result in the loss or obfuscation of this crucial information .

So , you already know about the SVU episode ( if not , check this strip https : //www.kukuruyo.com/comic/gamergate-life-26-english/ ) . Recently , the developer Mark Kern , who worked many times on World of Warcraft , gave the gaming media a scolding about their fault in the creation of the false narrative that led to the SVU http : //theralphretort.com/world-of-warcraft-lead-developer-mark-kern-rips-kotaku-polygon-021215/
After that , he went on to create a petition to Polygon and Kotaku to lead the way to clean the image of the videogame industry https : //www.change.org/p/kotaku-lead-the-way-in-healing-the-rift-in-video-games ? just_created=true
There 's division inside gamergate about if we should sign the petition or not , some want to lend a reconciliation hand , others do n't want those sites to go unpunished , others simply do n't trust them . Personaly i simply think they will ignore the petition no matter how many signs , and one of the reasons i think that is the reaction of several members of the media http : //blogjob.com/oneangrygamer/2015/02/games-journalist-threatens-devs-not-to-support-gamergate-devs-respond/
Essentialy they are saying they do n't have any responsibility in creating the narrative that led to the gamergate SVU episode , nope , any of that was because of their wrongdoing , i 'm sure that treating gamers like if they were misogynysts , violent vile people or even terrorists have n't influenced the script of that episode in the slightest .
There was some talking about it in this stream of female gamergaters https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xVbLNg5eBFE

The site where the Pacheedaht people originated — their Garden of Eden — is stunning .
The Jordan River exits a 500-metre-deep canyon , then tumbles toward the sea through a jumble of immense boulders polished as smooth as beach pebbles .
It was here , about 70 kilometres west of Victoria , in a past so ancient it predates legends of a great flood that inundated the world , that the Pacheedaht took their name from foam on the river .
Today , there 's still foam on the river . It signals not the birth of a people , but the death of their river .
Barely an hour 's drive from where the B.C . government we trust to protect the environment convenes in the capital that prides itself as the City of Gardens , the Pacheedaht 's Garden of Eden has been poisoned for more than 40 years by toxic residues leaching from an abandoned mine .
Salmon runs that supported the original Pacheedaht villages at the river mouth collapsed . Below the mine site with its eroding tailings dumps and litters of rusting debris , the junk-strewn river bottom appears devoid of life .
And the Pacheedaht , forced out of their ancestral homes a century ago , now live 40 km further west around Port Renfrew . Yet , deep emotional attachments to the place from which they came endure .
“ It 's one of our most important sites , ” says Helen Jones , a Pacheedaht fisheries manager who has swum the Jordan River attempting fish counts . The band wants to establish spawning channels in the lower river that could help restore runs , but how effective can that be if contaminants continue to seep upstream ?
After clambering down a steep washout and spending several hours , I saw not one juvenile fish . There were n't even water insects . No waterfowl . The face of the tailings dump was crusted with green scabs . Scummy foam left intricate patterns on the pools . The river bottom was coated with a furry reddish brown .
Between 1962 and 1974 , about 1.5 million tonnes of ore milled in an underground cavern yielded copper , gold and silver . Following a blowout during mining operations in 1963 , the mine flooded . A large volume of material from the mine was ejected onto the banks and into the Jordan River . Operations were restarted , but a decade later abandoned .
Today , copper concentrations downstream from the abandoned mine site consistently exceed levels prohibited under the province 's regulations for contaminated sites . In some cases , concentrations are up to 30 times the maximum allowable standard .
As is often the case with mining ventures , this enterprise , which began in 1915 , shuffled through a Byzantine maze of holding companies , and who knew where legal responsibility might lie ?
Law student Mathew Nefstead at the University of Victoria 's Environmental Law Centre undertook the painstaking detective work through company registries on behalf of Ken Farquharson , who 's been working since 2005 to try to help restore salmon runs to Vancouver Island 's industrially ravaged rivers .
Now , Teck Resources Inc. is being asked to remediate the site by the B.C . government .
Farquharson says that when people interested in saving the river met in 2012 “ everyone was very pessimistic about its future due to the long-term contamination by copper from the mine waste dump . More worryingly , nobody seemed interested in getting the situation corrected . ”
Perhaps he was n't far off . ELC director Calvin Sandborn says the Jordan River is symptomatic of a much bigger problem — the province 's apparent failure to adequately monitor for similar environmental legacies from the mining industry .
He points to a report from the auditor general that said the government 's regulatory performance has been “ highly deficient ” and that it is “ at risk of regulatory capture ” — placing the interests of corporations It 's supposed to regulate before the public 's interests .
“ We 're asking for a review of all the streams in the province , ” Sandborn says .
Nefstead and Sandborn wrote to Teck in 2013 about the Jordan River . On Aug. 25 , 2016 , the province finally ordered a remediation plan for the abandoned mine by June 1 , 2017 .
“ Progress has been slow , ” Farquharson wrote , “ but I believe that improvements for the Jordan River are at last underway . ”
“ We want to breathe life back into that river again , ” says Jones .
Maybe , just maybe , with goodwill from everybody involved , perhaps it 's possible to find a way back to the Garden of Eden .

A massive pentagram erected in a downtown Boca Raton park was plowed over by a vehicle Monday night , marking the fourth time the display has been vandalized since it went up in early December .
Boca Raton Community Middle School teacher Preston Smith erected the 10-foot tall , 300-pound inverted pentagon in a “ free speech zone ” in Sanborn Square on Dec. 7 to counter a nativity scene in the park , WPTV reports .
Breaking details : @ BocaPolice says pentagram was spray painted yesterday afternoon and then torn down at night @ WPTV pic.twitter.com/EZkmHQrEdI — Andrew Ruiz WPTV ( @ AndrewNRuiz ) December 20 , 2016
But over the last few weeks the display – which also includes signs that read “ In Satan we trust . One nation under Antichrist ” and “ May the children hail Satan ” - has been the constant target of vandals who have stolen signs and spray-painted the display . On Monday night , officials found the display toppled over , with tire tracks cutting across the park and into the pentagram , the Sun-Sentinel reports .
Police told the news site they 've responded to the park a total of eight times since Smith put up his pentagram . The display was vandalized on Dec. 12 and Dec. 16 , and officers found a woman attaching a bamboo cross to it on Dec. 17 .
“ The woman said she was at the park for a yoga class and felt a moral obligation to attach the cross , ” the Sun-Sentinel reports . “ The officer removed the cross and explained to the woman that she 'd need a permit to put anything on the pentagram . ”
The pentagram was vandalized again on Sunday , and appeared to have been smashed with a vehicle Monday night .
Karen Slosaski , 30 , was working out downtown when she came across the pentagram , on the ground with tire tracks burned into the grass .
“ If you want to voice your opinion , that 's fine but there are other ways to do it without hurting public grounds , ” she said .
Others honked and cheered from their vehicles as they drove by the destruction .
“ I go on morning walks all the time and I was like , ‘ What the heck is that ? ' ” local Tom Beal , 44 , told the Sun-Sentinel . “ I came over and my girlfriend was with me and we took a picture of it like what is going on here ? ”
Smith has not discussed the recent damage with the media , but he has defended his actions against local parents who are calling on the school board to remove him from his teaching position .
“ 'May the children hail Satan ' is an artistic expression of defiance toward the Sanborn Square nativity scene , which performs an annual reenactment of predatory indoctrination in a public park targeting young children before they have critical thinking skills , ” he told WPTV in a statement .
“ Satan and God are clearly both fictional characters devoid of any verifiable peer-reviewed scientific evidence . ”
Dozens of local residents marched against the “ evil ” display last week , and parents are holding a protest in front of Boca Raton Community Middle School today to demand better for their children .
“ A teacher we entrust our children with should not be putting a sign like this anywhere , ” parent teacher association president Kim Bremer said .
“ I just do n't feel comfortable about it and I do n't agree with it , ” said parent Solange Bush , who tried unsuccessfully to remove her 14-year-old son from Smith 's class .
Boca Raton school officials , meanwhile , refuse to take action against the teacher .
“ We certainly ca n't micro-manage what an individual does outside of the schoolhouse , ” superintendent Robert Avossa told WPTV . “ I am aware of the situation . This is n't the first time this individual has participated in an activity like that . What we do is answer any questions as they come up to the school . ”
In October , German magazine Das Deutsche Waffenjournal ( DWJ ) , which positions itself as a magazine for gun owners , published an article about the fourteenth international firearm training for law enforcement officials .

The training took place in one of the Austrian districts ( Kennelbach near Bregenz ) and was attended by 241 police and bodyguards from 5 countries : Austria , Switzerland , Germany , Luxembourg and Monaco .
DWJ also published a photo depicting figures of President Putin and his bodyguard as targets on a shooting stand . The figures revealed numerous traces of bullets .
© Photo : alles-schallundrauch.blogspot DWJ published a photo depicting figures of President Putin and his bodyguard as targets on a shooting stand
“ I find it more than tasteless that ‘ law enforcement officials ' from the above mentioned countries shoot at a picture of President Putin , ” a journalist wrote for the German web platform Alles Schall und Rauch .
“ What were the organizers in Kennelbach thinking about ? ” the author asked with surprise .
The author added that he can hardly imagine a reverse situation , when one would shoot at figures of Obama or Merkel and use them as targets . The situation would be considered scandalous and would cause outcry among all Western countries .
Last winter I had a few chances to play some pond hockey . However , the outdoor rink near me did n't take care of the ice as well as I would have liked . There were bumps and cracks all over , the ice was n't all that smooth , and at one point we had to shovel off a foot of snow just so we could play . Last year we tried making a rink rake . It was a big success . Well , not really . We did n't have access to a hose , so we had to rely on a couple of 5 gallon buckets of warm water and a ghetto rigging to distribute the water to the rink rake .
This winter I want to be prepared so I tried looking for different ways to cut the ice . After searching the internet for a while , I did n't have much success finding out how to make a homemade Zamboni . Mostly all I could find was how to build a rink rake .
So I built this :
I was fortunate enough to have most of the materials provided for me . I work in a metal plating shop , so I was able to obtain a 55 gallon PVC barrel for water and a pallet to hold the barrel . Basically all I needed to do was purchase some wheels and some PVC attachments for the rink rake we already had .
Here are the materials I purchased to finish the job :
2″ ( threaded ) pvc male adapter
2″ x 3/4″ pressure bushing
3/4″ pvc ball valve
3/4″ 45degree angle pvc elbow
80z low VOC pvc cement ( you will need less than 2oz of this ) … I will refer to this as “ glue ” later in the post
( 2 ) 5″ swivel caster tire
( 2 ) 4″ fixed caster tire
( 16 ) 2-3″ zinc plated screws ( make sure to purchase ones with a big head or you can purchase washers )
( 2 ) 6′ x 2″ nylon ratchet tie down
I also had a bunch of extra 3/4″ pvc pipe that I cut off the rink rake that was previously made .
Step 1
Take the 2″ pvc male adapter , glue the inside of the non-threaded side with pvc cement . Place the 2″ side of the 2″x 3/4″ pressure bushing inside of the 2″ pvc male adapter ( the side that you just put the pvc cement in ) .
Once that is finished , glue the inside ( 3/4″ inch side ) of the 2″x 3/4″ pressure bushing . Place about a 3″ piece of 3/4″ pvc pipe inside the 3/4″ inch side of the 2″x3/4″ pressure bushing .
Next , take the 3/4″ pvc ball valve and , very carefully , put a thin layer of glue on the inside of either side of the valve…
The reason why I say carefully is you DO NOT want the ball of the ball valve to get any glue on it , otherwise it will lock up and you may have to start all over again .
… slowly push the glued side of the 3/4″ ball valve on to the rest of the fixture you made previously in this step .
Last , carefully glue a thin layer on the inside of the other side of the 3/4″ ball valve . Take about a 2″ piece of 3/4″ pvc pipe and slowly push it into the 3/4″ ball valve .
Step 2
* This step is up to you * . I decided to glue a 3/4″ 45-degree angle pvc elbow TO THE REST OF THE FIXTURE made above . I did this so that I could detach the rink rake in case I wanted to use the rake with out the whole Zamboni . If you want , you can just glue the 45degree elbow to the rink rake . I would glue the angled elbow on the fixture ( to hold a little better than just shoving it on ) rather than glue the elbow on the rink rake . Of course , the choice is yours .
Step 3
Flip the pallet upside down . The pallet I had was about 4′ tall ( the barrel was about 3′ tall ) and2′ wide . It had 4 , 2x4s on top for support . This worked out perfectly because the barrel rested perfectly in between the 2 middle 2x4s .
First , take the 5″ swivel caster tires and place them about an inch away from the base of the board on the bottom of the pallet ( see picture for reference ) . Screw the wheels on with either a wide head 2″ – 3″ screw or use a washer for a screw with a small head . Do this to all 4 holes on each wheel .
Then , place the 4″ fixed caster tires perpendicular to the board on the bottom of the pallet that you are screwing them to . Place the tires about 3-4″ inches away from the outside edge of the pallet . Keep in mind , you 'll want this to look somewhat similar to the wheels on a shopping cart . Screw these down the same way mentioned above .
The reason why you want one set of wheels an inch bigger is to create just enough water pressure to the rink rake . I will repeat this later , but it is important that the larger wheels swivel and the smaller wheels are fixed because you will be pulling the Zamboni . If you think about if it is the opposite set up of a shopping cart because you are pulling the “ shopping cart ” rather than pushing it .
This is what the finished product looks like :
A couple of side notes to mention :
You can build this on a lot smaller scale , this is meant to coat around a 100'x100′ surface . With that said , make sure the materials you get ( eg . the pallet and tires ) can support the weight of water in your container . For example , the pallet I used holds two full ( 55 gallon ) barrels of liquid , the 5″ and 4″wheels support up to 330lbs each . With that said , a gallon of water weighs approximately 8.33-8.34lbs .

Suppose you want to bake binary data directly into a program 's executable . It could be image pixel data ( PNG , BMP , JPEG ) , a text file , or some sort of complex data structure . Perhaps the purpose is to build a single executable with no extraneous data files — easier to install and manage , though harder to modify . Or maybe you 're lazy and do n't want to worry about handling the various complications and errors that arise when reading external data : Where to find it , and what to do if you ca n't find it or ca n't read it . This article is about two different approaches I 've used a number of times for C programs .
The linker approach
The simpler , less portable option is to have the linker do it . Both the GNU linker and the gold linker ( ELF only ) can create object files from arbitrary files using the -- format ( -b ) option set to binary ( raw data ) . It 's combined with -- relocatable ( -r ) to make it linkable with the rest of the program . MinGW supports all of this , too , so it 's fairly portable so long as you stick to GNU Binutils .
For example , to create an object file , my_msg.o with the contents of the text file my_msg.txt :
$ ld -r -b binary -o my_file.o my_msg.txt
The object file will have three symbols , each named after the input file . Unfortunately there 's no control over the symbol names , section ( .data ) , alignment , or protections ( e.g . read-only ) . You 're completely at the whim of the linker , short of objcopy tricks .
$ nm my_msg.o 000000000000000e D _binary_my_msg_txt_end 000000000000000e A _binary_my_msg_txt_size 0000000000000000 D _binary_my_msg_txt_start
To access these in C , declare them as global variables like so :
extern char _binary_my_msg_txt_start [ ] ; extern char _binary_my_msg_txt_end [ ] ; extern char _binary_my_msg_txt_size ;
The size symbol , _binary_my_msg_txt_size , is misleading . The “ A ” from nm means it 's an absolute symbol , not relocated . It does n't refer to an integer that holds the size of the raw data . The value of the symbol itself is the size of the data . That is , take the address of it and cast it to an integer .
size_t size = ( size_t ) & _binary_my_msg_txt_size ;
Alternatively — and this is my own preference — just subtract the other two symbols . It 's cleaner and easier to understand .
size_t size = _binary_my_msg_txt_end - _binary_my_msg_txt_start ;
Here 's the “ Hello , world ” for this approach ( hello.c ) .
# include < stdio.h > extern char _binary_my_msg_txt_start [ ] ; extern char _binary_my_msg_txt_end [ ] ; extern char _binary_my_msg_txt_size ; int main ( void ) { size_t size = _binary_my_msg_txt_end - _binary_my_msg_txt_start ; fwrite ( _binary_my_msg_txt_start , size , 1 , stdout ) ; return 0 ; }
The program has to use fwrite ( ) rather than fputs ( ) because the data wo n't necessarily be null-terminated . That is , unless a null is intentionally put at the end of the text file itself .
And for the build :
$ cat my_msg.txt Hello , world ! $ ld -r -b binary -o my_msg.o my_msg.txt $ gcc -o hello hello.c my_msg.o $ ./hello Hello , world !
If this was binary data , such as an image file , the program would instead read the array as if it were a memory mapped file . In fact , that 's what it really is : the raw data memory mapped by the loader before the program started .
How about a data structure dump ?
This could be taken further to dump out some kinds of data structures . For example , this program ( table_gen.c ) fills out a table of the first 90 Fibonacci numbers and dumps it to standard output .
# include < stdio.h > # define TABLE_SIZE 90 long long table [ TABLE_SIZE ] = { 1 , 1 } ; int main ( void ) { for ( int i = 2 ; i < TABLE_SIZE ; i ++ ) table [ i ] = table [ i - 1 ] + table [ i - 2 ] ; fwrite ( table , sizeof ( table ) , 1 , stdout ) ; return 0 ; }
Build and run this intermediate helper program as part of the overall build .
$ gcc -std=c99 -o table_gen table_gen.c $ ./table_gen > table.bin $ ld -r -b binary -o table.o table.bin
And then the main program ( print_fib.c ) might look like :
# include < stdio.h > extern long long _binary_table_bin_start [ ] ; extern long long _binary_table_bin_end [ ] ; int main ( void ) { long long * start = _binary_table_bin_start ; long long * end = _binary_table_bin_end ; for ( long long * x = start ; x < end ; x ++ ) printf ( `` % lld
`` , * x ) ; return 0 ; }
However , there are some good reasons not to use this feature in this way :
The format of table.bin is specific to the host architecture ( byte order , size , padding , etc. ) . If the host is the same as the target then this is n't a problem , but it will prohibit cross-compilation . The linker has no information about the alignment requirements of the data . To the linker it 's just a byte buffer . In the final program the long long array will not necessarily align properly for its type , meaning the above program might crash . The Right Way is to never dereference the data directly but rather memcpy ( ) it into a properly-aligned variable , just as if the data was an unaligned buffer . The data structure can not use any pointers . Pointer values are meaningless to other processes and will be no different than garbage .
Towards a more portable approach
There 's an easy way to address all three of these problems and eliminate the reliance on GNU linkers : serialize the data into C code . It 's metaprogramming , baby .
In the Fibonacci example , change the fwrite ( ) in table_gen.c to this :
printf ( `` int table_size = % d ;
`` , TABLE_SIZE ) ; printf ( `` long long table [ ] = {
`` ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < TABLE_SIZE ; i ++ ) printf ( `` % lldLL ,
`` , table [ i ] ) ; printf ( `` } ;
`` ) ;
The output of the program becomes text :
int table_size = 90 ; long long table [ ] = { 1LL , 1LL , 2LL , 3LL , / * ... * / 1779979416004714189LL , 2880067194370816120LL , }
And print_fib.c is changed to :
# include < stdio.h > extern int table_size ; extern long long table [ ] ; int main ( void ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < table_size ; i ++ ) printf ( `` % lld
`` , table [ i ] ) ; return 0 ; }
Putting it all together :
$ gcc -std=c99 -o table_gen table_gen.c $ ./table_gen > table.c $ gcc -std=c99 -o print_fib print_fib.c table.c
Any C compiler and linker could do all of this , no problem , making it more portable . The intermediate metaprogram is n't a barrier to cross compilation . It would be compiled for the host ( typically identified through HOST_CC ) and the rest is compiled for the target ( e.g . CC ) .
The output of table_gen.c is n't dependent on any architecture , making it cross-compiler friendly . There are also no alignment problems because it 's all visible to compiler . The type system is n't being undermined .
Dealing with pointers
The Fibonacci example does n't address the pointer problem — it has no pointers to speak of . So let 's step it up to a trie using the trie from the previous article . As a reminder , here it is :
# define TRIE_ALPHABET_SIZE 4 # define TRIE_TERMINAL_FLAG ( 1U < < 0 ) struct trie { struct trie * next [ TRIE_ALPHABET_SIZE ] ; struct trie * p ; int i ; unsigned flags ; } ;
Dumping these structures out raw would definitely be useless since they 're almost entirely pointer data . So instead , fill out an array of these structures , referencing the array itself to build up the pointers ( later filled in by either the linker or the loader ) . This code uses the in-place breadth-first traversal technique from the previous article .
void trie_serialize ( struct trie * t , const char * name ) { printf ( `` struct trie % s [ ] = {
`` , name ) ; struct trie * head = t ; struct trie * tail = t ; t - > p = NULL ; size_t count = 0 ; while ( head ) { printf ( `` { ​ { `` ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < TRIE_ALPHABET_SIZE ; i ++ ) { struct trie * next = head - > next [ i ] ; const char * comma = i ? `` , `` : `` '' ; if ( next ) { / * Add child to the queue . * / tail - > p = next ; tail = next ; next - > p = NULL ; / * Print the pointer to the child . * / printf ( `` % s % s + % zu '' , comma , name , ++ count ) ; } else { printf ( `` % s0 '' , comma ) ; } } printf ( `` } , 0 , 0 , % u } ,
`` , head - > flags & TRIE_TERMINAL_FLAG ) ; head = head - > p ; } printf ( `` } ;
`` ) ; }
Remember that list of strings from before ?
AAAAA ABCD CAA CAD CDBD
Which looks like this ?
That serializes to this C code :
struct trie root [ ] = { { ​ { root + 1 , 0 , root + 2 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { root + 3 , root + 4 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { root + 5 , 0 , 0 , root + 6 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { root + 7 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , root + 8 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { root + 9 , 0 , 0 , root + 10 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { 0 , root + 11 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { root + 12 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , 0 , root + 13 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 1 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 1 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , 0 , root + 14 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { root + 15 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 0 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 1 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 1 } , { ​ { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , 0 , 0 , 1 } , } ;
This trie can be immediately used at program startup without initialization , and it can even have new nodes inserted into it . It 's not without its downsides , particularly because it 's a trie :
It 's really going to blow up the size of the binary , especially when it holds lots of strings . These nodes are anything but compact . If the code is compiled to be position-independent ( -fPIC ) , each of those nodes is going to hold multiple dynamic relocations , further exploding the size of the binary and preventing the trie from being shared between processes . It 's 24 bytes per relocation on x86-64 . This will also slow down program start up time . With just a few thousand strings , the simple test program was taking 5x longer to start ( 25ms instead of 5ms ) than with an empty trie . Even without being position-independent , the linker will have to resolve all the compile-time relocations . I was able to overwhelm linker and run it out of memory with just some tens of thousands of strings . This would make for a decent linker stress test .
This technique obviously does n't scale well with trie data . You 're better off baking in the flat string list and building the trie at run time — though you could compute the exact number of needed nodes at compile time and statically allocate them ( in .bss ) . I 've personally had much better luck with other sorts of lookup tables . It 's a useful tool for the C programmer 's toolbelt .

The film has n't officially been confirmed as yet , but the 40-year-old hunk is optimistic that Warner Bros. - who produced the last two films - are keen to greenlight a third film .
He added : 'Warner Bros. have still got to agree to pay for it ... I think they want to ! '
It 's elementary , my dear Watson : The Dom Hemingway actor has revealed the third installment of the series is currently in the process of being written
Guy Ritchie has reportedly signed on to direct the film and is keen to base the production in Los Angeles , while I ron Man 3 writer Drew Pearce has been tapped to pen the script .
A source told The Sun earlier this year : 'Guy has loved making the movies and he gets on really well with all the cast .
'But Robert had to spend large parts of the year in the UK filming so will probably welcome the move back home . He loves the UK , and London in particular but having home comforts close by is such a big bonus . '
Back together : And it may not be long before the 40-year-old star reprises his role as Dr. Watson alongside Robert Downey Jr , who plays the iconic English detective
Jude has made no secret of his desire to be involved with a third installment in the franchise .
He told the November issue of Empire magazine : ' I think Warners want it and there 's a lot of want from us as a team . We want it to be better than the other two . We want to make sure it 's smarter and cleverer , but in the same realm .
'It 's a slow process . We 're all busy . So getting us together to try to nail that has taken a little bit longer than we had hoped . '
Sony Corp has officially announced its entry in the 3D television game , launching its first line of Bravia flatscreen TVs for sale in Japan beginning in June . Other announcements will follow as Sony joins electronics giants like Panasonic and Samsung in chasing a 3D marketplace that Sony expects will immediately become responsible for 10 % of its sales in the next year .
The big question I have Is Sony indebted to James Cameron , beyond what his film Avatar has done to stoke 3D demand ?
To hear Cameron tell it , Sony 's TV plan is exactly the same one he pitched Sony chief , Sir Howard Stringer , as a business proposition . Though Cameron makes his films at 20th Century Fox , he had a strong association with Sony , the maker of 3D cameras that were used for Avatar .
Listen to Cameron 's response to a recent Business Week cover story , when Charlie Rose mentioned Stringer ‘ s plan to make 3D units the entire thrust of Sony 's presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show that took place in early January .
Said Cameron : “ There 's an interesting history there because , about 6 or 7 months ago , I had a closed-door secret presentation to Howard Stringer of a new business venture , and I mapped out what I believed was going to be the future of 3D and how many television sets were going to be entering the home and how there would initially be a dearth of 3D content and blah , blah , blah . I basically mapped out an entire strategy that he promptly announced a week later at the Sony stockholders ' meeting . His speech was pretty much culled verbatim from my presentation . So thank you , Howard . ”
When Rose suggested this was the “ sincerest form of flattery , ” Cameron was having none of it .
“ A more sincere form would have been to actually make the deal I was proposing , ” Cameron said .

THE FILM
What if we do n't understand the workings of life as well as we think ?
On the Back of a Tiger follows a group of pioneering scientists & thinkers as they rewrite the story of life , challenging science & medicine 's most sacred cows . From breakthrough ideas on water and the living cell , to radical theories of mind and brain . These ideas have already inspired an intrepid group of health-seekers who share their impressive - though unconventional - stories .
Through interviews , experiments , and animations , these theories are woven into an alternate model of life , one that could have a profound impact on our understanding of disease , aging , and consciousness .
WHY NOW
Why do so many medical claims - particularly when it comes to nutrition - seem to contradict the next ? Why has so little progress been made treating the most devastating diseases ?
This film explores two answers : There are fundamental flaws in our understanding of biology , and there are institutionalized problems at the core of our scientific and medical establishments . Each perpetuates the other , creating the dire situation today .
We all know someone , maybe even ourselves , that has a serious illness of some kind , or been misdiagnosed or mistreated . Some of the most serious diseases are no better understood after decades of research . This growing sense of urgency is felt by us all .
But some great minds young and old have been changing this narrative . With your help we can get their message out there , igniting a paradigm shift that 's been decades in the making .
PROGRESS , PLAN , & BUDGET
Interviews shot so far
So far we have completed roughly 35 % of production , having conducted 8 in-depth interviews . We 've done it all alone , including self-funding the first 25k , but we simply can not continue without support .
We still need to conduct 10-12 additional interviews , as well as 2-3 days of studio shooting . We will then have enough material for a rough cut to garner additional support for post-production .
To complete this phase we will need at least $ 38 , 000 . This the bare minimum amount to cover travel , equipment , and crew to film the remaining interviews , recreation of experiments , capturing of archival material , creating an animation example , and complete a rough cut . Surpassing our goal means a quicker production timeline , higher quality , and money for post-production . We aim to complete production by January 2016 and post-production by May 2016 .
Kickstarter is all-or-nothing . If we do n't reach our funding goal , we do n't see a dollar .
THE REWARDS
In addition to the standard fare ( exclusive downloads , Blurays , credits , etc . ) , we have some incredibly unique rewards . There 's always the option to forgo the rewards and just donate , with the bonus of saving us some time and budget .
Essential for the citizen-scientist 's home library : Signed and unsigned books by Maewan Ho , Gilbert Ling , Gerald Pollack , Todd Murphy , Kate Deering , and Fred Kummerow . We also have some extremely rare and out-of-print books by Ray Peat and Harold Hillman .
We 're offering the full-suite of superbly formulated healthcare products from Idea Labs , and a cutting-edge CO2-based skin cream from Carbogenetics , offered here for the first time .
Biochemist Benedicte M. Lerche , M.Sc. , Ph.D is offering nutritional-metabolic counseling sessions , and Zachariah Salazar of Z Health will conduct one-on-one Skype/phone consultations on movement therapy , exercise , nutrition , and lifestyle .
If you or a loved one is coming up short in the hair-department , Danny Roddy is providing access to both levels of his Organizing the Panic program .
And for the very lucky few , Ray Peat and Maewan Ho have graciously offered of their own one-of-a-kind original paintings . Ray has even offered to paint an original piece specifically for the donator .
Other rewards include : t-shirts and tote bags with the film title , a coffee mug with picture of an interviewee , a beautifully laid-out and printed behind-the-scenes photo book , and a box of local organic tropical fruit from South Florida
We 'll fulfill things like the products , books , and consultations as soon as we can . DVD 's , digital downloads , and premiere tickets will be a ways off , as this phase is just to fund the rest of production .
Help us start a revolution in science , medicine , and nutrition .

divorce is also down from 3 per cent to 2.2 per cent
Published : 20:17 GMT , 27 December 2015 | Updated : 20:17 GMT , 27 December 2015
Women are less likely to seek a divorce in the first five years of marriage today than they were 30 years ago because their husbands have a more realistic expectation of marriage , according to a pro-marriage researcher .
According to the analysis , fewer women are asking for a divorce early in their marriage because men are walking down the aisle with their eyes wide open .
Sir Paul Coleridge , founder of the Marriage Foundation , commissioned the data from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) , which distinguishes between divorces instigated by husbands and wives .

Copy link to paste in your message +2 Fewer women are asking for a divorce early in their marriage because men now marry because they want to , and not because of social pressure
'The scale of the decrease in women filing for divorce suggests that 'men doing better ' must be a significant factor , ' Sir Coleridge told The Sunday Times .
While 7.9 per cent of women initiated divorce proceedings within five years after marrying in 1986 , the figure dropped to 4.2 per cent in 2013 .
The proportion of men seeking to part in the same period also dropped from 3 per cent of those who wed in 1993 to 2.2 % for those married in 2008 and seeking a divorce by 2013 .
Dismissing reasons such as a change in work-life patterns , and the later stage at which women now get married , Marriage Foundation researcher Henry Benson says the change is because men get married these days because they want to , not because they 'have ' to because of social pressure .
'In the 1990s , a man was under social pressure from his family or friends . 'Do the right thing , ' they say . 'Make an honest woman of her . Tie the knot . ' So he enters marriage under a certain amount of duress , without ever fully buying into it , ' Benson said in The Sunday Times article .
'So as long as things are good , he is broadly content with his new arrangement , but over time , and perhaps with the arrival of a baby , inevitable little conflicts emerge .
'Instead of dealing with them responsibly , he feels less constrained in the way he behaves because he never really bought into a long-term plan . She becomes aware of his indifference and pulls the plug , ' he said .
Other experts attribute the uptick of divorces in the 1980s as women no longer accepted their role as sole child carer and pushed back against old stereotypes .
They argue that some men have caught up with expectations of equal division of domestic labour , which causes less conflict .
The 49ers ' Eric Reid and Colin Kaepernick during the national anthem prior to the game against the Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium on Sept. 1 , 2016 , in San Diego , California . Michael Zagaris/San Francisco 49ers/Getty Images
On Sunday , the Kansas City Chiefs ' Marcus Peters held a black-gloved fist aloft during the national anthem , an homage to the 1968 black-power protest of John Carlos and Tommie Smith . Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty of the New England Patriots raised their fists , too , and four members of the Miami Dolphins kneeled on the ground during “ The Star-Spangled Banner , ” with Arian Foster saying after the game , “ They say it 's not the time to do this . When is the time ? It 's never the time in somebody else 's eye , because they 'll always feel like it 's good enough . And some people do n't . ”
It 's not just an NFL thing . Soccer player Megan Rapinoe took a knee during the anthem . So did a football player at Indiana State University and high schoolers in Nebraska , Kentucky , Virginia , Illinois , Minnesota , and Maryland . All of these athletes are following Colin Kaepernick 's lead . Back in August , Steve Wyche of NFL Media asked the San Francisco 49ers quarterback why he did n't stand for the national anthem . ( He 'd done the same thing the previous two weeks but nobody had noticed . ) When Kaepernick explained he was protesting the oppression of black Americans , he was widely ridiculed as an ignorant , washed-up millionaire athlete who just wanted attention . Well , one of those things was true . Kaepernick did want attention , and he 's getting it . The guy in the Fidel Castro T-shirt is changing the way we talk and think about sports and symbology and patriotism . The people calling him a dummy are having the conversation Colin Kaepernick wants them to have .
The pundits who disagreed with Kaepernick 's stance did n't just tell us they disagreed with his decision to protest . The Daily Caller called him both an “ uneducated idiot ” and an “ uneducated coward. ” Fox Sports ' Clay Travis termed Kaepernick an “ idiot ” twice and a “ fucking idiot ” twice more , writing that his “ decision not to stand for the national anthem … [ is ] an insult to anyone with a working brain. ” Tomi Lahren of Glenn Beck 's the Blaze promised to “ eviscerate [ Kaepernick 's ] mouth diarrhea , ” saying he 's a “ whiny , indulgent , attention-seeking crybaby . ”
Lahren is a one-woman basket of deplorables , a straight-up racist . Her crybaby–mouth diarrhea evisceration included a plea for “ those in black communities [ to ] take a step back and take some responsi-damn-bility for the problems in black communities. ” Kaepernick 's other critics , to be generous , got so caught up in feeding the messenger through a wood chipper—he 's rich , he 's entitled , he retweets stuff that does n't make sense , his message is n't as well-sourced as a doctoral dissertation—that they failed to appreciate how his voice would carry .
Fox Sports ' Jason Whitlock said recently that Kaepernick has “ fallen into this hole of Twitter information , which is very shallow. ” He continued :
When you 're a multi-millionaire with a platform as an NFL quarterback , gestures—and that 's all this is , is a gesture—is not what you 're called upon to do . He 's not John Carlos and Tommie Smith . Those guys in the 1960s , when they were making gestures , that was all they could do . They were n't wealthy . They did n't have the power or the platform that Colin Kaepernick and these modern-day athletes have .
Whitlock compared Kaepernick unfavorably to LeBron James , who 's done an incredible amount of charity work in Akron , Ohio , the city where he was born and raised . “ Let newspaper people , let media people , be outspoken . When you have great wealth , you should use it to influence change , ” said Whitlock , who would later call Kaepernick 's protest a “ fad. ” ( “ You remember the dab last year ? ” he said . “ That 's all this is . ” )
What has Kaepernick 's supposedly empty gesture achieved thus far ? It 's inspired football players and other athletes to speak up about race and police violence , and to do so in such a way that reporters , fans , and team owners actually pay attention . According to Robert Klemko , more than 70 NFL players , including Kaepernick , Foster , and Richard Sherman , are in a group text talking about “ what Kaep started. ” That 's not a gesture . That 's a movement .
The 49ers franchise announced they would donate $ 1 million to , in the words of the team 's chief executive , Jed York , “ the cause of improving racial and economic inequality and fostering communication and collaboration between law enforcement and the communities they serve here in the Bay Area. ” Kaepernick has pledged $ 1 million of his own money to address the same issues . “ I have to help these people . I have to help these communities . It 's not right that they 're not put in a position to succeed or given those opportunities to succeed , ” he said . That 's a movement with money to back it up .
Just as important , Kaepernick has made his fellow Americans think about what they 're standing for , and why . It was n't typical for NFL players to stand for the national anthem until 2009—before then , it was customary for players to stay in the locker room as the anthem played . * A 2015 congressional report revealed that the Department of Defense had paid $ 5.4 million to NFL teams between 2011 and 2014 to stage on-field patriotic ceremonies ; the National Guard shelled out $ 6.7 million for similar displays between 2013 and 2015 .
And as the San Francisco Chronicle 's Ann Killion noted , if you think Kaepernick 's gesture is an empty one , you need to grapple with the fact that “ standing for the national anthem before a sporting event is an equally empty gesture for many people. ” Consider that , as Marcus Peters raised his right fist in Kansas City 's Arrowhead Stadium , thousands of fans interrupted the supposedly sacred anthem to yell out “ home of the CHIEFS ! ” Thousands more jersey-wearing , beer-swilling patriots booed President Obama 's pre-recorded Sept. 11 speech as it poured out of PA systems in Baltimore , Seattle , and New Jersey . Patriotism !
If Kaepernick had donated $ 1 million without the anthem protest , or if he 'd stuck to venting on social media , then prominent columnists and TV yakkers would n't be calling him an idiot . Nobody would be saying anything at all , because nobody would care . Back in our nonhypothetical universe , an NFL player who happens to be black and happens to play quarterback happened to sit during a patriotic pre-game ritual to protest the country 's racial inequities . Kaepernick 's gesture worked because it was divisive—because his supporters celebrated him for giving voice to the voiceless , and because his detractors amplified that voice by trying to shout it down with ad hominem attacks . His protest , striking at the heart of America 's most cherished pieties from the stage of its favorite sport , was precision engineered to accomplish exactly what it 's accomplished , and the response has only proved its necessity . Who 's the idiot now ?
* Correction , Sept. 14 , 2016 : This story originally misstated that no NFL player stood for the national anthem until 2009 . While it was n't customary to stand for the anthem prior to 2009 , some teams and players did . ( Return . )
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is trying to change the world — and he thinks Harvard 's graduating class can and should be doing the same .
Zuckerberg gave the commencement address Thursday at Harvard College , the place where he founded Facebook before dropping out , and where he finally returned to receive an honorary degree .
The speech felt , at times , very political , and Zuckerberg mentioned a number of social , fiscal and environmental issues that are important to him throughout the address .
Among those issues was immigration . At one point late in the 30-minute-long speech , Zuckerberg started tearing up when talking about an undocumented high school student he mentors . The student may not get to go to college because he 's not a U.S. citizen . “ It says something about our situation today that I ca n't even say his name because I do n't want to put him at risk , ” Zuckerberg said , visibly emotional .
Zuckerberg , 33 , the youngest person to deliver a Harvard commencement address , gave his talk as attendees hid from the rain under ponchos and umbrellas . Zuckerberg 's speech , which he wrote himself , was impassioned , especially for the Facebook CEO who can be very scripted , especially in public .

Immigration was n't the only political theme Zuckerberg touched on during the speech . He also mentioned the rising cost of college education , the idea of a universal living wage , and the troubling effects of climate change . “ It is time for our generation-defining great works , ” he told students . “ How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet ? ... How about curing all diseases ? ”
Zuckerberg has said on numerous occasions now that he is n't running for political office , but the speech gave those who believe that he 's preparing for a political run a lot of material to work with . He 's long positioned Facebook as a service void of political agendas , but it was clear from his speech Thursday that Zuckerberg himself has a lot of strong views on a lot of important issues .
All of these references were connected under the broader theme of “ purpose , ” and Zuckerberg used his time to impress upon students the need to build a better world for others — specifically , helping others find purpose in life .
“ I 'm not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose , ” Zuckerberg said toward the beginning of the address . “ We 're millennials . We try to do that instinctively . Instead , I 'm here to tell you that finding your purpose is n't enough . The challenge for our generation is to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose . ”
This is hard , Zuckerberg said , because the world is changing quickly and the kinds of things that used to give people purpose , like their jobs or their real-life communities , are changing , too .
“ When our parents graduated , that sense of purpose reliably came from your job , your church , your community , ” he said . “ But today , technology and automation are eliminating many jobs . Membership in a lot of communities is declining . And a lot of people are feeling disconnected and depressed , and are trying to fill a void in their lives . ”
Zuckerberg said students should focus on three major ways to help instill more purpose in their own lives , but also in others ' lives : Tackling big projects , like curing all disease ; creating equality , like making education affordable for everyone ; and building better offline and online communities .
In the section on big projects , Zuckerberg talked about his own struggles in Facebook 's early days . He recounted a story of when his top-ranking executives and investors all wanted him to sell the company early on , but he resisted . Many of the executives quit , and Zuckerberg said his decision not to sell “ tore our company apart . ”
“ I felt alone . And worse , it was my fault , ” he said . “ I wondered if I was just wrong . An imposter . A 22-year-old kid who had no idea how things actually worked . ”
But then he added , “ Now , years later , I understand that is how things work when there 's no sense of higher purpose . ”
The focus on community in particular is something that Zuckerberg has long pushed , and It 's quite frankly the backbone of Facebook 's connect the entire world mission . He often refers to Facebook 's users as “ the community , ” and when he penned a near 6,000-word manifesto earlier this year on his vision for the world , it was titled “ building global community . ”
These beliefs are also visible in Zuckerberg 's philanthropic work , specifically his decision in late 2015 with wife Priscilla Chan to give away all of their wealth during their lifetime to philanthropic causes . That effort , which is driven by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , is focused on things like curing all disease and personalized learning .
“ Yes , giving everyone the freedom to pursue purpose is n't going to be free , ” Zuckerberg said . “ People like me should pay for it . And a lot of you are going to do really well and you should to . ”
If you want to watch the full speech , you can see it here at the 1:38:00 mark . And here 's a transcript if you want to read instead of listen .

Puddle Duck Racer
Cheap , creative , and having fun on the water .
What is a Puddle Duck Racer
The PDRacer is a developmental one design racing sailboat that is basically a plywood box with a curved bottom and is the easiest boat in the world to build . The rules are aimed at keeping the lower 10 '' of all hulls the same but the rest is up to the builder . A simple hull can be made from 3 sheets of plywood , titebond II glue and latex house paint . If you work hard for 2 weekends you can go sailing on the 3rd weekend . If you are really in a hurry it is possible to go from lumber to the lake in 5 days . Here are our free plywood sailboat plans
What our club is about
Our club is not about the boat , it is about the people and what we do is described right at the top of this page in our motto . We use the same shaped hulls and go play with them together in fun ways and also for serious racing . We have a handicap rating so we can race with other recognized racing classes . Membership is free , any puddle ducker can organize events ( there are no restricted territories ) . We have an open member list so any ducker can directly contact another . Here is why the hull we use is perfect for puddle ducking : Design Considerations Of The Puddle Duck Racer For more information about what a great community activity the PDRacer Class is , see this newspaper article . In addition to conventional racing we have a big list of fun sailboat games and races .
Interesting Niche Racing
Most of the other sailboat classes fit in one of the two basic categories . 1 : One Design where the class keep the boats as identical as possible so that the competition is between the skill of the crew . 2 : Developmental class where the competitors engineer different sailboats so that their boat design is a significant part of their ability to compete . This category also tends to become a competition of who has the financial resources to gain the best engineering solutions .
Our class fits in an area between those 2 general types , we are a `` developmental one design '' . Our hulls are a fixed one design shape , the sail rigs and fins are open for development . The result is our racing competition is blend of both the sailing skill of the skipper AND boat engineering & building skill . Because our boat is so small , that imposes a natural limit on the cost so our class will always be within the grasp of an amateur garage level competitor .
Getting Started On Your Duck
You do n't need permission from headquarters , just build your duck , contact other duckers to get out there & do our motto ! ! If nobody else is organizing events in your area , then stand up and take the initiative to organize a local fleet and make the magic happen ! !
Many Other Uses
Our boat is not just for racing , she is great for all sorts of other purposes and in most states a boat this small does not need to be titled or registered . The hull shape carries 630 lbs . One member took 2 adults and 3 kids for an afternoon sail . Another went on a 3 day cruise with his wife and slept aboard at anchor every night . If you think about it , many people go backpacking for long periods , a PDRacer can hold much more gear and water than a backpack . She also works good as a row boat and motorboat . free plans diy boat oars
I often take my kids out rowing in mine , instead of a sail rig I put a big beach umbrella in the mast sleeve so they can sit in the shade . If you like fishing , you can row her into the shallow areas that power boats ca n't get to and launch in areas that do n't have a boat ramp . She is very stable , enough that you can stand up and cast .
Which boat to build ?
If you just discovered boat building , very soon you will become aware that there are TONS and TONS of different boats you could build . For some odd reason , many sailors think they should only have one sailboat - please realize it is perfectly OK to have several ( or many ) sailboats at the same time . Consider building a puddle duck to get some experience and have fun sailing with other duckers . The lessons you will learn will give you better understanding of how to build boats and make your next project go a lot faster . The duck is big enough to carry a 2nd passenger but small and easy to store . If you lose interest or do n't have time , then stand her upright in the corner of your garage or out back till you get the itch to go sail her again .
Do n't know how to sail ?
For many people that build ducks , it is their first boat and they do n't know how to sail either . Sailing is easy , just point the boat in the direction you want to go , then pull in the sail till it stops flapping . The best way to learn is to have your own boat and take her out on a very light wind day , on a very small lake and give it a try . Take a set of oars , if you ca n't figure out how to sail back then drop your sail and row back . If you know a sailor then invite them along and they will help you out , the PDRacer can easily carry 2 adults .
Afraid it will leak ?
All boats leak especially wooden ones . Just because it might leak , does n't mean you will sink , that is what the airbox flotation chambers are for . Besides , when you are sailing on a very windy day splashing along you will get more spray water than from any leak . Take along a bottomless chlorox bottle and when the water gets to about an inch deep inside the cockpit just do a couple of scoops to flip the water out .
If you are worried about capsizing , see our info about emergency flotation and recovering from knock down pages . Then go practice capsizing with your duck tied to the dock with a long line . After you learn how to recover from a knock down , you wo n't be afraid of them anymore .
Afraid it wo n't be perfect the way you build it ?
A big part of puddle ducking is to continually tinker with your boat to improve it . Figure which configuration attracts you the most and start building it . Later if you change your mind , you can reconfigure her or just build another hull and move your parts over . They have almost no resale value so no matter what you do , she will be worth the same .
Club Membership
All you have to do is build ( or get ) a class legal PDRacer and register her . Registration is FREE and Shorty has tried to keep all other aspects of puddle ducking free , offering free plans and full instructions here on the website and requiring entrance to the world championship be free to any registered puddle ducker and their crew . There are no protected territories and any puddle ducker is welcome to organize events and invite others to go sailing .
We have an open member list , if their email address is listed , that means you can contact them direct for duck related activities .
Hatch Events
Want to increase the number of puddle ducks in your local area ? One of the things we do is organize `` hatch events '' . This is where people organize a day ( or weekend ) to get together and build ducks . Many times these are as simple as having a friend ( or two ) come over and just try to build what you can with no prior preparation needed or can be elaborate events on a big scale with 15 or more ducks being built at the same time . If you are interested in doing a hatch , consider inviting the other local duckers to come help because we really like any excuse to build another boat or help someone else build theirs . : )
Are aliens showing off their latest weaponry to the astronauts on the International Space Station or are they just a bunch of extraterrestrial pranksters playing with a galactic laser pointer ? Those and more possible explanations have been bantered about as viewers of the ISS video feed spotted a red glowing ball appear to fire a red glowing laser beam in the direction of Earth .
The laser show appeared on December 5th at around 09:20 AM GMT on the feed from the webcam located on the outside of the space station . While red spheres have been spotted around the ISS before , this is the first that appears to be firing a laser beam .
Since it 's beyond the range of a laser pointer on Earth , one thought is that an astronaut on the ISS is playing with one . That would be a first , since they 've given plenty of presentations without one . It could be a reflection , but a reflection of what ? Then there 's the “ problem with the camera ” reasoning . I join with the chorus on this one in wondering why NASA would spend so much on the space station and go cheap on the camera .
The European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope occasionally beams a laser skyward to create guide star to help adjust for atmospheric distortion and in fact did so on December 5th , but no one has confirmed that 's what this was . There 's also a new laser communications system on the ISS called the Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science ( OPALS ) that is supposed to be used for payload guidance . Again , there 's been no indication this red globe and beam was related to OPAL .
There have been enough sightings of UFOs and other strange objects outside the space station that the powers that be are starting to run out of explanations . What else could the glowing ball and laser beam be ? Are we ready for it ?

Corporatism 101
Regular readers of this Corporatocracy series should have a firm grasp on the concept of Corporatism . However , the uninitiated might presume that a corporation is merely a vehicle for protecting the owners of the enterprise from the liability risks of conducting business . Much attention has been devoted to the economic conditions and aspects when examining the corporate structure . But modest effort is found in business journals that discuss the social consequences of consolidating the entire hierarchy of political favoritism , access to capital and protection from competition that is at the heart of the corporatist model .
Corporatism as Theory and Practice by Joseph R. Stromberg offers a historic perspective .
“ Corporatism and corporations are not yet the same subject . The key word is “ yet. ” If there is a relationship , it is historical . Very briefly , corporations — legally privileged from birth , pampered by courts , subsidized by Congress , with a social “ in ” with the most important state personnel — were likely , as ideal engines for accumulating capital , to produce unbalanced economic outcomes , mass discontent , and political unrest . Combine those engines with inherited dysfunctional institutions such as fractional-reserve banking , eminent domain , primitive military accumulation ( e.g. , the Indian wars ) , governmental distribution of resources , a venal party system , and a mighty executive , and you have a recipe for crisis . American elites recognized the danger fairly early . By trial and error they put together “ corporate syndicalism ” ( Williams ) , “ political capitalism ” ( Kolko ) , corporatism ( varii ) , or “ interest-group liberalism ” ( Lowi ) . It remained to be seen who ( business or state ? ) would dominate the partnership . Hoover himself reflected in 1922 on the danger of “ a syndicalist nation on a gigantic scale . ”
Out of such a context the 21th century version of corporatism maintains little effort to satisfy mass discontent of the populace , because the will to achieve an independent livelihood has been stamped out so wholly by the merged state/corporate system . Viewing this alliance as a partnership vying for dominance is a false outlook . In this new millennium , the globalist economy is under total control by a financial dictate that makes laws , writes regulations , enforces compliance , bankrupts companies not in the club , subsidizes crony ventures , and imposes access to capital as a reward for playing ball .
This is not Capitalism , it is demented Corporatocracy .
Don Quijones writes in Crunch Time for the Global Corporatocracy about the closed door negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the US-EU trade deal ( TIPP ) and TISA .
“ The hyper-secret Trade in Services Act ( TiSA ) , which seeks to bind together the U.S. , the EU and 22 other Western-aligned nations under a new system of laws and regulations covering telecoms , water , gas , electricity , transport , financial and legal services , software design , electronic data , tourism , healthcare and a whole lot more , is infinitely worse . The treaty 's text is designed to be almost impossible to repeal , and is to be “ considered confidential ” for at least five years after being signed . ”
Basically , the nature of all these destructive trade agreements is reducible to “ The fact that we now live in a world dominated by highly undemocratic and unaccountable supranational organizations ( the IMF , World Bank , WTO , EU… ) is no mere accident . ”
Corporatism 101 is not taught in school or even debated in the mass media . It falls to online publications like Naked Capitalism to feature another persuasive argument by Mr. Quijones , which concludes .
“ The rise of investor-state dispute settlements and the broad application of arbitration procedures are the ultimate victory in the global corporatocracy 's decades-long coup d'état . If allowed to take universal effect , the system will impose above you , me , and our governments a rigid framework of international corporate law designed to exclusively protect the interests of corporations , relieving them of all financial risk and social and environmental responsibility . From then on , every investment they make will effectively be backstopped by our governments ( and by extension , you and me ) ; it will be too-big-to-fail writ on an unimaginable scale . ”
It seems that all the attention provided in business news is diverted away from the totality of integration under the auspices of a pseudo and hostile legal framework that only deepen the aggregate control over the social , political , economic and global functions , is silent by design .
So when Suarez-Villa , Luis , publishes in Globalization and Technocapitalism : the political economy of corporate power and technological domination , page 203 , we all should take notice .
“ It should not surprise , therefore , that a major objective of the fast neo-imperialism is to establish corporatocratic governance whenever and wherever campaigns of conquest happen to be carried out . Fast militarism thereby comes into the scene , whenever aggression is executive . Military conquest for its own sake is pointless , and the fast neo-imperialism has no real reason for being , unless the imposition of corporatocracy is part of the end game of conquest . ”
The re-establishment of a neo-feudalism is not a function of privatization , when market forces are unleashed from the choke hold that keeps real competition at bay . Allowing businesses to vie for consumer favor is healthy under a free market economy . Today , there are few examples where the corporatocracy allows for free trading in goods and services .
This is the important lesson that techno corporatism refuses to accept . As the bondage economy expands , the serfs become expendable . Since the consumer economy is shifting into a financial speculation arena , the elites see little reason for continued subsistence of the bottom feeders , since they are not needed to till their estates .
Knowing this object lesson is the actual answer to the Corporatism 101 studies .
Maybe Bruce E. Levine PhD should be teaching class . Get Up , Stand Up : Uniting Populists , Energizing the Defeated , and Battling the Corporate Elite , argues that “ individuals must recover self-respect , and a people must regain collective confidence that they can succeed at eliminating top-down controls . Get Up , Stand Up describes how we can recover dignity , confidence , and the energy to do battle . ”
It all starts with a required understanding that the Corporatocracy economy is inherently destructive to individual liberty . If people are unable to learn this fact , life on earth will sink into oblivion .

Meagan Byrne is a game designer currently attending Sheridan College , and will be showing off her game Wanisinowin | Lost at the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Festival next week . She was awesome enough to sit down and answer some questions about herself and her work . A big shout out to Carson Pinch for helping set this up as well .
TorontoGameDevs.com : Thanks for doing the interview Meagan ! Can you tell me a bit about yourself ? What experiences got you to this point ?
Meagan Byrne : Tanisi ! Thanks for having me !
Well , I 'm a game designer entering my 3rd year of study at Sheridan College .
Mostly what got me to this point is my love of storytelling . Game Design and narrative design for games has been something that I just took to . It was like everything I had done up to this point just culminated into game design .
TorontoGameDevs.com : You 're currently doing Game Design at Sheridan College , how is that program ? What made you decide to go with Sheridan ?
Meagan : Any tips or suggestions for people looking into it ? I love the program , even though we 're the guinea pig class . Lol . I picked it mostly due to distance and how well thought out their education plan was . I felt that this was a program that had really done its homework on what the industry needed .
To anyone thinking of applying the biggest thing you need to know is that It is challenging and it 's definitely being not for everyone . It 's not enough to enjoy playing games you have to want to create games and experiences for someone else . Also , learn the basics . Basics first . Cool MMO design second .
TorontoGameDevs.com : Wanisinowin | Lost is a platformer-puzzle game that tells the story of a young girl resolving her identity in the spirit world . What help inspired this game ? What kind of challenges will the player encounter ?
Meagan : A lot of what inspired this game was personal experience . I grew up in the city , away from Protocol and Language . It was hard to want to embrace my culture when I was young because of that . Then when I became a teenager I felt I did n't have the right to claim my culture . It was a space of feeling like this is where I should be , but I do n't think I belong . But I always had the stories of Creation and the Creator or Wisakedjak growing up , but it was n't until I was older that I stopped thinking of them as `` just '' stories I had heard or read .
So I figured what 's the best way to deal with an issue ? You tell a story about it .
I wanted to express the story mainly through mechanics , because that was the feeling I had when I heard some of these stories . As Wani you have very little in the way of control of your environment , but sometimes having a choice to not do something or to ignore that nagging doubt is a powerful one . You also get a little help on your way . It 's almost impossible to do the work of finding your way without someone who can help . I wanted a game that reflected that .
TorontoGameDevs.com : What 's it like being a game developer in Toronto ? How 's the support for the scene and your experience with it so far .
Meagan : I love it ! I 'm actually based out of Hamilton , but I 'm pretty much doing stuff all across the GTA . Lol I 'm pretty lucky being a student . I can sort of go where I want . But no matter where I go every game development community I 've met so far is made up of great people .
Though I have to say that Dames Making Games and Bento Miso have been my biggest supports . They 're just filled with wonderful , helpful people ! I 'm super glad to have found them .
TorontoGameDevs.com : What 's it like for you to be part of the first Digital Media Art+Cade at imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts festival ?
Meagan : So awesome and so intimidating ! When I joined Indigicade I did n't even know that this was the presentation space they were talking about . I just wanted to make games with other indigenous women . I 'm very glad I stumbled on to this chance .
TorontoGameDevs.com : Anything else you would like to share with our readers , and thanks again !
Meagan : I Hope everyone can make it out to Digital Media Art+Cade and play some awesome games !
Thanks Meagan ! You can follow her on Twitter and make sure to check out the event October 14th - October 18th , and let us know in the comments if you plan on showing up !
Baltimore Det . Jimmy McNulty finds himself in hot water with his superior Major William Rawls after a drug dealer , D'Angelo Barksdale who is charged with three murders , is acquitted . McNulty knows the judge in question and although it 's not his case , he 's called into chambers to explain what happened . Obviously key witnesses recanted their police statements on the stand but McNulty does n't underplay Barksdale 's role in at least 7 other murders . When the judge 's raises his concerns at the senior levels of the police department , they have a new investigation on their hands . Lt. Cedric Daniels is put in charge with Kima Greggs as the lead detective . As for Barksdale , he finds himself demoted to a low-level dealer after his arrest and he obviously has to prove himself yet again . Written by garykmcd
FAYETTEVILLE , ARK . -- Here 's a new way to look at Wal-Mart : institution of higher learning .
Under a program announced Thursday , employees of Wal-Mart and Sam 's Club will be able to receive college credit for performing their jobs , including such tasks as loading trucks and ringing up purchases . Workers could earn as much as 45 percent of the credits needed for an associate or bachelor 's degree while on the job .
The credits are earned through the Internet-based American Public University , with headquarters in Charles Town , W.Va. , and administrative offices in Manassas .
`` We want to provide you with more ways and faster ways to succeed with us , '' Eduardo Castro-Wright , head of Wal-Mart 's U.S. division , told 4,000 employees during the company 's annual meeting . The program is designed to encourage more workers to climb the corporate ladder . Although Wal-Mart says about 70 percent of its managers begin as hourly employees , it estimates that about half of its employees do not hold college degrees .
Jaymes Murphy , 24 , a salesman from Victoria , Tex. , who was at the annual meeting , said he tried for several years to juggle work and school with little success . He would attend class from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and then sprint to his job as a cashier at Wal-Mart , working from 3 p.m. to midnight . He eventually quit school but he still dreams of getting a bachelor 's degree in political science or communications .
`` It gets stressful , '' he said . The program would allow him to `` not have to worry about sacrificing one or the other . ''
The credits will be given for Wal-Mart 's own training as well as on-the-job experience . Many of the courses for which Wal-Mart workers can get credit are business-related , such as retail shipping and receiving , ethics , commercial safety and finance fundamentals .
Those credits could be applied to a degree in retail management from APU or may be used to fulfill elective requirements for other majors . Students would need to complete additional courses outside of their jobs to complete a degree . So in classic Wal-Mart fashion , the company negotiated a 15 percent tuition reduction on other courses at APU in exchange for handling some administrative and marketing duties .
Many colleges allow students to receive credit for work experience , such as internships . APU officials said they have worked closely with the military to develop courses and award credits , but this is the first time they have partnered with a company to create a comprehensive program .
For their work to qualify as credit , full-time employees must be in the job for a year and receive satisfactory reviews , while part-timers must put in three years and get a positive review . About 200,000 workers are eligible for the program , and Wal-Mart said additional positions will be added each quarter .
`` People will surprise you if you give them opportunities , '' said Tom Mars , chief administrative officer at Wal-Mart . `` The single biggest competitive advantage we have . . . is our associates . ''
Daniel Soto of Hardeeville , S.C. , works full time at Wal-Mart as a zone manager supervisor , lending a hand in several departments . He had to give up college to work , but said he could see some of his duties translating to academia , such as the algebraic equations he uses to figure out how much merchandise will fit on a shelf or how much of a product to order .
`` I do math all day at Wal-Mart , '' he said .
Wal-Mart is the country 's largest private employer with 1.4 million workers , and the partnership will probably provide a significant boost for APU . The college was organized in 1991 as the online American Military University and has since expanded to enroll nearly 71,000 students during the first quarter , up 42 percent from the previous year .
American Public University is one of a growing number of so-called career colleges that operate on a for-profit model , rather than as state institutions or private foundations . APU 's parent company is publicly traded and its reported revenue jumped 43 percent to $ 47.3 million during the most recent quarter , while profit rose 46 percent to $ 7.6 million .
Mars said the company has recently improved opportunities for workers to be promoted . It removed a ban on promoting employees to store managers within the same store and created a mentorship program that ties some executive bonuses to how they advance the careers of other workers .
Cari Prill , a department manager in Bad Axe , Mich. , said the flexibility of Wal-Mart 's program is appealing . She has spent seven years at the company and would probably qualify for the credits . Although she once thought about studying pre-law , now she is interested in business management and human resources , especially if her Wal-Mart experience will count toward the degree .
`` Money and time go hand in hand , '' she said .

In secondary school I remember speaking to one of the few white classmates about my religion , that my parents were both Muslim , and she said , “ oh so you 're Muslim by default ? ” I smiled tentatively and said , “ Yeah , that 's it . I 'm Muslim by default. ” And that was what I said from then on . Throughout university I was ‘ Muslim by default ' and it was comfortable . I went to university in Brighton , a population well known to be whiter than white . I went to university to find more people like me and fit in . But my brown skin was only going to let me fit in so much despite how much I tried to look , act and talk like my white friends . Yes , being ‘ Muslim by default ' was comfortable .
It became something I said without even thinking . And before I knew it I stopped saying it altogether , and the only time I ever acknowledged it was when I filled in monitoring forms in private , where only the ticked box and my pen knows who I really am .
BGD accepts writing and video from queer and trans people of color ! SUBMIT your work .
It was only when I started to discover my true gender identity that I started to discover all these other parts of me – my queerness , my feminism . And that led me to rediscover my brownness , a process that was a lot more difficult surprisingly . With that came my culture , my heritage , my language , and lastly , my religion .
I found a new community of queer people of colour , queer brown people and queer desi people . But for most of these people , religion was not important . It was never spoken about and it taught me not to speak about it . I understood religion in a way that was so tied to culture , heritage and language , it became something I acknowledged in a different way . Something that was in my past , something that I let go of . I said , “ I am brought up as Muslim , ” and only when people asked . I declared my desi identity first and foremost and just hoped that was enough .
Two months ago I submitted some self-shot video footage for an upcoming TV documentary called ‘ The T Diaries . ' I was filming myself answering a set of standard questions given to all participants focused on trans men transitioning and their medical journey . I answered with non-answers , hoping to broaden the narrative outside of medical transition . For a couple of the videos , my partner helped me out . They are queer , Pakistani and Muslim . Like me . I was answering a question on how my family reacted to me coming out as trans . When we stopped filming , my partner pointed out that I had said , “ I 'm brought up as Muslim. ” I was embarrassed . I realised that I have been saying this for so long without really thinking about why I say that or what that really means . My partner said , “ It sounds like you 're not Muslim. ” I was hesitant . Am I Muslim ? Can I call myself that ? Am I as Muslim as you ? Am I Muslim enough ?
This will be the first time I have ever acknowledged these feelings out loud . Sometimes I feel like I am appropriating Islam . I feel so deeply that Islam is not mine , that I do not have the right to use Allah 's name , to have an Islamic tattoo , to go to a mosque , to even wear shalwaar kameez and a dupatta . I have put myself so far outside my own culture , that coming back in feels like an invasion of someone else 's world . For every Muslim I meet , I almost want to apologise , because I feel like I a caricature , like I 'm trying to be a Muslim when I 'm not . When did it start to feel like something I had to try to be ?
Maybe it was when I started to feel different . Maybe it was when I was told feeling different was wrong . That what I was doing was wrong . Not good enough . Not Muslim enough .
The first time I resented God was when I was a child . I used to pray every night and sometimes in the day when I saw my body or something made me think about my body parts . I prayed to Allah , begging for Him to turn me into a boy . I knew Allah would be able to help me ; He knew me for who I really am , who I am really meant to be and that it was all okay . I would pray : Allah , I know that my body is n't fully developed yet and it does n't have to change overnight but soon please . I want to be a boy , I want boy parts , that stick out , I want to grow down there . Please let me be a boy . When nothing changed and I saw myself growing into a girl , I stopped praying .
When people see me speaking about being trans and desi , I usually do n't have a choice in telling them I am Muslim . My experiences , my name and my skin speak for themselves . But now I make the choice to say out loud for myself that I am Muslim . I do not resent Allah any more , I resent not being closer . I resent turning away from Islam and denying myself faith . I know that when I say I am Muslim , I am putting myself in a position of even more discrimination , I become a bigger target . I know that when I say I am a Muslim , desi people around me are surprised that I can call myself that and look like this . My parents are shocked that Islam is important enough to me to mention after a decade of rebellion and queerness . And everyone else did n't know where to put me in the first place ; I do n't fit neatly into the male or female box so I 'm already a threat . But I do n't care . I want people to know that being trans or queer does n't mean you ca n't have faith or practice a religion . It 's the culture that we are in that teaches us that we do n't deserve to be religious . It does n't come from within us and it definitely is n't because of us . I 'm still trying to forgive myself for that . I am trans and proud and I am Muslim and proud .

Media playback is not supported on this device Managers pay tribute to Ferguson
Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini says it has been `` a great honour and pleasure '' to take on Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson .
Ferguson , 71 , after 26 years in charge and will be replaced by David Moyes .
Mancini said : `` It was a great honour to beat him at Old Trafford and I wish him good luck for his future .
Ferguson v Mancini Roberto Mancini has faced Manchester United 14 times as a manager : Twice as Inter boss , 12 with Man City
His record is : P14 W5 D2 L7 F20 A20
`` I do n't think there 'll be another manager like him . To win every trophy for 27 years is incredible situation . ''
Mancini got the better of Ferguson to win the Premier League title last season - including a famous 6-1 win at Old Trafford in 2011 - but saw Ferguson respond with a dominant title win this season .
And Mancini expects United to remain a force under Moyes next season when he after leaving Everton after 11 years in charge .
`` In Europe , there are other good managers . I do n't know if you can say Sir Alex is the best ever but he is the best in the last 27 years , '' Mancini said .
`` A top club , a big club like United , you can change the manager . Sir Alex built this team but it is a big club with a big history and I do n't think it will change something . ''
One of Ferguson 's biggest rivals in the past 20 years has been Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger , who called the United manager 's reign `` immaculate '' .
`` It is difficult to imagine English football without him , but it 's now a reality and a fact , '' Wenger added .
QPR boss Harry Redknapp says Ferguson `` will be a great loss to English football '' .
Ferguson 's Man Utd trophies Premier League : 1993 , 1994 , 1996 , 1997 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2003 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2011 , 2013 FA Cup : 1990 , 1994 , 1996 , 1999 , 2004 League Cup : 1992 , 2006 , 2009 , 2010 Champions League : 1999 , 2008 Cup Winners ' Cup : 1991 Fifa Club World Cup : 2008 Uefa Super Cup : 1992 Inter-Continental Cup : 1999 FA Charity/Community Shield : 1990 ( shared ) , 1993 , 1994 , 1996 , 1997 , 2003 , 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011
Redknapp said : `` Sir Alex has had a massive influence on so many managers . He 's achieved so much .
`` Davey is a great boy , a top manager . It 's good that a British coach has got the top job . ''
West Ham manager Sam Allardyce called Moyes `` the perfect candidate '' for the United job and anticipated an emotional atmosphere when he takes the Hammers to Goodison Park on Sunday for Moyes ' final home game in charge .
`` I hope their crowd show their appreciation for him . You ca n't do anything but applaud him for what he 's done in 11 years at Everton , '' Allardyce said .
`` He 'll face the challenge head on . It 's one of the biggest jobs in club football . ''
Stoke manager Tony Pulis believes the appointment of Moyes is a positive for young British managers in the game .
He said : `` David Moyes has come from bottom to the top , and for him to have this chance is brilliant . It 's great for all young , aspiring managers , because it shows that young British managers are given a chance at the very top . ''
Moyes has yet to win a major trophy but current Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic believes the new boss can continue the club 's success .
`` I 'm looking forward to working with David and I believe I will have the same success I had with Sir Alex , '' Vidic told the club 's official website .
`` David and Sir Alex share some similarities - they are very passionate , they are both winners and you can see the way they approach the games and how they run things . ''

Upon release , the original TA game boasted : Fully-articulated 3D units and buildings , with a diverse complement of unit types — for example , aircraft , amphibious tanks , infantry bots ( kbots ) , vehicles , hovercraft , ships , submarines , unit production factories , powerful stationary defenses , and long-range weapons . A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units , entire armies , or even projectiles across the landscape .
True 3D terrain that units can climb over , into , and around , on extra-large 3D-generated maps . TA runs comfortably in high resolutions and even on modern dual monitor setups , so players can see more of the battlefield .
Numerous world types to do battle on , such as grasslands , forests , deserts , archipelagos , open water , lava , metal , ice , crystal , acid , and even moons .
More than 150 official units and 25 official missions per side in a single player campaign . The Core Contingency expansion pack added 75 new units ( including the infamous Krogoth ) , 50 new maps , 25 new missions , and 6 new world types . Battle Tactics added 4 new units , 6 new maps , and 100 new missions . A final patch ( version 3.1c , and included here ) added 6 new units , including a resurrection kbot !
Detailed and exciting campaigns that focus on their respective side 's leaders , the Commanders . The stories of either the Core or the Arm start with an effort to defend the protagonist 's home world and initiate a turning point in the war , followed by a series of battles on numerous planets and moons ( using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation ) , before a final strike on the enemy 's home world : either on the Arm 's bucolic Empyrean or the Core 's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime . Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area , capturing a pivotal enemy unit , or simply eliminating all enemy units . More powerful units and weapons are gradually unlocked throughout the campaigns after specific missions or events .
Single-player skirmish battles and full multiplayer support , allowing players to watch and join battles , and form allied teams to share resources , information , and units .
Highly advanced weaponry , including lasers , energy machine guns ( EMGs ) , starburst missiles , plasma shells , lightning pulses , paralyzers , and nuclear warheads .
Variables such as gravity , tides , and wind to disrupt the effectiveness of certain weapon types or to enhance resource production .
Intelligence measures to detect or jam enemy units using radar and sonar , the ability to cloak or provide stealth shielding for units , and the means to revive destroyed units from their wreckages .
Over the years , the TA community has created literally thousands of third-party units and hundreds of maps to customize a player 's TA experience . Numerous utilities , missions , mods , and factions have also been created to rebalance or totally convert the game ; many of these units are still in competitive online and skirmish play today . Modern modifications to the game push the venerable 16-year-old TA engine to new limits with complex scripting , allowing for mass unit transporting , instant map-wide teleportation , upgradeable units , and true shields — plus much more . Do n't forget to visit File Universe and Unit Universe to download and test the TA community 's many maps , missions , mods , races , standalone units , utilities , and other extras !

What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds . The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination . Both sides now crippled beyond repair , the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets , their hatred fuelled by over four thousand years of total war . This is a fight to the death . For each side , the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.In the distant future , the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core ( a contraction of `` Consciousness Repository '' ) . The Core 's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity . However , the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine , thereby theoretically granting infinite life , in a process called `` patterning . '' Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure , a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy ( hence their name , the Arm ) , whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core 's machines . A war lasting 4,000 years followed , with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines.Total Annihilation ( TA ) is a real-time strategy ( RTS ) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor . It was released on September 30 , 1997 , and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain . Two expansion packs were released : The Core Contingency on April 30 , 1998 , and Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30 , 1998 . When TA was released , the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM . Of course , these requirements were for computers in 1997 ; modern day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications , but it is still recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game engine.You can find more detailed information about the many aspects of TA — including the perfect installation , troubleshooting techniques , and tutorials on how to use / create third-party mods , units , maps , and missions — in TA FAQ . Further reading — about the gameplay , story , Jeremy Soule 's eponymous soundtrack , reception , and the 58 awards that TA received — can be found by visiting the TA article on Wikipedia . You can also find entries on TA 's expansion packs , The Core Contingency and Battle Tactics there .

Biography of Neil David Theobald
Neil David Theobald is currently senior vice president and chief financial officer at Indiana University . He has university-wide responsibility for developing and implementing financial plans and policies to support Indiana University 's objective : educating its 110,000 students , developing new knowledge through research expenditures of over $ 55 million and serving the state .
As senior vice president and chief financial officer , he oversees the preparation , approval and administration of the university 's $ 3.1 billion budget , supervision of human resource services for the university 's 3,100 faculty and more than 14,000 staff members , and management of the largest student union in the world and one of the five largest student housing systems in the country .
Under Theobald 's direction , Indiana University implemented a $ 38.4 million state budget cut ( 7.8 percent ) while avoiding layoffs and providing funding for faculty and staff salary increases averaging 2 percent per year . To accomplish this , the university has aggressively cut costs by consolidating purchasing systems ( $ 12 million annual savings ) , providing an early retirement incentive taken by 500 employees ( $ 46 million on-going savings ) , changing the vesting provision in the retirement plan ( $ 3.5 million per year ) , closing the School of Continuing Studies ( $ 1.8 million per year ) and boosting IU 's credit ranking to Moody 's highest level , Aaa . Indiana University is one of only eight Aaa-rated public universities in the country .
In addition to his senior administrative responsibilities , Theobald holds a professorship in education finance on the Indiana University Bloomington campus . His research interests in the appropriate role of decentralization in educational financing and in modeling educational labor markets are reflected in more than $ 1.5 million in funded research , numerous books and book chapters , dozens of articles published in professional journals and nearly 50 policy reports for state governments across the United States .
Prior to his current post , Theobald was appointed as senior vice provost and special assistant to the president in 2006 . Major accomplishments during his five years overseeing the campus budget include increasing the number of tenure-track faculty members by 80 , increasing the campus financial aid endowment from $ 150 million to $ 370 million and increasing the mean SAT score of the incoming class from 1099 to 1147 . He was named Indiana University Bloomington 's vice chancellor for budgetary administration and planning in 2002 .
In 1993 , he was named director of the Indiana Education Policy Center , a role he held until 2002 . Funded by the Lilly Endowment and the Indiana General Assembly , the center focused on Indiana 's complex and ambitious efforts to improve the process by which about $ 47 billion annually is allocated to the state 's K-12 public schools .
A native of Peoria , Illinois , Dr. Theobald began his career as a secondary school mathematics teacher in Washington state . He began his higher education career teaching education at the University of Washington from 1988 to 1993 . Dr. Theobald went to Indiana University from the University of Washington , where he was associate professor of education finance .
He earned a bachelor 's degree from Trinity College and a doctoral degree from the University of Washington .
He lives in Bloomington with his wife , Sheona Mackenzie , who is a school psychologist in the Monroe County schools . Their son , Roddy , is a graduate student in statistics at the University of Washington ; their elder daughter , Kinnear , is completing a medical residency at the University of Colorado ; and their younger daughter , Mattie , is a junior at Hamilton College in New York .
The unfair part , of course , is that when Trump just reads words he 's been given , people are so relieved he gets way too much credit . Look at the speech on Afghanistan . The plan Trump unveiled is clearly never going to improve anything . And he delivered it in a strange way , staring at teleprompters to the left and right but almost never looking directly at the TV audience . But still , it had complete sentences ! He did not once mention his own personal wealth or make up facts about his election victory . The White House basked in glory .
Then came the rally in Phoenix , an excellent example of how the president wanders off the written plan and just sort of runs amok .
He blathered for 77 minutes , dissing the two local Republican senators , one of whom is suffering from brain cancer . He threatened to shut down the government if he did n't get money for his wall . He revealed that “ Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves ” and then raced into another paean to you-know-who .
“ But I do n't come to Washington for me . You know , I 've had a great life . I 've had great success , ” he confided to the viewing world . “ I 've enjoyed my life . Most people think I 'm crazy to have done this . And I think they 're right . But I enjoy it because we 've made so much — I do n't believe that any president — I do n't believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months . I really do n't believe it . ”
We are not going to go into the list of presidents who accomplished more , since it requires naming everyone who 's held the office since Warren Harding .
This is a man who ca n't refrain from congratulating himself even when he 's talking about the weather . “ I was over at the Yuma sector , ” he told the folks in Phoenix , describing his trip to meet members of the Border Patrol . “ It was hot . It was like 115 degrees . I 'm out signing autographs for an hour . I was there . That was a hot day . You learn if you 're in shape if you can do that , believe me . ”
Now the auditorium was full of people from Arizona . They spend their lives in ridiculous heat . It did not seem like a group who you wanted to entertain with a story about how much you suffered signing autographs when it was “ like 115 degrees . ”
It was actually 107 . But that 's the least of our problems .
With a majority of Americans now in favor marijuana legalization , President Barack Obama is now saying weed is no more dangerous to individuals ' health than alcohol .
In an interview with the New Yorker 's David Remnick published Sunday , Obama said while he believes marijuana is `` not very healthy , '' the drug is n't as harmful as some insist .
“ As has been well documented , I smoked pot as a kid , and I view it as a bad habit and a vice , not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life . I do n't think it is more dangerous than alcohol , '' Obama told Remnick .
When asked if he believes marijuana is less harmful than alcohol , Obama said it is less damaging `` in terms of its impact on the individual consumer . ''
`` It 's not something I encourage , and I 've told my daughters I think it 's a bad idea , a waste of time , not very healthy , '' he added .
Marijuana is currently classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 substance , which the DEA considers `` the most dangerous class of drugs with a high potential for abuse and potentially severe psychological and/or physical dependence . '' Other Schedule 1 drugs include heroin , ecstasy and LSD .
Obama said his focus on reforming laws that punish drug users , noting the racial disparity in drug arrests .
`` We should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing , '' he said .
In August , the Obama administration announced it would not stop Washington and Colorado from legalizing recreational marijuana use , marking a major step away from the administration 's war on drugs .
In the New Yorker interview , Obama said he believes these new laws are `` important . ''

We decided to feature this 1972 Lancia Stratos Stradale today despite the fact that we just featured a Stratos last week . I sincerely doubt that any of you will complain about being inundated with a car that re-wrote the rule book for international rally competition and looked utterly spellbinding whilst doing it .
The Stratos Stradale you see pictured here is a barn find of sorts , it was left in a barn and largely forgotten about for the past 15 years . It was originally delivered to a collector in Germany before finding its way to California in the ownership of a British expatriate , the fact that it 's been living in such a dry climate is likely to interest collectors and specialist restorers as it indicates that the car wo n't be rotten under the skin .
After having been inspected by experts from Bonhams , the Stratos is listed as being a complete car with a body in “ very sound condition ” . Although it likely would n't take too much to get the car running , it 's recommended that it undergoes a full restoration before any enthusiastic driving is undertaken . It 's difficult to estimate how much a proper restoration on a car like this would cost , it certainly would n't be cheap but it 's possible that any potential investor would still come out in the black .
The estimated sale price is pretty low at $ 250,000 to $ 300,000 , this is significantly less than a fully sorted example could expect to sell for so if you 'd like to take a second mortgage on the house and get into some vintage rallying , you can click the link here to visit the lot listing via Bonhams .
AP Photo Ben Bernanke on 2016 : 'The political environment is not very good '
Ben Bernanke said he is optimistic that the wave of `` populism '' sweeping the United States will eventually crest , alluding to the rise of Donald Trump on the right and `` democratic socialist '' Bernie Sanders on the left .
`` There is a lot of anger about economic developments in general , and the Fed is one object of that anger , '' the former Federal Reserve chairman said in an interview with MarketWatch published on Tuesday . `` I hope things will get better over time . ''
Story Continued Below
“ I think , as the economy improves and as some of the extreme predictions of Fed critics do n't come true — hyperinflation and the like — that the anger will diminish , ” he said . “ But the political environment certainly is not very good . ”
Bernanke , who headed the central bank during the 2008 financial crisis , also urged Congress to play a greater role in fighting or mitigating any future recession through deficit spending .
“ I do n't think it is something that we need to be thinking about in the United States right now , but just in general , having fiscal policy become a bigger part of our recession-fighting toolkit would be desirable , ” Bernanke said .
Bernanke noted the political barriers at play and said he does n't know whether lawmakers will put their differences aside to prevent another crisis . But if the next administration finds itself on a path toward recession and the Fed says it 's “ running out of weapons , ” he said — for example , an inability to reduce interest rates — fiscal authorities should consider how they want to respond .
“ So , it is nothing to do with the Fed per se , ” he said . “ It has to do with whether or not Congress wants to take the necessary action to help restore growth in a hypothetical future situation where the economy is slowing and the Fed has exhausted its firepower . ”
Slightly more than 2,700 high school seniors from across the country and around the world can go online at 7 p.m . ET Thursday ( today ) to learn if they have been accepted to Duke University .
More than 31,150 students applied for admission this year -- the fourth straight year that applications have exceeded 31,000 -- with more than 28,000 students applying under Duke 's Regular Decision program . Among the Regular Decision applicant pool , 2,650 students -- 9.4 percent -- will receive a notice of acceptance today inviting them to become members of the Class of 2019 . Another 69 students who applied Early Decision and whose decisions were deferred to March also will learn they have been admitted .
These students have until May 1 to make their final decision .
In December , 815 students were admitted under the university 's binding Early Decision program , 18 more than the year before .
`` This is the second year we 've admitted fewer than 10 percent of our Regular Decision applicants , and there were some very difficult decisions we needed to make , '' said Christoph Guttentag , dean of undergraduate admissions . `` Most of the students applying to Duke are extraordinarily well qualified both in their academic credentials and their extracurricular accomplishments .
“ We end up disappointing a good number of exceptionals , deserving students . With only 1,705 places in the class , we just do n't have the room for everyone who did their part to be a competitive applicant . ”
Duke 's admissions policy is `` need blind '' for U.S. citizens and permanent residents , meaning that applicants are accepted regardless of their ability to pay for college . Duke also meets 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for all admitted students .
`` Every year we demonstrate that the university is committed to making a Duke education affordable for students across the economic spectrum , '' Guttentag said . `` We 're one of a small number of universities where the admissions office has the freedom to admit the most compelling candidates regardless of a family 's financial circumstances . ''
All admitted students are invited to campus for Blue Devil Days , a series of two-day events that provide students and their parents opportunities to discuss Duke 's offerings with faculty and administrators , attend classes and tour Duke 's campus . Participants also can get acquainted with other members of the Class of 2019 . This year , Blue Devil Days will be held at three different times : April 9-10 , April 12-13 and April 20-21 .
All students who applied for admission will be able to receive their decisions online , but only those students who are admitted will receive mailed letters . As in previous recent years , students will be able to reply online to offers of admission or the opportunity to be placed on the waiting list .

President Barack Obama used a campaign stop in Washington State on Friday to criticize the Republican presidential candidates on immigration policy and Donald Trump , specifically , for the way he talks about Latinos .
`` How many folks here got a little Irish in them ? '' Obama asked . `` There was a time they were talking about the Irish just like Mr. Trump is talking about Mexicans right now .
Story Continued Below
`` How many Italians , '' Obama continued . `` They were talking about you , too . ''
Referring to a proposal from the former reality television star to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to keep undocumented immigrants from entering the country on foot from Mexico , Obama said that America 's `` greatness does n't come from walls , it comes from opportunity . ''
The line appeared to sideswipe the Trump campaign 's `` Make America Great Again '' slogan .
`` Why are all these Republicans so down on America ? '' Obama said . `` Listening to them is really depressing and it does n't match up with the truth . ''
Obama urged those attending a fundraiser for Washington Sen. Patty Murray to get involved in local , state and national politics .
`` Our system is only as good as what we put into it , '' he said , criticizing the `` false prophets who spout things that under examination do n't really make any sense , but feed your biases and your fears . ''
`` I 'm proud of the fact that we are not just the party that is against everything , '' Obama said .
Obama stayed away from the leadership chaos in the House on Thursday when Republicans canceled elections for Speaker of the House after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy withdrew at the last minute .
He also did not mention the Democratic presidential primary , which could soon include a match up between Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Tom Daley had another confession to make Wednesday : `` I am a gay man now . ''
The announcement came months after he told fans that he was bisexual . `` Of course I still fancy girls , '' Daley said on a YouTube video posted in December 2013 . Later that month , E ! News exclusively revealed that the Olympic diver , 19 , is dating Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black , 39 .
During an appearance on Keith Lemon 's Celebrity Juice , however , Daley admitted he only wants to be with men . `` I came out on YouTube as I wanted to say what I wanted to say without anyone twisting it . I told my family before I told the world . I was terrified . I did not know what the reaction was going to be , '' he explained . `` I did it on YouTube because people were constantly digging and asking questions . ''
Nearly 300 people have been killed after several days of fighting between the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) group and the Syrian government in the historic town of Palmyra , activists said .
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday the dead included 123 Syrian government soldiers and allied militiamen , 115 ISIL fighters , and 57 civilians .
Reports of the deaths came as the Syrian government claimed it had repelled ISIL fighters from the ancient city , where the armed group had seized the northern part of the modern settlement , Tadmur .
Provincial governor Talal Barazi told the AFP news agency that the army had recaptured districts of the town which ISIL had overrun on Saturday .
Barazi said the army was `` still combing the streets for bombs '' , but that `` the situation in the city and its outskirts is good '' .
The ISIL advance on Palmyra had sparked international concern for the safety of the UNESCO World Heritage site . Syrian officials expressed relief that the armed group had been pushed back .
`` We have good news today , we feel much better , '' said antiquities chief Mamoun Abdulkarim .
`` There was no damage to the ruins , but this does not mean we should not be afraid . ''
ISIL launched a lightning offensive across the desert last week from their stronghold in the Euphrates Valley to the east , triggering ferocious fighting with the army , which has a major base just outside the oasis town .
FORT LAUDERDALE ( CBSMiami ) – Suspended Broward Sheriff Deputy Eduardo Mesa bonded out of jail Thursday evening .
As he walked out , Mesa said “ No comment . ”
He was back in court earlier in the day fighting to get out on bond .
His parents and sister went before the judge , putting up a home as collateral for his $ 79,000 bond . The judge accepted it .
Mesa is facing several felony charges , which include grand theft and armed trafficking in hydrocodone . Investigators said he stole drugs that belonged to a dead man , Billy Martin , and lied about it .
Martin was killed when he was hit by train in Pompano Beach in January when investigators said he committed suicide .
Click here to watch the report .
Investigators said the victim 's pill bottle and pills were found in Mesa 's cruiser seven months later .
Tony Alfero , Mesa 's attorney , is using the fact the pills were still in Mesa 's squad car after seven months as a way to fight the charges .
“ I do n't see it as any kind of intent if , in fact , the bottle which is alleged to have been found in his car in July has been sitting there for seven months , ” Alfero said . “ If he intended to do something wrong with it obviously it would n't be in a police car . ”
Kathy Gibbs , Martin 's longtime friend and fiancé , sees this case differently .
“ I 'm relieved that he 's been arrested and it gives me a smidge of hope in the justice system that he would n't be able to do this to anybody else , ” she said .
Gibbs it struck by the fact that not only is Mesa accused of taking Martin 's pills , but tossing his belongs in the trash .
BSO officials said Mesa threw Martin 's personal and private possessions , which were contained in two suitcases , into a dumpster .
Those items , precious to Gibbs and Martin 's family , have never been found .
“ Clearly he did n't have morals , feelings , in my opinion , ” she said . “ His character was shocking in a 17-year officer . He had no care for human life , dead or alive . ”

It should n't be surprising to see Marine Le Pen heap praise upon praise at the UK 's decision to Brexit the EU . The New York Times published a translated piece from the National Front leader , where she declares Brexit was just the latest in “ the people 's spring ” in hopes of grabbing up democracy .
Calls for referendums are ringing throughout the Continent . I myself have suggested to [ French President Francois ] Hollande that one such public consultation be held in France . He did not fail to turn me down . More and more , the destiny of the European Union resembles the destiny of the Soviet Union , which died from its own contradictions . The People 's Spring is now inevitable ! The only question left to ask is whether Europe is ready to rid itself of its illusions , or if the return to reason will come with suffering . I made my decision a long time ago : I chose France . I chose sovereign nations . I chose freedom .
Le Pen is right to a certain extent because the EU is a bureaucratic nightmare . It also cares nothing about republics or democracies . But Le Pen is not the right person to advocate these policies because of her party 's stances on public policy . FN is a proponent of nationalizing France 's industries and a strong welfare state . They 're also in favor of tax hikes , abortion , and a stronger security state .
Le Pen also has a little bit of a problem with timelines , specifically when it comes to the EU 's relationship with Greece . Via NYT :
When in 2015 Greece decided by referendum to reject Brussels ' austerity plans , the European Union 's antidemocratic response took no one by surprise : To deny the people 's will had become a habit . In a flash of honesty , the president of the European Commission , Jean-Claude Juncker , unabashedly declared , “ There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties . ”
It 's true Juncker made the rather odious statement , but they were n't after the 2015 Greece referendum on austerity . Juncker instead made the comments to Le Figero months earlier after Greece elected Alexis Tsipras as prime minister . Either Le Pen is forgetting her history or purposefully trying to mislead Americans reading about Brexit and the EU . Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan was much more honest in his own commentary on Juncker 's statement .
This does n't mean Brexit was bad or that the EU should stick around . Perhaps it 's the nature of politics where different factions get together to fight against a larger threat . There were a variety of reasons for colonists to fight against the British in the American Revolution . Britain and America teamed up with Russia to fight Nazi Germany ( after Russia was stabbed in the back ) . The U.S. has supported dictators and strong men to fight off communists ( with various degrees of success ) . The Gironde and La Montagne were originally part of the Jacobins Club before separating once the French Republic was created . It probably just depends on which faction wins and how much ( if any ) blood is shed .
The biggest issue for the freedom and liberty folk is what comes after the EU ? How will the various nations deal with different ideologies , especially if one goes towards extreme statism , while the other prefers liberalism ( the classical kind of free markets and free minds ) ? How will Russia react to this and will they try to create their own EU or Warsaw Pact ? There are a ton of questions as to what comes next , especially with the poorer nations ( like Greece ) dealing with riots because of austerity . If “ the people 's spring ” turns violent , how will Le Pen ( and her supporters ) defend it , like others tried to do with the “ Arab Spring ” ? The obvious solution for economic liberals ( or libertarians ) is to make sure they have the right people in place to direct policy and convince the public their stances are better than the authoritarians . It also means not sacrificing principles to get ahead . When that happens , nothing will win , except perhaps the power of the state .
“ I want people to pay attention , because this is such a big issue for China , ” Mr. Yi said . He has long criticized China 's family planning policies that emerged in the 1970s and took a draconian hold in the 1980s . “ If so many aggregate numbers are wrong , so how can we make accurate predictions ? ”

Mr. Yi 's claims met skepticism from demographers , who said he had misread or exaggerated statistical discrepancies . But Mr. Yi said he was not just splitting statistical hairs . China 's birthrate will determine the size of the work force sustaining its economy , and the data indicated that stagnation could occur in coming decades , he said .
Chinese main official population statistics have often masked a steep falloff in the birthrate , Mr. Yi said . Even more sobering , he said , President Xi Jinping 's decision in 2015 to loosen the one child policy was too late and piecemeal to arrest a decline in birthrates , Mr. Yi said .
Family planning policies , sometimes enforced with sterilizations and abortions , have ended , but left a lasting imprint on policies and attitudes , Mr. Yi said .

“ We enforced the one-child policy for over three decades , and a swathe of economic and social policies came to center on one child , ” Mr. Yi said at Peking University , according to a Chinese transcript that he shared online

“ Even if family planning stopped , habits die hard , ” he said . “ Overall , our structure is where Japan was in 1992 , and our economic waning will be a long-term trend . ”

Other demographers strongly disagreed with Mr. Yi .
His findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal . Some Chinese experts said that Mr. Yi overstated the problems in the official data , perhaps to fit his longstanding criticism of China 's family planning controls .
“ To report that India surpassed China as the largest population on earth , without the announcement of some agency such as the United Nations ' Population Division , or a serious and peer-reviewed study , is not quite professional , ” said Wang Feng , a sociologist at the University of California , Irvine , who studies China 's population trends . “ The problem with Mr. Yi 's number is that it is based on a hasty and careless calculation . ”
He and other experts scoffed at the idea that China had essentially cooked data to create a phantom population almost as big as Henan Province , which has 94 million people .
“ I think that the numbers from the National Bureau of Statistics are quite reliable , ” said Lu Jiehua , a population researcher at Peking University , referring to the birthrate estimates .

“ As well , what would their motive be for faking on a major scale ? ” Mr. Lu said . “ Being totally dismissive is not objective or scientific . ”

This debate has broad implications , but it will also be fought over seemingly slight differences in assumptions and data that population scientists use to study trends .
That would be a sensitive issue in any society , but in countries like China and India , which are plowing through tumultuous industrial and social changes , it 's even more difficult . And Chinese officials ' habit of massaging data to show their policies in the best light added distortions , Mr. Yi said .

China 's official birthrate — the average number of children born by each woman — is much lower than the rate given in state statistics , he said . China 's fertility rate in 2015 fell to 1.05 births per woman , far lower than the rate of up to 1.64 births per woman estimated by China 's National Health and Family Planning Commission , he said in a PowerPoint presentation at Peking University . The commission did not reply to questions faxed to them about Mr. Yi 's claims .
China 's demographic stagnation could be worse than Japan 's , he argued . Chinese women show less desire to have more than one child and China has not built a robust welfare net that can protect older Chinese .

“ Young people do n't want to have one child , let alone two children , ” he said . “ In the future , it will be very hard to achieve an increase . ”
But some demographers said Mr. Yi appeared to underestimate the ability of Chinese statisticians to reach reasonably accurate estimates . Mr. Wang , the Irvine professor , said demographers made adjustments when analyzing census data to take into account undercounting of births — a common problem in censuses — but he said Mr. Yi unfairly treated “ all adjustments as unscientific and political . ”

“ The numbers from the National Health and Family Planning Commission are derived from hospital childbirth statistics , ” said Liu Hongyan , a researcher at the China Population and Development Research Center , a government institute in Beijing . “ In recent years the rate of hospital births has been quite high , up to 97-98 percent , so I think those numbers from the hospitals are quite solid . ”
In India , too , Mr. Yi 's findings were met with raised eyebrows .
K.S . James , a professor of population studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi , said it was unlikely that population estimates were so off that India had already overtaken China . That will happen in the coming years , he said .

Indian people born 20 years ago “ will be getting married now , ” Mr. James said . “ The population will grow for the next 30 to 40 years . ”
A Maricopa County Superior Court judge on Friday ordered that the Sheriff 's Office divulge the password it forcefully installed on a county computer system linked to sensitive state and federal criminal-justice data .
But Chief Deputy David Hendershott later said he will refuse to share the password - even if it means he goes to jail .
During the Friday hearing , Judge Joseph Heilman said that if the Sheriff 's Office does n't divulge the password by Wednesday , he will `` hold someone in contempt of court . ''
`` I assume it 's going to be someone seated at this table , '' he added , referring to Hendershott .
Hendershott said he could not reveal the password under federal law . And if he goes to jail : `` I bet I get a pretty decent place . Something with a view of the dump . ''
Heilman would not comment on the remark .
Since April , Heilman has presided over a lawsuit between the sheriff and the Board of Supervisors over operation of the Integrated Criminal Justice Information System , an electronic hub that allows the county 's criminal-justice agencies to share information .
Taking control
On Wednesday , the Sheriff 's Office took control of the system from county employees and changed a password to prevent civilians from having access to the sensitive data .
The system links the criminal-justice agencies to state and national databases that hold criminal records , court dates , probation and personal information , and other records .
The supervisors and county administrators tried to get a temporary restraining order against the Sheriff 's Office and get the system back under their control .
The judge did not grant the restraining order .
The judge also ordered the Sheriff 's Office to call a meeting in his courtroom on Tuesday with `` stakeholders '' who are supposed to control the system .
Those stakeholders include the Sheriff 's and County Attorney 's offices , indigent-defense agencies , adult probation and the Superior Court .
Wade Swanson , director of the county 's civil-litigation department , called the judge 's ruling a win for the Board of Supervisors : `` He reversed what the sheriff did on Wednesday . ''
County Manager David Smith , meanwhile , said the ruling took the county `` back to a civilized way of doing business . ''
However , county attorney spokesman Barnett Lotstein said the sheriff 's witnesses were not given much time .
During the two-day hearing , county witnesses gave testimony on Thursday and Friday , while Lotstein said the sheriff 's witnesses were n't given time to present their case .
Lotstein said the sheriff `` may very well have been deprived of due process . ''
`` The sheriff was denied his day in court this afternoon , '' he added .
State , federal law
Under state and federal law , a criminal-justice agency must manage the system or county agencies could lose access to the National Criminal Information Center and the Arizona Criminal Justice Information System . However , the integrated system now is under county control .
The county has been trying to figure out a new management system , but because of the tension among the county , the Sheriff 's Office and County Attorney 's Office , they have been deadlocked .
Kerry Martin , an attorney for the Sheriff 's Office , told the court that the office changed the password because county managers were trying to force the office to agree to a management system they disagree with .
Heilman repeatedly asked Martin why he did not come to the court before the takeover .
Martin answered that the Sheriff 's Office did not need approval and had the authority to take control .
The judge also ordered that no further changes be made to the computer system by anyone during the length of the lawsuit .
Hendershott said the Sheriff 's Office is conducting a criminal investigation into suspected mismanagement of the computer system .
He said the investigation targets Superior Court presiding Judge Barbara Mundell , County Manager Smith and other county personnel .
He did not provide details on the investigation .
BEREA , Ohio -- DeShone Kizer conceded Monday that being spotted at a downtown Cleveland bar early Saturday morning caused a distraction the winless Browns do not need .
`` When you become the centerpiece of a distraction for a week , it definitely is very frustrating on my part , '' Kizer said one day after the Browns lost for the seventh time in seven games this season . `` That is not who I am . My mother would n't be proud of this . That is pretty much the biggest takeaway is done whatever you can to make sure that you are not a distraction . ''
Several videos of Kizer at the bar were posted on Snapchat , WKRK-FM in Cleveland reported . One was played on Tailgate 19 on WOIO in Cleveland before the game . The 11-second video merely showed Kizer , baseball cap on backward , talking while standing at the bar .
Coach Hue Jackson said he does not begrudge his players having a social life , as long as they are not breaking the law or violating team rules . However , he said that in this day and age they have to understand they always are targets for a social media appearance . He said stories like this are magnified with a losing team .
`` I think everybody has to be careful , not just DeShone , not just the quarterback . I think all of our players do , '' Jackson said . `` Just because I think those are the things that become headlines more so than what is really the issue [ that ] we have to play football better . ''
WKRK reported that with Kizer were wide receivers Kenny Britt and Corey Coleman and linebacker Christian Kirksey of the Browns , along with Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt and tight end Travis Kelce -- both of whom are Cleveland natives . Britt and Coleman had been sent home from a road trip to Houston five days earlier after missing curfew .
Jackson said it was his understanding that a larger group went out to dinner in Cleveland and the smaller group stayed later .
`` A couple of guys stuck around and have some conversations and now it turns into all of this , '' Jackson said . `` I do n't see any harm in that because guys are out and talking and having a little fun . I do n't see anything wrong with that . ''
Kizer said simply being asked about what happened shows it is a distraction .
`` With that , it is on me to make sure that , from here on out , I am not a distraction and I am only an asset to this team , not a guy that is pulling away from the ultimate goal , '' he said .
Meanwhile , Jackson said he will announce Wednesday who will start at quarterback when the Browns play the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday in London . Kizer has started six games and has thrown three touchdown passes and 11 interceptions . Cody Kessler replaced him during the Browns ' most recent loss , to the Tennessee Titans .
Giuliana Rancic is not a racist . At least , that 's what the Fashion Police presenter suggested late on Tuesday evening when she issued a full-throated apology to Zendaya Coleman , darling of the Disney channel .
Apparently , Rancic was doing her best to fill Joan Rivers ' sardonic stilettos when she quipped that Coleman 's new faux-dreadlocks made the starlet look like she “ [ smelled ] like patchouli oil ” . Or weed . You know . Because , Bob Marley .
Once news of Rancic 's joke hit social media , however , very few people were laughing , least of all Coleman . The 18-year-old delivered an impassioned rebuke , pointing out the real problem with Rancic 's comments : “ There is a fine line between what is funny and disrespectful , ” Coleman shared on Twitter . “ To say that an 18-year-old young woman with locs must smell of patchouli oil or ‘ weed ' is not only a large stereotype but outrageously offensive . ”
Rancic initially tweeted Coleman a half-hearted apology , claiming her jab at the teen 's hair “ had nothing to do with race ” . But Black Twitter – the social network 's proverbial cool table – was n't having it . The response was swift and decisive . One popular user labelled the presenter 's observation “ racist and xenophobic ” , while another called it “ disgusting ” . By Tuesday night , Rancic 's name had been mentioned in more than 40,000 tweets , and the overwhelming majority of the comments were bad . Real bad .
Even celebrities piled in . Rancic 's Fashion Police co-host , Kelly Osbourne , threatened to walk off the show because she does n't “ condone racism ” , and the Grammy award-winning singer India Arie took to her blog to defend Coleman , and her hair . “ I 'm not calling Giuliana Rancic a RACIST…but OF COURSE it has to do with RACE , ” the singer wrote .
“ To say it has ‘ Nothing to do with race'…THAT 'S why people get mad. ” Arie added : “ It 's offensive . It has a racist edge . But also it 's also just off base . WAY off base . ”
As the condemnation of Rancic 's misguided remarks became even more heated , and the demand for a more formal apology from Rancic grew , I could n't help but watch in amazement , and dismay , as people worked themselves into a tizzy over yet another obtuse comment from a celebrity . I fully understand why many chose to critique Rancic 's remarks . Her words disparaged not only Coleman but also an entire swath of people with Afro-textured hair who are often marginalised by mainstream ( read : white ) beauty ideals . Moreover , as an African-American woman with a kinky mane , I have often felt frustrated , annoyed , and othered by those who view black hair as less acceptable , unruly , or unattractive simply because it is n't straight and blonde .
So I get it : Rancic was wrong . However , at times I wish we would n't take the bait , because losing our collective cool over the narrow-minded utterances of a celebrity is just a distraction . For all the wonderful conversations Twitter has sparked about race , gender , religion , and politics , the social network is rife with distractions masquerading as righteous indignation . An errant remark by a politician , a clumsy statement by a TV presenter , or a racially charged joke by anyone with a platform can quickly become a topic of national , or even international , conversation . But should it ?
In 1975 , Toni Morrison gave a powerful speech about the effects of racism on black artists and writers : “ It 's important to know who the real enemy is and to know the very serious function of racism , which is distraction . It keeps you from doing your work . It keeps you explaining over and over your reason for being , ” Morrison told students at Portland State University .
“ Somebody says you have no language , so you spend 20 years proving that you do . Somebody says your head is n't shaped properly , so you have scientists working on the fact that it is . Somebody says you have no art , so you dredge that up . Somebody says you have no kingdoms , so you dredge that up . None of that is necessary . There will always be one more thing . ”
Morrison 's argument – that there will always be one more offensive remark – sums up my thoughts on the cycle of “ outrage ” . Though some conversations , such as discussing the problematic bits of actress Patricia Arquette 's Oscar speech , are certainly worth having , constantly reacting to every single microaggression is not only a waste of time , but also serves to reinforce the myth of the superiority of white opinions and ideals over all others .
Black folks are used to residing on the margins . We 're constantly left out of race-neutral , “ colour-blind ” conversations because white remains the default in many societies . And while this is unfair , as Morrison notes , constantly trying to prove our worth and explain our reason for being is a waste of time .
Though Rancic 's comments about Coleman 's hair were stupid , closed-minded and painfully stereotypical , they do n't actually matter , and neither does her apology .
What matters is that people of colour centre ourselves in the conversation and continue to go about the business of living , thriving , loving , creating , dressing , and styling our hair however we see fit . Because , as Morrison explained to those students 40 years ago : “ A prison is erected when one spends one 's life fighting phantoms , concentrating on myths and explaining over and over to the conqueror your language , your lifestyle , your history , your habits . And you do n't have to do it any more . ”

What critics are saying
Vive $ 799 , from HTC
A week after the launch of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset , a new competitor in the world of VR gaming has arrived . HTC 's Vive costs more ( nearly $ 800 compared to the Rift 's $ 600 price tag ) , but also provides more in the box : namely , a pair of one-handed , motion-sensing SteamVR controllers as well as two base stations that track your movement over an area of at least 6 feet by 5 feet ( up to a maximum of 15 feet by 15 feet ) .
The aim is for that increased physical action and freedom of movement to provide an even more immersive experience , akin to a Star Trek holodeck . The downside is that you 'll need to find a large enough clear space in your home to take full advantage of it .
Both new VR headsets offer similar visual resolution . As with the Rift , you 'll need a high-powered Windows PC to run the HTC Vive , and the minimum system requirements are similar to those for the Oculus headset . Unlike Rift , which has its own proprietary software and storefront , the Vive runs on Steam and pairs with the Steam distribution portal . A few games ( including Fantastic Contraption and Job Simulator ) are free with your hardware purchase . In all , over 100 compatible games are available via SteamVR at launch , though the bulk of those are fairly simplistic .
In general , critics seem to prefer the Vive to the Rift , thanks to the more immersive experience provided by the included controllers . Below , find quotes from professional reviews of the Vive hardware . ( Click on any publication name to read the full review . ) Scores ( converted to our 0-100 scale ) are listed only if one has been assigned by the publication itself ; otherwise , we have grouped the reviews into rough categories , from most to least positive .
Extremely positive reviews
Destructoid If you have the space for it , for my money , the HTC Vive blows the Oculus out the water as a long term investment . ... I 've used the Vive for the better part of two weeks now as a daily part of my routine and I 've not once experienced motion sickness , fatigue or eye strain . I have instead experienced gaming in a form that 's more exciting than anything else I have played in some time .
Digital Trends Even if you 're not into VR , or have no interest , you need to try the Vive . This is the VR experience you 've always dreamed of . No competitor , including Oculus Rift , can compare to the Vive right now . It 's the closest thing we 'll get to The Matrix anytime soon .
93 IGN Its demanding setup and fits of unreliability give the Vive major caveats , but the simple fact is that this is an unprecedented piece of hardware that opens up absolutely amazing possibilities for gaming and beyond . ... If you 're willing to rearrange your furniture to experience everything this exciting new technology has to offer as soon as possible , the Vive is absolutely the VR headset for you .
SlashGear It 's reinvigorated my love of gaming . ... What sets Vive apart so thoroughly is how it blurs the division between the digital space and the real world . Spend a few minutes in even the most basic of Vive games , and it 's hard not to get sucked into believing that the two environments are one and the same . It 's simply more realistic , more engaging , and frankly more fun than any of the others .
90 Time With Oculus ' Rift , you 're restricted mostly to sitting experiences , waggling thumbsticks or tapping buttons on a gamepad—the novelty 's all in what you can do with your head . The Vive adds both of your hands by way of large dual wands that look a bit like Boba Fett 's Slave One . The difference these make in virtual space is staggering . ... If you have money to burn and an interest in virtual reality , for now , HTC 's Vive is the device to beat .
Tom 's Hardware To be frank , the Rift left me scratching my head as to why I 'd need virtual reality to enjoy some of its games . Meanwhile , all of the games designed for the Vive leave no question as to why they require hand controls . VR for games that work in 2D is neat , but it feels like a novelty after sampling the alternative . Room-scale games do not feel that way at all . ... HTC and Valve came together and created something truly incredible . The experience that you get from room-scale VR with hand-tracked controllers is going to change your definition of what gaming can be .
Positive reviews
Ars Technica Perhaps the sheer novelty of the Vive 's experience will wear off with more time , or perhaps developers will fail to take the fullest advantage of the new interaction models the Vive provides . At this point , though , I 'd say that 's unlikely . If you can get over the significant space requirements , the facial comfort issues , and the price point ( especially if you do n't have a decent gaming PC ) , HTC and Valve will sell you a little glimpse of the future that you can use in your house right now .
80 CNET If you want the very best VR , the Vive offers motion controllers and an entire room-tracking system in a package the Oculus Rift ca n't match . Yet . But you trade convenience and compactness for a stellar room-scale VR experience , if you have the room for it . I do n't know if I 'd want all this tech in my life right now if I was n't reviewing it . It 's complex , bulky , full of wires and parts to sync . But I 'd want to be near it . Very near it . And I ca n't wait to see the apps and games that come next .
82 Engadget It 's oh-so-close to being the Holy Grail of VR experiences . It 's just too bad that ergonomics get in the way of truly enjoying it .
GameSpot Unlike Rift , Vive comes with strict spatial requirements if you plan to utilize its hardware 's full potential . It 's not the easiest suite of hardware to set up , nor is it as refined as Rift , but Vive delivers the most advanced VR experience to date , a luxury that comes at a cost and with compromises . Where Rift feel 's like a VR headset built for mainstream consumption , Vive caters to the hardcore crowd that will stop at nothing to get the best VR experience .
Gizmodo The HTC Vive 's goggles are heavy—noticeably heavier than the Oculus Rift 's . They 're heavier than a bike helmet , heavier than a baseball cap , heavier than scuba goggles , and probably heavier than anything you 've ever put on your face . But it 's a small price to pay for walking around in a virtual space , especially if you 're excited about it , so most people will probably disregard the excruciating weight of the plastic headset . I know I did . ... But the HTC Vive ... [ is ] launching with a bunch of half-baked titles that would be better off bundled together in a sale bin .
Mashable The Vive is as `` there '' as the Rift is at this point . Put it on for the first time , and your mind is blown . But spend an uninterrupted hour messing around in the virtual , and you 'll pine for the gentle caress of actual reality . That just speaks to how new all of this tech is . ... HTC does n't have the game exclusives that Oculus does , but Vive offers exclusive experiences that are n't yet technically possible using any of its competitors . If you want the fullest VR experience that 's available right now — and you have both the space and the computer to support it — the Vive is your answer .
80 PC Mag Cables are the biggest nuisance of the Vive . The cable that runs from the headset might be long ( about 10 feet ) , but it 's still easy to get caught on if you do n't keep track of where it is . This is a bigger issue for whole-room VR than it is when using the Vive standing or sitting .
80 PC World Playing room-scale Vive experiences leaves me feeling giddy about gaming in a way I have n't felt ... well , since the earliest days of the Oculus . Walking around . Touching things with my hands . Truly inhabiting a space . These are logical next steps for virtual reality and for gaming , and it leaves the Rift looking backwards by comparison . Safe , even .
80 Polygons So the headset is heavier and not as polished as its competitors , the cable bundle is clunky , and setup requires a large initial investment from the player in just about every way . ... The Vive asks a lot from anyone buying the platform , but it gives just as much back , if not more so . Everyone has the same reaction after a demo , in our experience : They remark on how complicated it seems and how little they 'd want to set one up in their own home , and then they get wide-eyed and want to tell you all about how amazed they are by the experience .
Shacknews The HTC Vive is definitely a first generation product . It is apparent how much time was spent on making sure this product was as great as it could be , but it has its limitations . ... [ But ] HTC Vive definitely offers the best VR experience out of the box so far .
TechCrunch It tries so many damn things , and it gets most of the things so right , though not every feature is a home run . $ 799 is a lot of cash , but it really feels worth it here . The experience is in a lot of ways so much richer than any other headsets out there , including the Rift .
80 Tom 's Guide The virtual experience is still awe-inspiring , but the ability to literally reach out and touch something is a game-changer . As fun and mind-blowing as the Vive is , a lack of built-in audio and a sometimes confusing interface are disappointing . The amount of setup is frustrating , too , especially for those of us who live in tiny apartments or houses that do n't have the room or a cluster of outlets to spare .
80 The Verge Expectations for the Vive are high — and the headset both exceeds and falls short of them . ... On a pure image quality level , both [ Rift and Vive ] are at the top of the VR headset game . But the Rift showed everyone that consumer VR headsets can be both comfortable and a little stylish , while the significantly heavier Vive remains something you might expect to see in a fighter pilot training course or a ‘ 90s arcade .
Mixed/so-so reviews
Tech Insider The Vive is , right now , pure potential . ... The Vive is both the best VR system available and something you probably should n't buy just yet . For as incredible an experience as it can create , it 's equally matched in discomfort — the headset 's straps , paired with the wire situation and the headphone situation , make an expensive , bleeding-edge electronics product feel woefully underdone .
The Wall Street Journal The Vive is less buzzy than Oculus , and its product is less refined . That 's not saying much—I would n't buy either right now . Yet the Vive has two clear advantages that helped me get lost in the experience and forget all about the gear . First , I was free to move around the whole room , so I could peer over the edge of the reef or inspect a floating critter up close . Second , holding motion-sensitive controllers , my hands became part of the action so I could interact with the undersea life . ... After a week with each , I had more fun with the Vive than with the Rift .

Former Rep. Ron Paul said the law enforcement that swarmed around Boston in the days following the marathon bombings was scarier than the actual terrorist attack .
“ The Boston bombing provided the opportunity for the government to turn what should have been a police investigation into a military-style occupation of an American city , ” he said on the Lew Rockwell website , Politico reported . “ This unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself . ”
The terror attacks on April 15 in Boston killed three and injured 264 .
Mr. Paul , a former libertarian political candidate who served in Congress as a member of the Republican Party , said the door-to-door searches police conducted in Watertown for the bombing suspects were particularly alarming .
They reminded of a “ military coup in a far off banana republic , ” he said , Politico reported . “ Force lockdown of a city . Militarized police riding tanks in the streets . Door-to-door armed searches without warrant . Families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable cause . Businesses forced to close . Transport shut down . ”
Mr. Paul reminded the surviving suspect , 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , was ultimately discovered by a civilian , and not due to police crackdown , Politico reported .
“ He was discovered by a private citizen , who then placed a call to the police , ” he said . “ And he was identified not by government surveillance cameras , but by private citizens who willingly shared their photographs with the police . ”

I 'm no expert about Syria , so why these blogposts ? The initial stimulus was realising that people of good will and similar ethics can have some markedly contrasting views of the situation in Syria . This was a puzzle to me . And given the gravity of what 's at stake , I felt an obligation to try and solve it .
The basic disagreement could not be explained by familiar sorts of political bias . It cuts across left-right and authoritarian-libertarian lines ; a person 's stance on it can not even be predicted by their stance , say , on Palestine , or Cuba . Attitudes to Russia can be a better indicator , but if my own case is anything to go by , this has nothing particularly to do with political views and is anyway an effect rather than a cause . What Putin says about Syria tend to resonate with what I 've come to think ; I have never thought that any statement was true because Putin made it . I also just do n't think it very intellectually mature or responsible to suppose that something is false because he says it !
Still , it is understandable that people would rather accept the consensus view of our news outlets , especially since it is echoed by the vast majority of our politicians and opinion formers , along with NGOs like Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , and MSF . They present Assad as the problem in Syria and regime change as the solution .
The general public do not perceive that view as a controversial one . It seems established beyond the range of normal political debate that ‘ Assad must go ' . ‘ Assad 's regime ' is regarded , like Hitler 's , as beyond the pale of reasonable disagreement . The only kind of debate there can be on this basis is whether Assad is as bad as Hitler . In fact , US spokesperson Sean Spicer recently suggested Hitler was less bad .
As karma would have it , the hapless Spicer also let us know , with a slip of the tongue , that America 's “ first goal is to destabilise Syria ” .
Should we believe the official narrative or the one that , while suppressed , still sometimes slips out ? I have asked this question of reports from Channel 4 , from BBC , from Amnesty International , from Doctors Without Borders , and from UK Government . I 've shared my findings in the five blogs respectively linked . I have concluded that none of those reports provides credible evidence to support the mainstream account of what has been happening in Syria these past six years .
I ask nobody to take my word for it , though , and I would urge everybody , who gets the chance , to look more closely for yourself . This is not a matter on which any established authority should simply be assumed reliable .
It is not a matter of normal political loyalties . On Syria I now have more faith in the views of Peter Hitchens or Peter Oborne writing in the Daily Mail , for instance , than in those of George Monbiot in the Guardian ; I got blocked on Twitter by Paul Mason for asking an awkward question ; I 've even questioned the wisdom of a statement by Caroline Lucas ( here ) . I feel all the more resolutely ecologically socialist for recognising that independently conservative thought can sometimes be more astutely resistant than that of progressives to the deceptions of a delinquent neoliberal globalism .
The issue here is not a normal part of political argument . Politics can even serve to distract us from what I believe is a serious matter of truth against war . The agenda underlying foreign states ' investment in the war in Syria is continuous with what came to fruition in Iraq and Libya . We have good reasons to fear that it will lead on to a still more catastrophic confrontation with Iran and even Russia .
Perhaps that 's why those who do not accept the mainstream narrative can be presented as ‘ siding with the Russians ' , who do n't want war either ! But I 'd go further and say there are people of no nation on this planet who want war . That is why we should not let ourselves be deceived into thinking that anything we truly want can only be achieved at the price of war .
As for the war in Syria , please do n't believe me . Please just do n't let yourself be deceived . This is too important , not only for you and me , but for our children , and everyone else too . Please ask questions about who wants war and why , and please then think about how they can be stopped from getting it .
…
Afterword
Who do I believe ? I tend to believe those I find sincere and whose statements are coherent , consistent , and not belied by their actions . I believe ISIS when they say they want to destroy the Syrian secular state and create their caliphate . I believe Al Qaeda and the multitude of other Islamist terror organisations that threaten terrible violence of the kind they routinely execute . I believe the ordinary people who live in Syria and say they just want to be left to live their lives in peace . I find I also believe , on the basis of scores of interviews I 've now seen , that the Syrian president is doing all he can to fulfil the wish of the latter against threats of the former . I believe his claims that the foreign states ' regime change agenda has nothing to do with trying to do right by the Syrian people . If that makes me an ‘ Assad Apologist ' , I make no apology . For anyone who thinks Iraq or Libya today have better governance than Syria 's government-protected areas do is not someone I would feel capable of debating with . Of course , Syria could do a lot better still , and the Syrian people should be free to choose their government . My instinct , for what it 's worth , tells me that Bashar Al Assad and the First Lady Asma Al Assad long for such a day to come . But the nation 's sovereignty has first to be fully restored .
I have stopped believing reports about Syria from Amnesty International , an organisation I actively supported for two decades . For no report I have seen produces credible evidence to support its claims about the war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the Syrian government . I illustrate this here , and here , and I further show how the organisation has been captured by people with no interest in human rights here . I fear there seems to be a similar problem even in some parts of MSF 's organisation . As for the news outlets , with almost nobody on the ground , they provide little coverage of areas that are under legitimate government , while , from occupied areas , they rely heavily on terrorist sources like Al Qaeda , under its various rebrandings . And our government ? It provides funds , weapons and training for Al Qaeda . Some of this goes into the PR campaign sustained as White Helmets . If you are inclined to believe what the White Helmets say , then I suggest you watch the Oscar-winning documentary about them and ask yourself one simple question : where are the terrorists ? I assume that anyone who is reading these words does not need me to make any comment about poor little Bana Alabed . But you might know people who do , so please be gentle with them . We are all at different stages of learning about how we are misled .

Ever since the fixtures were announced late last year this was the game everyone at the club was looking forward to , and now it has arrived .
The Golden Fern will fly across the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday to take on the unbeaten Toronto Wolfpack at the Lamport Stadium ( 9:30pm GMT , 4:30pm Canadian time , live on Premier Sports TV ) .
The challenge facing our young team is enormous . The Wolfpack have won every single game in League 1 so far , racking up some huge scores along the way . Despite being massive underdogs our head coach says he 's looking forward to what he calls ‘ a game of a lifetime ' . Speaking after training on Tuesday evening Lee Greenwood said : “ We 're all really looking forward to the challenge . To get the chance to play in front of a big crowd in a great city like Toronto will be amazing . We 've faced some very good sides this season but Toronto are obviously the best team in the division .
“ Unfortunately we 've lost a number of players in recent weeks so we 're going to be up against it . Injuries are part of the game though so we 're not going to feel sorry for ourselves . We 've watched a fair bit of Toronto so we know what they can do . It 's important we concentrate on our game though and not worry too much about them .
“ We 've got a very young , inexperienced squad that have done very well so far this season . I 'm sure the lads will want to do themselves proud on Saturday , if they can come off the pitch at full time having given their all then you ca n't ask for more . ”
Saturday 's defeat against Barrow has come at a cost with Courtney Davies being ruled out of the game in Toronto with an injury . Chris Barlow 's leg injury he sustained up in Cumbria is n't as serious as first expected and he 's hopeful of starting the game on Saturday . Brad Hargreaves and Kadeem Williams wo n't be making the trip owing to work commitments . With Ben Stead , Brad Kislingbury and Harry Kidd playing for England at the Student World Cup Greenwood 's selection options have been severely limited . On the plus side full back Alex Gaskell looks like travelling having missed three months out with a foot injury . Errol Carter and Sam Hodge have been called back from their loan deals with South Wales Ironmen and both could feature on Saturday .

The assault took place in Istanbul and reportedly was due to the music fans listening to rock music and drinking during Ramadan .
Dominique Soguel / AP A ripped up Radiohead poster at the Istanbul record shop on Saturday .
ISTANBUL — Screaming thugs stormed an alternative record store in central Istanbul Friday night where fans of the band Radiohead had gathered for a listening party . The enraged unidentified assailants yelled , beat customers and smashed equipment , driving the fans outside , where more shouting ensued . Much of the encounter was captured on video . The mob was apparently incensed that those inside the record store , including what appeared to be at least two foreigners , were drinking beer and listening to rock music during the holy month of Ramadan .
There were no serious injuries , CNN Turk reported . The incident will surely further damage the tourism industry of Turkey and its premier city , which has been battered by numerous terrorist strikes claimed by ISIS and Kurdish separatist guerillas . Islamist and nationalist vigilantes are on edge , having threatened to violently smash up the city 's annual gay pride march next weekend . The mayor of the city , citing security concerns in the wake of the threats by the rightwing extremists as well as the attack on gays in an Orlando nightclub , abruptly canceled the parade , the largest in the Middle East . The record store , Velvet Indieground , caters to Western and Turkish underground and indie music aficionados . It is located in a corner of the mostly upscale Cihangir neighborhood that remains on the front line of gentrification , with foreigners and wealthy urbanites working in the arts and media bristling against traditionally minded families who have lived in the neighborhood for decades .

Whenever 12-year-old Jezreel Ann Balbuena comes down with a cold , her parents rush to a nearby pharmacy to get hold of nonprescription drugs and take turns tending to her . Going to see a doctor is not an option because the family has no health insurance .
Daily necessities , such as rice , clothes and stationery items , are hard to come by , too , with Balbuena unable to wear anything other than her mother 's hand-me-down clothes .
“ I 'm ashamed every time I find myself to be the last person in my classroom to pay school lunch fees and other school-related expenses , ” the Filipino said . “ I 'm scared of the way people look at me . ”
Like many other children born into undocumented immigrant families , Balbuena has no valid visa status — a situation that has thrown her into a lifetime of poverty and legal limbo .
Ever since they were caught overstaying their visas in 2009 , her family has lived on a highly precarious status called karihomen , or provisional release , that spares them detention but requires monthly renewal . Those on provisional release are unable to work , claim national health insurance or travel beyond their residing prefecture without permission from immigration authorities .
As such , many children live in fear that their family may one day be denied renewal and repatriated to a country that they know nothing about .
Some of these children , in asking for special permission to live in Japan , have been told by the government that while they qualify on humanitarian grounds , their parents do not — an ultimatum that threatens to tear their families apart .
Eight children in such a predicament petitioned the Tokyo Regional Immigration Bureau , in Shinagawa Ward , on Friday for clemency from the government to allow their families to stay and , as one organizer put it , “ pursue their dreams in Japan . ”
“ To these children , their parents ' countries are so foreign . These are not the places for them to ‘ return ' to , ” said organizer Jotaro Kato , who heads nonprofit organization Asian People 's Friendship Society ( APFS ) .
“ Children ca n't pick the parents they are born to . Given their circumstances , I believe they deserve a bit of mercy from the government . And being together with their parents is crucial to their sound development . ”
Friday 's action comes amid Japan 's intensifying crackdown on illegal immigrants , including visa overstayers , in the lead-up to the 2020 Olympic games . Although Japan used to tolerate visa overstayers at the height of its bubble economy , it quickly began to clamp down on them once demand for their labor fizzled out , branding them criminals responsible for wrongdoing such as home invasions and robberies .
The number of visa overstayers was 60,007 as of Jan. 1 this year , about one-fifth of the record 298,646 logged in 1993 , according to the Justice Ministry .
The Justice Ministry , in a five-year immigration policy review unveiled last month , has decided to ratchet up efforts to oust overstayers by strengthening cooperation with police in a move it claims will improve public order and security .
“ We 're sorry for breaking Japan 's rule , ” Balbuena 's mother , Myla , said .
She and her husband , Frederick , initially came to Japan in 2001 on a three-month tourist visa and later overstayed it in pursuit of employment . “ But we 're begging the government to give us a chance to stay in Japan . The future of our daughter is our concern . ”
“ Japan is my only home . I ca n't , and do n't want to , imagine myself living anywhere other than here , ” Balbuena , who does n't understand Tagalog at all , said .
Balbuena 's story is not an isolated case among children of overstayers .
Iranian Narin Zoljalalian , for one , knows all about hardships as a result of not having a visa . Having moved to Japan at age 2 in 2002 , she now lives alone with her mother on provisional release after facing a deportation order for overstaying their visas in 2007 .
With no proper form of identification , such as a residence certificate , the 16-year-old said she could n't open her own bank account , nor could she work in a part-time job as her friends do .
The Justice Ministry , in response to her handwritten letter pleading for an exceptional measure to greenlight her and her mother 's stay in Japan , answered in December last year that she was eligible for such special permission . But her mother , the ministry said , needed to be repatriated no matter what .
“ I do n't understand why the ministry would drive us apart , ” Zoljalalian said .
“ The most frightening part is I do n't know when and whether this unstable life of ours will come to an end . I often ask myself , could this be the last summer I would spend with my friends in Japan ? Or would I be able to join our school trip next year ? My future is so uncertain I ca n't even think about whether to go to college . ”
With the cooperation of her classmates , Zoljalalian is now collecting signatures as part of her campaign to obtain residency for her mother and her .
Kato from APFS said being undocumented affected the well-being of children even more as they grew older .
Such is the case for an 18-year-old Filipino boy in Saitama Prefecture .
The boy 's parents came to Japan in 1994 on a tourist visa in search of employment and it was n't until he was 11 years old that he learned about his family 's situation when , on one unforgettable morning , a group of immigration officials showed up unannounced and took his father to a detention center . His family is currently granted provisional release .
At no time in his life , the boy said , had he been more excruciatingly aware of the consequences of not having a visa than today . A sense of crisis has descended upon him lately with the realization that it wo n't be long before he stops being a “ child ” entitled to full protection and care by his parents . He will be a full-fledged adult in two years and will need to make ends meet on his own and support the family .
Currently a student at a Saitama vocational school for nursing care , he is hoping to pass a national nursing exam to work in the industry . But without a visa , he will remain unemployable even if he has passed .
“ When I was in high school , I used to not care much about my situation , perhaps except for the fact that I could n't have a part-time job . But now that I 've come to a point in my life where I 'm expected to do lots of things on my own , the lack of a visa has become a serious worry for me , ” said the boy , who asked to have his name withheld for privacy reasons .
Although children of visa overstayers certainly have it tough , that is not to say that they are entirely in despair .
Despite financial difficulties , Filipino Balbuena , for one , said she loved her school , her face brightening with joy as she described her volleyball club activities , her lunchtime chitchat with friends and her future dream of becoming a nurse .
“ I want to do something to help others , ” she said . “ I love making people smile . ”

We wanted to redisign our site year ago , and came to one of the famous agencies . What they 've offered us did n't reflect the main idea of our fund . Well , frankly speaking — it was trash .
After a year when we decided to try once again , we surely had that negative experience , but we really wanted to make the best website on our market . In the end , we decide to make a tender procedure , so we could find the best team to work with such important mission . One of the criteria was the knowledge of UMI.CMS platform . Red Collar was in the top three . I think it was an intuition to choose them , and luckily we were not disappointed .
What I liked the most is that they hear the client , but not just do everything the client want . They try to find the right solution . Then , reasonable creativity which includs specificity of the client . And of course , the result . I do n't know how they did it , but in the end we got what we needed : light ( but not lightweight ) , informative ( but not overloaded ) , high-tech ( but not too complicated ) website to stay for a long time , because it 's interesting , non-standart and inspiring . But what is more important — it is really the best one .
We are really thankful to Red Collar for their excellent work and ready to recommend their team to everyone .
On paper , your investments in stocks , real estate or even cash may look like your greatest assets . While all those things are superimportant , you have something else that 's even more valuable . It 's the investment called you .
Finding ways to increase your value while doing the things you love may be the most important thing you do . Maybe you pursue more training to qualify for a raise . Maybe you find a way to sell the photography you did as a hobby . Maybe you find a way to turn your freelance writing into full-time work .
They all involve doing something new for you , but when you head down this path , you are probably going to run into this thing , this fear that you 're bumping up against the limits of your ability . Then , the voice inside your head may start saying things like :
■ “ Who gave you permission to do that ? ”
■ “ Do you have a license to be an artist ? ”
■ “ Who said you could draw on cardstock with a Sharpie in Park City , Utah , and send those sketches to The New York Times ? ”
I think you get the idea . It 's at the moment when you 're most vulnerable that all your doubts come crashing in around you . When I first heard that voice in my own head , I did n't know what to make of it . The fear was paralyzing . Every time I sent a sketch or something else into the world , I worried the world would say , “ You 're a fraud . ”
Germany 's highest criminal court overturned the conviction of former arms industry lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber on Tuesday and ordered a retrial .
The court ruled that mistakes were made in the 2010 trial of the German Canadian , now 77 , who was at the center of a party funding scandal that disgraced former Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
Schreiber was sentenced to eight years in prison for tax evasion in May 2010 for failing to report some 14.6 million deutsche marks , or 7.3 million ( $ 10.3 million ) , in income . He had originally been indicted on charges of both tax evasion and bribery in connection with weapons deals . He was accused of taking undeclared commissions from a deal in the early 1990s to deliver Fuchs armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia .
But the court in the Bavarian city of Augsburg only considered the tax evasion charges after finding that the statute of limitations had expired on a bribery charge .
Not All Good News
On Tuesday , the Federal Court of Justice ordered the Augsburg court to reexamine the conviction and clarify whether Schreiber was obliged to pay tax in Germany , given that he had been resident in Canada for most of the time in question . Schreiber had appealed the conviction .
However , it was n't all good news for him , because the court also decided that the bribery charges against him would have to be reassessed to determine whether they did indeed fall under the state of limitations . Prosecutors had appealed against the Augsburg court 's ruling that the alleged bribery happened too long ago to be tried .
It was not clear when the retrial will take place .
Schreiber was arrested in Canada in 1999 under a German warrant and sent to Germany in 2009 after a 10-year battle against extradition .
It may seem improbable , but the odds that faster trains are coming to the Northeast Corridor have jumped recently . That 's because beginning in 2015 , the Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) is expected to finally permit modern European designs on tracks throughout the country , running side by side with heavy freight , at all times of day . This decision could cut the weight of U.S. passenger trains in half , meaning trains can go faster , accelerate more quickly , cause less wear on tracks , and get passengers to their destination in less time .
How much time ? The decision by the FRA to finally shelve regulatory requirements from the 1920s means that lighter replacement train sets for the Acela could cut the trip from Boston to New York by 30 minutes ( the trains can maneuver the curvy tracks of New England at higher speeds ) and the faster acceleration and braking could shave 5 to 10 minutes off the trip from New York to Washington .
That does n't seem like a lot of time savings , particularly on the New York to Washington run , but for a small investment , you could shave off a lot more minutes .
For example , if you combine the purchase of the new lighter Acela train sets with some of the incremental improvements that Amtrak has proposed in its 2012 “ Vision for the Northeast Corridor ” report , passengers on trains could get from Boston to New York City in 2 hours and 51 minutes ( versus 3 hours and 30 minutes currently ) and travel between New York City and Washington in a mere 2 hours and 22 minutes ( 2 hours and 50 minutes now ) . And for the first time , the Acela will actually be able to reach speeds of 160 mph both north and south of New York , which was what it was supposed to do back when it was built in the 1990s .
The cost for these faster times ? About $ 19.2 billion spread out over ten years . That 's a lot of money , especially in these tough fiscal times , but compared with the $ 150 billion price tag for Amtrak 's Next Generation High Speed Rail ( which could include a new tunnel under the Long Island Sound that everyone knows will never be built ) , or the $ 69 billion being spent on the California 's high speed rail project , it 's a bargain . Or to put it another way , we can spend $ 19 billion to shave 67 minutes between Boston and Washington or we can spend an additional $ 131 billion to cut another 149 minutes .
And because lighter trains mean less fuel consumption , the cost for a ticket on the Acela could be cut . That would help increase Amtrak 's share of the travel market from Boston to New York , possibly to as high as 70 percent from the current level of just above 50 percent , as well as increase its share of the Washington to New York market , which is already over 70 percent .
Of course , as long as the sequester is in place , any additional investment in high speed rail , no matter how modest and cost effective , is a non-starter . But if Congress and the Administration can finally reach a larger budget agreement , there is hope . Creating a true high speed rail corridor has long been a goal of Democrats and in particular the Obama Administration . And the new Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure , Bill Shuster , is from Pennsylvania , a state that would greatly benefit from this investment . In addition , if Democrats are willing to open the operation of the rail system to private firms ( while maintaining ownership of the infrastructure with Amtrak and the Federal government ) , enough Republicans , might be swayed to make this smart , cost effective investment .
But even if none of that happens , the FRA 's decision alone will help speed up travel in the northeast , and that is long overdue .

San José , CA - At midnight on Oct. 1 , the federal government began a partial shutdown . Later that morning , hundreds of thousands of federal workers showed up to wind up work - putting up closed signs at national parks and monuments across the country and updating web pages saying that many functions were no longer available . Then they went home for an indefinite furlough without pay .
Behind the partial shutdown of the federal government was the leadership of the House Republicans , who followed the lead of their right-wing Tea Party congress people . They needed to pass a bill to continue funding the government , since no budget for the 2014 Fiscal Year , which began Oct. 1 , had passed . Instead , the House Republicans insisted on using the threat of a government shutdown to get what they wanted , which was to derail the Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare , even though the Senate , the president and the Supreme Court were against them .
The House Republicans ' willingness to seemingly burn down their own house to rid it of what they saw as vermin ( Obamacare ) , is not only extremism , but also comes from their right-wing view of the government . It was under the Reagan presidency in the 1980s that the term “ Starving the beast ” arose , as right-wingers targeted the federal government as a “ beast ” for its social-welfare functions , wanting to pare down the role of the government to basically prisons to protect property rights of the rich and the military to maintain the empire .
Looking at a list of how agencies are being hit by the partial government shutdown , it is clear that many of the programs that the right wing hates will be the hardest hit . Among the departments with the highest percentage of furloughed workers are the Department of Education ( 95 % ) , Housing and Urban Development or HUD ( 95 % ) , the Environmental Protection Agency or EPA ( 90 % ) , and the Department of Labor ( 80 % ) .
On the other hand , the Department of Homeland Security , which includes the Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE , has only 15 % furloughs , so one can expect the record deportations to continue . The Department of Justice , which includes the FBI , also has only a 15 % furlough , so no let-up in spying and harassments of Muslim Americans , Arab Americans and anti-war and international solidarity activists is in sight .
While the House Republicans say that they are targeting Obamacare , by and large the rollout of the Affordable Care Act set for October 1 was unaffected . While there were long waits for web sites to load and phones to get answered , this was largely because nearly 3 million people flocked to the U.S. government web site www.healthcare.gov and more went to state web sites such as www.coverca.gov in California .
In contrast , Senate Democrats and the Obama administration value the role of the government , both to subsidize big corporations ( as Obamacare does with big health insurance companies ) and to maintain social peace through social welfare programs such as Social Security and Medicare . But they also support the military and policing functions of the government , as seen in the Obama administration 's attempt to unleash a military attack on Syria and the FBI coordination of local police efforts to smash the Occupy movements .

St. Louis all but declared victory after the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency 's director gave the city the nod earlier this month for a new $ 1.75 billion facility .
Yet officials across the river are n't giving up on a 182-acre site in St. Clair County .
`` We are n't just talking about argument about which side of the river it 's going on , '' said Congressman Mike Bost of Illinois . `` We 're talking about the long-term security of this facility as well as the overall cost to taxpayers . ''
Bost and other Illinois officials point to errors in the Final Environmental Impact Statement put together by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that sometimes confused the Illinois county with St. Clair counties in Missouri and Michigan .
`` Any information that 's given when you 're going to make a decision like that should be accurate , first off , and all information should be given , '' the Republican lawmaker said . `` I think there was some information that was actually deleted out of the north St. Louis site that was vitally important as far as safety and security . ''
Bost argues the site , made up of farmland near Scott Air Force Base , would be safer and would need little preparation ahead of construction , making it a more affordable option .
The Belleville News-Democrat reported that the Leadership Council Southwestern Illinois commissioned a study on security at both sites . The newspaper obtained the report , done by Command Consulting Group of Washington , D. C. , and said it found the Illinois site had major advantages .
That report and other comments are being submitted to the NGA during a public comment period that runs through Monday . NGA director Robert Cardillo is expected to make his final decision in early June .
U.S . Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk of Illinois also are requesting a meeting with Cardillo in May . Bost and fellow Republican House members Rodney Davis and John Shimkus also say they will attend .
Davis told Illinois Public Radio that the nearly 400 acres offered to the NGA in St. Clair County provides the agency with both the opportunity to grow and security .
`` I think that priority was not put as high as what it should have been when the administration made the decision to locate this new facility in St. Louis , '' Davis said .
St. Louis Public Radio made multiple attempts to reach the Leadership Council 's executive Ronda Sauget for an interview , as well St. Clair County chairman Mark Kern , to no avail .
Meanwhile , Missouri officials also are encouraging citizens to support the north St. Louis site and submit comments . Congressman William Lacy Clay told supporters in a newsletter this week that they had the power to help finalize the selection of north St. Louis for the NGA .
`` Winning the preliminary site selection competition was huge , but I need you to take part in the public comment period which runs through May 2nd , '' said the Democratic Congressman in his newsletter `` Backbone . ''
In St. Louis , officials say they 're moving forward with land acquisition efforts for the NGA site . At the same time St. Louis Development Corporation Otis Williams says they 're asking for citizens ' support within the public comment period .
`` We 're being vigilant , '' he said .

Police said the victim of a late-night road rage incident fired six rounds into the other vehicle , critically injuring the driver who tried to run him off the road .
Geoffrey Reavis , 25 , of North Carolina , remains in critical condition after being wounded in the head and shoulder .
According to an incident report , Richmond County deputies were called to Gordon Highway at Old Savannah Road about 11:20 p.m. to check out reports of shots fired .
Austin Burch , 27 , of North Augusta , told police he was traveling eastbound on Gordon Highway in his Dodge Ram pickup and was being followed by a silver Ford Ranger . According to an incident report , the Ford Ranger continually tried to run Burch 's pickup off the road , striking his vehicle twice . Burch stated he “ feared for his life , ” so he grabbed his firearm and fired into the truck .
Reavis was taken to Georgia Regents Medical Center . A 31-year-old male passenger in the Ranger was evaluated by EMS at the scene .
Sgt . Glen Rahn said no charges are being sought against Burch at this time . A preliminary investigation found he was justified in his actions . Reavis still could face charges , Rahn said .
Meteorologist Paul Douglas ( Minneapolis Star Tribune/screen grab )
Paul Douglas , a veteran meteorologist with over 3 decades of experience , revealed to the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he never imagined that the planet would be facing a climate catastrophe when he began his a career .
Douglas , who spent 11 years at both KARE and WCCO , told the Tribune 's C.J . that he began to notice in the 1990s that “ something had changed . ”
“ I just started connecting the dots , and that led me to climate change . I did n't wake up and have an epiphany . It had nothing to do with Al Gore . I was tracking Minnesota 's increasingly bizarre weather when I said , ‘ Something 's up , ' ” he recalled .
But Douglas said that sharing the science on television was not always easy .
“ Look , it 's no secret ; local television news is a popularity contest , ” he explained . “ Viewers vote with their remote controls every day , and so if you 're a meteorologist and trying to do the right thing , connect the dots… You know you 're going to piss off 20-30 percent of the audience . ”
“ Talking about climate change probably was not good for my television career . But I happen to believe that some things are more important than ratings . Life is n't a popularity contest , ” he noted , adding that conservative meteorologists were more likely to be skeptical of climate change .
“ Conservatives , because they fear that tackling climate change will automatically lead to bigger government , it 's easier to push back and deny the science , ” Douglas admitted . “ So yeah , there are meteorologists in this country who are very conservative , who believe there is n't enough data or the data are inconclusive . I do n't know how much more data you need . ”
To help get the word out to conservative audiences , Douglas has partnered with a Republican minister to author a book on why evangelicals should care about climate change .
“ As I tell people , acknowledging the science , the data , acknowledging that climate change is real does n't make you liberal , it makes you literate , ” Douglas pointed out . “ It means you 're scientifically literate . You respond to data and facts and not conspiracy theories and fairy tales . ”

Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has announced that Stephen Poloz will serve as the new Bank of Canada governor .
Poloz , 57 , the current head of Export Development Canada , will serve a seven-year term , beginning June 3 .
The appointment comes ahead of current governor Mark Carney 's June 1 departure for London , where he will head up the Bank of England .
Flaherty told reporters he 's confident that Poloz “ has the skills and experience required to lead the Bank of Canada at a time of global economic uncertainty . ”
Poloz , who has worked in the public and private sectors over three decades , said he 's honoured to assume the role of Canada 's top banker . He pledged to “ do my utmost to live up to the very high standards of those who came before me . ”
In a statement , the Bank of Canada 's board of directors said Poloz was deemed the best candidate for the job after “ an exhaustive domestic and international search . ”
“ Mr . Poloz has significant knowledge of financial markets and monetary policy issues and extensive management experience . We are confident Mr. Poloz will make an outstanding contribution to the work of the Bank and uphold its reputation as a leading central bank , ” said David Laidley , chair of the board 's special committee .
Poloz , an Oshawa , Ont . native , graduated from Queen 's University in 1978 with a bachelor 's degree in economics . He received a master 's degree in economics in 1979 and a PhD in economics in 1982 , both from the University of Western Ontario .
He first joined the Bank of Canada in 1981 , and held various senior positions there over 14 years .
Poloz then spent five years with Montreal-based BCA Research before joining Export Development Canada in 1999 as its chief economist . He became president and CEO of EDC in January 2011 .
For months , analysts have been saying that Tiff Macklem , the 51-year-old senior deputy governor , is likely to take over for Carney . Poloz was considered to be a runner-up for the job .
`` Who said that central banking was boring ? The choice of Stephen Poloz as the new governor of the Bank of Canada is a huge surprise , '' CIBC said in a note to clients , The Canadian Press reports .
`` Why did the Finance Minister decide to take this direction as opposed to the widely expected choice of going with the current senior deputy governor ? The answer may be that the minister would like to see a governor with more experience with dealing directly with the private sector , ” the CIBC note continued .
Although the appointment may have stunned some observers , TD Bank 's chief economist said Poloz is known to Bay Street .
“ The key message here is that Steve Poloz is an extraordinarily strong economist but he 's also an extremely good manager and leader , ” Craig Alexander told CTV 's Power Play Thursday . “ And so I think that he has all of the skills that you would be looking for in an incoming governor of the Bank of Canada . ”
Alexander said he does n't expect a big shift in the central bank 's monetary policy once Poloz takes over .
But because Poloz 's views on the policy are not publicly known , “ markets will be dissecting every sentence that he says , ” Alexander added .
CherryPy is a successful small web framework which over the years has built up its performances as well as its stability . To do so , Robert Brewer , the main CherryPy 's architect has introduced what is called the Web Site Process Bus ( WSPBus ) . The idea is to manage a Python process by providing it with a bus to which one can publish or subscribe for events . CherryPy 's implementation of the bus comes with a set of pubsub handlers for very basic operations such as responding to system signals , handle thread creation and deletion , drop process privileges and handle PID files . The bus mechanism can help your handling of sub-processes so that they start , run and terminates gracefully . Let 's see how .
Create your bus
First , you need to create a bus instance . This could be as simple as this .
from cherrypy.process import wspbus bus = wspbus.Bus ( ) 1 2 from cherrypy . process import wspbus bus = wspbus . Bus ( )
If you want to log through the bus , you will need further work since the bus does n't create a logger by default . Let 's see an example .
import sys import logging from logging import handlers from cherrypy.process import wspbus class MyBus ( wspbus.Bus ) : def __init__ ( self , name= '' '' ) : wspbus.Bus.__init__ ( self ) self.open_logger ( name ) self.subscribe ( `` log '' , self._log ) def exit ( self ) : wspbus.Bus.exit ( self ) self.close_logger ( ) def open_logger ( self , name= '' '' ) : logger = logging.getLogger ( name ) logger.setLevel ( logging.INFO ) h = logging.StreamHandler ( sys.stdout ) h.setLevel ( logging.INFO ) h.setFormatter ( logging.Formatter ( `` [ % ( asctime ) s ] % ( name ) s - % ( levelname ) s - % ( message ) s '' ) ) logger.addHandler ( h ) self.logger = logger def close_logger ( self ) : for handler in self.logger.handlers : handler.flush ( ) handler.close ( ) def _log ( self , msg= '' '' , level=logging.INFO ) : self.logger.log ( level , msg ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 import sys import logging from logging import handlers from cherrypy . process import wspbus class MyBus ( wspbus . Bus ) : def __init__ ( self , name = `` '' ) : wspbus . Bus . __init__ ( self ) self . open_logger ( name ) self . subscribe ( `` log '' , self . _log ) def exit ( self ) : wspbus . Bus . exit ( self ) self . close_logger ( ) def open_logger ( self , name = `` '' ) : logger = logging . getLogger ( name ) logger . setLevel ( logging . INFO ) h = logging .

INFO ) : self . logger . log ( level , msg )
Not much , just creating a logger and subscribing the bus log channel to an instance method .
Associate the bus with the main process
Before we move on to the management of sub-process , let 's see how we can manage the main Python process already with our bus above .
For this , let 's imagine a bank placing stock orders , those orders will be handled by a broker running in a sub-process .
import random import string from multiprocessing import Process class Bank ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , queue ) : self.bus = MyBus ( Bank.__name__ ) self.queue = queue self.bus.subscribe ( `` main '' , self.randomly_place_order ) self.bus.subscribe ( `` exit '' , self.terminate ) def randomly_place_order ( self ) : order = random.sample ( [ 'BUY ' , 'SELL ' ] , 1 ) [ 0 ] code = random.sample ( string.ascii_uppercase , 4 ) amount = random.randint ( 0 , 100 ) message = `` % s % s % d '' % ( order , `` .join ( code ) , amount ) self.bus.log ( `` Placing order : % s '' % message ) self.queue.put ( message ) def run ( self ) : self.bus.start ( ) self.bus.block ( interval=0.01 ) def terminate ( self ) : self.bus.unsubscribe ( `` main '' , self.randomly_place_order ) self.bus.unsubscribe ( `` exit '' , self.terminate ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 import random import string from multiprocessing import Process class Bank ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , queue ) : self . bus = MyBus ( Bank . __name__ ) self . queue = queue self . bus . subscribe ( `` main '' , self . randomly_place_order ) self . bus . subscribe ( `` exit '' , self . terminate ) def randomly_place_order ( self ) : order = random . sample ( [ 'BUY ' , 'SELL ' ] , 1 ) [ 0 ] code = random . sample ( string . ascii_uppercase , 4 ) amount = random . randint ( 0 , 100 ) message = `` % s % s % d '' % ( order , `` . join ( code ) , amount ) self . bus . log ( `` Placing order : % s '' % message ) self . queue . put ( message ) def run ( self ) : self . bus . start ( ) self . bus . block ( interval = 0.01 ) def terminate ( self ) : self . bus . unsubscribe ( `` main '' , self . randomly_place_order ) self . bus . unsubscribe ( `` exit '' , self . terminate )
As you can see , not much again here , we simply associate a bus with the bank object . We also register to the exit channel of the bus so that when we terminated , we can do some cleanup . It 's good use to unregister from the bus .
We do n't actually care where those orders come from so we randomly generate them . The orders are placed every time the bus iterates its loop . This is done by attaching to the main channel of the bus .
We use a process queue to communicate with the broker 's sub-process .
Associate the bus with a sub-process
Handling the sub-process is actually similar to handling the main process . Let 's see the broker implementation for example .
from Queue import Empty class Broker ( Process ) : def __init__ ( self , queue ) : Process.__init__ ( self ) self.queue = queue self.bus = MyBus ( Broker.__name__ ) self.bus.subscribe ( `` main '' , self.check ) def check ( self ) : try : message = self.queue.get_nowait ( ) except Empty : return if message == `` stop '' : self.bus.unsubscribe ( `` main '' , self.check ) self.bus.exit ( ) elif message.startswith ( `` BUY '' ) : self.buy ( * message.split ( ' ' , 2 ) [ 1 : ] ) elif message.startswith ( `` SELL '' ) : self.sell ( * message.split ( ' ' , 2 ) [ 1 : ] ) def run ( self ) : self.bus.start ( ) self.bus.block ( interval=0.01 ) def stop ( self ) : self.queue.put ( `` stop '' ) def buy ( self , code , amount ) : self.bus.log ( `` BUY order placed for % s % s '' % ( amount , code ) ) def sell ( self , code , amount ) : self.bus.log ( `` SELL order placed for % s % s '' % ( amount , code ) ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 from Queue import Empty class Broker ( Process ) : def __init__ ( self , queue ) : Process . __init__ ( self ) self . queue = queue self . bus = MyBus ( Broker . __name__ ) self . bus . subscribe ( `` main '' , self . check ) def check ( self ) : try : message = self . queue . get_nowait ( ) except Empty : return if message == `` stop '' : self . bus . unsubscribe ( `` main '' , self . check ) self . bus . exit ( ) elif message . startswith ( `` BUY '' ) : self . buy ( * message . split ( ' ' , 2 ) [ 1 : ] ) elif message . startswith ( `` SELL '' ) : self . sell ( * message . split ( ' ' , 2 ) [ 1 : ] ) def run ( self ) : self . bus . start ( ) self . bus . block ( interval = 0.01 ) def stop ( self ) : self . queue . put ( `` stop '' ) def buy ( self , code , amount ) : self . bus . log ( `` BUY order placed for % s % s '' % ( amount , code ) ) def sell ( self , code , amount ) : self . bus . log ( `` SELL order placed for % s % s '' % ( amount , code ) )
Several things are to be noticed . First we register once again to the bus ' main channel a method that checks the shared queue for incoming data . Whenever the incoming message is “ stop ” , we exit the bus altogether , thus leaving the sub-process , since it was blocked on the bus loop .
Note that the stop method could be called by the parent process if you needed to programatically stop the sub-process .
Put it all together
Run the code above as follow :
if __name__ == '__main__ ' : from multiprocessing import Queue queue = Queue ( ) broker = Broker ( queue ) broker.start ( ) bank = Bank ( queue ) bank.run ( ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 if __name__ == '__main__ ' : from multiprocessing import Queue queue = Queue ( ) broker = Broker ( queue ) broker . start ( ) bank = Bank ( queue ) bank . run ( )
This creates the shared queue , starts the sub-process that runs the broker and finally starts the bank within the main process .
You should see a bunch of messages in the console and if you hit Ctrl-C , this will stop both processes cleanly .
And here we are , we now manage processes and sub-processes with a clean solution . The CherryPy process bus is an elegant add-on to your toolbox that I can only highly advise considering in the future . The WSPBus implementation is part of the main CherryPy package ( CherryPy 3.x ) , so you 'll have to install it all , even if you do n't require the HTTP framework . But do n't let that hold you back since the HTTP framework is n't required for the bus to be used .
Happy coding !
The code is here .
Artistic masterpiece from Qing China
The Meat-shaped Stone ( Chinese : 肉形石 ; pinyin : ròuxíngshí ) is a piece of jasper carved into the shape of a Dongpo pork . It is part of the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipei , Taiwan . Although of only moderate importance from the point of view of art history , it is a great popular favourite with visitors and has become famous .
The Meat-shaped Stone has been called the `` most famous masterpiece '' of the entire National Palace Museum , [ 2 ] and along with the Jadeite Cabbage and the Mao Gong Ding , is today called one of the Three Treasures of the National Palace Museum , a redesignation from several less accessible , infrequently-displayed works . [ 3 ] It has also been chosen by the public as the most important item in the museum 's entire collection . [ 4 ]
History [ edit ]
The stone was carved during the Qing dynasty from banded jasper . The layers of the stone accumulated naturally over the years , with various shades of hues . [ 5 ] The craftsman who carved the stone stained the skin , which resulted in a realistic looking piece of stone with multiple layers appearing like layers of fat and meat .

Senior U.S. military leaders and defense officials are debating whether military force should be used to protect Washington-backed Syrian rebels who have come under attack by Russian airstrikes in recent days .
The Associated Press reported early Friday that the question was part of a broader debate within the Pentagon about the the broader dilemma of how the administration should respond to what White House press secretary Josh Earnest described as Russia 's “ indiscriminate military operations against the Syrian opposition . ”

View the Chivas 2-0 Atlas highlights here .
In the Week 15 game that excites the media the most -Chivas vs Atlas- will be played this Sunday , October 28 , 2012 ( 7:00 PM EDT ) at the Estadio Omnilife . On a regular season , Chivas of Guadalajara and Atlas would be strong contenders with good football , but this Apertura 2012 it has been the complete opposite . This is a game that calls for the media 's attention because it is one of the 100 so-called ‘ clasicos ' of the Mexican league .
Sadly , this will be a poor ‘ Clasico Tapatio ' because the city of Guadalajara is still living through the worst soccer curse in its history . Chivas just got eliminated from the Concachampions by a Guatemalan squad , Atlas is second to last in the league , and let 's not forget that Estudiantes Tecos was the last team to get relegated into the 2nd division . Therefore , on Sunday we will witness a good game where Chivas plays for its life , but other than that , will it really be worth to call it a ‘ clasico ' ?
Chivas has one last chance to stay alive
The goats have played poorly all throughout 2012 , and this season has brought constant dissatisfactions to its fans . While it has not been a great season , it has also not been the worst , and this has kept Chivas with little hope to remain in the fight for a playoff spot . They currently sit in 13th place of the regular standings , only three points below the 8th seed Pumas . If Pumas were to lose against America , and Chivas wins , then Guadalajara will be more alive than ever to be a playoff contender . However , Chivas also requires three victories in its last three games , and considering they have only won four all season long , this will be a difficult task . Nonetheless , the game against city-rivals , Atlas , will be a good parameter to understand where they stand in this league . The offense could see the return of injured forward Rafael Marquez Lugo , and this could be their key to victory .
Atlas saved by Queretaro
Atlas has been far from good this season by only obtaining 11 points in fourteen games . They are second to last in the relegation percentage battle , but Queretaro has done badly enough that Atlas still has a fair advantage to remain in the league . The ‘ rojinegros ' have a good squad with a good defense , but like Chivas , they have an offense that lacks creativity and more importantly , goals . A win against Chivas will not only boost morale , but it will alleviate some pressure away from the relegation battle . Atlas needs to play a counter-attack game that will allow them to keep a clean sheet .
Prediction : In what I call the media 's ‘ game of the week ' , on Sunday we will have a game between two young weak sides with poor offense . Chivas has the pressure to succeed because surprisingly they are still in fight for a playoff spot , and a win keeps their hopes alive . The Chivas vs Atlas game has the home team Guadalajara as the favorites , partly because they already played a clasico against America earlier this season and won 3-1 . For Sunday 's game , it will be a close match , but Chivas will win a close match , 2-1 .
Television : The Chivas vs Atlas match will be shown this Sunday , October 28 , 2012 at 7:00 PM EDT on Telemundo .
With so much going on in the world today , it 's those special kinds of moments people can share at a magical place such as Walt Disney World that can remind you of what is truly special in life .
Case in point , 21-year-old Basilio Santana meeting Mickey Mouse on a recent trip to Magic Kingdom with his mother and a group of Brazilian tourists has touched many people 's hearts thanks to a video that was shared on Facebook .
Santana lost his sight at the age of nine due to Devic 's syndrome , a rare disease which affects the immune system , and he was able to travel to Orlando with his mother , who also has the disease , after winning a contest . When Santana met Mickey at Town Square Theater on Main Street , U.S.A. , his tour guide Nataly White filmed the special encounter and it has since gone viral .
When one of the group 's translators tells Mickey where they 're from , he said “ Wow ! All the way from Brazil ? Cool . My friends have been teaching me some Portuguese . Let 's see if I can remember how to say this… ”
Just look at the care in which Mickey carefully guides Basilio along and when he touches his face and features . What a beautiful and truly special moment , especially when they touch noses . Santana later said it was his favorite moment of the trip and thanks to this wonderful video we can all see why .
Former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee weighed in on media bias in coverage of the 2016 presidential race .
Continue Reading Below
The FOX Business Network 's Dagen McDowell listed two recent examples to support allegations of bias by the mainstream media . In a re-airing of an interview with a retired New Jersey police officer on Headline News , his “ Trump for President ” shirt was blurred out . And CNN edited the word “ crooked ” out of a Donald Trump tweet the network showed on air . To which Huckabee responded , “ It 's an example of the fact that journalism is dead as we once knew it . ”
Huckabee then reflected on how the mainstream media used to be more objective in its coverage of politics .
“ It used to be that if you read a story written by a journalist you did n't really know whether that journalist liked the person he was writing about or did n't . And I always said , ‘ the best journalists were the ones who when I read the story about me , I could n't tell whether he liked me or not . ' And when I read that I said , ‘ that 's a real journalist . ' I do n't read many stories like that ever – there just are n't any . ”
According to Huckabee , today there are an increasing number of examples of liberal bias in the mainstream media .
“ Today the bias in the media , we 've seen it this week , you just gave two examples from Headline News and CNN . We see it all the time with Facebook , you see it with the New York Times , the Washington Post – organizations that used to be respected in journalistic circles and now is nothing more than fronts for left-wing claptrap . “

But McDowell pointed out signs of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 's dislike of the media as well .
“ Trump , he frequently criticizes the mainstream media and he goes after individuals , he goes after whole networks . But Hillary Clinton has just as much disdain for the media – it has been 272 days I think since she held a press conference , and that does n't seem to have any impact . ”
Some things , it is said , can not be taught . I actually happen to believe that most things can be taught , or at least enhanced through the act of teaching , but it would be better if some things did n't need to be .
For example , a so-called `` happiness lesson '' , while arguably a valuable addition to the PSHE spectrum if handled in the right way , would be rendered largely unnecessary had not huge swathes of time been cut from the curriculum which was once devoted to activities which naturally make children happy , like sport , arts and music . But I digress… .
Some things are better gleaned by osmosis . Children tend to be more well-mannered if they spend time in an educational environment where people are naturally respectful of one another . Similarly , studies suggest that young people are much more likely to show symptoms of good body image if they have parents who are also confident in their own skin . I do n't know why I 'm telling you this , as it 's essentially common sense . I guess I 'm just setting out my stall because , unsurprisingly enough , I believe the same blueprint can be applied to mental wellbeing .
There are certain triggers which almost always result in a mental health issue – sustained bullying , for example . Another of these is stress . When stress is both chronic and regular it has been linked to a number of mental health ailments , including but not limited to depression , anxiety and memory loss . Stress is also contagious . The presence or absence of just one or two severely stressed colleagues can dramatically change the culture of a working environment .
Other than nurses , I struggle to think of a group of professionals whose day-to-day existence is more conducive to stress than teachers .
The media predominantly portrays teaching as a jammy gig , characterised by clocking off at 3pm on the dot , enjoying six weeks of unencumbered holiday every summer and becoming crazed with power to the extent that the urge to enforce completely nonsensical health and safety rules which spoil everyone 's fun becomes insatiable .
Anyone who is a teacher or knows one understands this to be utter hogwash , fuelled by an agenda which ( either inexplicably or not , depending on your politics ) desires to portray anyone who works in the public sector as overpaid and work shy .
I 'd defy any teacher not to be at least a little stressed in this climate of contemptuous suspicion , when faced with increasingly narrow targets , long hours and the expectation that they will take on more and more responsibilities which fall outside the remit of their job description . And it is inevitable that the stress that is being generated amongst teachers will impact on their students .
Does n't it stand to reason , then , that if the goal is to improve the mental health of young people in the UK , we should begin by giving more focus and resources to improving the mental health of their teachers ?
I 've been visiting schools since late 2007 . With each passing year the teachers I have met have told me they are expected to do more and more to provide a network of pastoral support and emotional first aid for their pupils . There is no doubt in my mind that teachers are fast becoming the primary mental healthcare giver to an entire generation of children and adolescents . But who will look after them ?
It 's a question I 'll be taking to the Department for Education during my next visit and I 'd welcome any thoughts you might have on the issue in the meantime , dear readers ( @ natashadevonMBE on Twitter ) .

A team led by researchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science has made major improvements in computer processing using an emerging class of magnetic materials called “ multiferroics , ” and these advances could make future devices far more energy-efficient than current technologies .
With today 's microprocessors , electric current passes through transistors ( electronic switches ) . Because current involves the movement of electrons , this process produces heat — which makes devices warm to the touch .
These switches can also “ leak ” electrons , making it difficult to completely turn them off . And as chips continue to get smaller , with more circuits packed into smaller spaces , the amount of wasted heat grows , limiting further miniaturization .
The ‘ spin wave bus '
The UCLA Engineering team used multiferroic magnetic materials to reduce the amount of power consumed by “ logic devices , ” a type of circuit on a computer chip dedicated to performing functions such as calculations . A multiferroic can be switched on or off by applying alternating voltage . Instead of using current , it then carries power through the material in a cascading wave via the spins of electrons , a process referred to as a “ spin wave bus . ”
The researchers showed that using this multiferroic material to generate spin waves could reduce wasted heat and therefore increase power efficiency for processing by up to 1,000 times . Their research is published in the journal Applied Physics Letters .
A spin wave can be thought of as similar to an ocean wave , which keeps water molecules in essentially the same place while the energy is carried through the water , as opposed to an electric current , which can be envisioned as water flowing through a pipe , said principal investigator Kang L. Wang , UCLA 's Raytheon Professor of Electrical Engineering and director of the Western Institute of Nanoelectronics ( WIN ) .
“ Spin waves open an opportunity to realize fundamentally new ways of computing while solving some of the key challenges faced by scaling of conventional semiconductor technology , potentially creating a new paradigm of spin-based electronics , ” Wang said .
“ Electrical control of magnetism without involving charge currents is a fast-growing area of interest in magnetics research , ” said co-author Pedram Khalili , a UCLA assistant adjunct professor of electrical engineering . “ It can have major implications for future information processing and data-storage devices , and our recent results are exciting in that context . ”
The researchers previously applied this technology in a similar way to computer memory .
UC Riverside 's Bourns College of Engineering and the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Translational Applications of Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems ( TANMS ) , which focuses on multiferroic device applications , were also involved in the research .
The research was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 's Non-Volatile Logic program and by the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative through the WIN .
Abstract of Applied Physics Letters paper
In this work , we report on the demonstration of voltage-driven spin wave excitation , where spin waves are generated by multiferroic magnetoelectric ( ME ) cell transducers driven by an alternating voltage , rather than an electric current . A multiferroic element consisting of a magnetostrictive Ni film and a piezoelectric [ Pb ( Mg1/3Nb2/3 ) O3 ] ( 1−x ) – [ PbTiO3 ] x substrate was used for this purpose . By applying an AC voltage to the piezoelectric , an oscillating electric field is created within the piezoelectric material , which results in an alternating strain-induced magnetic anisotropy in the magnetostrictive Ni layer . The resulting anisotropy-driven magnetization oscillations propagate in the form of spin waves along a 5 μm wide Ni/NiFe waveguide . Control experiments confirm the strain-mediated origin of the spin wave excitation . The voltage-driven spin wave excitation , demonstrated in this work , can potentially be used for low-dissipation spin wave-based logic and memory elements .
Almost exactly a year ago , at the end of an E3 press conference in which Microsoft heralded fitness software , Kinect , Internet Explorer , Bing and dying action games as the future of entertainment , I wrote that anyone who has paid attention to Microsoft 's business over the years should not be surprised by its apparent lack of self-awareness .
`` If we are entertained by what Microsoft chooses to do for its own gain , '' I suggested , `` then that is simply a happy coincidence . ''
Guess what ? The coincidence is over .
The fact that Microsoft 's policies governing game ownership , sharing and privacy are not surprising does not make them any less devastating to consumer rights , should they be formally adopted and become a standard . They sacrifice our freedom to own and trade games for no other reason than corporate self-interest .
To save you skimming large tracts of condescending prose about how much Microsoft loves and respects you as a human wallet , here is a summary :
You do not own the games you buy . You license them .
Discs are only used to install and then license games and do not imply ownership .
People can play games installed on your console whether you 're logged in or not .
10 people can be authorised to play these games on a different Xbox One via the cloud , but not at the same time , similar to iTunes authorised devices .
Publishers decide whether you can trade in your games and may charge for this .
Publishers decide whether you can give a game you own to someone for free , and this only works if they have been on your friends list for 30 days .
Your account allows you to play the games you license on any console .
Your Xbox One must connect to the internet every 24 hours to keep playing games .
When playing on another Xbox One with your account , this is reduced to one hour .
Live TV , Blu-ray and DVD movies are exempt from these internet requirements .
Loaning and renting games will not be possible at launch , but Microsoft is `` exploring the possibilities '' .
Microsoft may change these policies or discontinue them at any point .
There is also a promise that Microsoft Studios games will all allow you to trade them in and give them away for free , bringing a whole new emphasis to the expression , `` It 's the least we could do ! ''
The only positive thing in the whole document is confirmation that you can turn off Kinect and its data will never be uploaded without your permission . Let us all applaud Microsoft 's `` OK , fine ! '' decision not to intrude on our privacy .
The suggestion that these changes to game ownership have been taken to combat piracy or limit the damage that used game sales do to the primary market do not stand up to much scrutiny - at our most charitable , we can say that the data is merely inconclusive , but analysis of other industries that have dealt with these issues for much longer is pretty clear that the overall benefits at least balance out the risks of allowing piracy and used markets to flourish .
The more likely reason for this unprecedented new attitude to console game ownership and sharing is that Microsoft wants to turn its game business into the equivalent of iTunes . The signs are already there in the merger of Xbox , Windows and Windows Phone app stores and the decision to run Xbox games off a Virtual Machine 'game OS ' within Xbox One , which could easily be included in new hardware derived from the same architectural roadmap .
This is a neat business way of getting everything to line up . It is done in service to Microsoft 's corporate objectives . It is not even done with any particular malice towards you and me . Nevertheless , it signals the most significant divergence to date of Microsoft 's goals for the Xbox business from our own . It also puts an unspecified expiry date on every Xbox One game ever made and gives you no control over it . Yes , at a point in time where consoles are becoming less relevant , Microsoft 's solution is to make them less permanent .
The addition of cloud gaming functions , the avoidance of DVD or Blu-ray disc access times , the convenience of global access - these are the rewards we are being offered for our complicity in Microsoft 's decision to eradicate the concept of console game ownership . They are not good enough and very little ever will be .
Digital marketplaces like Netflix , iTunes and the present Xbox Live are a good thing , but they should be additive . They allow us to form a different kind of relationship with art - a more convenient , expansive and often cheaper one that includes better tools for exploration beyond the borders of our current interest . We should and I do celebrate these things . But a critical reason that I accept them is that I still have the option to own an untouchable physical copy of the things I find there as well .
You can say this is no worse than what Steam does , you can say that it is no worse than what a lot of 'content ' companies do , and those statements are true , but they do not engage with the most important detail of this news , which is what we are being told to give up in exchange for this new arrangement : the opportunity to form tangible , lasting relationships with art that matters to us . If you never had that , then why would you miss it ? But we do . And soon we wo n't .
Collectors will still be able to buy Xbox One games on disc , of course , and we may line them up happily on our shelves so that our friends and families can admire our dedication and taste forever more . But under Microsoft 's new rules , we are no longer building a collection of games - we are building a collection of loans that may be recalled from us at any time , leaving us with nothing but distant memories . And that loss will be simple , instant and complete .
The truth about multiple litigant Mrs Pratt - the high priestess of victimhood
Christine Pratt is a habitual whistleblower .
In the past 15 years , she 's sued two multinationals , claiming hundreds of thousands in compensation for alleged discrimination .
On a more mundane level , there have been spats with her local council over a footpath and garden bordering her house .
Whistleblower : Christine Pratt is at the centre of the controversy surrounding bullying claims from Downing Street staff
But the shrillest and most attention-grabbing peep from her well-worn pipe came at the weekend .
As founder of a hitherto obscure charity , the National Bullying Helpline , she claimed it had been contacted by 'three or four ' of Gordon Brown 's office staff who , she says , 'believe they are working in a bullying culture and that it has caused them some stress ' .
Her intervention - and breach of the helpline 's confidentiality - followed allegations in a new book that Mr Brown is a bully , claims that he and ministers have denied .
By last night , everyone involved in what has become an increasingly ludicrous saga was looking a little shabby . Not least among them Mrs Pratt and her 'helpline ' , which is based in a Swindon business park . Serious questions have been raised about the charity .
Yesterday , one of its patrons , Professor Cary Cooper , an expert in workplace stress , resigned because he felt Mrs Pratt had breached 'patient confidentiality ' . Two other patrons , including Tory MP Ann Widdecombe , followed suit last night .
And the Mail can reveal there have been a number of complaints from members of the public who have contacted the National Bullying Helpline in the past .
Far from receiving free support and advice , callers were put in touch with a consultancy run by Mrs Pratt 's businessman husband David , 68 , who charged four-figure fees to 'investigate ' their complaints of bullying . On one occasion , he turned up on a client 's doorstep demanding payment .
Last night , the Charity Commission said the helpline 's annual accounts are 207 days overdue , despite three reminders .
' A number of issues have been raised over the weekend concerning the charity National Bullying Helpline , and the Charity Commission has received a number of complaints , ' says a spokesman for the watchdog .
'We are considering these to see which may fall within our remit . We will be contacting the charity for further information . '
U.S. president Harry Truman once gave blunt advice to those who presume to be involved in politics or other positions of responsibility : 'If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen . '
In New Labour 's Britain , the guidance appears to be if you ca n't stand the heat , seek recompense .
Mrs Pratt launched two claims against her former employer BAE Systems , but refused to comment on either this week
Such an approach was enshrined in the 1998 Human Rights Act . Its critics have seen it as a charter for ambulance chasing , petty litigation and the growth of the health and safety leviathan . Now it is Mr Brown 's turn to feel its clammy grip .
At the centre of this cameo of the grievance industry in action is 54-year-old Mrs Pratt . The mother of one has a colourful litigious history .
Her first employment tribunal action was launched against BAE Systems , where until 1995 she had worked as a secretary . She claimed constructive dismissal and bullying , and settled out of court .
But in 2003 she was back , accusing BAE of breaching a confidentiality agreement . Another action for £450,000 in damages was launched .
In the years between the two BAE cases , Mrs Pratt found time to accuse Japanese firm Sanden International ( Europe ) Ltd of sexual and racial discrimination .
She told a tribunal she left the firm - where she had been human resources officer - in 2001 after the managing director told her women are less intelligent than men . Last night , she refused to discuss the outcome of either action or if she 'd been involved in other tribunals .
With her husband , she established the National Bullying Helpline in 2002 . It was designed , Mrs Pratt claims , to provide help for employees and employers suffering problems with bullying in the workplace , and was given charitable status in 2007 .
But the Pratts ' motives were not entirely altruistic .
They also ran a company called HR & Diversity Management Ltd. Callers to the helpline found themselves being referred by Mrs Pratt to the firm where , after paying a £300 deposit , they faced a much larger bill for an 'independent ' investigation of their situation .
Yesterday , the Mail was given testimony by two people who had suffered bullying and contacted the helpline , only to be asked for large sums of money .
Both had complained to Swindon South MP Anne Snelgrove , Gordon Brown 's parliamentary aide . Mrs Snelgrove initially supported the Pratts ' charity , but severed links two years ago following concerns about its running .
In the first case , Nico Souleles contacted Mrs Pratt after being suspended from his senior lecturer post at a college in Cumbria . Mr Souleles , 51 , was yesterday working abroad and was reluctant to discuss his dispute with Mrs Pratt , but he explained in an earlier email : 'When I contacted Christine Pratt , I was going through terrible mental anguish due to the institutionalised harassment and bullying I was experiencing from my employer .
'She promised me she would deal personally with my case , and then I was asked to pay a deposit of £300 .
The report I got at the end of the day was not ... detailed enough or strong enough to counter the malicious allegations my employer was throwing at me .
' A discussion followed between my legal adviser and Christine Pratt about the amount of money I had to pay her considering the quality of what I received .
The PM 's office has rejected calls for an inquiry into the bullying claims
'While this was going on , her husband , totally uninvited , knocked on our door one night just when the kids went to sleep and demanded money . This was quite disturbing for my wife and my family . '
Mr Souleles said that Mr Pratt had demanded £4,000 .
Jane McGrath from London also complained about the helpline . ' I called it as I was very desperate and really at the end of my tether due to workplace bullying , ' she said .
'All this woman did was to send me forms that were part of her own consultancy business offering her `` independent investigation services '' at a considerable fee to my employer .
'There was no support , no guidance , advice or care - I felt very much as if she was using me and my devastating situation as a means to accrue business from my employer .
'She said she was too busy to talk as she was off on holiday and would call back . She never did , but did manage to email me the forms to present to my employer before she left .
' I would strongly protest ( about ) a woman who . . . lines her own pockets . . . in the guise of running a much-needed helpline . '
Last night , Mrs Pratt confirmed that callers to the helpline had been referred to her husband 's business and some had complained . But she defended her charity .
'Since the helpline became a registered charity in 2007 , we have separated it from the HR company - they have separate offices and separate processes , ' she said .
'However , we do give callers the option to be referred on to dispute resolution service providers - and our HR company does provide a dispute resolution service . '
She said of Mr Souleles and Ms McGrath : 'They were quite pushy and told us they could n't afford solicitors . Mr Souleles thought we were going to be giving him low-cost support and signed up knowing exactly what we were doing . He reneged on the payments to us .
' I would not accept a fee-paying client now who has called the charity helpline . For the past 18 months to two years , we have stopped acting as an adviser in any way to individuals because in nine out of ten cases they do not have the money . If they did , they would pay for a solicitor .
'Because we 're a charity , they expect support for nothing , and if they do n't get the outcome they want they tend to take it out on us .
'The expectations of Nicos Souleles and people like him are such that we are unable to support them . '
She denied she has political motivations . However , the helpline office is two doors from the local Conservative Association and David Cameron endorses the charity on its website .
How different to the last General Election campaign , when Mr Cameron 's predecessor , Michael Howard , said : 'The time has come to liberate the nation from the avalanche of political correctness , costly litigation , feeble justice and culture of compensation running riot in Britain today . '
At 10am yesterday , the National Bullying Hotline was still being flagged up on the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills website . By 3.30pm , it had been removed .
Mrs Pratt and her 'helpline ' had been torpedoed in the choppy waters of political combat . Whether she was a victim or aggressor in this saga is another matter .
Is Stephen Harper about to rise , Lazarus-like , from the political dead ?
On the face of it , the very idea seems like absurdity in hot pursuit of farce . After all , following the debacle of 1993 — when Canadian voters nuked the former Progressive Conservative Party of Canada — the party was definitely in need of a Moses . It 's just that no one was suggesting that it should be Brian Mulroney .
Why would they ? It was Mulroney who created the perfect storm of electoral revulsion that resulted in Kim Campbell being blasted into oblivion , along with all but two members of her caucus . The lesson ? It 's not normal for the guy who organizes the Charge of the Light Brigade to be given a new command .
So it was with moderate surprise that I read this week that , according to a “ respected senior Conservative ” , the name of one Stephen Joseph Harper was being advanced in Tory circles as a possible contender for the Conservative leadership .
Which is like saying Donald Trump has a shot at being the new Archbishop of New York . This bit of speculation was retailed by no less a pundit than the National Post ‘ s John Ivison . ( I checked to make sure this was n't an April 1st leftover , and that Ivison was not moonlighting with 22 Minutes . Negative on both counts . )
The theory that accounts for the bizarre prospect of Harper Redux is that the CPC is a party in danger of bifurcating like a worm chopped in two by a garden spade . One part of this wriggling creation would be the Reform and Canadian Alliance element of the party which swallowed the old PCs after the “ merger ” . The other part would be the Red Tory excommunicants who have had no part to play in Canada 's decade of Tea Party Republicanism under Harper — except , with one or two noteworthy exceptions , as his accomplices .
The potential return of Harper , despite his loss of sixty seats and the government in the last election , is being driven by the urge to preserve the unity of the party — i.e . Western Canadian control of the conservative movement . And what is he supposed to be guarding it against ? The heretical influence of progressive ideas from the old Joe Clark Brigade .
“ These guys ( the Harperites ) are ideologues , ” one knowledgeable source told me . “ They hate Red Tories . Harper courted Peter ( MacKay ) for the merger . As soon as they had him , they shamed him continuously . No Red Tories allowed . ”
Now it could be argued that Mr. Photo Op needed no help from Harper & Co. when it came to shaming . He did a superb job of embarrassing himself — from his broken promise to David Orchard on merging the party of John A. Macdonald with the neocon zealots of the Canadian Alliance , to his serial stretchers on the doomed F-35 fighter jet program .
There 's more , of course . There was the fishing camp imbroglio which saw the then-defence minister ordering up a Search and Rescue helicopter to get him back to work , the way the rest of us might hail a cab .
For reasons that look pathetic today , MacKay thought Libya was a great victory . He also used his office to publicly trash Canadian diplomat Richard Colvin , after Colvin tried to blow the whistle on the still-unresolved Afghan detainee issue . As minister of justice , MacKay seemed not to understand the difference between constitutional and unconstitutional laws . And who can forget the saga of Belinda and the rented dog ?
Now hear this : If Harper ever did that — if he ever chose to run for the leadership — he 'd be diving head-first into the woodchipper . Now hear this : If Harper ever did that — if he ever chose to run for the leadership — he 'd be diving head-first into the woodchipper .
Peter MacKay is no Red Tory . He 's just a creature of the security , intelligence and armament sector with a case of terminal political ambition .
That said , perhaps Harper is sufficiently distressed at watching his misbegotten political heritage deconstructed brick by PM Trudeau to contemplate the unthinkable — a run for the leadership . All Harper has left to his legacy at this point is his reverse takeover of the party , and he may not want to risk MacKay or anyone else dismantles his last remaining political accomplishment .
Now hear this : If Harper ever did that — if he ever chose to run for the leadership — he 'd be diving head-first into the woodchipper . It would serve only to complete the destruction of the party which started with its shellacking in the 2015 election . ( I do n't think there was a run on Stephen Harper “ Miss Me Yet ” buttons at the recent Manning Conference in Ottawa . Maybe Ray Novak bought them out . )
If MacKay 's legacy is a run of disappointing retreats from principle , the Harper legacy remains an unreconstructed nightmare . In the twilight of the fossil fuel era , Saudi Arabia is making plans to sell that country 's state oil assets for two trillion dollars and to reinvest the money in diversified enterprises . The Chinese are proposing a fifty trillion dollar international global electricity network using wind and solar power . What was Harper 's vision ? Bet the farm on dirty , expensive oil and hope the prices remain sky-high .
This is also the prime minister who did n't even recognize the environment as an issue in the last election , while the rest of the world famously hammered out the Paris climate deal , which both the United States and China will sign this month .
This is the prime minister who looked like Attila the Hun on a day his ulcer was kicking up . He loved nothing better than sending in the troops and planes . While President Obama and all the major western allies were negotiating a deal to direct Iran 's nuclear program away from the production of nuclear weapons , Harper was still banging the War of Civilizations drum .
His domestic legacy was abominable , from proposing snitch lines to issuing cultural denunciations over so-called ‘ barbaric acts ' . He so offended First Nations peoples and environmentalists that not a single pipeline was built during his tenure — despite the fact that he carried a brief for the oilpatch , handed over the NEB to industry representatives and gutted Canada 's environmental protection legislation .
Despite his incessant enabling of his media courtiers , this “ fiscally conservative ” PM grew the size of government , could n't balance budgets to save his life and added $ 150 billion to the national debt .
Though Harper touted a “ values-based ” approach to public life , he had an astonishing ability to appoint felons to key positions . He hired Bruce Carson as a PMO advisor , despite knowing of his criminal record . He also appointed Arthur Porter as the civilian watchdog of CSIS . Porter flamed out in spectacular fashion , dying in Panama as a wanted fugitive . Just this week , Harper 's former parliamentary secretary , Dean Del Mastro , was taken off to jail after he lost his appeal of his election overspending case .
Harper was the prime minister who created his own personal ministry of propaganda , paid for by Canadians . He censored and muzzled and bullied and berated anyone who opposed his notion of government by personal fiat . His exemption for political parties on the copyright of all news footage had journalist Don Martin remarking that the then-PM was flirting with “ fascism ” .
You have to admit : Until Harper , the words “ Canada ” and “ fascism ” were seldom linked .
The Conservative Party of Canada could do something far more constructive for its future prospects than to look to the past for a saviour . The party might accept Harper-era hacks like MacKay or Kellie Leitch as new leadership material , but Canadians never will . Nor will voters buy the proposition put out by Harper loyalists that Harper was just a misunderstood statesman whose tenure will be viewed kindly by history .
He was a rogue , an outlier , an authoritarian and an anomaly . The real job is not to dry-clean the Harper years , but to reject them .
The sooner his much-diminished party realizes that , the more quickly they will begin down the long road back to political respectability .

Conclusion
With the R9 290X effectively taking the wind out of their enthusiast lineup , NVIDIA needed to answer back in a big way and thats exactly what theyve done . The GTX 780 Ti is quite simply the fastest single core graphics card on the planet and more importantly , it doesnt require insane fan speeds or rampant power consumption to reach its full potential .
This launch may be entirely reactionary but it shows how NVIDIA has been biding their time , waiting for just the right moment to show off Keplers true potential with a fully-enabled GK110 . AMDs R9 290X and R9 290 shook the ultra high end market to its core . However NVIDIA seems to have shrugged off the competition by hard-launching an immensely powerful graphics card hot on the heels of AMDs debut without losing a step .
Just how fast is the GTX 780 Ti ? Try double-digit improvements over TITAN , just 9 % slower than a GTX 690 and its in an altogether different league than the GTX 780 . More importantly , power consumption hasnt increased by all that much over the TITAN . This does cast the TITANs position in a less than positive light but we have to remember that particular SKU will be increasingly targeted towards CUDA developers rather than gamers . The GTX 780 Ti fits into NVIDIAs GeForce lineup like a tailored suit and it couldnt have come at a better time .
Overclocking wasnt bad either ( minus the limited voltage overhead ) and were told that NVIDIAs board partners will be able to push things even further with their custom designs . These premium boards will actually be available at or shortly after launch , giving them a several week head start on AMDs similar , yet delayed board-partner initiatives .
Against AMDs cards the GTX 780 Ti really flexes its substantial muscle . It thoroughly outclasses the R9 290X from a raw framerate perspective even though many of the games we are using can be considered AMD friendly . Even in Uber mode , the 290X was cleanly beaten in most games . We cant consider the R9 290 a fitting competitor either since it targets a different segment , though it does remain very , very enticing from a price / performance perspective . Yes , we know the old refrain : these AMD cards will only get better as time goes on and custom versions will be much better . Its too bad for Radeon users that those two statements are based upon hypotheticals and wistful thinking while the GTX 780 Ti is reality right now .
The real differentiator between AMDs and NVIDIAs high-end cards boils down to usability . The R9 290X is loud and power hungry while the GTX 780 Ti performs better , uses less power and is noticeably quieter . Lets put this into perspective . To achieve comparable results on a reference R9 290X , youll need to pump up the fan speed to obscenely high levels and pray that PowerTune doesnt slap your overclock down to lower levels . Conversely , getting similar acoustical results as the GTX 780 Ti would push the R9 290X into such low framerates , it would likely be beaten by an even wider margin .
Another thing we should mention is consistency . NVIDIA has shown time and again their GeForce Boost algorithm is predictive enough that clocks will hardly ever go below the Base frequency . Meanwhile , Boost overhead has a nearly unlimited ceiling provided theres enough voltage and power overhead to back it up . AMDs R9 290 cards feature extreme clock speed swings in most applications and there doesnt seem to be any minimum guaranteed core clock so theres just no way to know how fast ( so slow ) your particular card will actually be .
The term value isnt exactly a hallmark of the high-end GPU market , particularly for NVIDIA cards but the GTX 780 Ti is actually quite competitive . This may actually be one of the first times weve thought of a $ 699 card as a good value ( just do n't mix up value with affordability ) despite a sky-high price tag . Granted , if you can put up with the R9 290Xs insane noise profile when in Uber Mode , it can deliver a slightly better bang for buck ratio due to a price which is some $ 150 lower but among NVIDIAs lineup the Ti is clearly superior in every respect .
Another benefit of buying the GTX 780 Ti right now is the game bundle NVIDIA is offering . Splinter Cell Blacklist may be a slightly older title but Assassin 's Creed IV Black Flag and Batman Arkham City are both triple-a games plus theres a $ 100 coupon for SHIELD . Granted , the actual value of these additions is somewhat temporary and the $ 100 discount for SHIELD is pointless for anyone who doesnt want NVIDIAs portable gaming device but they still represent more than what AMD is offering right now .
The GTX 780 Ti is everything we expected and more . It is extremely fast , consumes less power than the R9 290X and remains whisper quiet regardless of how much load you put it under . Thats a noteworthy achievement for NVIDIA in the face of an odd push towards justifying overly loud acoustics in favor of performance . Currently , there isnt a better card available for gamers who dont want to buy a water block or custom heatsink to ensure optimal framerates .

Nobody made it rain ? It 's Erykah Badu people
Surely , they did n't realize that . Surely , to Erykah Badu fans–like the ones that interrupted her early on in the video clip–recognizing Badu no matter what disguise she has on , is n't the hardest thing to do . But , to her credit , she is n't necessarily the most recognizable face in music . So , when she decided to take to Times Square to sing for cash , her grand sum of $ 3.60 is n't really surprising , especially considering her lyrics consisted of things like “ I do n't want to get no job ” . It 's a pretty awesome thing to think of , if you 're a fan and/or a resident of New York City–that you can be walking from the movie theatre on 42nd St. and 8th Ave. to the train station and run into Erykah Badu trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents .

how

start ?
When I was 7 years old I came to Halmstad where I started playing properly . Originally I started playing at home at 5 years old against a door . We had so many role models in Sweden at the time , the likes of Stellan Bengtsson and Kjell Johansson among others , at the time table tennis was strong in Sweden .
Another incredible feat you achieved in your career was returning to compete in the 2008 Beijing Olympics . You placed 4th there and had some incredible results , what inspired you to compete in Beijing and to continue competing at an age where many players had retired ?
I took a break from full time playing from 2005-2006 , I was working at Aspire Academy as coach in Qatar . During the 2006 World Table Tennis Championships I was there watching and felt like I was n't done just yet and I still had some competition left in me , at this time I was coaching and playing maybe 50 % of the team split . I made the decision to play in Beijing . I was practicing in Beijing in 1981 at 15 years old so it was a return after 27 years .
You were a member of the Swedish team at a time when there was a fierce and very two sided battle in world table tennis between your nation and China . This must have been an exciting time , what is your best memory of competing against China in the team ?
There have been many memories . Our team togethe beat China for our first time in 1989 , Dortmund . We had lost to them previously , but we always believed we could beat them . The year 2000 was also a very special memory as we were the last team on the planet to beat China at a World Team championship . I had lost easily to Liu Guoliang in the 1999 World Championships which he had won . I then had to play him in 2000 at 2-2 in the team match , it was a great feeling to produce this result . Also most people were n't really counting on Sweden to win this match in 2000 , there were many fond memories .
I also have a very good memory of 1995 when we lost to China , The Championships were in Tianjin and we lost 3-2 but there was an amazing atmosphere , thousands of people watching .
Do you think to diminish of the Swedish team and therefore the start of Chinese dominance has caused problems in the popularity of the sport ?
We simply had a fantastic generation and also strong previous players , it is not so easy to have players like this all together . It 's no coincidence that China are so good at table tennis - its the national sport and they have history and infrastructure . They have the knowledge and resources so it 's unlikely that their level will fall so much . We had to lift our game to beat them , you have to believe . The Chinese team need people to strive to beat them . Sweden before had the goal of being number 1 and we always strived towards this goal . There are more young players coming up from Japan etc and may start to believe they can win in the future . This is good for the future of the sport .
Jorgen and lifetime teammate J.O Waldner
ITTF Legends Tour 2016
Really fun , I had n't seen Jiang for a long time . It was really nice to come together and share a lot of memories and development of the sport . Great for the sport , people want to see legends , playing a little slower but can still put on a good show . Would be nice to take it to different parts of the world , its a social experience too so we meet each other in a different environment .
Do you feel that there are certain things which Europe can improve in order to create more top players at the international level to compete with Asia ?
It is important to learn from the best and put it in your own way , it 's not really possible to copy the Chinese . I went to China in 1981 and learned many things , but took some things away and then made it my own special way . There is lots of knowledge in Asia in the coaches , and the top players come back into the system , this is not seen often in Europe . For the future more financial resources are needed to try and encourage former players to transition to coaching and development or to find roles where they can help the next generation .
Also because of the financial inputs in Asia coaches are able to focus on a smaller number of players , the coach : player ratio in many Asian centers is much better than in Europe and other continents .
Do you think nations have been trapped by trying to follow China in focusing on developing strong technique , therefore losing the variation which may have helped them win before and , in a sense , trying to beat them at their own game ? ( Accurate technique , speed and power ) .
We for sure need to have different styles . Now there is less spin on the ball and everything is power with use of the body , technique is important . Many players are playing full power on both sides , the game is quicker and harder to play style like full table with the forehand . Lots of styles have been phased out with rule changes like defensive players , short pimple penholders , traditional penholders and others .
Players are trying to copy China and are becoming too similar , power on both sides . Trying to play at this speed against China is very difficult there need to be other ideas and things to focus on in order to improve .
One of the most significant highlights occurring in your matches was your backhand 'swat ' . How did you develop that stroke into your game , was it something you practiced or just a feeling of being the right shot ?
I used to do one exercise with some forehand and then a random change to backhand and sometimes was n't ready and ended up playing this shot . After a while I started to use it in practice and games also as I became more confident with it . I also knew in matches if I can hit this ball then I am in good form . Sometimes it even surprised me when the ball was very late and I could still hit it on .
What do you think it was that made your Swedish team during the height of your career so strong ? What do you see in this era of the Swedish team and for the future ?
We were very passionate and stubborn , we wanted to win in everything we did . This was shared among our team . Our matches even in practice were very intense , we hated to lose , everything was a competition even running , football games and other activities . This built the mentality which helped our team to win .
The team now needs to step up a little higher and work more on details . We have a young generation coming through and have WTTC next year at home , things are looking much better now than a few years ago .
What do you think about the current game and the balance of power and consistency ?
Today many players play too hard and do n't adjust so well . You have to adjust to how the incoming ball is rather than planning too far ahead . Sometimes the ball may bounce higher or lower and already the player makes a plan to play with full power and is then not able to adjust .

It was my great honour to catch up with Sweden 's legend Jorgen Persson at the 2017 Liebherr ITTF World Table Tennis Championships in Dusseldorf , Germany . Jorgen has been one of the most prominent players in the sport , helping a powerful Swedish team to reach the top of the world and repel a strong Chinese movement . Hope you enjoy the interview ! For more top player interviews visit my Interviews Page . I of course had previously had a chance to win a World championship but lost to Waldner in the 1989 final . Usually you only get one opportunity to achieve these things and when they arise you must take them . I was very disappointed about the 89 final and so when I had another chance in 1991 I went in with confidence as I had been playing well for the whole tournament so I had to take this chance.Roger Federer gentleman and good for sport.JapanesePorsche 911New Zealand or maybe FijiBuy a porsche and go to New Zealand and invest some , be smart ; )
Mar 9 , 2015 ; Charlotte , NC , USA ; Washington Wizards guard Garrett Temple ( 17 ) signals to his team during the second half of the game against the Charlotte Hornets at Time Warner Cable Arena . Wizards win 95-69 . Mandatory Credit : Sam Sharpe-USA TODAY Sports
Washington Wizards , Where Are They Now : The Euro Resurgence ( Jan Vesely and Oleksiy Pecherov )
Washington Wizards , Where Are They Now : The Euro Resurgence ( Jan Vesely and Oleksiy Pecherov ) by David Statman
Over the next couple of weeks , we 'll be releasing player previews for everyone on the Washington Wizards ‘ roster .
Garrett Temple , 2014-2015 regular season stats : 3.9 PPG , 1.7 RPG , 1.1 APG , .40 FG % , 14 minutes ( 52 games played )
Every coach in the NBA has their guy . For Washington Wizards coach Randy Wittman , it 's pretty clear that Garrett Temple is his guy .
Temple exemplifies everything that Wittman wants in his players : he 's tough , gritty , versatile and can defend . Unfortunately , though , there are plenty of players that you can find outside of the league that can do pretty much the same thing . Toure ' Murry , who 's joining the Wizards for training camp , is essentially the same player as Temple and he has n't found a permanent home in the league yet .
Temple played some backup point guard for Washington last year after the bench began to struggle with Andre Miller , but once Ernie Grunfeld acquired Ramon Sessions from the Sacramento Kings , his minutes became virtually nonexistent .
The 6 ' 6″ combo-guard exercised his player-option with the team this summer , opting not to test his value on the free agent market .
While Temple is capable of contributing in the NBA , he lacks a single particular skill that could separate him from the rest of the guards .
Washington will continue to use Sessions as their primary backup guard and they acquired a number of wing players this summer .
With that said , it 's tough to find a situation where Temple will get serious minutes if everyone remains healthy .
Recently the Utah Jazz were reportedly interested in trading for Temple after Dante Exum suffered a torn ACL during international competition , but as of right now , Temple is still in Washington .
The Wizards typically go into the regular season with an open spot on the roster , but that 's not the case this year . They invited both Murry and Ish Smith to training camp , so perhaps they will eventually move Temple to a team that could actually use his services .
But for the sake of this preview , let 's assume that Temple will stick around in D.C .
He 's going to have a lot of competition for minutes this upcoming season — more competition than he 's ever seen before . The Washington Wizards will have John Wall and Bradley Beal get the majority of playing time , while the rest will be determined by their play during camp and preseason .
In camp , Temple will have to outplay Sessions , newly acquired Gary Neal , Martell Webster and Alan Anderson for a chance to play .
More Player Previews : DeJuan Blair
If Temple can consistently knock down the perimeter shot , then he might be able to get some unexpected playing time , just like Kevin Seraphin did this past season .
I 'm still not completely sold on Neal , who has n't been very consistent throughout the course of his NBA career . Temple is a better defender than Neal , but he 's not an outside threat .
Neal was brought in to provide a scoring spark off the bench , but if he does n't perform up to expectations during camp , it really would n't surprise me if he gets into a DeJuan Blair situation . After all , how many gunners had success playing for Wittman ?
Temple will be the team 's third string point guard this upcoming season . At this point , we all pretty much know what to expect from him .
He 's a solid defender and he 'll occasionally hit an outside shot . While he probably wo n't get much playing time , it 'll still be nice to have a somewhat reliable option off the bench in Temple .
The Food and Drug Administration 's chief operating officer said Wednesday that the agency 's new guidelines for monitoring employee e-mails will protect the rights of whistleblowers to communicate their concerns to Congress and others .
But agency officials said the guidelines would still allow them to conduct the kind of controversial surveillance that the FDA carried out in recent years against five government scientists . Officials said that monitoring was appropriate because the agency had reason to believe the scientists were releasing confidential company trade secrets .
“ From where we were two or three years ago , it 's night and day , ” Walter S. Harris , the FDA 's deputy commissioner for operations , told members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at a hearing .
“ We do n't consider whistleblowers outsiders , ” Harris said . “ We consider them part of our staff . ”
His comments were met with skepticism by committee Republicans and some Democrats , who called the agency 's spying operation unacceptably invasive .
“ The only thing that was missing was a camera looking both ways that would be reminiscent of George Orwell 's ‘ 1984 , ' ” Chairman Darrell Issa ( R-Calif. ) said . He acknowledged that federal workers have no right to privacy on government computers or property . “ But that is not to say that targeting is appropriate , ” he said .
FDA officials have been under fire from Congress since the disclosure that they monitored the scientists ' computers as they wrote to congressional staff , their lawyers , journalists and offices that investigate government wrongdoing .
The agency says it suspected the scientists of disclosing confidential company information about medical devices they believed were unsafe . In a report released before the hearing , however , committee Republicans and Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R-Iowa ) said the FDA may have overstepped federal laws meant to protect whistleblowers — and suggested the employees were targeted for retaliation .
By using software that searched for keywords and captured screen shots of their laptops at five-
second intervals , the FDA swept up material that 's protected by whistleblower laws .
“ There was no effort to avoid snooping on legally protected communications , ” said Grassley , who appeared as a witness . “ They gave little or any thought to limiting what they were collecting . ”
Some House Democrats , including Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( Md . ) , the party 's ranking member on the panel , defended the FDA , pointing to findings by the inspector general that oversees the agency .
In a review released before the hearing , the IG for the Department of Health and Human Services found the FDA 's concerns about leaks had been legitimate . That said , the review found the agency failed to “ fully assess '' the legality of whether the “ potentially intrusive ” scope of the operation would protect whistleblowers .
Angela Canterbury of the Project on Government Oversight questioned whether the new safeguards would protect whistleblowers ' communications . She said the FDA should not be in the surveillance or law enforcement business and suggested concerns about criminal wrongdoing go to the Justice Department .
Harris said the new monitoring policy makes sure that in collecting information about employees , any protected communications — for instance , e-mails to Congress — are flagged for review by agency lawyers , then discarded .
“ We consider interactions with the Hill [ and others ] protected activities , ” Harris said . “ When we are going through the monitoring , they may walk upon that . And they 'll stop all processes . ”
Harris also highlighted the usefulness of employee monitoring . He said such FDA efforts led to the conviction in 2012 of a chemist who used his access to the drug-approval process to make millions of dollars in an insider-trading scheme .
The case of the five scientists goes back to 2009 , when FDA reviewers sent letters to Congress and the incoming Obama administration about alleged misconduct in the medical device office . They later took their complaints to the media , leading the FDA to ask the inspector general about a criminal inquiry into what the agency believed was leaked information . The IG turned them down . But the surveillance program moved ahead in 2010 .
“ The IT people collected information they thought met very narrow search terms , ” Jeffrey Shuren , director of the agency 's Center for Devices and Radiological Health , told lawmakers . The terms included “ colonography ” and K followed by six numbers , the code for medical devices .
“ Some of these appear to be the beginnings of a witch hunt , ” Rep. Jackie Speier ( D-Calif. ) said .
The scientists had challenged approval of numerous imaging devices , maintaining that they did not work as advertised by their manufacturers , produced false positives and subjected patients to excessive radiation .
Asked by lawmakers if the scientists ' concerns turned out to be valid , Shuren said a committee of scientists that recently reviewed a CT scan approved for routine colon cancer screening unanimously found it safe for asymptomatic patients .
The whistleblowers were not called to testify Wednesday . Cummings said Issa was playing politics by not interviewing them as Democrats had wanted .
“ Unfortunately , the majority has taken a traditionally bipartisan issue — something that all committee members should be investigating together — and turned it into another partisan spectacle for which our committee has become well-known , ” he said .
Issa said the scientists ' allegations “ have been confirmed independently ” and added that he was “ worried about [ further ] retaliation against them . ”
Tyler Johnson came into the NHL as an undrafted free agent and wasted no time making his mark . The Lightning in turn wasted little time themselves recently re-signing the 24-year old to a three- year contract extension . Here are five reasons why extending Tyler Johnson 's contract was a no brainer for the Bolts .
Johnson set a new franchise rookie record for most goals in a season with 24 , surpassing teammate Steven Stamkos who previously held the record with 23 goals .
2 . He 's used to performing when the odds are against him
He 's just the second rookie in NHL history to record five short-handed goals and five power-play goals in a single season .
3 . What summer vacation ?
Always eager to improve , Johnson was on a plane to Belarus soon after the Lightning exited the Stanley Cup playoffs to represent Team USA at the 2014 IIHF World Championships . It was there that Johnson recorded a team-high six goals in eight games including two goals in 17 seconds and led all Team USA forwards in on ice time with nearly 21 minutes per game .
4 . The future looks bright
Johnny 's found success at every level of the game so far , being named the AHL 's most valuable player in 2013 , and most recently being nominated as one of three finalists for the Calder Trophy .
5 . Anddddddd , who would n't want to see more of this face on the ice

Majority of Chinese willing to pay more for greener goods , poll shows
The vast majority of Chinese believe climate change is taking place and most consumers are willing to pay more for eco-friendly products to reduce its effects , a survey has found .
Some 93 percent of respondents said climate change is under way , while about three out of five respondents feel they have been directly affected by it .
The study of 4,169 Chinese adults was carried out from July to September by the Center for China Climate Change Communication , jointly established by Renmin University of China and non-governmental organization Oxfam .
About 68.4 percent of respondents said they thought China has already suffered from the effects of climate change , while about half of respondents said it will affect people in rural areas more .
About 90 percent of respondents said the government should have prime responsibility for dealing with climate change , followed by the public , media , companies and NGOs .
Zheng Baowei , director of Renmin University 's Research Center of Journalism and Social Development , said the government should play a dominant role in adopting measures and designing policies in line with the public 's expectations and interests . However , implementation of the policies will eventually rely on public participation .
More than 93.4 percent of respondents felt they have knowledge of climate change , while just 6.6 percent said they had never heard of it .
About 60 percent thought climate change is mainly caused by human activities , while 33 percent considered it to be mainly caused by the environment .
Sun Zhen , deputy director of the Department of Climate Change at the National Development and Reform Commission , said the data might sound satisfactory , but climate change is placing increasing pressure on China .
As the world is facing more extreme weather-related events , such as hurricanes , drought and floods , the government has an obligation to clarify to what extent climate change has contributed to these , Sun said .
Wang Binbin , executive director of the Center for China Climate Change Communication , said addressing climate change also calls for the public to practise low-carbon ways of living and consumption , while the good news is that more Chinese consumers are willing to pay more for a greener life .
Some 87 percent of those surveyed said they were willing to pay more for greener products , while more than 34 percent said they would accept a 30 percent price rise to buy such products .
The survey also showed that people aged between 18 and 24 were willing to pay more for environmentally-friendly products .
More than four out of five respondents said they supported the government in setting standards for mandatory garbage separation and waste recycling , adopting greener materials for construction , and producing greener cars , even if it means higher costs .
Only 34 percent of respondents said they separated their garbage .

LEAFS DAILY :
Please allow me to kick today 's post off with a quick tweet from Sportsnet 's Stephen Burtch who is , in my opinion , the guy to follow if you want to learn how statistics in hockey work .
2 ) the # Leafs are yet again providing fodder for the `` analytics are meaningless garbage '' crowd… — Stephen Burtch ( @ SteveBurtch ) November 1 , 2015
Everyday I get comments from people who think I am insane for how highly I regard my two absolute favorite current Maple Leafs , Jake Gardiner and Nazem Kadri , but the stats back me up ( which is why they 're my favorite – I do n't just randomly like them , they are the best my favorite team currently has to offer ) .
It 's OK if you do n't agree : friends do n't need to agree on everything and I am always open to , and interested in opposing opinions ( but I will require statistical evidence , or compelling logic in order to change my mind ) .
Anyways this is just a preamble for what I am about to say : The Leafs are currently too good . Yes , their record is 1-7-2 and they are tied for last in the NHL . However – and this is really important and would raise the level of discourse surrounding the NHL if people were more aware of it – talent does n't become a bigger factor in determining the standings than luck until game 73 . That means that it is in no way unusual for a team to have a record that is in no way reflective of their actual play , ten games into the season , which is the situation the Leafs are in right now .
The Leafs have actually been an excellent team this year . To wit :
16 players on their roster are above 50 % CF .
They are fifth in the NHL in team Corsi For .
As a team , at 5v5 , they are shooting only 6 % .
Their 98.3 PDO suggest room for improvement and bad luck .
Both their team save % and team shooting % are bottom ten in the league and will improve .
They are starting more of their shifts in the offensive zone than all but two other teams .
They have allowed the fourth least high-danger scoring chances against .
They are fifth in the NHL in positive shot differential .
Even though they are in a virtual tie for first place in power-play possession , their PP has not scored very much .
They are last in the NHL in PP success percentage with a 7.4 % PP , a number all but guaranteed to double , because it is incredibly rare for a team to finish the season below 14 % .
Everything on this list shows that the Leafs are due to start getting some puck-luck and win some games . If a team plays a high-possession game , like the Leafs do , it is highly likely they 'll be successful long-term . The power-play and team shooting/save percentages are all sure to rise and when they do , the Leafs will start winning .
The other factor , which I have n't touched on yet , is goaltending . So far , Bernier and Reimer have had a few bad games , likely costing the team some points . However , we are ten games into a season and we ca n't read too much into any players performance up to this point .
The Leafs are a team whose main goal should be development , coaching and acquiring future assets . Actual results , as long as the team gets a high draft pick , do n't matter . There is no way the Leafs should be making a move to get a goalie better than Bernier this season – first of all , I do n't know how likely that even is , but secondly , even if it was , why would they want to win more games ? That 's the Brian Burke way and we all know how it turned out .
I must give another Stephen Burtch Tweet credit for pointing this out to me , but Johnathan Bernier leads the NHL in high-danger save percentage among goalies with 150 minutes or more played so far this year . The fact is , Bernier wo n't continue to let in bad goals at the rate he has . He is clearly talented and I 've been more than critical of him so far this year , but when he inevitably reverts back to allowing his career average in low-danger shots ( currently 3 % lower than normal over 7 games vs the other 175 NHL games he 's played ) then the Leafs will win more games .
Why It 's a Problem :
The problem as I see it is this : the Leafs built a quality team that is tenacious and which has been quick to adopt to Babcock 's aggressive system , and as such , they have a much worse record than they deserve to have . So far , this has n't been a problem because the team can take moral victories while not hurting its long-term future by moving out of top-five draft pick range .
However , when the team starts scoring at a rate that its peripheral stats suggest it almost certainly will , when the power-play doubles its current efficiency and when Bernier stops giving up bad goals at a slightly higher than acceptable rate , the Leafs will start to win games .
Maybe they will be lucky and they will continue to play well and lose , but it can not be counted on . The Leafs are a team that desperately needs at least one more top-five pick to add to their impressive Nylander , Marner , Kapanen , Kadri , Gardiner , Rielly cache , and by playing as well as they currently are , they are going to screw this plan up .
Did someone forget to remind the fans and media that a “ scorched earth ” rebuild actually involves tearing the team down ? I keep hearing about how Phaneuf does n't need to be traded because he 's having a “ Renaissance ” under Babcock , and how Bozak , for the same reason , might actually be worth keeping around .
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO !
These guys are playing good , no doubt . But that only means the Leafs have an even more urgent need to trade them . Identify players you want to keep when the team is good again , and then move out everyone else , even if those players make the team better now .
Because better now is worse later and no matter how good they are this year , they are n't good enough to win . Only luckily unlucky results so far have kept the Leafs from that familiar territory of “ too good to finish last , not good enough for the Playoffs . ”
The horrible irony is that last year they were a team that was supposed to compete and which was competing well into December , despite horrible advanced stats . We all know what happened . Now they are a team which is not supposed to compete and they are n't , but the stats say they will . It 's a reverse situation that is just as bad .
The Leafs need to get worse , before they accidentally get better .
Tonight 's Game :
The Maple Leafs host the Dallas Stars tonight , while the fans will watch Tyler Seguin and play their own game called “ What If/If Only , ” which a very depressing game so I do n't recommend you play it . Reimer gets the start tonight because Bernier is suffering a minor injury ( he will back up ) .
Thanks for reading .

CABLE TV viewers in middle as titans clash
Viacom channels could go dark for Time Warner subscribers if a price dispute is n't resolved by midnight .
The two sides could still resolve their dispute today , allowing Time Warner customers on New Year 's Day to see `` Engaged & Underage : The Bridal Bowl '' on MTV or an episode of `` iCarly '' called `` iCarly Saves Television '' on Nickelodeon .
`` We 've been attempting to negotiate in good faith but they seem to have taken it to the brink . Unfortunately , we are now at an impasse , '' said Philippe Dauman , chief executive of Viacom . The company 's two-year contract with Time Warner , the nation 's second-largest cable company , which provides service to 12.3 million homes , expires at midnight .
Viacom Inc. has threatened to pull its programming in a high-stakes showdown over pricing . Nearly 2 million homes in the Los Angeles area that are customers of Time Warner Cable Inc. could lose such Viacom channels as Nickelodeon , MTV , VH-1 , Comedy Central , Spike , TV Land and BET .
Time Warner Cable subscribers could lose `` SpongeBob SquarePants , '' `` Dora the Explorer '' and Jon Stewart at midnight tonight if the cable company fails to agree on a new contract with one of its biggest suppliers .
On Tuesday , however , both sides appeared to be dug in to their positions , with Viacom placing newspaper ads and TV spots utilizing characters such as Dora the Explorer to encourage viewers to call Time Warner and complain . The media giant used similar tactics in a dispute with satellite broadcaster EchoStar Communications nearly five years ago .
`` It rarely comes to this , '' said television consultant Larry Gerbrandt of Media Valuation Partners in Beverly Hills . `` If they go off the air , no one wins . Customers will get upset at Time Warner and they could lose subscribers , and Viacom will lose important advertising revenue . ''
For its part , Time Warner said Viacom 's demands for higher fees were `` egregious , '' particularly at a time when the country is in the throes of an economic recession and subscribers are sensitive to costly cable bills .
`` We are being put in an awkward spot , '' Time Warner Cable spokesman Alex Dudley said . `` Advertising revenue stinks so they are looking to stick our customers for the difference . We have to hold the line for our customers . ''
SNL Kagan cable analyst Derek Baine said , `` It 's a really bad time to be squeezing people for a rate increase . ''
Viacom , however , said it was asking for only a modest increase of about 25 cents a month , or $ 3 a year , per subscriber for its package of 20 channels .
Time Warner countered that consenting to such an increase could encourage other cable networks also to demand higher fees , a scenario that could lead to $ 30 a year in increased charges for cable subscribers .
Viacom 's strategy is complicated because ratings for its signature MTV , VH-1 and BET channels have been down this year , which means that advertising revenue has been lower than expected . Nickelodeon , meanwhile , has increased its audience with `` Dora the Explorer , '' `` SpongeBob SquarePants , '' `` iCarly '' and a stronger Nick at Night lineup .
`` They are holding our customers hostage for a bunch of networks with sagging ratings and only one or two good channels , '' Dudley said .
There will probably be more such disputes in the new year as companies struggle amid a sour economy , predicted SNL Kagan 's Baine . In recent months , a tussle between Time Warner and broadcaster LIN TV resulted in a monthlong blackout of 17 LIN television stations from Time Warner 's cable system .
Viacom has gone to the mat before . In 2004 , its cable channels disappeared from EchoStar 's Dish Network for two days while the two sides quarreled over the terms of a new contract . And 12 years ago , the cable company Tele-Communications Inc. removed MTV and VH-1 from its lineup in a dispute with Viacom .
The Wonderkids of La Masia # 1
Lee Seung Woo — South Korea
Navid Molaaghaei Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 6 , 2014
Info
Birthday : 06.01.1998 ( 17 y/o )
Position : Forward
Nationality : South Korean
Been at Barça since : August 2011
Favorite number : 10
Idol : Lionel Messi
Release clause : €3m , but it 'll rise to €12m when he gets promoted to Barça B
Lee
The offensive wonderkids are pumping out from every corner of Asia . With their quick feet , great workrates and high discipline level , you ca n't really go wrong when you , as a scout , are out hunting for new talent for their clubs .
Lee Seung Woo is a prime example of these Asian phenomenons . With his shear speed , technical ability , eye for goal , light touch in around the box and positivity on and off the pitch , he is arguably the biggest prospect in Barcelona 's beloved Cantera . BarcaTV journalist Jaume Marcet describes him as “ a striker with a midfielder 's soul ” .
When Lee was 12 , a Barça scout spotted him in South Korea , during the 9-a-side mini World Cup back in October 2010 . The things he noticed about him was his speed , dribling and his ability to bag in goal after goal . The Barcelona scout had to set Lee up for a move to La Masia quickly because Real Madrid and a couple of clubs from the Bundesliga were also interested . Fortunately for Barça , Lee chose the Catalans instead of the other offers he got .
Back in Korea , Lee was a massive star in under 13 and 15 football . He managed to score 29 goals in 16 matches in the West Seoul Division , 11 goals in 6 matches during the knockout stages and after that , he was awarded with the ‘ Cha Boom 's youth player MVP of the year ' . With the U-15 side , he scored 38 goals and made 18 assists in just 29 games .
Similar to Messi ?
Putting this in to perspective , Messi scored 37 goals in 30 appearances at a similar age . No wonder people have given Lee the nickname : “ The Korean Messi ” . Such a cliché , I know .
In truth , his playing style is n't that similar to Leo 's , but his ability to score goals is the same as Messi 's when he was younger , if not better . Lee is a huge fan of him and when he was asked on an opinion on him , he said :
“ I watch Messi very closely . I want to be a perfect player just like him . My goal is to try my absolute best to become the first Korean to play for Barcelona 's senior team ” .
Like Messi , Lee starts from the striker position and always drops back to receive the ball from his teammates , linking up with them and driving the ball forwards with his exceptional dribbling and close control . In that sense , they 're definitely similar . Same goes for their goalscoring records .
Suspended by FIFA
In March 2013 , Lee and a few other internationals were unfairly banned by FIFA from participating in official competitons for the club upon complaints from an “ unnamed club ” ( some conspiracies say that it was Real Madrid ) , stating that FIFA laws prevent clubs from signing international footballers under the age of 18 .
“ The rules for the signing of minors are very clear . The popularity of football also brings some dangers . The financial success of our sport makes it , unfortunately , of interest to international mafias , who get rich due to illicit activities like match-fixing or tricking underprivileged kids with false promises of a professional career in Europe ” , the FIFA-president Sepp Blatter said .
To their defense , Barcelona point to the fact it was the Korean FA that offered Lee , and two other footballers Paik and Jang to the club . The issue is yet to be fully resolved , but these players will continue to train with the club and take part in friendlies until then .
To add a dash of controversy , Catalan paper ‘ Sport ' is reporting that cases like these are rare , as FIFA hardly interferes in such affairs , unless a complaint or allegation from another body or club is received . When a player like Lee is performing like he has done ever since he came , it 's not hard to see why other clubs would want to potentially eliminate the South Korean 's opportunity to grow and integrate to the Barcelona system , making the chances for him to succeed smaller . Keep in mind , however , that this is mostly speculation and should therefore be taken with a grain of salt .
According to FIFA , the suspension of the players will be cancelled if :
1 ) The player 's parents move to the club 's country for non-football related purposes .
2 ) The players lives 50km from a border shared by the club 's country , with the club being within 50km of that same border .
The star of his generation
Ever since he joined , he 's been the mian factor of generation 1998 's big succes . Already in his first tournament with Barça in the Summer of 2011 , Lee scored 13 goals in 10 games and was chosen as the MVP of the Torneo de Canillas .
In May 2012 , MD wrote a small article on him , in which they wrote : “ 14 year old is the star of Infantil A ” saying he 's more than a goalscorer , despite 36 goals in 26 games with five hat-tricks included , and that he is known for excellent speed , intelligence of movement ( with and without the ball ) and a prototypical La Masia teammate .
Later that month , his team played with the under 15 side , Infantil A , in the Lennart Johansson Trophy and won the competition , scoring 17 goals and conceding 0 goals with him being the top scorer . He impressed to say the least , scoring a brace in the semi-final against Dutch side Vitesse and then a goal in the final against Red Star Belgrade which Barça won 2-0 .
In general , he has been playing in a lot of different friendly tournaments to keep in form . In October 2013 , he scored a goal and an assist in the Copa Internacional del Caribe final .
Suspension on and off
2014 has been a bit of a rollercoaster for Lee , to say the least . At the end of the 2013/14 season , the young South Korean was with the league winning Juvenil B side , despite being eligible for the Cadet A . Even though it 's a good achievement , he still was n't allowed to play any official matches at the club because of the ban imposed by FIFA .
But during the summer , the ban was temporarily removed on all the suspended youth players , while CAS were coming up with a final solution to the transfer ban imposed on Barcelona . Despite this , Lee and the other youngsters would 've played during the summer anyways since all the games were friendlies .
Lee was promoted to the Juvenil A and played a couple of friendly tournaments with the team . These tournaments were n't a success for the team and Lee had a tough time . He did n't score any goals and his impact on the games were minimal .
Meanwhile , CAS decided to extend the deadline for the final decision regarding Barcelona 's transfer ban , and the youngsters were once again suspended from playing any official matches for the Catalan club .
Star of the Asian Championship
Shortly after the pre-season came to an end , Lee went back to South Korea to prepare for the U-16 Asian Championship with the South Korean national team . Together with his Barcelona teammate Jang Gyeol-Hee , also suspended by FIFA , they went on to become key players in South Korea 's run to the final .
Despite being suspended from the first game because of too many yellow cards during qualifiers , Lee went on to score two goals in the two group games he played , both ending up being match deciding goals . And it was n't regular goals either . Both of those goals were created by Lee himself after some terrific individual brilliance .
On came the knockout stages , and in the quarter-final against Japan , Lee scored both of the goals in South Korea 's 2–0 win . His second goal of the match was a rather easy one-touch goal but the first one was as good as a solo goal gets and definitely the goal of the tournament . Lee recieved the ball on his own half , sprinted past the midfielders , dribbling past three out of four Japanese defenders , before taking the ball past the helpless goalkeeper and putting it in to the back of the net . One could say it was Maradona-Messi-esque .
Then the semi-final against Syria came and it ended up being a 7–1 thrashing of the poor Syrians , and once again , Lee was the main man . He scored a penalty and made four ( ! ) assists . Again , it was n't just regular stuff . All the assists were pretty well executed . But in the final against North Korea , Lee was physically beaten by the hard-hitting defenders who did n't give the spaces Lee would 've hoped for , including some pretty nasty tackles . In the end , North Korea won 1–0 , but despite a rather disappointing final , Lee was deservedly awarded as the MVP of the tournament . He was also the top goalscorer .
Since Lee already plays at a higher age level , at a much higher team level , these performances should n't really come as the biggest surprise , but even so , Lee showed why he is one of the best talents in the world under the age of 18 .
Future economical profit
Economically , Lee can also become very important in the future . The Asian market is huge and if he continues likes this , Barça will definitely use his marketing potential in Asia , especially South Korea , and earn enormous sums of money in a market which only gets more and more profitable . We saw this with Park Ji-sung when he was a key player for Manchester United .
Lee Seung Woo is definitely a player that we should keep an eye on for the future , but I 'm afraid that the ban , which has kept him away form official matches in two years now , might have had an effect to Lee 's development . However , the talent is definitely there and hopefully he will still develop in to an important first team player . He has the potential for it .

Built By Immigrants , U.S. Catholic Churches Bolstered By Them Once Again

Nearly a century ago , immigrants from Germany and Ireland founded St. Helena Church in a working-class neighborhood in north Philadelphia .
Immigrants , and their children , still fill the pews at St. Helena 's — but the vast majority of them are now from Vietnam , Latin America , the Philippines and Africa . Weekly masses are conducted in Spanish and Vietnamese as well as English . The senior priest , the Rev . Joseph Trinh , is himself a Vietnamese refugee . One of his associate priests is from Haiti , and another is from Ecuador .
`` I tell people here that we did n't have the opportunity to build this beautiful church , but now it is our turn to upkeep it and pass it on to the next generation , '' Trinh says . `` We were welcomed here , and now we have to welcome other groups that come in . ''

Immigrants may be unpopular in some corners of American society , but not with the U.S. Catholic Church , which depends on immigrant members to replenish its ranks . More than a quarter of today 's U.S. Catholics were born outside the country , and another 15 percent are the children of immigrants . Hispanics account for the largest proportion of the immigrant influx , but Asians are moving up fast .
Not surprisingly , immigrants will get a lot of attention from Pope Francis on his upcoming U.S. visit . In New York , he 'll go to a school that serves immigrant students , and he 's expected to follow that with a personal meeting with immigrant families . He will meet again with foreign-born Catholics in Philadelphia , and he is likely to speak out on immigration issues in his address to the World Meeting of Families .
`` We 're in the twilight of the white ethnic European Catholic Church , '' says William D'Antonio , a sociologist who has been studying U.S. Catholics for nearly 60 years . `` We are in a new era . Within 40 years , this will be a colorful church . ''
The shift is already evident in many urban parishes . Across the northeast United States , for instance , many of the Catholic parishes established decades ago by European immigrants have closed due to declining membership . For a while , it appeared St. Helena might join them .
`` I remember sitting in church one day and feeling the void , '' says 66-year-old Mary Black , a St. Helena member for more than 40 years . `` People were moving out , and it was that scary feeling of transition , of 'What 's going to happen ? ' But then they came . I really think this church would be shuttered if it was n't for the Vietnamese community and other immigrants . ''

Membership in the U.S. Catholic Church as a whole is dropping , according to the Pew Research Center , but the trend would be far sharper if not for the foreign-born .
`` Immigrants are a large and important part of the church in the United States , '' says Greg Smith , Pew 's associate research director , `` and their importance to the Catholic faithful will only grow , because they 're much younger than the Catholic population as a whole . ''
With the church depending so heavily on immigrant members , Catholic leaders are outspoken supporters of immigration reform . Cardinal Timothy Dolan , the archbishop of New York , and Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput have both criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for his anti-immigrant rhetoric . In remarks delivered at a recent immigration panel discussion , Chaput also singled out the Obama administration over its deportation policy , which he said was `` brutally '' affecting immigrant families .

Hispanic immigrants have borne the greatest burden of those policies . About four out of five foreign-born Catholics come from countries in the Western Hemisphere , according to Pew data . Many immigrants from Mexico have settled in the southern and western parts of the United States , and the share of U.S. Catholics living in that region is growing .
At St. Patrick 's Catholic Church in Oakland , Calif. , Spanish-language Masses are far more popular than English-language Masses .
`` [ When ] I say English Mass on Saturday nights , [ the pews ] are practically empty , '' says Monsignor Antonio Valdivia . `` Then I say a Spanish Mass , be it Saturday night or Sunday morning , and they 're filled to bursting , and you see complete families . ''
The shift in the geographic center of Catholicism from the Northeast and Midwest to the South and West is presenting a challenge to the church , says Smith of the Pew Research Center .
`` This has real repercussions , in terms of trying to find a match between where the resources are , where the parishes are , where the priests are , where the schools are , and where the people are , '' he says .
If that problem can be solved , however , immigrants can revitalize Catholic congregations . St. Helena in Philadelphia , for instance , counts about 200 Vietnamese families among its congregation . Longtime parishioners there say that as they get to know the immigrant newcomers , they appreciate what they bring to the community .
`` The warmth of the Spanish people to me is so heartfelt , '' says Mary Black , the longtime parishioner . `` The devoutness of the Vietnamese always inspires me . The folks that come from Africa with their dress , Indians who come in saris — it 's an amazing experience . ''

Her friend Anita Repsch , a St. Helena member for 58 years , says she often attends Mass with her immigrant friends .
`` We go to Mass that 's Spanish or Vietnamese , and because our Mass is so structured , we can follow it and know what 's happening . It does n't have to be in our language , '' 71-year-old Repsch says . `` Basically we can pray together , no matter what language we use . ''
As the first prelate from Latin America , Pope Francis is promoting such cross-cultural tolerance , and 84-year-old sociologist William D'Antonio , himself a practicing Catholic , says he 's encouraged by the changes in his church .
`` We could be a model for the world of how Catholics from all over know how to live together , '' he says .

Time to stock up on Cuban heels , boys ? 70 % of women say a man 'would n't stand a chance ' if he was under 6ft
Tom Cruise , Daniel Radcliffe , Seth Green and Jack Black are all below 6ft
UK men have grown four inches in 100 years to average height of 5ft 10ins
Ideal height for a male partner is between 6ft and 6ft 6ins
British woman 's average height is 5ft 4ins
Tom Cruise , Daniel Radcliffe , Jack Black , Seth Green and Macauley Culkin should probably visit their nearest Cuban heel outlet the next time they 're interested in wooing a lady friend .
The vast majority of women say a man 'would n't stand a chance ' in the love stakes if they were under 6ft in height , and 'would struggle ' to get their attention ... despite the average height of the British man being just 5ft 10ins , two inches below a 'perfect ' height .
And although men are getting there ( slowly but surely ) , having shot up by four inches in the past 100 years , 71 per cent of females still say the ideal height for a male partner is between 6ft and 6ft 6ins , according to a new poll .
Kate Holmes towers above her ex-husband Tom Cruise ( 5ft 7ins ) , left , and her co-presenter Danielle Radcliffe ( 5ft 5ins ) , right
Meanwhile , the average height of women in the UK is 5ft 4ins - just one-and-half inches more than 100 years ago .
And as far as men are concerned , 45 per cent would date a woman taller than them - if she would have them - and 49 per cent said the ideal woman was between 5ft 7ins and 5ft 10ins tall , according to the study of 1,400 British women by men 's big and tall brand High And Mighty .
Of these women , 71 per cent want their man between 6ft and 6ft 6ins , 26 per cent between 5ft 7ins to 5ft 11ins , and three per cent between 6ft 6ins and 6ft 11ins .
A total of 63 per cent also said they thought that 'taller men ' were sexier than smaller men - mirroring Hollywood 's penchant for taller leading men such as 6ft 3ins tall Thor star Chris Hemsworth and 6ft 3ins tall Transformers star Josh Duhamel .
Jack Black , 5ft 6ins , promoting Shallow Hal with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow in 2001 , left , and actor Seth Green , 5ft 4ins - but neither of them need to worry as they are both already married
Women also said they believe that 'short man syndrome ' or 'small man 's inferiority complex ' - also called the Napolean complex after the famous emperor Napolean Bonaparte , who was 5ft 6ins tall - really does exist , with 62 per cent saying smaller men had an inferiority complex linked to their height .
What women look for in a man
Sense of humour Kindness Height Grooming Physique Fashion sense Hair
A total of 33 per cent of women polled said they believed tall men were happier than short men .
Women were also asked which factors were 'most important in a man ' , with the top answer being a sense of humour , followed by kindness , height , grooming , physique , fashion sense and hair .
The poll found that 72 per cent of men is 'happy with their height ' , with the most ideal height listed as 6ft by 23 per cent , 6ft 2ins by 17 per cent , and 6ft 3ins by 10 per cent .
Some 54 per cent of men polled said they thought 'height made no difference to their attractiveness ' .
Sally Smith , 32 , of Birmingham , said : ' I 'm 5ft 8ins and my ex-boyfriend was only 5ft 7ins . After a while I got a bit sick of looking down on him and never being able to wear heels , so after a year I gave him the push . '
The accounts worker added : ' I 'm now dating a man who is 6ft 2ins , and now I can wear whatever kind of shoes I want without feeling like I 'm towering over by boyfriend . '
Women also said they believe that 'short man syndrome ' or 'small man 's inferiority complex ' - also called the Napolean complex after the famous emperor Napolean Bonaparte , who was 5ft 6ins tall - really does exist
Psychologist Portia Hickey said : 'Psychological research has found that women tend to describe their ideal man as taller than average .
'Women 's attraction to taller men is likely to be driven by both evolution and positive stereotypes about tall men .

In the past 10 years , 80 people aged 21 and under have killed themselves in prison - the government has set up a review to find out why so many young people die in custody . One mother explains what it is like to have a child die behind bars .
`` Three days before his seventh birthday , we picked Adam up and all his worldly goods - which was n't very much - and brought him home , '' says Annette Rushton . `` He seemed happy quickly to be here . ''
Adam 's new home was in Welshpool in Powys , with his adopted parents , Annette and husband David . It was a completely different environment from his early childhood experiences .
He had been taken into care , along with his baby brothers , after their biological mother struggled to cope and there had been concerns for the children 's welfare .
Although only a child himself , Adam had been looking after his twin brothers .

`` They would be hungry and there might be Weetabix in the house , but there 'd be no milk . He would go outside and wander up and down the streets and look for somebody 's milk on the doorstep , '' says Mrs Rushton .
`` So we soon came to realise that from a very early age , the only way Adam could survive was by taking things . ''
Mrs Rushton remembers Adam as an active and mischievous boy .
`` He would have periods of bad behaviour , most often when he 'd had a particularly nice day , '' she says .
`` You 'd go to the seaside , or you 'd go and do something with [ him ] , and then you 'd come home and his behaviour would deteriorate .
`` The only way we could ever really understand it , or explain it , was that this child did n't think he deserved to have anything nice , or to do anything nice . As if he believed , ' I do n't deserve this , I 'm bad . '
`` He could n't believe that he was lovable . ''
Image copyright other Image caption Annette Rushton remembers her son Adam as `` always on the go ''
At 12 , Adam was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and began attending a specialist boarding school , but was suspended after aggressive behaviour towards another pupil and then asked not to return .
`` He went back to feeling , ' I 'm just a load of rubbish , are n't I ? What 's the point ? I might as well just do what I want to do ' , '' says Mrs Rushton .
By the age of 16 , Adam was living away from home in a hostel in Newtown , but began getting into trouble for minor crimes , such as shoplifting , and served 10 short prison sentences .
Image copyright Other Image caption Annette Rushton says her son 's behaviour could be challenging at times
In 2009 , in the run-up to his last spell in prison , his behaviour became unrecognisable to those who knew him .
`` His life became extremely chaotic , worse than I 'd ever seen in the past , '' says Eli Smith , who worked at the hostel where Adam lived .
Adam 's friend , Luke Day , noticed a change in his physical appearance too .
`` His eyes were sunken in over the few days because he was n't getting the sleep , and I do n't imagine he was eating either , '' says Mr Day .
After being caught stealing a mobile phone , Adam was remanded in custody again .
`` His behaviour in the holding cell at court was very worrying for the solicitor . He smeared faeces all over the cell wall , '' says Mrs Rushton .
She says the psychiatric nurse who assessed her son made a recommendation in his report that if he was sent back to prison he could be in danger of taking his own life .
`` That psychiatric report did n't go with him , and when it was faxed to the prison the following day , our information is that it was filed , that nobody even read it , nobody joined anything up , '' says Mrs Rushton .
Adam was sent to Brinsford , a young offenders institution near Wolverhampton , and on 22 October 2009 took his own life . He was 20 years old .
During the inquest into Adam 's death , it was discovered that another young man had killed himself in the same cell , and in the same way , weeks before .
Brinsford Young Offenders Institution accepted all of the 11 recommendations made by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman 's report into Adam 's death , including a recommendation to improve reception procedures .
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said : `` Adam Rushton 's death was a tragedy and our sympathies are with his family .
`` We have addressed all the recommendations made by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman following the investigation into the death and the points raised by the coroner following the inquest .
`` Prison staff work with some very troubled and challenging individuals and care for them professionally and effectively every day . When a death occurs it affects everyone in the prison and we are committed to do everything possible to prevent such tragedies occurring . ''

According to statistics published by the Ministry of Justice , in 2013 there were 74 deaths in custody that were self-inflicted .
In February , the Ministry of Justice announced it would be establishing an independent review into self-inflicted deaths in custody of 18-24 year olds .
When I used to visit prison , I would look around the room and I would see 30 or 40 Adams Annette Rushton
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said : `` Although there are already comprehensive investigations into individual deaths we recognise there is benefit at this time in collating lessons that may be system-wide . ''
Casework analysis by the charity Inquest suggests a large majority of young people who die in prison are diagnosed with ADHD , special educational needs and other disorders .
Mrs Rushton would like to see extra support for these young adults .
`` When I used to visit prison , I would look around the room and I would see 30 or 40 Adams , all with the same look in their eyes , all with the same expressions on their faces .
`` Yes , they deserve to be punished , but there should be something a bit more for them . ''

Songs We Love : Twin Peaks , 'Holding Roses '
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist
Chicago 's Twin Peaks was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist and guitarist Cadien Lake James . With power chords and power-pop melodies , the band recorded its debut EP in James ' basement and released its first full-length , Wild Onion , in 2014 . Twin Peaks began while its members were still in high school , and the quartet built up a fervent local following playing house shows and becoming prominent in Chicago 's DIY basement scene before graduating to small clubs .
Down In Heaven , out on May 13 , is the band 's third record — and its most polished . Now a five-piece ( keyboardist Colin Croom joined last year ) , Twin Peaks falls easily into a lineage of power-pop-influenced rock outfits like Teenage Fanclub , Velvet Crush , The Replacements and any number of the one-hit wonders you might find on the Nuggets box set . In concert , its members present as raucous punk rockers who love visceral melodies and messy three-minute songs with loud guitars .

While they 're drawn to heritage rock artists like David Bowie , Brian Wilson , The Kinks and The Rolling Stones , the Twin Peaks dudes withhold allegiance to any single source of inspiration . On Down In Heaven , the classic-rock touchpoints are familiar , yet James and his bandmates offer an invigorating reset .
`` Holding Roses , '' one of the album 's standout tracks , has a charming , Stones-ish , mid-tempo grace . Flourishes from muted trumpet and some good old-fashioned rock 'n ' roll piano riffs give the song musical depth . It 's a breakup song , but mostly it 's about the moment you realize you 've lost something special . `` Goodbye baby , and the music starts to fade , '' guitarist Clay Frankel sings . `` Goodbye baby , I really wish you could have stayed . ''
Down In Heaven comes out May 13 on Grand Jury .
Welfare State
F. Scott Fitzgerald , meticulous chronicler of American social class , famously confided to Ernest Hemingway that `` the rich are different from the rest of us . ''
`` Yes , '' was Hemingway 's laconic reply . `` They have more money . ''
These days , the same could be said of the American military . Is the military different from the rest of us ? Yes — it has more money .
This is true in a multitude of ways . Start with the obvious : if we view military spending as synonymous with defense spending ( which it 's not , really , but pretend it is for now ) , boy , does it have more money . In 2011 , the United States spent an estimated $ 768 billion on defense . Defense spending has gone down a tad since then — by the time I ended a two-year stint as counselor to the under secretary of defense for policy in summer 2011 , we were beginning to speak glumly of the coming age of austerity . But the Pentagon budget still dwarfs pretty much everything else . The poor little State Department , for instance , shared a measly $ 55 billion with USAID and numerous other international programs .
This year , Congress and the White House are playing chicken over budget sequestration , which would force draconian cuts in military spending if Congress fails to avert it . But with politicians from both parties vying to demonstrate their love for all things Pentagon , it 's safe to assume that an eleventh hour compromise will be reached . The overall budget pie may shrink in the coming decade , but I 'd bet my government Thrift Savings Account that DoD 's share of that pie will grow , while the State Department 's slice will get slimmer still .
And it 's not just from the perspective of national-level budgeting that the military has more money . According to the Congressional Budget Office , the average member of the military is paid better than 75 percent of civilian federal workers with comparable experience . Members of the military and their families can also lay claim to America 's most generous ( though arguably unsustainable ) social programs .
As the spouse of a career Army officer , I 'm stunned by the range of available benefits . Health care ? Free ! Groceries ? Military commissaries save military families roughly 30 percent over shopping in civilian stores . Education benefits ? Career personnel can expect the military to finance additional higher education , and the post-9/11 GI Bill provides up to 36 months of benefits to veterans , amounting , in effect , to full tuition and fees for four academic years . ( The education benefit is also transferable to dependents . )
Housing ? Free on base and subsidized off-base ( the housing allowance goes up with family size : from each according to his ability , to each according to his need ) . Pensions ? After 20 years of service , military personnel can retire and immediately begin to receive , at the ripe old age of 40 or so , an annual pension equal to half their salary — for the rest of their lives . Anyone who thinks socialism failed in America has never spent time on a military base .
The generous benefits we give our military reflect the increasingly reflexive esteem in which we hold the armed forces . Despite ( or because of ) the dwindling number of Americans who serve or have a close relative who serves , support for the military has become America 's civil religion .
In part , this is because we recognize that with our all-volunteer military , the few truly do make sacrifices for the many . The punishing deployment tempo of the last decade — not to mention the thousands of military personnel killed and wounded — has wreaked havoc on military families and communities , even as most Americans live lives wholly untouched by terrorism and war .
But this ca n't fully account for the disproportionate benefits we bestow on the military . Plenty of other Americans serve the nation in vital ways — consider public school teachers and nurses — and plenty of other Americans , from fishers to fire-fighters , have dangerous jobs . We do n't seem inclined to fling free health care and housing in the direction of teachers or fire-fighters , though .
Our willingness to throw money at the military , heedless of the need or cost , reflects a deep anxiety about the changing world we live in , combined with a general sense that the military is one of the few remaining functional public institutions .
The world scares us , and for good reason : Economic collapse , political stalemate , rising powers poised to eat our national lunch , global instability , terrorism , violence in the Middle East , dwindling fossil fuels , climate change… . It 's more than enough to leave you with the anxious sense that somebody needs to do something .
Americans look to the military to Fix Things . After all , the military can be relied on to go where it 's told and do what it 's asked to do . In 2012 , 75 percent of Americans told Gallup that they had `` a great deal '' or `` a lot '' of confidence in the military . In contrast , only 37 percent had confidence in the presidency , and a mere 13 percent had confidence in Congress .
As a result , the military has become our go-to tool for fixing whatever happens to be broke . Today , we expect the military to plan agricultural programs in Afghanistan , protect us from cyberattack , sponsor radio talk-shows in Iraq , and run health clinics in Mali . We want the military to deliver humanitarian aid in Japan , collect human intelligence , and convince the Egyptian military to respect democracy . We want the military busy here at home , too , putting out summer forest fires , patrolling New York 's Grand Central Station , and stopping illegal immigration in Arizona .
More and more , we 're funding the military to take on a multitude of tasks that would once have been considered the province of civilian government agencies . Inevitably , this blurs the boundary of just what constitutes a military task and what constitutes a civilian task . Which in turn raises a deeper question : Should we view these developments as the militarization of American foreign policy ( and , increasingly , of domestic policy as well ) ? Or is this phenomenon better understood as something different — as , perhaps , the civilianization of the military , or the metamorphosis of the military into something still unknown , in support of ever-murkier strategic aims ?
To put the question a little differently , in today 's interconnected , globalized world — in which the lines between `` war '' and other kinds of `` security threat '' have blurred , in which it 's harder and harder to distinguish between battlefields and zones of peace , between foreign and domestic , between civilians and combatants — what exactly is the American military ? More to the point , what 's it for ? ( And if the answer is , `` everything , '' then what happens to our longstanding assumptions about civilian control of the military ? )
Unfortunately , even as Americans ask the military to do more and more , we understand it less and less . Military personnel certainly feel misunderstood : in its 2012 annual survey , the Military Times found that more than 75 percent of all active duty personnel and reservists felt that `` The military community has little in common with the rest of the country and most civilians do not understand the military . ''
Many civilians would no doubt say the same , and that 's more than a little disturbing , given the military 's perpetually expanding role . All most civilians really know , in the end , is that the military has more money . And sequestration talk notwithstanding , we seem determined to keep it that way .
He is acknowledged by virtually every law agency on Earth as the world 's number one thief .
Often in his adventures , he and his colleagues , will take it upon themselves to foil other criminals engaged in more crimes .
While first glance may imply our protagonist as fun-loving , flighty , perhaps even `` goofy '' , his surface facade overcoats a brilliant imagination and a thorough knowledge of a hundred varying sciences . Forever extemporizing and reevaluating , he has been responsible for heists no right minded individual would believe possible . His infatuation with F. is perhaps his most significant weakness , as it lands him in undesirable situations most of the time , like arrested and jailed on numerous occasions , typically by his nemesis : The Inspector Z .

Earlier this week , our community 's interest was piqued by the news that a Tibia player had reached level 998 and would soon be ready to open the 'door of mystery ' that can only be accessed at level 999 . We had the opportunity to chat with Lead Product Manager Martin Eglseder about this and much more .
advertisement advertisement
MMORPG : Tibia has such a strong community behind it , can you tell us how the team works with the players to make the best game possible ?
Martin Eglseder : Within our company there is a dedicated Community Management team . This team processes internal information and provides it to the community . On the other hand , the team serves as the voice of the community and represents the players ( for example as stakeholders in design meetings ) . Finally , there are external test servers before one of the two major annual updates is launched . Then , the community managers , developers and members of our dedicated QA team are discussing general aspects and implementation details with parts of the community .
MMORPG : One of your players is actually level 999 and is about to unlock so major end game material with the “ Door of Mystery ” without giving anything away how can you hint at what this might be like ?
ME : We had long discussions about the content behind the level 999 door . We respect that the first player that reached this limit currently does not want to share this secret . However , we can clarify that it is not a whole feature set or package of “ end game ” content .
MMORPG : For those who may not have heard the game is in its 10th year , what have you been doing all these years from the development side to keep players so active in the game ?
ME : Actually , we are double this age , the game will be celebrating its 20th birthday in January 2017 . All the way from the small project of four students up to a long-running MMORPG with hundreds of thousands of active players , CipSoft 's employees have been spending a lot of time and effort to improve the game and keep it interesting . I know that the community has some controversial thoughts about some of the major changes the game ran through during this time . But working for the company now for more than 7 years , I can assure you that every single person working on Tibia does everything in its powers to keep the game alive and rocking , and that all decisions are made to the best of our beliefs .
MMORPG : Your eleventh game update is still in beta , can you tell us what is in store for players when it goes live ?
ME : Version 11.0 is bringing a full new technical base to our major game client . This is necessary to ensure the client can be enhanced and improved with new features for the following decades J . Besides that , we are working on the winter update and are preparing the celebration of 20 years of Tibia in January 2017 .
MMORPG : How are you moving forward with the technology behind the game , seeing that it is ten years old , what has it been like to update the game and keep the back end running smoothly ?
ME : In a complex software system whose components are up to 19 years old , legacy code is always a big issue . That 's the main reason for building the Tibia 11 client . Of course , we always try to refactor and keep the basic components up to date . The truth , however , is that for some of the most critical components a redesign or full refactoring is not economically feasible .
MMORPG : Are there any big lore changes for the game in the near future ? What are your plans moving into the fall and winter months ?
ME : We are constantly evolving the lore and adding parts to the huge content of Tibia . Currently , we are working on a main questline which will bring together some ancient lore parts with a new game mechanic . In agreement with our Community Management team we do not want to spoil more information at this moment . SRY ; )
As it was published earlier at Theregister : Users of anonymising network Tor should definitely update as the man-in-the-middle attack affects Tor clients and relays . Readers may also recognize the name of the chap who , according to HP 's ZDI team , wrote the buggy DTLS code .
Quote :
The OpenSSL team today pushed out fixes for six security vulnerabilities in the widely used crypto library .
These holes include a flaw that enables man-in-the-middle ( MITM ) eavesdropping on encrypted connections , and another that allows miscreants to drop malware on at-risk systems .
A DTLS invalid fragment bug ( CVE-2014-0195 , affects versions 0.9.8 , 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 ) can be used to inject malicious code into vulnerable software on apps or servers . DTLS is more or less TLS encryption over UDP rather than TCP , and is used to secure live streams of video , voice chat and so on .
However , an SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0224 , potentially affects all clients , and servers running 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1 ) is arguably worse , as an advisory from OpenSSL explains :
An attacker using a carefully crafted handshake can force the use of weak keying material in OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers . This can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle ( MITM ) attack where the attacker can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked client and server .
The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client * and * server . OpenSSL clients are vulnerable in all versions of OpenSSL . Servers are only known to be vulnerable in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1 . Users of OpenSSL servers earlier than 1.0.1 are advised to upgrade as a precaution .
Users and administrators are advised to check their systems for updates ; patched builds of OpenSSL are available from the major Linux distros , for instance .
Kikuchi 's logo for the MITM bug
The CVE-2014-0224 MITM bug has existed since the very first release of OpenSSL , according to Masashi Kikuchi , the Japanese security researcher who unearthed the flaw .
“ The good news is that attacks [ exploiting CVE-2014-0224 ] need a man-in-the-middle position against the victim , and that non-OpenSSL clients ( Internet Explorer , Firefox , Chrome on Desktop and iOS , Safari etc ) are n't affected , ” Adam Langley , a senior software engineer at Google , published on his personal blog today .
“ Nonetheless , all OpenSSL users should be updating . ”
The DTLS flaw has also given security experts the fear . “ The OpenSSL DTLS vulnerability dates from April , but was reported today . It may allow remote-code execution ( OpenSSL DTLS is still a nightmare ) , ” noted computer-science professor Matthew Green in a Twitter update .
“ This OpenSSL vuln is an example of the kind of subtle protocol bug that LibreSSL ‘ s ( admirable ) fork is not likely to fix . ”
The OpenSSL.org advisory comes just weeks after the discovery of the infamous Heartbleed vulnerability .
Prof Green reckons none of the bugs would be easy to exploit – the direct opposite of the password-leaking Heartbleed hole .
The other four fixes in today 's batch deal with denial-of-service-style vulnerabilities .
Nicholas J. Percoco , veep of strategic services at vulnerability management firm Rapid7 , said a wide variety of servers and other internet-connected systems will need to be updated to guard against attackers exploiting these now-fixed bugs .
“ The newly disclosed man-in-the-middle vulnerability disclosed in OpenSSL affects all client applications and devices that run OpenSSL when communicating to vulnerable servers of specific versions , but includes the most recent , ” Percoco explained .
“ This likely contains the majority of systems on the internet given most rushed to upgrade OpenSSL after the Heartbleed disclosure in early April of this year . A man-in-the-middle attack is dangerous because it can allow an attacker to intercept data that was presumed encrypted between a client – for example , an end user – and a server – eg , an online bank .
“ This attack is also passive in nature and will may not be detected by the client , server or network-based security controls . ”
Prof Green added that unearthing multiple bugs in OpenSSL was essentially a welcome development , even though it may cause some unscheduled overtime for sysadmins in the short term .
“ The sudden proliferation of OpenSSL bugs is to be expected and a good thing . Like finding dirty socks during spring cleaning , ” he said . ®

Users of anonymising network Tor should definitely update as the man-in-the-middle attack affects Tor clients and relays . Readers may also recognise the name of the chap who , according to HP 's ZDI team , wrote the buggy DTLS code .
LAMBERTVILLE — A 74-year-old man drove up to the New Hope-Lambertville Route 202 Toll Bridge early Thanksgiving afternoon , quickly walked over to the side , and jumped into the Delaware River to his death .
Suicide has not been conclusively determined , but police have identified the deceased as Isaiah Haines , a Southampton man .
The drop from the bridge to the river is normally 53 feet , according to Joe Donnelly , a spokesman with the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission . However , water levels have appeared to be lower recently , he added .
A witness watched Haines drive up in his car , walk over to the railing , and jump off without hesitating , according to State Police Sgt . Adam Grossman .
“ It was pretty quick , ” said Grossman .
The 9-1-1 call from the witness was placed at 1:24 p.m. , the police said . Haines was pulled from the water near an adjoining bridge downstream within 25 minutes by Lambertville water rescue personnel , but he was declared dead at the scene . New Jersey State Police also responded from the Kingwood barracks .
The preliminary investigation pointed toward suicide , but that is not the definitive ruling yet as the police continue the investigation , Grossman said .
The 1,682-foot , 10-span steel-girder and concrete-deck structure bridges the Delaware River and connects Solebury , Pa. with Delaware Township .

Fire , says I , as soon as ye will … I want your Watch and Money ; deliver this Minute , or I 'll fire … I have 12 Slugs in this Piece , and if you do n't deliver this Minute I 'll fire thro ' your Body . '
An account of a highway robbery which took place on Hounslow Heath on 30th January 1733 .
The highway through Egham was a vital route linking London and Windsor with the west of England during the early modern period . Its importance can be seen in two pieces of Tudor legislation . On 18th February 1510 Henry VIII passed an act concerning the maintenance of Staines Bridge . The act described how ‘ carts and horses laden with merchandize ' regularly travelled over the bridge into Egham , as well as ‘ barges coming underneath ' travelling along the Thames . The act ordered between two and four tollkeepers to be stationed on the Staines side of the bridge to collect money from all travellers ; the money would then be used for maintenance and repairs . Another act was passed by his daughter , Elizabeth I , in December 1597 . The new legislation altered the location of the tollkeepers ; two would be on the Staines side , and two on the Egham side . It also reiterated that the toll money they collected should be used for ‘ the reparation and making of the said bridge and causeway ' , and that the tollkeepers would be fined up to £10 if they were found to be negligent in their duties .
Travellers to and from London would inevitably be carrying money with them to pay for the charges and accommodation they encountered along the journey , which left them vulnerable to attacks from highway robbers . The Old Bailey defines highway robbery as ‘ a robbery which took place on or near the King 's Highway ' , which ‘ frequently took place on the outskirts of London ' and were treated with such severity by the courts because they ‘ interfered with the freedom to travel . '
Highway robbery was so common that numerous slang terms emerged referring to both the victims and perpetrators . A wonderful publication called A new dictionary of the canting crew in its several tribes of gypsies , beggers , thieves , cheats etc , written anonymously and published in 1699 , lists several ;
Bandit – defined as a highwayman on horse or foot
Rum-padders – defined as ‘ the better sort of Highwaymen , well Mounted and Armed '
Snaffle – defined as ‘ a Highwayman that has got Booty '
Provender – defined as ‘ he from whom any Money is taken on the Highway '
Surviving court records show that several convictions for highway robberies in Egham took place across the early modern period , although it is likely that more were committed without the cases ever reaching court . Most trials took place at assize courts , which were local and held in the main county towns , but later cases took place in the Old Bailey , London 's central criminal court .
Two early cases of highway robbery in Egham can be seen in the Southwark assize records . On 31st January 1560 William Allen , a yeoman from London , was found guilty of assaulting John Appowell on the highway at Egham on 23rd July 1559 . He stole £4 in money , and a gold signet ring . Allen was found guilty , but his sentence was not recorded . Three years later George Vale , a labourer from Southwark , was also convicted after assaulting and robbing John Hooker in the same place on 24th September 1562 . His victim was clearly a wealthy man , because Vale relieved him of £26 13 shillings and 4 pence in money , as well as his brown horse , valued at £4 . Vale was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging .
On 3rd November 1573 another robbery took place on the highway at Egham , although the case was not brought to trial until 4th October 1575 , at Kingston Assizes . Anthony Cooke , a bargeman from Weybridge , was accused of stealing 6 shillings from an unknown man . He had managed to escape arrest , and the case was presented in absentia . He was eventually put on trial for the crime in July 1576 and found not guilty . We may never know whether or not he did steal the money , but it seems likely that the long period of time between the crime taking place and the trial gave him a real advantage , as it would be hard to prove .
Another case where the defendants managed to escape prosecution took place at Reigate Assizes on 13th April 1596 . Two tailors from London , Edward Whitney and John Wright , were accused of assaulting Ralph Doylie , described as a gentleman , and his servant Thomas Preston , on 1st March , and stealing £7 10 shillings from Doylie . It is not clear why they managed to clear themselves , but they were both found not guilty .
Highway robberies were still taking place a century later . On 7th July 1697 William Cokeley of Englefield was tried at the Old Bailey for robbing the Winchester Waggon when it was passing through Egham on Saturday 29th June . This waggon was run by Thomas Waldren , and set out for Winchester from the Rose Inn on Holborn Bridge every Monday and Thursday . Cokeley was accused of taking ‘ six pound weight of Hair ' worth £20 , ‘ a Silver Tankard , a Watch , and forty Ounces of burnt Silver ' , all the property of George West . Cokelely was caught in Englefield with the stolen items , and he ‘ could not deny but that he had part of the Goods . ' The jury found him guilty , and his punishment was to have his hand branded and be conscripted into military service .
In late February James Mills , who was described in the London Journal as ‘ a Victualler in good business at the Fountain in Stocks-Market ' , and James Spay , ‘ a Poulterer in Leadenhall-Market ' were accused of committing highway robbery . They ‘ attacked a young Lady in her Coach near Egham ' and stole ‘ her Watch , Rings , and Money . ' A more sensational account of the robbery was printed in Applebee 's Original Weekly Journal on 3rd March ;
‘ The Highway Borrowers have furnished 'd us lately with some Remarkables in their way .
The first was on Thursday Sev'nnight last , when two Highwaymen attacked a Lady in her Chariot , on the Road from Egham to Bagshot , and having taken her Watch and Money , were so much in haste for the Earrings , that they either cut them out , or tore them out of her Ears , in a most barbarous manner : The Lady 's Servants , that is to say , the Coachman and Foot Boy , driving the Lady immediately to the next Village , threw off the Harness , and mounting the Coach-Horses , pursued the Rogues , and giving Notice at a Turnpike where they expected they might come , and describing them , they were apprehended . '
The author expressed astonishment that the robbers turned out to be respectable citizens of London . He noted that ‘ At present , they have taken up their Abode in the Marshalsea ' , and were set to be tried at Winchester Assizes , rather than a Surrey court , because the crime had technically been carried out in Hampshire .
A final case of robbery in Egham was heard at the Old Bailey on 8th June 1791 . John Hurst was accused of stealing a linen shirt worth 2 shillings , a pair of worsted stockings worth 4 pence , and a linen handkerchief , also worth 4 pence , belonging to Bernard Clemens of Staines . In his testimony Clemens said he lived in Staines , and had lost the items at approximately 12.30 on 24th April . A man called Thomas Hall was called as a witness , and he revealed that he had travelled across the bridge from Egham to Staines where he met Hurst , and the two went to the Red Lion Inn to enjoy a pint of beer . Hurst offered to sell Hall the shirt , stockings and handkerchief for a shilling , but Hurst was suspicious and asked the innkeeper whether he knew of anyone who had lost those items . The innkeeper said he did , so Hall and two other men detained Hurst on suspicion of theft . In his defence Hurst claimed that he had simply found the items by the side of the road ‘ where some waggons stood all night ' . He was found guilty , fined 1 shilling and imprisoned for 6 months .
By the end of the 18th century highway robberies were rapidly fading . Previously styled the ‘ Gentlemen of the road ' , improvements in transport , policing and banking had deprived the robbers of their lucrative business , and barely any convictions took place during the 19th century . The range of punishments handed out to the individuals explored in this article – from hanging , to branding , to a fine and imprisonment – all reflect the changing fortunes of highway robbers . When they were a common and ever present danger , their punishment was severest . When the threat had almost faded away , the punishment was greatly reduced .

This might sound crazy , but what if we tried cutting taxes for the rich ? ( AP Photo/Steve Helber )
A specter is haunting the Republican Party—the specter of Ronald Reagan 's tax cuts .
For the last 35 years , the GOP has monomaniacally focused on lowering taxes on the rich . It 's one part economic theory , and another party political mythology . The theory is that letting high-earners keep more of their money gives them the incentive to make and invest even more , which creates growth that benefits everybody . And the political mythology is that this is what made Reagan so popular . ( Never mind that then-Fed chair Paul Volcker 's rate cuts , more than Reagan 's tax cuts , led to `` Morning in America '' ) . That 's why , no matter what the problem , Republicans insist that government is not the solution ; tax cuts for the wealthy are .
There 's only one hitch : none of this is really true . Sure , incentives matter . But so do other things . Indeed , the economy grew faster after Bill Clinton raised the top rate to 39.6 percent than it did when Reagan cut it to 28 percent . Not only that , but , adjusted for inflation , stagnant median wages the past 25 years show that tax cuts for the rich have not , in fact , trickled down . So it 's no surprise that `` supply-side economics '' has n't been a political winner since the 1980s . Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections , and no , that 's not because they have n't promised deep enough tax cuts . Mitt Romney , you might remember , ran on bringing the top marginal rate down to the same sacrosanct level it was when Reagan left office .
It 's time , some Republicans think , for the Party to confront the reality that it 's not 1980 anymore . For one , there is n't as much bang for the tax-cutting buck when you bring rates from 40 to 25 percent as there was when Reagan brought them from 70 to 28 percent . For another , cutting the federal income tax does n't help the 40 percent or so of households that do n't pay it . And , finally , you ca n't blithely assume that growth will eventually reach the middle class when it has n't for decades . In other words , we have different problems today that demand different solutions than 35 years ago .
What kind of policies ? Well , reform conservatives—or `` reformicons '' —want what they call family-friendly tax reform . Now , this still involves cutting the top marginal rate from 39.6 to 35 percent . But rather than trying to cut it even further , they want to expand the Child Tax Credit by $ 2,500 instead . The idea , as former Treasury official Robert Stein explains , is to help middle-class parents and try to get them to have more kids . This , though , has its own problems . The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center calculates that Senator Mike Lee 's version of this plan would increase deficits by $ 2.4 trillion over 10 years . The way it structures the Child Tax Credit means it 'd be worth more to upper-middle class parents than to poor ones . And it would still help the top 1 percent—and , particularly , the top 0.1 percent—more than anybody else .
But , as you can see below , it would n't help the top 1 percent nearly as much as Romney 's plan would have . In a way , it 's the policy that dare not speak its name : compassionate conservatism .
Indeed , George W. Bush 's formula of tax cuts for the rich and tax credits for the rest is the only one that 's been able to get Republicans elected the past 20 years .
But the supply-side Jacobins are having none of it . `` I 'm a classic growth conservative , '' Rep. Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) told John McCormack of the Weekly Standard , who `` believe [ s ] that the best way to help families , the best way to help the economy is to reduce rates across the board '' rather than expanding the Child Tax Credit instead . Daniel Mitchell of the Cato Institute downplays the idea that giving middle-class families more money even helps them , and says Republicans should keep focusing on cutting tax rates . And Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal thinks that the Lee plan is just a `` capitulation to the left 's inequality and middle-class talking points '' that ignores the timeless lessons of , you guessed it , Ronald Reagan .
Now , for the most part , the reformicons and the supply-siders are polite to each other . But do n't mistake this agreeableness for agreement . Aside from monetary policy , the biggest schism between the reformicons and the rest of the Republicans is over taxes . That 's because if the Party stays with its tax-cuts-for-the-rich-solve-all-problems philosophy , there wo n't be much money left for anything else . They wo n't be able to change their message . So the biggest question for 2016 is which side the GOP 's presidential candidate chooses in this debate .
In other words , whether the Republicans will keep running on Reagan , or something else .
Cream Cheese Brownies
Next to the combination of chocolate and peanut butter , there are few combinations that I love more than chocolate and cream cheese . Whether it 's in the form of a cheesecake , or something like these brownies , I swoon . I love how the richness of the chocolate is cut with the cool creaminess of the cream cheese . I have been wanted to find a perfect cream cheese brownie recipe for the longest time , and finally made it my mission this week to get it done . These brownies are an amazing blend of rich brownie and perfectly creamy cheesecake . In fact , there are very much the exact inverse of the Brownie Mosaic Cheesecake . Instead of a cheesecake with chunks of brownie in it , here we have brownies with swirls of cheesecake . Such a lovely little ying and yang .
This is a basic brownie recipe that is layered with a cream cheese filling , and then marbled to create layers and swirls of cheesecake within the brownie . It 's the prettiest version of this type of brownie that I think I 've seen . I love them !
A word of caution : be very careful not to overbake these . I would recommend checking them about 5 minutes before they were supposed to be done . I usually do that , but got a little sidetracked , so these baked for the minimum time ( 50 minutes ) and they were a little too done – the toothpick test came out clean , when ideally it comes out with moist crumbs when you 're dealing with brownies . So just a heads-up that you may want to check on them a little early . Otherwise , enjoy every sinful bite of decadence !

President Trump does not plan to fire special counsel Robert Mueller in response to charges brought against three former Trump campaign aides , the White House said on Monday .
`` There is no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel , '' White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters .
Sanders also said there have been no conversations at the White House about potential pardons for those charged .
“ I think we should let the process play through before we start looking at that , ” she said .
Trump 's former campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , and Manafort 's business associate , Rick Gates , have been charged on 12 counts , including illegal foreign lobbying , tax evasion and bank fraud .
Separately , former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to federal investigators about conversations he had with a Russian professor about thousands of emails purportedly containing `` dirt '' about Trump 's Democratic rival , Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders : ' I fully expect ' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed ' 2016 primary Sanders : 'Damn right ' I 'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes ' Former Sanders campaign spokesman : Clinton staff are 'biggest a -- holes in American politics ' MORE . Papadopoulos was first charged in July .
The charges stemmed from special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and have provoked speculation that Trump may fire Mueller .
The White House , however , sought to separate itself from those charged on Monday .
Sanders said Trump had not spoken to Manafort since the inauguration and noted that the indictment against him does not mention the president or his campaign . She also cast Papadopoulos as a low-level volunteer .
`` This individual was the member of a volunteer counsel that met one time over the course of a year , ” she said . “ He was part of a list that was read out in The Washington Post . … He was not paid by the campaign . He was a volunteer on a counsel that met once . ''

The Supreme Court has opted to conduct an oral argument on a petition that seeks to stop the burial of the late strongman Ferdinand E. Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani .
Oral argument is set on Aug. 24 .

The high court also ordered the respondents military , Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and the Marcos heirs to comment on the petition within a non-extendible period of five days .
The high court issued the order following a petition filed by human rights victims during the martial law years .
In their petition , they urged the high court to nullify memorandum dated Aug. 7 , 2016 issued by Lorenzana ordering Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff General Ricardo R. Visaya to start the preparations for the interment and the transfer of Marcos ' remains to the Libingan .
The petitioners said respondents committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in ordering and allowing Marcos ' burial at the Libingan .
Petitioners include former party-list Representatives Satur Ocampo and Neri Colmenares as well as Trinidad Repuno , Bienvenido Lumbera , Bonifacio Ilagan , Maria Carolina Araulo , Samahan ng Ex-Detainees laban sa Detensyon at Aresto represented by Dionito Cabillas , Carmencita Florentino , Rodolfo Del Rosario , Felix Dalisay and Danilo Dela Fuente .

“ For how can such honesty and integrity be promoted and defended when a dishonest and disgraced public official , such as Ferdinand E.Marcos , after his removal from power , can snatch respect and thereby rewrite not only history but his culpability via the back door of declaring and celebrating him a hero , ” the petition stated .
“ The public respondent 's decision to re-furbish the tattered image of Ferdinand E. Marcos also goes against the constitutional precept that corruption , just like the ill-gotten wealth that it spawns , is never forgotten and hence the action against its rich proceeds never prescribes , ” it added .
“ In fact , the reverse is true and Marcos is not qualified under any law or guideline . While Marcos was a former President of the Philippines and a soldier who allegedly valiantly fought during World War II , a claim that is a more concocted self-serving and grandiose fable than a fact the interment of his remains at the Libingan ng mga Bayani is contrary to law , ” they said .

During the martial law years , thousands were arrested , tortured and summarily executed .
The petitioners said the country 's experience under the Marcos dictatorship “ should not be emulated and can not serve as an inspiration to this generation and to the next generation of Filipinos. ” RAM/rga

Please turn on JavaScript . Media requires JavaScript to play . The National Identity Card scheme will be abolished within 100 days with all cards becoming invalid , Home Secretary Theresa May has said . Legislation to axe the scheme will be the first put before parliament by the new government - with a target of it becoming law by August . The 15,000 people who voluntarily paid £30 for a card since the 2009 roll out in Manchester will not get a refund . Ms May said ID cardholders would at least have a `` souvenir '' of the scheme . TIMELINE July 2002 : Plans unveiled November 2004 : ID cards bill March 2006 : Act becomes law November 2009 : Cards available May 2010 : Scheme scrapped
Full timeline : ID cards Q & A : Identity cards The Labour scheme was aimed at tackling fraud , illegal immigration and identity theft - but it was criticised for being too expensive and an infringement of civil liberties . The cards were designed to hold personal biometric data on an encrypted chip , including name , a photograph and fingerprints . The supporting National Identity Register was designed to hold up to 50 pieces of information . The cards already in circulation will remain legal until Parliament has passed the legislation to abolish them and the register . The short abolition bill will be pushed through Parliament as quickly as possible with the aim of cards being invalid by 3 September . Anyone who has a card or has to deal with them , such as airport security officials , will be told the termination date in writing . Once the cards are illegal , the National Identity Register will be `` physically destroyed '' , say ministers . Some 60 people who were working on the scheme for the Identity and Passport Service in Durham have lost their jobs . Ms May said : `` This bill is a first step of many that this government is taking to reduce the control of the state over decent , law-abiding people and hand power back to them . With swift Parliamentary approval , we aim to consign identity cards and the intrusive ID card scheme to history within 100 days . '' £800m saving Officials are renegotiating two contracts worth £650m with companies who had agreed to deliver parts of the scheme . It 's not clear how much the government will need to pay compensation , but officials say there is no `` poisoned pill '' in the deals and they expect to save £86m once all exit costs are met . 'DO N'T TAKE AWAY MY ID ' I paid £30 for this identity card and I certainly would have paid £75 for it because of the advantages it has given me
John Kirby , one of the 15,000 ID cardholders
'Why I love my ID card ' Some £250m was spent on developing the national ID programme over eight years and its abolition will mean the government will avoid spending a further £800m over a decade . Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett unveiled plans for an identity card scheme in July 2002 . By February 2010 , the scheme 's costs over its lifetime had ballooned to an estimated £4.5bn . Despite the demise of the national identity card , a separate but technically similar scheme for some foreign nationals will continue . That scheme , run by the UK Border Agency , is still being rolled out . Immigration minister Damian Green said the scheme was an EU obligation and that the previous Labour government had rolled it into the main ID card programme . Some 200,000 of these cards , now known as biometric resident permits , have already been given to migrant workers , foreign students and family members from outside the European Economic Area . British passports are about to be upgraded to a new international security standard but additional proposals to put more biometric information on in the future have also been axed .

Carter Page , an adviser once linked to Donald Trump 's presidential campaign , confirmed to MSNBC 's Chris Hayes Thursday that he met with Russia 's ambassador to the U.S. at last year 's Republican convention .
USA Today reported Thursday that Page met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a diplomacy conference at the Republican National Convention last year , a meeting that involved other ambassadors and which was described as not unusual .
`` I 'm not going to deny that I talked with him , '' Page , who was once named by Trump as part of his foreign policy committee during the campaign , said on `` All In With Chris Hayes . ''
`` I will say that I never met him anywhere outside of Cleveland , let 's just say that much , '' Page said .
He declined to say what the discussions were about , citing confidentiality agreements and agreements to event organizers . `` I 'm respectful to confidentiality rules , whether it 's in government or outside of it , '' he said .

The questions about Russia come amid scrutiny over contacts with people linked to Trump 's administration or campaign and officials in Russia . U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia was involved in an operation to interfere in last year 's election .
Another adviser named in the USA Today report , J.D . Gordon , told the newspaper the meeting in Cleveland with Kislyak was not unusual . `` I 'd consider it an informal conversation just like my interactions with dozens of other ambassadors and senior diplomats in Cleveland , '' Gordon said .
Page was among several Trump associates named in a New York Times report in January that said law enforcement and intelligence investigators were looking into any possible links between Russian officials and Trump associates .

Page traveled to Moscow to give a commencement speech last summer . Asked if he ever served as a liaison between the Trump campaign and Russian officials , Page said , `` absolutely not . ''
Page said he has given speeches at some of Moscow 's top universities dozens of times in the past , and lived there for three years . He called the invitation to speak at a commencement not unusual .
He said on MSNBC that he spoke with some scholars and professors and students , but as far as he knows no one involved in Russian intelligence services , and he said “ there was nothing specific or really worth discussing that was brought up at the time . ”
A Kremlin spokesman told a Russian news agency in December that there was no contact between Page and the government .

In March 2016 , Trump named Page as a candidate for his campaign 's foreign policy team . But in January , Trump 's incoming press secretary , Sean Spicer , said : `` Carter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know , and was put on notice months ago by the campaign . ''
On Thursday , Page said he was part of a named committee that was put together , but did not ever directly brief Trump .
Page would not say how he became affiliated with the Trump campaign , but denied a report in Politico in September that suggested that it may have been arranged by the chief of staff of Jeff Sessions , a then-senator who is now attorney general .
`` I can confirm that is not the case , '' Page said . He would n't say how he ended up named by Trump .
`` If I started naming names there would be literally dozens of reporters within the next hour calling each of those individuals , '' Page said . `` I 'm just respectful to individuals who are colleagues . ''
Trump 's former national security adviser , Michael Flynn , resigned last month after misleading Vice President Mike Pence and others about conversations he had with Russia 's ambassador before Trump took office . Trump said Flynn did nothing wrong , but “ I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence . ”
On Thursday , Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would recuse himself in any federal investigation involving the Trump campaign , which he supported .
Sessions made the announcement after coming under fire for not disclosing in his confirmation hearing that he met with the Russian ambassador during the campaign .
Sessions said he understood the question at the confirmation hearing to be about contacts regarding the campaign , and said he should have answered differently .

Despite being tens of millions of years old , some beetle fossils appear almost as they did in life . Not only are their shape and structure preserved , but so are the actual colors of their shells , which have changed only slightly in the intervening eons .
Though relatively little-known , these fossils represent the purest of biological colors retrieved from deep time , far richer than much-celebrated pigment traces of dinosaur plumage and more varied than the hues of a few ancient plants .
In a study published Sept. 27 in Proceedings of the Royal Society B , researchers led by Yale University paleogeologist Maria McNamara analyzed 10 of these spectacular beetle fossils , ranging from 15 million to 47 million years old , which owe their enduring shades to the phenomenon of structural coloration . Unlike pigments , which generate color from light bouncing off a chemical , structural colors are produced by the interaction of light with nanometer-scale surface geometries .
If especially fine-grained sediments replace a dead beetle 's decomposing body , the resulting fossil should replicate its hues , too . `` Structural colors do n't need chemicals at all , '' said McNamara . `` What we wanted to find out was , what kind of structures in the fossils make the color ? And are the colors we 're seeing today in the fossils the same as when beetles were alive millions of years ago ? ''
McNamara 's team took .00008 millimeter-wide samples of the fossils ' surfaces , too small to see unaided but enough to determine surface shape when viewed under an electron microscope . From that shape , they used models derived from modern beetle shells to calculate how the fossils ought to look . Prediction and reality did n't quite match : According to their calculations , the fossils now appear just slightly more reddish than they ought to . The fossils do n't perfectly replicate the beetle 's original carapaces , and subtly change how light refracts as it passes through shell layers .
`` You need to mentally redshift the color . If it 's green , it 's actually a little more on the yellow side . If it 's blue , it 's a little greener , '' said McNamara , who next plans to analyze the colors of moth fossils .
`` Holding these fossils is amazing , '' she said . `` But what I really get a kick out of is investigating the details that are preserved on such a tiny scale . It 's one thing to look at a colored fossil beetle , but quite another to realize the level of preservation extends right down to the level of structures that are smaller than a cell . ''
On the following pages are examples of the fossils and their structures .

About 12,000 people gathered in Warsaw , Poland , to protest changes made by the governing Law and Justice party , which the opposition believes curb freedom and democracy . Photo by Radek Pietruszka/EPA
May 6 ( UPI ) -- Thousands of opposition demonstrators gathered in Poland on Saturday to protest changes to made by the governing party they said are undemocratic .
Police said about 12,000 people attended the `` Freedom March '' in Warsaw , in which members of the opposition accused the governing Law and Justice party of making changes to curb political challenges and consolidate power .
A major cause for the unrest occurred when the Law and Justice party made changes to Poland 's Constitutional Tribunal , the nation 's highest court , requiring a two-thirds majority of the 15 judges to support a ruling for it to be valid , making it more difficult to strike down laws passed by the ruling party .
The European Council said the changes endangered the rule of law and launched an investigation , which is expected to yield a report at the end of the month .

The council also said a new government power to appoint the heads of public television and radio stations may jeopardize the values of the European Union .
Law and Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said `` only a total failure to see reality '' would lead someone to believe freedom in Poland was being threatened .
`` We have a democracy , everyone can have their opinion , everyone can protest , everyone can vote as they please , everyone can write what they want , we completely guarantee it , '' he said .
Grzegorz Schetyna of the Civic Platform , a group opposed to Kaczynski , said his defense was `` not true and we know it , '' and said the march would lead to freedom and an election win .
`` We are for a democratic Poland , for a European Poland , for a Poland that is proud , that seeks friends and partners , not enemies in Europe as it is today , '' he told protesters .
Unlike in Iraq , where domestic political pressure gave Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki reason to resist a continued American military presence into 2012 , in Afghanistan , President Hamid Karzai and his senior aides have expressed an initial willingness to continue a partnership with the United States that includes counterterrorism missions and training .
Senior American officials have also expressed a desire to keep some training and counterterrorism troops in Afghanistan past 2014 . The transition plan for the next three years in Afghanistan could be a model for such a continued military relationship .
The new focus builds on a desire to use the nation 's most elite troops to counter any residual terrorist threat over the coming months as well as to devote the military 's best trainers to the difficult task of preparing Afghan security forces to take over responsibilities in their country .
The plan would put a particularly heavy focus on Army Special Forces , also known as the Green Berets . They would be in charge of training a variety of Afghan security forces . At the same time , the elite commando teams within Special Operations forces would continue their raids to hunt down , capture or kill insurgent commanders and terrorist leaders and keep pressure on cells of fighters to prevent them from mounting attacks .
Created by President John F. Kennedy in the 1960s , the Green Berets have as one of their core missions what is called “ foreign internal defense ” — using combat , mentoring , language and cross-cultural skills to train local forces in rugged environments , as they are today in missions conducted quietly in dozens of nations around the world .
Just as significant would be what the American military 's conventional forces stop doing .
Americans would no longer be carrying out large numbers of patrols to clear vast areas of Afghanistan of insurgents , or holding villages and towns vulnerable to militant attacks while local forces and government agencies rebuilt the local economy and empowered local governments .
Those tasks would fall to Afghan forces , with Special Forces soldiers remaining in the field to guide them . This shift has already begun to take place .

The defense secretary , Leon E. Panetta , surprised NATO allies last week when he announced that American forces would step back from a leading role in combat missions by mid-2013 , turning over security responsibilities to Afghan forces a year earlier than expected . The description of the shift to a Special Operations mission in Afghanistan by senior officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the final plans have not been approved , go a long way toward explaining what Mr. Panetta sketched out for the allies .

White House officials confirmed in broad terms the shift to a Special Operations mission , and said a formal announcement on the future of the mission was expected at the May summit meeting of NATO leaders in Chicago .
“ The president said in June that when the drawdown of surge forces is complete in September , U.S. troops will continue coming home at a steady pace and our mission will shift from combat to support as the Afghans take the lead , ” said Tommy Vietor , the National Security Council spokesman .
The United States has about 90,000 troops in Afghanistan , with 22,000 of them expected to leave by this fall . No schedule has been set for the pace of withdrawal for the 68,000 American troops who will remain , although some administration officials are advocating for Mr. Obama to order another reduction by the summer of 2013 .
The planning for a transition of the Afghanistan mission is a central effort among the Pentagon 's civilian planners and the military 's Joint Staff , as well as among officers at the United States Central and Special Operations Commands .
Senior Pentagon officials involved in the planning acknowledge that a military effort with a smaller force and a more focused mission could be easier to explain to Americans who have tired of the large counterinsurgency campaigns of Iraq and , previously , Afghanistan .
To be sure , some American conventional units would be called on to handle logistics and other support services — transportation , medical care , security — to enable the Special Operations missions to continue .
But that would require a far smaller American presence to help the Afghans protect recent security gains while minimizing American expenses and casualties .
The plan first calls for creating a two-star command position overseeing the entire Special Operations effort in Afghanistan . Next , the three-star corps headquarters that currently commands the day-to-day operations of the war — and is held by an Army officer from the conventional force — would be handed over to a Special Operations officer .

Officials said that no final decisions had been made on the timing of the transition , although it is likely to begin late this year as the rest of the surge forces are withdrawn . There has also been no decision on the number of troops to be committed to the mission as it evolves in 2013 and into 2014 , officials said .
Officials noted the progress in creating new “ Afghan Strike Force ” units to carry out commando-type raids , and they said that the effort to create an Afghan National Army — which had been focused on building as large a force as possible — would shift to emphasize quality and capability .
Officials conceded that the Afghan National Police program remained a huge disappointment , but said that a great value in American investment had been organizing local Afghan police units , drawn from the villages they are assigned to protect .
A small Syracuse stationary company wanted to hold a contest on Pinterest for its customers . Instead , it 's been inundated with spam—and is helpless to do anything about it .
Bella Figura Letterpress invited more than 180 Pinterest users to pin to its Do Good in March collaboration board . However , a glance at the board reveals just one good deed … and multiple photos of random affiliate links from spammers .
Since Pinterest does n't give the owner of a collaboration board special privileges , the small business ca n't remove these spam links without Pinterest 's help . And Pinterest is n't helping .
Bella Figura wrote :
“ We reported these on Friday morning , just after they started appearing , and also removed the spammers from this board . The pins have n't disappeared yet . In fact , more have appeared . Sad … but hopefully Pinterest will get this under control . We 're hoping to make this board more uplifting but need their cooperation ! ”
Pinterest 's collaboration option is supposed to make it easy to pin to a board with multiple contributors . However , holes in the feature make it a prime tool for exploitation .
The Daily Dot has already covered the ways that you can use collaboration boards to hijack big name pinners , including the President . Simply add these big names to your shared boards . Since Pinterest wo n't wait for their consent first , it will appear as if these users are promoting your boards .
Now , we 've discovered a new loophole that shows hijacking can go both ways . Pinthusiast Claire Isabel Hutchinson tipped us off to how Bella Figura 's shared board was rendered a spam free-for-all .
“ I am guessing a lot of people have n't thought about how to really run a competition on Pinterest or the problem of letting people pin on your board ! ” Hutchinson told the Daily Dot . “ You can not remove the pins that are pinned by another contributor on a board that you set up and let others contribute to . ”
More experienced Pinterest users are already aware of the problem . Drew Hawkins , the founder of Board of Man , has 200,000 followers for his board , butonly 26 contributors , all of whom he knows personally . To keep things under control , he invites strangers to tag their own pins with # menofpinterest to get his attention .
Likewise , Modcloth , an online retailer of women 's vintage clothing , allows users to email pins to their Guest Pinner Gallery instead of joining it outright .
Some brands have already discovered a spam-free option for holding a contest . Instead of inviting users to pin to the brand 's board , it asks users to design and submit their own boards to the contest . Better Homes and Gardens and Lands End has both embraced this approach .
As Pinterest only gets larger , spammers are becoming more of a problem . Online security firm Trend Micro 's TrendLabs lists a few of Pinterest 's most popular scams on its Malware Blog . If you see a pin that looks too good to be true , click the “ Report Pin ” button on the side of the image .

Croatia has opened its border with Serbia , removing one of the bottlenecks for thousands of stranded migrants trying to make their way north .
About 3,000 people had been stuck in cold and wet weather in the Serbian border village of Berkasovo , after Croatia moved to curb new arrivals .
The UN refugee agency ( UNHCR ) had described conditions there as `` dire '' .
Many remain stranded near the Croatia-Slovenia border . The Balkan route has been squeezed by restrictions .
Hundreds of thousands of migrants , many from Syria , Africa and Afghanistan , have been making their way from Turkey to the Balkans in recent months , in a bid to reach Germany , Sweden and other EU states .
UNHCR spokeswoman Melita Sunjic , who is at the Berkasovo crossing , said late on Monday : `` Without any announcement , the borders opened . Everybody rushed . ''
Describing the conditions at the camp there earlier , she had said : `` We have a lot of small children . We have disabled people , we have people who got sick on the road .
`` This is not a place for people , they ca n't sleep - they can just stand upright in the mud . ''
Croatian buses are now taking the thousands of migrants who crossed the border to a nearby reception centre .

Croatia moved to limit the flow of migrants at the weekend , when Hungary closed its southern border and Slovenia announced its own restrictions , fuelling fears that migrants could get stuck in Croatia .
In recent days , Croatia sent at least two trains and several busloads of migrants north towards the border with Slovenia .
However Slovenian officials have accused the Croatian government of breaking an agreement to limit such transfers to 2,500 people a day , and have announced new restrictions on people coming in .

Guy Delauney , BBC News , Trnovec , Slovenia
The small border crossing at Trnovec became a picture of human misery , with hundreds stranded in no man 's land in bone-numbingly cold rain . They had arrived in the early hours of Monday to find a line of police and barriers blocking their way into Slovenia .
Authorities and aid agencies seemed completely unprepared . There were no tents or shelter of any kind for the migrants , who included a large number of young children and babies .
People pulled branches from trees to light fires and turned a rubbish skip on its side for a little protection from the elements .
When the Red Cross belatedly arrived , they persuaded Croatian police to allow people to shelter under the border crossing 's metal canopy . But with little sign of being allowed through to Slovenia or even back into Croatia , a chant of `` You kill us '' started echoing around the facility .
`` Shame on whoever is responsible for this , '' one Syrian man told the BBC . `` I wish I could go back to Syria , '' said a young woman .

Crisis in graphics : Migration numbers explained
About 500 people spent Sunday night in the open in the Slovenian border village of Trnovec .
A further 1,800-2,000 slept on a train held on the Croatian side of the border . Officials told them they could stay temporarily in Croatia or try to make their own way into Slovenia .
Hungary , citing security concerns , has closed its borders with Serbia and Croatia , forcing migrants to switch to a slower route via Slovenia .
Before Monday 's mass crossing , the UNHCR said 10,000 migrants were stranded in Serbia - with more than 6,000 entering from Macedonia on Monday alone .
Some Serbian officials have indicated they may in turn hold back arrivals from the south .
Germany 's welcome for Syrian migrants continues to create internal tensions . Thousands of people took part in a rally organised by the Pegida organisation in Dresden on Monday evening to mark the first anniversary of the group , which campaigns against `` Islamisation '' .
More than 600,000 people , most of them Syrians , have reached Europe so far this year compared with just over 200,000 for the whole of 2014
Germany has said it expects 800,000 asylum seekers this year , but it is believed the number could be as high as 1.5 million .
A note on terminology : The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum . This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria , who are likely to be granted refugee status , as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives , who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants .

According to local media reports , people were lined up as early as 6:30am this morning . Thousands could n't even get in to the filled venue .
WILKES-BARRE TWP . – Donald Trump took the stage to a cheering , capacity crowd at the Mohegan Sun Arena around 7:30 p.m. Monday .
“ We love Wilkes-Barre , ” Trump said , opening his remarks . “ This place is unbelievable . ”
Trump immediately said his son reminded him to immediately tell the crowd he supports the area natural gas and coal industries . “ This is my last stop . Tomorrow is the election , ” Trump said . A win in Pennsylvania will help him get closer to the Republican nomination .
“ We 're going to make American great again , ” he said . Trump was quick to quick praise local congressmen Lou Barletta and Tom Marino . “ Lou and Tom , Lou and Tom . Get them up here ( on stage ) . If you could get them down here . What great guys , from the beginning , ” Trump said .
Trump noted there were 6,000 people outside the area who could n't make it in . Trump 's speech lasted approximately 52 minutes , closing out the rally at approximately 8:20 p.m .
As the raucous crowd cheered him on at the end , Trump reminded them to vote for him and his delegates .
“ I had no idea you were going to be so beautiful . In a packed arena with thousands of people trying to get in , we had a great time . You 're going to represent the great state of Pennsylvania , which I love . When you look back … you 're going to say that was the single greatest vote I ever cast , President Donald Trump , ”
Barletta and Marino rallied the crowd prior to Trump 's speech . Trump has funded his own campaign and is n't controlled by lobbyists and the ingrained political establishment , Barletta said .
“ They ca n't buy him . They wo n't control him . He 'll you 'll bring your voice to Washington , ” Barletta said . “ This is a movement and you are a part of it . “ Together , we 're going to make America great again ” Barletta said Trump is strong on his signature issue : illegal immigration .
“ I believe Donald Trump when he said he 's going to secure the border and finally stop illegal immigration , ” Barletta said . “
Marino , one of the first people in Congress to endorse Trump , said Trump is the only candidate who can beat Hillary Clinton .
“ Donald Trump has brought together millions of people because he 's not a Washington insider , ” Marino said .
Before Marino 's speech , he told The Citizens ' Voice he , Barletta and others helped bring Trump to speak in the area .
“ This is a great way to segue into a big victory he ' going to have in Pennsylvania . It 's a great way to kick it off , ” Marino said .
The arena is packed with thousands of people , many crowded in front of the standing-room-only area around the stage . ( read more )

ANTI-TERROR legislation being planned by the UK Government has been condemned as Orwellian , draconian , repressive and a direct threat to freedom of speech .
Under the Home Office proposals , staff at pre-school nurseries would be required to monitor children for signs of radicalism . Speakers at universities would be vetted for any signs of extremist views that would support or encourage terrorism .
Colleges and universities would have to provide details to the authorities of who is due to speak at least two weeks before they are due to appear . It would enable background checks to be carried out to find out if they have promoted extremism .
They must also provide advance notice of the content , including an outline of the topics to be covered . It also suggests , where appropriate , universities should have protocols to pool information about speakers .
The plans are outlined in a consultative document which accompanies Home Secretary Theresa May 's Counterterrorism and Security Bill .
However , the proposals face a growing backlash . Scotland 's children 's commissioner Tam Baillie warned , if passed , they could split communities .
In a letter in today 's Herald , Mr Baillie , Jackie Brock , chief executive of Children in Scotland , Maggie Simpson , who heads the Scottish Childminding Association , Jean Carwood-Edwards of the Scottish Pre-School Play Association said it could impact on how staff work with children .
They said : `` Among many staff members caring for and working with children , these duties would fall on , for example , the childminder of a three-year-old and the nursery teacher of a two-year-old .
They called on ministers to publish any evidence justifying the view that children attending Scottish childminders , nurseries , out of school clubs , schools , and other settings pose any threat of becoming radicalised .
`` If , as we suspect , such evidence does n't exist , the new duties seem wholly unnecessary '' , they say , adding that if any such radicalisation did arise Scottish laws and policy would already enable it to be addressed .
It added : `` They will distance and alienate certain families and communities from services that are there to help them , not spy on them , '' the letter says . ''
Ms Brock said she believed the proposals contravened the United Nations convention on the rights of the Child , while placing service providers in an extremely invidious position .
She said that as well as councils , the NHS and prison services , the bill would apply to early years settings , schools , out of school clubs and holiday schemes for disabled children .
She added : `` We suspect that the proposed duty is , in reality , aimed at parents and carers of children and young people , thus placing staff in services to be covered by the duty in the invidious position of being asked to observe and assess adults as well as children and young people . ''
Mazhar Khan of the Muslim Council of Scotland described the measures as `` quite bizarre and frankly impractical . ''
He said `` For the Government to push this draconian law through while preaching to Muslims the importance of freedom of speech , is quite bizarre . ''
He said it was also clearly impractical . Anyone could quite easily submit something very different to what they intended to say on the day .
`` Any person suspected of being a potential hate preacher should be proscribed based on their history , not through these types of ridiculous methods , `` he said .
The Free Church of Scotland was one of the first to highlight their concerns over the wider implications
Rev David Robertson , who becomes Free Church of Scotland Moderator in May and is a part-time Dundee University chaplain , described the plans as a `` dangerous and repressive attack on freedom of speech and civil liberties .
`` To require all visiting speakers to submit their talks a fortnight in advance so they can be vetted against political correctness is Big Brother Orwellian stuff . ''
He said if these requirements were introduced , a sermon for Christmas carol service in a university union would have to be scrutinised .
A spokeswoman for Universities Scotland , which represents higher education institutions north of the Border , said : `` We believe there is a need for greater clarity around and scrutiny of the new powers this Bill would give to the Home Secretary and a need for further consideration of the statutory guidance that universities would be required to follow . ''
MPs and peers have already warned Ms May that the plans seriously restrict academic freedom of speech .
Dr Hywel Francis MP , chair of the UK Parliament 's Joint Human Rights Commitee said earlier this month the plans were 'surely counter-productive '
The guidance document states : `` Universities must take seriously their responsibility to exclude those promoting extremist views that support or are conducive to terrorism . ''
It continues : `` We would expect the policies and procedures on speakers and events to include at least the following : Sufficient notice of booking ( generally at least 14 days ) to allow for checks to be made and cancellation to take place if necessary ; Advance notice of the content of the event , including an outline of the topics to be discussed and sight of any presentations , footage to be broadcast etc . ''
The Home Office says such provisions are required to `` ensure that poisonous , divisive ideologies are not allowed to spread , including through our universities . ''
A spokesman insisted : `` There is no contradiction between promoting freedom of speech and safeguarding the interests and well-being of students , staff and the wider community . Universities UK already provides guidance to help institutions develop extremist speaker policies . ''
He added the measures would ensure the strategy was delivered to a consistent standard across the country .
`` This is particularly important in areas where terrorism is of the most concern but we are clear that all areas need to understand the local threat and take action to address it . ''
A Scottish Government spokeswoman said : `` We need to ensure that any new UK Government proposals fit with what is a separate and distinct Scottish legal system , respects the current devolution arrangements and are taken in the context of proper engagement and consultation with the public bodies who would be affected by these proposals in Scotland. ``

As they returned home to Germany this past week from a South American tour and made ready to head out over the next month on a slew of European dates including festival stops at Under the Black Moon , Riff Ritual , and Desertfest in London and their native Berlin , Samsara Blues Experiment came one step closer to the release of their fourth full-length , One with the Universe . The album — confirmed for a May 12 release through Electric Magic Records with cover art by Michel Bassot newly unveiled below — arrives four years after the third Samsara Blues Experiment outing , Waiting for the Flood ( review here ) , and finds the band pared down to a trio for the first time on a studio offering , returning to activity after several years away following a prolific run between 2009 and 2013 , and embarking on some of their boldest and most progressive arrangements to date .
I have n't heard One with the Universe in its entirety yet — as of this weekend , the master was still being finalized — but today I have the extreme pleasure of hosting the premiere of the 10-minute opening track , “ Vipassana , ” for your ( and my ) streaming enjoyment . Obviously , its my basis for the assessment above about the arrangements , and as the song plays through its jam-based course , one can hear that coming through in the synth provided by guitarist/vocalist Christian Peters , joined in the three-piece by drummer Thomas Vedder and bassist Hans Eiselt . At the same time , to go along with the core warmth of low end and natural push of the toms at the start and the airy guitar and echoing vocals that accompany , there also emerges some weightier tonality in the chorus that hits with a more aggressive underlying vibe . Dare I say “ doomly ? ” I wo n't guess how it plays out across the span of One with the Universe , which runs just under 47 minutes , but along with the synth sprawl that starts at about the halfway point , it 's something that turned my head listening to “ Vipassana . ”
I 'll hope to have a review up sometime between now and the May 12 release date , so I 'll save some of the rambling for that , but the name of the song , if you 're wondering , refers to the Buddhist notion of insight into the true nature of reality . Not exactly a toss-off scale on which to begin an album . Such purposes are welcome from Samsara Blues Experiment , who recorded the likewise ambitiously-titled One with the Universe with former bassist Richard Behrens ( also of Heat ) , who also helmed the last outing . One looks forward to hearing how this spiritual searching resolves itself , or if it does at all , throughout the rest of the tracks .
Peters was kind enough to give some background on the making of “ Vipassana , ” and you 'll find his words , the complete album tracklisting , upcoming tour dates and more info under the player below .
Please enjoy :
Christian Peters on “ Vipassana ” :
‘ Vipassana ' is the first song we did after Richard had left the band . It came out from a series of jam sessions . Pretty much this is all we did in the first rehearsals after Richard left : jamming , jamming and even more jamming . The song topic seems to be about growing up , or maybe growing up responsibly . Kind of a coming of age thing wrapped in heavy riffs and Pink Floydish-psychedelia , plus some kind of Indian raga theme . It 's pretty much what one can consider as ‘ classic SBE'-material already , I think . It may be interesting to know that Richard , who did not play any instruments , but again recorded the album , also contributed some nice ideas in the process , like having me play the backward solo or putting in some vintage tape-effects . we are all very happy with the outcome of this song in particular and hope you will enjoy . there is much more on the album .
SAMSARA BLUES EXPERIMENT 's fourth ‘ full piece of wax ' “ One with the Universe “ is a culmination of all their works and truly a hard hitting cosmic invitation for floating into their universe of spiritual progression . The most evolutionary development compared to previous albums is the cosmic usage of analog synthesizers , keyboards and effects , while not losing focus on catchiness and well-rendered songwriting .
These five new epics subtly integrate flashes from Jimi Hendrix´ “ Electric Ladyland “ , Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath , with Canterbury Prog elements à la Caravan and the fuzzed-out riffs of Kyuss . “ One with the Universe “ can not be put just into one genre : it is a multifaceted heavy rock album with tons of soul , courage and originality !
The album will be released on May 12th through Electric Magic Records .

It was not so shocking that House Speaker John Boehner would seek to undermine President Barack Obama and his attempt to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran by inviting Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to deliver an address to Congress , in which Netanyahu will presumably dump on Obama 's efforts . Nor was it so shocking that Netanyahu , who apparently would rather see another war in the Middle East than a deal that allows Iran to maintain a civilian-oriented and internationally monitored nuclear program , agreed to mount this stunt two weeks before the Israeli elections—a close contest in which the hawkish PM is fighting for his political life . Certainly , Netanyahu realized that this audacious move would strain his already-ragged ties with the Obama administration and tick off the president , who will be in office for the next two years and quite able to inconvenience Netanyahu should he hold on to power . ( Even Fox News talking heads acknowledged that Boehner 's invitation and Netanyahu 's acceptance were low blows . ) But what was surprising was how willing Netanyahu was to send a harsh message to American Jews : Drop dead .
For the past six years , one big question has largely defined US politics : Are you for or against Obama ? The ongoing narrative in Washington has been a simple one : The president has tried to enact a progressive agenda—health care , gun safety , a minimum-wage hike , climate change action , immigration reform , Wall Street reform , gender pay equity , expanded education programs , diminishing tax cuts for the rich—and Boehner and the Republicans have consistently plotted to thwart him . The GOP has used the filibuster in the Senate to block Obama initiatives and routine presidential appointments . The House Republicans have resorted to extraordinary means—shutting down the government , holding the debt ceiling hostage , ginning up controversies ( Benghazi ! ) —to block the president . All this has happened as conservative allies of the Republican Party have challenged Obama 's legitimacy as president ( the birth certificate ) and peddled vicious conspiracy theories ( he 's a Muslim socialist who will destroy the nation ) . Throughout the Obama Wars , one demographic group that has steadfastly stood with the president is American Jews .
Jews have voted for Obama in strong numbers . In 2008 , Obama drew 74 percent of the Jewish vote ( maybe up to 78 percent ) . In 2012 , he won about 69 percent . Yes , there was a drop-off , but it was consistent with Obama 's decline within other constituencies . The second time around he was slightly less popular with everyone . Moreover , in the 2014 congressional elections , 69 percent of Jewish voters , according to one poll , voted for a Democratic congressional candidate . That survey found that 57 percent of American Jews approved of Obama 's performance as president—a much higher number than the 43 percent approval rating among the general population . As the Hill noted :
The clear conclusion is that despite Republican efforts to target Jewish voters and to paint the president as somehow anti-Israel , the Jewish vote is not up for grabs . In fact , there has been a remarkable consistency in the Jewish vote for Congress over the past three elections as measured by GBA surveys , including 66 percent for Democrats in 2010 , 69 percent in 2012 , and 69 percent in 2014 .
And there 's this . The poll asked American Jews to cite two issues of importance to them . Only 8 percent mentioned Israel , which put this subject in 10th place , far behind the economy and health care . Another survey conducted earlier in 2014 showed American Jewish voters overwhelmingly supporting Obama and listing the economy and the growing gap between the rich and poor as their top issues . As the New York Times reported , “ Concern about Israel or Iran ranked very low , even when respondents were asked for the second most important issue that would determine their vote for president. ” The paper quoted Robert Jones , head of the Public Religious Research Institute : “ We show no slippage in Jewish support for President Obama . ”
It 's no news flash that American Jews tend to be liberal . In 2013 , the Pew Research Religious and Public Life Project spelled out the obvious :
Jews are among the most strongly liberal , Democratic groups in U.S. politics . There are more than twice as many self-identified Jewish liberals as conservatives , while among the general public , this balance is nearly reversed . In addition , about seven-in-ten Jews identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party . Jews are more supportive of President Barack Obama than are most other religious groups . And about eight-in-ten Jews say homosexuality should be accepted by society .
And this Pew report noted that most Jews support Obama 's stance on Israel : “ Obama receives higher marks from Jews by religion than from most other religious groups for his handling of the nation 's policy toward Israel . The strongest critics of Obama 's approach toward Israel are white evangelical Protestants , among whom just 26 % approve of his performance in this area . ”
By RSVPing to Boehner 's invitation , Netanyahu is choosing sides and embracing the folks whom most American Jews oppose . He is butting into US politics and enabling the never-ending Republican campaign to undercut a president widely supported by American Jews .
That is not good for Jews in the United States or Israel . Israeli politicians have long counted on Jewish support in the United States—and support from conservative evangelicals . Yet there have been signs that non-Orthodox American Jews are not all that happy with Netanyahu 's policies . A 2013 poll found that only 38 percent of American Jews believed that his government was “ making a sincere effort to bring about a peace settlement ” with the Palestinians . Close to half believed Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank was a bad idea . ( Only 17 percent said it helped Israeli security . ) That is , Netanyahu 's right-wing approach—even if supported by AIPAC and other American Jewish establishment outfits—was not popular with many American Jews .
And now Netanyahu is partnering up with Boehner to kick Obama in the teeth and sabotage one of the president 's top diplomatic priorities . He is essentially telling American Jews to get lost : I have no regard for the president you support and no regard for your own political needs and desires .
The leader of a foreign country ought to place his own assessment of national security imperatives first . But the relationship between the Israeli government and American Jews is an important and sensitive matter for both sides—and perhaps more so for Tel Aviv . After all , Israel , which receives about $ 3 billion in US aid annually , needs the United States more than vice versa . Yet Netanyahu has decided to snub American Jews and to insult the leader they strongly back . This speech might help Netanyahu in the Israeli elections ; it could also backfire if Israeli voters decide to punish him for further weakening Israel 's special relationship with Washington . But Netanyahu 's scheming with Boehner against Obama could also end up alienating many American Jews from the Israeli government . By enlisting with Boehner , Netanyahu is conveying a brazen sign of disrespect for a community he and his country depend upon . What chutzpah .

With the inclusion of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) plans are underway for the upcoming movie and new details have emerged online .
In a new report by Deadline , the new franchise will span three to four films and cover Peter Parker 's years in high school after getting bitten .
`` There are all kinds of rumors raging about the wall crawler , including that Feige and his producing accomplice Amy Pascal are planning an arc that will tell the Spidey story over three to four movies , each covering a year of high school for Peter Parker , who 'll already have been bitten by the radioactive spider so we do n't have to see that all over again . The tone they are searching for in the coming of age tale is John Hughes humor and emotion , plus all the superhero stuff . ''
Unlike previous versions of the movie , Parker wo n't graduate high school and move onto college , rather , it 'll focus on the time after the transformation and fans will see how Peter handles being a superhero . Unlike `` The Amazing Spider-Man '' films , the new series may focus on the immediate years of the raw Spider-Man as he learns to manage his life with his new powers .
As plans continue , there is an on-going search for the film 's director and from the way things are progressing , the publication adds that a decision could be made by the end of the week . In addition to a search for actor to play the titular role , it 's likely that a name could be announced soon given that Spider-Man is expected to be included in the third installment of `` Captain America , '' subtitled , `` Civil War . ''
Sony Pictures and Marvel Team Up
It was announced back in February that Sony Pictures and Marvel have entered a partnership that will bring Spider-Man into the MCU .
Spider-Man will make his debut in a Marvel film and will be followed by a stand-alone film on July 28 , 2017 . The movie will be co-produced by Marvel 's Kevin Feige and his team along with Amy Pascal of Sony who was part of the franchise launch with the studio 13 years ago .
`` We always want to collaborate with the best and most successful filmmakers to grow our franchises and develop our characters . Marvel , Kevin Feige and Amy , who helped orchestrate this deal , are the perfect team to help produce the next chapter of Spider-Man , '' said Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Michael Lynton . `` This is the right decision for the franchise , for our business , for Marvel , and for the fans .

It 's not just using a handheld phone while driving that 's a menace to society . It turns out that charging it in the car has consequences too .
That 's because a phone drawing electricity from a USB port cuts 0.03 miles from each gallon of gasoline in a tank . Across the fleet of vehicles in the U.S. , that would mean about 970,000 tons of extra planet-warming carbon dioxide a year , according to calculations by Jon Bereisa , a retired General Motors Co. engineering executive who studies vehicle power usage . With a race under way to see how many charging ports automakers can cram into a car , the increased pollution is only going to get worse .
“ Do I think we 're at peak USB ? No , ” said Mary Gustanski , vice president of engineering and program management at Delphi Automotive Plc , which makes wiring and USB ports for vehicles . “ We 'll get more and more creative to not only allow you to connect with USB but also to connect wireless . Consumers want their car to be just like their home . ”
It 's not just an environmental issue , either . The proliferation of consumer devices , the growth of dashboard touch screens and other technology , and the shrinking size of engines to meet fuel-economy mandates mean the 12-volt automobile electrical system is just about tapped out . Some automakers are already turning to supplemental 48-volt systems in future models .
Port Proliferation
The number of vehicles sold in the U.S. with USB charge ports rose to about 14.6 million last year from about 3.3 million in 2005 , the first year they were available , and is projected to climb to 16.7 million by 2022 , according to a forecast from the consulting firm IHS . Global sales of vehicles with USB ports will increase to 85 million in 2022 from about 49 million last year , IHS said .
That estimate does n't capture how many ports are in a particular vehicle . For example , the new Chrysler Pacifica minivan , which goes on sale later this year , will have nine USB charging points , the most of any automobile , said Bruce Velisek , director of Chrysler brand product marketing . The model it replaces has four charging points , he said .
To make his calculation , Bereisa assumed that a typical smartphone connected to WiFi or the Internet needs about 4.8 watts of energy to charge in a car . ( Delphi estimates that some less-efficient models draw twice that amount . ) For a vehicle getting about 30 miles per gallon , that 's a 0.03 mpg loss , he said . Spread out across about 3 trillion road miles motorists drive each year in the U.S. — assuming an average speed of 30 mph — the estimated extra usage is 100 million gallons of gasoline , or about $ 200 million in costs , said Bereisa , the chief executive officer of Auto Electrification LLC in Sunrise Beach , Missouri .
Home Charging
The estimated extra CO2 created by plugging in one phone in every car in the U.S. would be about the same as that produced by 185,257 passenger vehicles in one year , according to an Environmental Protection Agency website that converts greenhouse gas into real-world equivalents . Put another way , that 's the pollution created by burning 945 million pounds of coal .
By far , the cheapest way to charge a smartphone is at home , Bereisa said . With gasoline at $ 2 a gallon , it costs about 2 cents an hour to charge a phone in a car compared with about 0.06 cent at home , or 33 times less . Gasoline would have to fall to 6 cents a gallon to compete with home electricity , he said . It would also produce about half the carbon dioxide .
“ That 's why modern electricity power plants are not driven by gasoline engine generators , ” said Bereisa , who worked on the EV-1 and Volt electric-vehicle programs and fuel-cell models during his 35 years at GM . “ We go through life without realizing how important energy is to everything we do , and the consequences of our energy consumption . We grow up entitled to just plug it in or flip the switch or push start — with no idea of what 's behind it all . ”
Gary Johnson was allowed to qualify for the debate after Fox News tweaked its criteria . Fla. GOP : Do n't let Johnson debate
Fox News has invited Gary Johnson to Thursday 's presidential debate over the objections of the Florida Republican Party , which is co-hosting the Orlando event .
But the former New Mexico governor and fledgling presidential candidate still wo n't be on the ballot at Saturday 's Presidency 5 straw poll , since the Florida GOP controls that order exclusively .
Story Continued Below
Fox and the state party disagreed on an interpretation of the rules , which require a candidate to receive at least 1 percent support in five recent national polls , said Florida GOP spokesman Brian Hughes . But Fox tweaked the criteria to require candidates only poll 1 percent in the last five polls in which they were presented as an option , allowing Johnson to qualify .
“ We had a sense of what their criteria meant and they felt their criteria was clear , ” Hughes said . “ I think it 's fair to say there is a misunderstanding in how non-inclusive polls would be considered . ”
Fox News included Johnson at the first debate of the season , in South Carolina in May , but not in the debate it hosted just before the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa .
The reasons behind the network 's decision to alter the rules in a way that seems to have specifically benefited Johnson 's campaign were not clear , and a Fox spokeswoman did not comment on that or the disagreement with the state party over Johnson 's invitation to Thursday 's debate .
Johnson , in an interview with POLITICO , said he has not received word of the invitation , but said he 'd take it if offered . He said he does n't plan to use the debate stage to make a spectacle of his campaign , but will reiterate his campaign themes .
“ I would be saying things different than everyone else up there , ” he said . “ I 'm promising to submit a balanced budget in 2013 . I am promising to veto spending legislation that exceeds revenue . I am promising to overhaul the tax code , that means throwing out the entire federal tax system and replacing it with the fair tax . ”
Johnson is no stranger to Fox : since June 1 , Johnson has appeared on Fox outlets 18 times , according to the liberal Fox monitor Media Matters . That figure is more than fellow GOP candidates Mitt Romney ( eight times ) , Jon Huntsman ( 11 ) and Rick Perry ( five ) — though Huntsman and Perry entered the race in July and August , respectively .
Hughes said the state party used its interpretation of the rules to disqualify Johnson from the Saturday straw poll , for which ballots have already been sent to the printer .
“ The Republican Party of Florida was using a version of the criteria to determine placement on our straw poll ballot , ” Hughes said . “ For logistical reasons , we had a different deadline . Based on using the criteria with a different deadline cut-off , Gary Johnson does not qualify for placement on the actual ballot that will be distributed Saturday . ”
Johnson spokesman Joe Hunter said it is “ not surprising ” that Johnson is being excluded from the straw poll ballot .
“ Straw polls , ” he said , “ are not what our campaign is about . ”
This wo n't come as a surprise if you 're familiar with the game 's genre , but playing Starcraft 2 might make you smarter . Starcraft 2 is a so-called “ real-time strategy game , ” a form of video game that involves resource management and military planning in parallel , while restricting the amount of information that each player has .
The result is a gaming experience that involves planning , strategic thinking on the fly , and rapid mental and physical coordination ( this is why I 'm terrible at Starcraft , if you were curious ) . According to a study published in August , brought to our attention by Red Bull 's gaming arm , “ cognitive flexibility is a trainable skill . ”
That conclusion was reached after running study participants through a controlled gaming environment , or Starcraft 1 and 2 . Some participants played The Sims , while others played the Starcraft titles , racking up 40 hours of gameplay over a period of one-and-a-half to two months . All individuals that took part in the study were female , due to a “ small number of non-gaming males ” that might have been eligible . Those who played Starcraft instead of The Sims showed measurable improvements in certain mental functions following the period of gaming .
Playing Starcraft , according to the study , “ stresses rapid and simultaneous maintenance , assessment , and coordination between multiple information and action sources was sufficient to affect change. ” The result of playing real-time strategy games such as Starcraft is “ an underlying dimension of cognitive flexibility ” across several laboratory tests .
So , playing Starcraft 2 with its mental rigor helps keep your brain fit , and perhaps tunes it up a bit . Again , this is not a surprising conclusion , but is a fun data point all the same .
There has long been an interesting connection between Starcraft 2 and startups , something that I first wrote about in 2010 . Since then , there have been startup Starcraft series , an entire league built to allow large tech companies to field their own teams , and discussion across the Internet about why tech workers seem to love the game .
It 's not surprising that digital types that stick to monitors and fast typing enjoy Starcraft , but it 's also possible that there is a bit of skill or interest overlap between working in a quickly growing tech company and playing the game .
And since Starcraft might help keep your mind fit , it does n't hurt to play a few games to stay sharp . At least that 's what you can tell your boss the next time you 're caught getting bunker-rushed before the end of the workday .

We are often told that we need population growth for the economy . We are also told that the small business sector is the engine room of Australian business .
But like many small business owners , I find that Australia 's high population growth hurts my business by increasing my costs .
It is not just working families and first home buyers who are suffering in our cities from unaffordable house prices and rents . The small business sector is also a victim of the rising rents that flow from a growing population 's ever-increasing demand for land .

High population growth also places enormous pressure on other critical resources like water and energy . Major price hikes are the direct result .
According to the New South Wales Government , a key factor in the recent massive rises in the price of energy is the need to `` keep up with a growing population and increased electricity use '' . Starting from July 1 this year , bills for those on standard tariffs rise by a total of up to 64 per cent to 2013 .
It 's a similar story with water . We used to have enough water for the population , even in times of drought . But a bigger population needs more water , so we built a desalination plant in NSW . Its $ 2 billion cost is a big factor behind the predicted 30 per cent increase in water rates by mid-2012 .
To add to the population-driven cost pressures , rising property prices have been recognised as a key factor in recent interest rate rises . Urban Taskforce Australia stated that `` the Reserve Bank has been using increased interest rates as a weapon against home price inflation '' . Do n't forget the impact of higher interest rates on the business sector . Many businesses run on bank credit , and bank interest is a significant part of their overheads .
The red-hot debate over banks moving to increase interest rates outside of the Reserve Bank 's rate movements also has its roots in population growth .
Population growth is creating increased demand for mortgages , which banks have been at pains to state can not be sourced from inside Australia . They need to source much of the extra credit from offshore , including wholesale credit markets . This offshore lending , which is not only driving our skyrocketing foreign debt towards $ 1 trillion , is also increasing the cost of borrowing for banks and therefore putting upward pressure on interest rates .

Then there are the costs to business of increasing traffic congestion . They include time costs and higher vehicle running costs . Federal Treasury has estimated these costs to be around $ 12.9 billion in 2010 . This could nearly double by 2020 if we keep up this reckless growth . It is simply not possible to widen Parramatta Road or the Pacific Highway to make way for an ever-increasing number of cars . It 's a similar story across Australia .
All these increasing costs make it hard for businesses to stay afloat . Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows in the two years from June 2007 more than 638,000 Australian businesses shut up shop . This , like our population growth , is at record levels .
Increasing costs also make Australian businesses less internationally competitive and threaten exports . If they manage to survive , businesses must pass on these costs to the customer . We all pay more .
Ninety years since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party
5 July 2011
Last Friday , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) celebrated its 90th anniversary with great fanfare throughout the country , including films , exhibitions and countless other events . But the very character of the festivities demonstrated that the present-day party has nothing to do with communism , the working class , or indeed the CCP as it was founded in 1921 .
The central theme was a disgusting celebration of Chinese nationalism and patriotism , designed to bury the party 's origins as a fighting organisation of the working class based on socialist internationalism . The present CCP regime , which has presided over a staggering expansion of Chinese capitalism , certainly did not want workers drawing any lessons from the party 's early history .
The CCP promoted “ Red tourism ” to the town of Yan'an , where Mao Zedong 's peasant army had its headquarters in the 1930s , but not to the sites of the revolutionary upheavals of the working class in the 1920s . The fate of the grey brick house in industrial Shanghai where the CCP held its founding congress in 1921 is telling . It now sits in an up-market dining and entertaining district developed by Hong Kong property tycoons for the affluent Chinese middle classes .
The founding congress was attended by just 13 men , representing a membership of less than 60 , and by Maring ( Hendrick Sneevliet ) on behalf of the Communist International . Chen Duxiu , the dean of the Peking University and editor of New Youth , was elected as leader . Formed as part of the powerful international response to the Russian Revolution of 1917 , the party , even though small at the outset , was quickly thrown into the maelstrom of revolution and posed with the challenge of taking power .
Tragically , the bureaucratic degeneration of Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin in conditions of international isolation and internal backwardness became the chief obstacle to the subsequent Chinese revolution in 1925-27 . Repudiating the lessons of the Russian Revolution , Stalin revived the Menshevik “ two-stage ” theory , subordinated the CCP to the bourgeois Kuomintang ( KMT ) on the basis that in backward China the capitalist class must first lead the bourgeois revolution and take power , postponing any socialist revolution by the working class to the distant future .
The results were disastrous . The KMT under Chiang Kai-shek exploited the prestige of the CCP and the Soviet Union , then turned on the party in April 1927 , murdering thousands of members and workers in Shanghai . Three months later , the debacle was repeated when Stalin subordinated the CCP to the “ left ” KMT . To counter criticism of these ruinous policies by the Left Opposition formed in 1923 by Leon Trotsky , Stalin ordered the battered CCP to stage an uprising in Canton in late 1927 that ended in catastrophe .
Two alternatives were starkly posed to the CCP . The first , taken by Chen Duxiu , was to draw the necessary lessons from the betrayals of Stalin and to form the Chinese Left Opposition . The second was pursued by Mao Zedong , who concluded that the working class was incapable of leading a revolution and turned to the peasantry . By submerging the CCP into a peasant guerrilla movement , Mao wrenched the party off its proletarian axis and transformed it into a radical movement of the rural petty bourgeoisie—a transformation that was to have profound implications .
In a far-sighted letter to Chinese supporters in 1932 , Trotsky warned of the dangers facing the working class from Mao 's peasant armies . “ The peasant movement is a mighty revolutionary factor insofar as it is directed against the large landowners , militarists , feudalists and usurers . But in the peasant movement itself are very powerful proprietary and reactionary tendencies and at a certain stage it can become hostile to the workers and sustain that hostility already equipped with arms , ” he explained .
Those warnings were borne out in 1949 . Having first tried to form a coalition with the KMT , Mao was forced to respond when Chang Kai-shek attempted to militarily crush the CCP . The CCP 's victory was not so much the result of Mao 's supposed military genius , but the political and economic implosion of the thoroughly corrupt KMT regime . On seizing power , the CCP suppressed any independent working class activity , jailed the Chinese Trotskyists and implemented Mao 's version of the two-stage theory—an alliance with those big businessmen who had not fled to Taiwan and Hong Kong and former KMT generals , including some who had massacred communists in 1927 .
The subsequent evolution of China into capitalism 's largest sweatshop flowed organically from the regime 's foundations laid in October 1949 . Article three of the CCP regime 's founding constitution contained an explicit defence of capitalist property relations . Insofar as the CCP carried out nationalisations , the aim was not socialism , but a nationally-regulated economy , not dissimilar to measures carried out in avowedly capitalist post-colonial countries such as India . The nationalisation of the land was not , as Lenin had explained , a socialist measure , but a radical bourgeois policy to put an end to the feudal landlord class—a policy that ultimately created the basis for the full flowering of capitalism .
Despite various internal divisions , the CCP regime was based on the reactionary Stalinist utopia of “ socialism in one country. ” Cut off from the world economy , China lurched from one crisis to another . Mao 's experiments in rural socialism created economic havoc and the disastrous famine of the late 1950s that killed tens of millions .
The last gasp of Mao 's peasant radicalism was his attempt to smash his factional rivals by launching the misnamed “ Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ” in 1966 . The faction fight unexpectedly unleashed militant struggles of the working class , forcing the CCP to call a halt by sending in the army to suppress the movement . Having reached an economic dead-end , Mao signalled the CCP 's embrace of imperialism by making a rapprochement with the US in 1972 . He then began to open the door to ties with foreign corporations .
In the midst of the current anniversary celebrations , the official Xinhua news agency boasted : “ History has proven that only the Communist Party of China can save China. ” The ending of restrictions on capitalist exploitation in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping formally unleashed pro-market reforms in 1978 has certainly proved a boon for emerging Chinese capitalists , as well as international capital desperate for new infusions of cheap labour .
Since 1949 , the CCP police-state has implemented bourgeois measures—integrating the country , nationalising the land , broadening education and building infrastructure—that the KMT proved completely incapable of achieving . The one guiding thread through all of the CCP 's twists and turns has been its intense distrust and hostility to the working class , most graphically demonstrated in its brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989 as soon as masses of workers began to voice their own class demands in the protests .
All the regime 's present patriotic boasting can not obscure the immense contradictions of Chinese capitalism , however . The CCP leadership is intensely aware that it is sitting on top of an economic and social time bomb—above all , the huge gulf between rich and poor . The feeling of insecurity and isolation was spelled out by CCP General Secretary Hu Jintao , whose party of 80 million now includes some of China 's billionaires . He recently warned that ending the party 's endemic corruption was the key to “ winning or losing public support and the life or death of the party . ”
These anniversary events could well be the party 's last hurrah . Despite their extravagance , the regime is like a 90-year-old man watching in horror at the grave digger it has prepared—the vastly expanded proletariat that has grown from 8 million in 1949 to 500 million today . The only basis for overturning the police-state in Beijing is Trotsky 's Theory of Permanent Revolution that insists on the leading role of the working class in mobilising the oppressed masses to overthrow the CCP regime , establish a genuine workers state and implement socialist policies as part of the struggle for socialism internationally .
In preparation , workers and intellectuals in China must learn from the tragic lessons of the strategic experiences of the working class in the twentieth century in China and internationally—particularly the betrayals carried out by Stalinism and Maoism . A new genuine Marxist revolutionary party is needed , based on the lessons of the Trotskyist movement 's protracted political fight against Stalinism . That means building a Chinese section of the International Committee of Fourth International .

A federal appeals court says Ashton , a transgender senior student , who identifies as a male , should be able to use the boys ' bathroom at at Kenosha 's Tremper High School . ( Transgender Law Center via AP )
MADISON , Wis. ( AP ) — A federal appeals court says a transgender student who identifies as a male should be able to use the boys ' bathroom at his Wisconsin high school .
Ashton Whitaker , who will graduate from Kenosha 's Tremper High School this week , first asked to use the boys ' bathroom as a sophomore . That set off a nearly yearlong legal battle with the school district .
In September , U.S. District Judge Pamela Pepper granted Whitaker permission to use the boys ' bathroom at school . On Tuesday , the second-to-last day of Whitaker 's senior year , the 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision .
“ I am thrilled that the 7th Circuit recognized my right to be treated as the boy that I am at school , ” Whitaker said in a statement distributed by the Transgender Law Center . “ As I look forward to college next year , I hope my case will help other transgender students in Kenosha and elsewhere to just be treated the same as everyone else without facing discrimination and harassment from school administrators . ”
Ilona Turner , legal director for the Transgender Law Center and one of the attorneys who helped represent Whitaker , said though the ruling only applies to Whitaker , it sets precedent that a federal law prohibiting gender discrimination in public schools protects transgender people .
“ This is just another building block on the large and growing number of courts to hold that discrimination against transgender people is illegal , ” she said .
Kenosha Unified School District had argued that the federal law does n't apply to transgender people as a group and that the harm to other students of Whitaker using the boys ' bathroom , particularly to male students , outweighs any harm to Whitaker . It also urged the appeals court to reconsider whether the case should be thrown out . Ronald Stadler , a lawyer for the school district , did n't immediately return a message .
U.S . Circuit Court Judge Ann Claire Williams declined to reconsider and rejected the district 's other arguments , saying harms to others are speculative while harms to Whitaker are well-documented . Those include suicidal thoughts as well as medical issues stemming from avoiding the bathroom .
According to the lawsuit , when Whitaker first asked to use the boys ' bathroom , the school said he could either use a gender-neutral bathroom in the school 's main office or the girls ' bathroom . He used the boys ' bathroom anyway without issue for six months , it says , until a teacher saw him washing his hands there and reported it to school administration .
Turner , who works with the Transgender Law Center , said Whitaker 's win could impact a case with the 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals — that of Gavin Grimm , a transgender high school senior in Virginia who sued his school board for the right to use the boys ' bathroom . The U.S. Supreme Court was set to hear his case but sent it back to the lower court after President Donald Trump 's administration revoked guidance from former President Barack Obama directing public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms aligned with their gender identities .

SLEEP-DEPRIVED STAFFS SLEEP-DEPRIVED STAFFS Workers who have :
Nodded off or fallen asleep while driving : 36 %
Fallen asleep or become very sleepy at work : 29 %
Been late to work because of sleepiness : 12 %
Source : National Sleep Foundation 2008 Sleep in America Poll telephone survey of 1,000 respondents Sept. 25-Nov. 19 . Margin of error +/-3.1 percentage points U.S. workers are silently suffering from a dramatic lack of sleep , costing companies billions of dollars in lost productivity , says a study out Monday . Nearly three in 10 workers have become very sleepy , or even fallen asleep , at work in the past month , according to a first-ever study on sleep and the workplace by the non-profit National Sleep Foundation . The late-2007 survey was based on a random sample of 1,000 workers . TELL US : How has your sleep affected your performance at work ? Have you ever fallen asleep on the job ? `` It 's a very expensive issue for employers , and it can be fatal , too , '' says Nilesh Dave , medical director of the Sleep and Breathing Disorders Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas . `` The 24/7 global economy means work is now around the clock . '' About 70 million Americans have a problem sleeping , according to the NSF . Some employers , such as Union Pacific ( UNP ) railroad , are so concerned that they 're now allowing workers to nap on the job . Employees also say it 's a significant issue , causing them to drive drowsy or even fall asleep at their desks . Ursula Forhan , 53 , of Chicago , used to fall asleep at her desk . She was treated for sleep apnea and says she has no problems today . `` I would take a nap on the floor of my office , and my boss was so tolerant he would step over me , '' says Forhan , a paralegal in Chicago . She used to drive for work and had to roll down the windows to stay awake . Among the survey 's findings : •Dangers on the road . Thirty-six percent of respondents say they have nodded off or fallen asleep while driving , including 26 % who say they drive drowsy during the workday . •Work performance . Twelve percent of respondents have arrived late to work in the past month because of sleepiness . Other problems cited : impatience with others , difficulty concentrating on job tasks and lower productivity . •Work hours . Employees with more than one job report the highest rate of dissatisfaction with sleep : 43 % say they get a good night 's sleep only a few nights per month or less . Part-time workers report the highest rate of sleep satisfaction . Several factors are driving the trend toward sleepier employees . Employees are putting in longer hours , in part due to increased pressure from employers to ramp up productivity . The study found that one-fourth of respondents have a workday that lasts between eight and nine hours , and another fourth say they work up to 10 hours a day . Technology , which is supposed to enhance productivity , has also required employees to be available . `` You 're not disconnecting except when you hit the pillow , '' says Mark Rosekind , a consultant who worked on the survey .

I was pre-ordering on steam a copy of the upcoming Dead Pool game while watching gameplay vids on my second monitor when I was left aghast by a graphic , repulsive dialog exchange between the Marvel comic book character `` DeadPool '' against another character in the game , a cis woman villain in revealing clothing called `` ArcLight '' Here is a transcript of the exchange : Direct Link here : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=xpHD0m-1R94 # t=444s I know DeadPool is suposed to be an outlandish character , and this is M rated game , but is there really a place for this kind of stuff in a videogame ? The 'she-man ' ( or variants like she-male ) words are very offensive and hurtful to the LGBT community . Recent threads on gaf were teaching experiences and I feel that I am now a better informed person about this . I 'm not sure if I should go on with my pre-order of the game , I do n't feel like it 's ok to encourage things like that . What a bad choice of word . They managed to merge sexism AND hate in a single scene : \
There are almost 69,000 parking spots in downtown Dallas , but to many weekday visitors , it might seem as though there are none .
Street spaces are almost always full . Most garages are gated . And it 's hard to tell which surface lots are open to the public . Officials who focus on downtown say they regularly field complaints there 's nowhere to park .
So it may come as a surprise there 's actually a surplus of spots in the area . One 2011 study found that more than 7,000 downtown spaces sit vacant during peak hours .
That disconnect poses a major problem as the area re-emerges as a desirable place to work and live . Developers argue that downtown 's renaissance will be stunted if more parking is n't provided . But urban advocates hope to see more spaces removed to create a less car-dependent and more pedestrian-oriented downtown .
How the city balances those seemingly competing needs could shape how the district fares over the next decade .
“ The biggest single challenge facing the resurgence of downtown for both office and residential [ development ] is parking , ” said Ken Good , who owns several buildings in the area .
Need for accessibility
Good has experienced that challenge first-hand . His real estate company recently bought the 14-story Hartford Building in the parking-deficient area of Bryan Street and St. Paul Street . The occupancy rate of the office building was less than 50 percent when his company took over . It 's up now , but he 's having trouble finding affordable parking for other tenants .
An adjoining parking garage recently raised the cost of a monthly space from $ 85 to $ 200 . And a nearby surface lot has increased its monthly rate from $ 119 to $ 149 .
“ Four blocks away , I can park for 75 or 80 bucks a month , ” he said . “ But people do n't want to walk that far . ”
And soon there may be even fewer parking options . The city plans to turn a lot with more than 300 spaces into a park at Pacific Plaza as part of its ongoing efforts to build attractions downtown .
Good and other owners of nearby developments support building a parking garage on part of the land . But that idea has drawn opposition from some parks department officials and urban advocates who worry it would lessen the appeal of the plaza .
That , Good argues , is short-sighted . Parks are an important part of downtown , he said . But they wo n't do much good if businesses are unwilling to locate around them . And those businesses wo n't come if they do n't think their employees will have anywhere to leave their cars .
Good said his building offers cheaper rent than a lot of comparable suburban offices . But those competitors usually offer free parking , so the overall expense for downtown tenants ends up being higher .
“ Until downtown becomes so cool that everyone wants to be there , nobody is going to pay extra just to be downtown and to have additional hassles , ” he said .
Hope for walkability
But others argue the development community has it backward . All those parking lots are part of the reason downtown is n't that cool , they say .
Surface lots make up about 13 percent of downtown land . They make the district drab and unwalkable . And their abundance eliminates the incentive for people to take mass transit into the area , making street life less vibrant , urban advocates say .
By comparison , the most successful urban cores in American cities have virtually no surface lots . That may make parking more expensive , but it has n't kept people from living or working in the densest parts of New York , Boston or San Francisco .
Some planners say the best scenario might be letting the parking lots disappear .
That may start happening soon . Local leaders say most of the lots ' owners have no plans to stay in the parking business . Instead , they have been charging for parking while they wait for better development opportunities .
In the 1990s , when downtown was suffering , those opportunities did n't exist . And they mostly did n't emerge during the early days of the area 's renaissance , either . Developers were more interested in renovating vacant buildings .
But most of the old buildings have been taken , so the lots are being sought for development .
“ It 's possible that all surface lots in downtown will be gone in 20 years , ” said Jim Wood , director of planning , transportation and development for Downtown Dallas Inc .
If that happens , about 17,000 parking spaces will disappear . Urban advocates think it would be misguided to try to replace them all .
After all , the area will never be able to compete with suburbs such as Frisco for cheap , ample parking . Land is too expensive downtown . Instead , the area should focus on its inherent advantages , argues urban planner and designer Patrick Kennedy .
Building apartments , restaurants , retail stores and parks where parking lots now sit would turn the district into an area where people could live without cars and enjoy a unique urban lifestyle , he said .
“ I think we need to get away from the idea that convenience is tied to parking , ” Kennedy said . “ I live downtown , and convenient for me is walking down the street to a restaurant . ”
Seeking buy-in
That vibrant , walkable vision for downtown wo n't materialize overnight , however . So city leaders say they need to find a way to accommodate demand for parking in the short-term .
Some ideas , such as building garages that can later be converted to apartments or office buildings , would be expensive . Planners are also seeking creative solutions that do n't involve much construction .
A 2011 study commissioned by Downtown Dallas Inc. called for better signs to help drivers find spaces . Others have raised the idea of incentives for businesses and apartment buildings to share parking .
One of the problems , planners say , is that some companies control large numbers of parking spaces — sometimes more than they need . But they keep those extra spaces fenced off instead of making them available to the public .
Getting support from businesses and property owners will be vital for creative approaches . The city barely owns any parking downtown . And the Downtown Dallas Inc. study found that the people who do own parking operate in “ silos ” ; there is no cooperation to make parking more efficient .
Karl Stundins , area redevelopment program manager in the city 's economic development office , said the city recognizes a need to address this . The staff will begin reaching out to property owners and other stakeholders in the next year .
That , combined with the continued growth of downtown attractions , could help sustain the area 's momentum , he said .
“ People do n't go to a location just because it has a lot of parking , ” he said . “ It is finding that balance between having the attractions that make Dallas a great place and having parking that supports the businesses and is convenient . ”
AT A GLANCE : What other cities do
PARKING SOLUTIONS
Many other cities have struggled with similar parking problems in their downtowns . Here are a few methods other cities have tried that some planners say might be considered in Dallas :
Shared parking : Many parking lots and garages are full for only part of the day . Spaces for offices sit empty at night , while those for apartments are empty during the day when tenants are at work . Having buildings with different needs share those spaces means fewer total spots will be needed , planners say .
Dynamic street pricing : When the most convenient spaces are too cheap , they are often taken up by long-term workers . That makes it difficult for shoppers or diners to find a place to park . In San Francisco , planners implemented a formula that raises parking prices as demand increases . The goal is to always have at least two open spaces per block . City officials say the pricing has made finding parking easier . It has also reduced traffic and pollution because fewer people are circling blocks in search of a spot , they say .
Convertible garages : Some planners suggest building parking garages that could later be turned into office or apartment buildings . That allows the area to provide needed parking now and adjust if demand goes down .
PRICING IT RIGHT
Downtowns in major cities should n't try to compete on price for parking , planners say . Dallas could be seen as having relatively cheap parking downtown . Here is a sample of how much it costs to park near major attractions within a few large American cities .
Austin near Sixth Street and Congress Avenue : $ 24 for full day , $ 167 to $ 270 monthly .
Houston near Discovery Green : $ 18 for full day , $ 186 monthly ( $ 290 for a reserved space ) .
Boston near Copley Square : $ 37 for a full day , $ 360 monthly .
San Francisco near Union Square : $ 34 for a full day , $ 380 monthly ( $ 580 for a reserved spot ) .
New York City near Times Square : $ 40 for a full day , $ 450 to $ 675 monthly .
Dallas near Dealey Plaza : $ 10 for full day , $ 50 per month .

The Washington Redskins needed a change in attitude along the offensive line and they got that in the form of former Iowa Hawkeye road grader Brandon Scherff at fifth overall .
Scherff is the fifth offensive lineman selected in the first round in team history . Sixth if you count TCU 's I.B . Hale , a tackle drafted eighth overall in the 1939 NFL Draft .
The others tackle taken ? Mark May ( 1981 – 20th overall ) , Andre Johnson ( 1996 – 30th overall ) , Chris Samuels ( 2000 – 3rd overall ) and Trent Williams ( 2010 – 4th overall ) .
Embed from Getty Images
The Redskins addressed defensive line this offseason with the additions of Ricky Jean Francois , Stephen Paea and Terrance Knighton but the team did not sign a newcomer to the offensive side of the ball .
Scherff started all 26 games of his last two seasons at left tackle but Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said in a conference call with reporters Thursday night that Sherff will start at right tackle , replacing free agent Tyler Polumbus .
The whole league saw the culmination of the Dallas Cowboys drafting an offensive lineman in the first round in three of the previous four years . Selecting tackle Tyron Smith ( 2010 – Ninth overall ) , center Travis Frederick ( 2012 – 31st overall ) and tackle Zack Martin ( 2014 – 16th overall ) resulted in a career year for running back DeMarco Murray , who rushed for 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2014 .
Redskins running back Alfred Morris voiced his opinion of the team 's newest addition on Twitter .
The 6-5 , 320-pounder from Denison , Iowa brings a high upside to a team that has long sought improvement along the offensive line for years .
Pros :
Plays with a mean streak and finishes off blocks , often pancaking opponents on second and third efforts .
Dominant run blocker known for driving defenders into the sidelines .
Beat out Texas defensive tackle Malcom Brown and Auburn center Reese Dismukes to win the 2014 Outland Trophy , awarded to the nation 's best interior lineman .
Athletic and has quick feet for someone who weighs more than 300 pounds .
Willing to play any spot on the offensive line .
Cons :
Lacks ideal frame and arm length for a tackle position . Body type more suited for guard .
Needs to improve pass protection .
Adjusting from left tackle to right tackle could take some getting used to .
Some holes in his mechanics with hand and foot placement .
Missed second half of 2012 season with a broken right leg and dislocated ankle . Suffered a torn meniscus in his right knee in the first half of a September 2014 game versus Ball State but returned in the second half and only missed one practice .
Fun facts :
Summary :
Scherff may be best suited for either guard position based on his frame and his ability as a run blocker but his two seasons at left tackle bode well for his transition to right tackle . His aggressiveness gives the Redskins an identity that new offensive line coach Bill Callahan loves . He should give the Redskins a Jon Jansen-like run at right tackle .

COMPANY A hires company B to hire employees for a project . These employees work for company B , but do they also work for company A ? If they are upset with the terms of their employment can they go after company A with pickets , boycotts and protests ? Does A have any direct obligations to these employees ?
The correct answer , in general , is that it depends . In a more specific sense it depends on the outcome of a fraught battle between a California branch of the Teamsters Union and Republic Services , one of America 's two giant rubbish-collection companies . The union is attempting to organise employees of Leadpoint Business Services , which employs sorters and other workers at a recycling plant in the Golden State . The union , however , has gone a step further and petitioned to have Republic treated as an employer as well since , it argues , Leadpoint 's supervisors act in a chain of authority controlled by Republic .

The National Labour Relations Board ( NLRB ) , a body set up in the Depression to rule on disputes between workers and management that is liked by Democrats and loathed by Republicans , is expected to issue a ruling on the matter in the final days of August . Its rulings are binding but can be appealed against . At least three of the five members of the board , which is appointed by the president , are expected to take the union 's side . That is unlikely to put an end to the matter , if only because the implications are so large .
The case has echoes of those wending their way through California 's courts , which will produce rulings on whether Uber drivers are employees , self-employed or something in between . Uber is appealing against a judgment that found it liable for $ 4,152 of a driver 's expenses—a small sum for a company with a valuation close to $ 50 billion but one with a potentially catastrophic effect on the company 's business model . Uber is not the only company facing such a case : a lawsuit in Virginia brought by ten former employees at a McDonald 's franchise restaurant , who say they were sacked on racial grounds , will test whether or not McDonald 's itself was their employer .
If the decision goes against Republic it would affect contracting , outsourcing and franchising , which is to say a vast segment of America 's economy . Republic would then probably appeal to a federal court , creating something else to fight over during elections to the White House and Congress , and fundamental questions for companies both large and small about their structure , risks and opportunities .
Given the stakes , one of the surprising aspects of the case is why it has received so little attention . This is partly because the defendants are barely known . Leadpoint is private and the name on the case is Browning-Ferris , a company that was absorbed into Republic years ago .
Trash talk
Interested parties were invited to submit “ amicus ” briefs ( extensive legal arguments ) to the NLRB and 17 were quickly received . The current standard for determining “ joint employment ” states that each company must be involved in hiring , firing , discipline , supervision and direction . Responsibility must be “ direct and immediate ” . Under this standard , Republic was found not to be a joint employer by a regional office of the NLRB in 2013 . That decision went to an appeal court .
This dispute turns on whether that is the right definition of employment . Among the most striking briefs was a submission by lawyers for the NLRB 's own general counsel . It begins by flatly stating the current rule should be abandoned . In its place , it “ urges the Board to adopt a new standard that takes account of the totality of the circumstances , including how the putative joint employers structured their commercial dealing with each other. ” The way the standards currently treat subcontracting and the operation of business franchises , it says , undermines the ability of workers to bargain for better wages , hours and working conditions .
If this change were to be adopted , businesses could find themselves responsible for people who provide them with services but whom they do not manage , such as janitors , argues Aloysius Hogan , of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a libertarian think-tank . They would be exposed to strikes and other labour strife prompted by the actions of companies other than their own . They would lose the ability to choose from competing service providers . Mr Hogan thinks large businesses would then be under pressure to integrate vertically , with all the inefficiency that may entail for their own operations , and lost opportunities for others . Whatever happens , the very different ideas on view in the Republic case about who is , and is not , an employee are not easily reconciled .

A friend recently observed to me that it is ironic that the neoconservatives , whose bottom line foreign policy issue is the uncritical support of Israel , should be obsessed with constantly confronting and goading Russia even though Tel Aviv and Moscow get along just fine . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has traveled to Russia three times in the past year and he and President Vladimir Putin reportedly understand each other very well .
To be sure , part of the reasoning behind the Israeli offering the hand of friendship is certainly demographic and electoral as many Israelis are Russian in origin and also characteristically strongly support recent right wing governments . They are regarded as essential members of Netanyahu 's coalition , but there is clearly more to it than counting votes .
From the Israeli point of view , Russia , though allied with Syria and friendly with Iran , does not threaten Israel and it also is an available resource to help Tel Aviv develop , refine and market its claimed offshore energy resources . Israel , increasingly isolated because of its repression of the Palestinians , is always eager to make new friends who will help protect it in international fora , witness Netanyahu 's recent charm offensive in Africa .
From the Russian point of view , Israel is a useful friend given its unparalleled access to the U.S. Congress , the White House and the American media . The Netanyahu government also understands Moscow 's concerns about radical Islam in the Arab world and Central Asia and is willing to share information that it obtains to contain the problem . For both Israel and Russia terrorism is not an abstraction – it sits right on and even inside their borders .
Even though Israel is undercutting the neocon plan to isolate and punish Russia at every opportunity people like Bill Kristol , the Kagans and John Bolton make no effort to criticize Netanyahu for his temerity . It is a policy of deliberately looking the other way and it underlines the essential phoniness of what the neoconservatives stand for . To put it bluntly , the neocons claim to support American military dominance globally for altruistic reasons but the reality is that they are largely in it for the money as well as the political and media access to power that money brings with it in contemporary America . What would Sunday morning talk shows be like without a beaming Bill Kristol ?
And the cash for the neocons comes mostly from defense contractors who are eager to have a clearly defined serious enemy to boost military spending coupled with an articulate group of pundits who insist on seeing threats worldwide and are willing to promote that viewpoint . Keeping the cash flowing to fund that nice corner office with a view of the Capitol even trumps the Israel relationship but the neocons are careful to make sure the two issues never bump up against each other when they are fulminating against Obama 's national security policies .
We are currently witnessing neocon perfidy at its most refined . They are jumping over themselves to support Hillary Clinton for president in spite of her manifest corruption and unreliability because Donald Trump has threatened to do two things : first he has expressed his unwillingness to enter into new wars in the Middle East or anywhere else and second he has stated that Washington should be even handed when attempting to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians . Both are anathema to the neocons and Trump has further complicated matters by indicating that he would be willing to talk with Vladimir Putin . If Trump were to win , many neocons would likely find themselves having to look for a real job , a terrifying prospect for people with few skills to fall back on .
Hillary Clinton on the other hand will do what is right from the neocon point of view – confronting the world one nation at a time starting with Iran , which she has threatened to “ obliterate. ” She will also need to boost defense spending to support her wars , will stiff Vlad , and will allow Bibi to move in down the hall at the White House as Bill will often be out on the town and his room in the East Wing is not needed .
Hillary 's bellicosity guarantees that the military industrial complex cash machine will continue to operate full speed , driving scores of leading neocons to announce that they will vote for her . Reuel Marc Gerecht , one of the neocons ' favorite Iran bashers , concluded in an article appearing in a recent issue of the Weekly Standard that Hillary 's “ not a neoconservative , but Hillary Clinton is n't uncomfortable with American power . Unlike Obama , she is n't the apologetic type . Whatever her opinions were in the Vietnam era , she does n't now view the Cold War ambivalently . She 's certain that might marry right in that struggle , even in the Third World , where Obama and many on the left have serious doubts. ” I 'm not completely sure what that pompous bit of prose is supposed to mean but Gerecht in a backhanded fashion also provided what is for me a ringing endorsement of Donald Trump , though he of course meant to do the opposite having stated his intention to vote for Hillary , writing “ Trump is probably the most anti-interventionist presidential candidate since Eugene V. Debs , the indefatigable socialist , in 1912 . ”
The issue of Israel has , of course , been somewhat hidden during the lead-up to the major party nominating conventions , with everyone inevitably expressing his or her deep affection for Netanyahu , but it has surfaced somewhat in the Democratic Party platform deliberations where Cornel West and James Zogby attempted to introduce some language critical of the occupation of the former Palestinian West Bank . They failed in that attempt though it is possible that something similar will be introduced from the floor during the actual convention . It will undoubtedly also fail even if it succeeds as it did in 2012 when the presiding chairman seemed to hear more “ yea ” votes than anyone else present in the hall .
The Republicans , still firmly under control of the neocon foreign policy clique , have outdone the Democrats . On July 12th the platform committee , with input from Jason Greenblatt and David Friedman , advisers to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump , approved a plank on Israel that does not accept creation of a Palestinian state at all unless Israel decides to take action to permit that to develop . On that and all other issues there will be “ no daylight ” between the U.S. and Israel . The subcommittee that drafted the position reportedly approved it by an overwhelming majority followed by a standing ovation .
The document calls Israel a “ beacon of democracy and humanity. ” It states that “ support for Israel is an expression of Americanism ” and declares that the U.S. Embassy will be moved to Jerusalem . It denies that Israel is an “ occupier , ” and calls for legislation to combat the “ anti-Semitic ” Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement . The plank could have been written by Netanyahu 's Foreign Ministry or perhaps by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) and basically cedes to Israel control over the direction of U.S. foreign policy in a critical and unstable region .
And there has been additional activity in Congress lately regarding Iran , with a large sale of Boeing jets being blocked and three additional bills submitted for consideration that will punish that country by , among other steps , denying it access to international finance . Indeed , the unrelenting neocon hostility towards Iran is a subset of the pro-Israel bias as Tehran is perceived as a problem for Tel Aviv while the arguments made to suggest that Iran threatens Europe and the United States lack any plausibility .
The creation of enemies unnecessarily , as applied to both Iran and Russia , is a symptom of the neoconservative disease . It is a pointless search for full spectrum military dominance that panders to an inchoate fear that the U.S. is surrounded by foes that can only be dealt with by decisive kinetic action which will require large defense budgets . Today 's neo-conservatism is a movement born from a curious amalgam of interests that have come together at a time when the United States is in reality militarily unchallenged worldwide and is threatened neither by any other country nor by the pinpricks inflicted by terrorists . Neocons and their associated liberal interventionists have to an extent dominated the foreign and defense policy thinking of the two major parties and most of the media but their message is ultimately based on emphasizing national insecurity , which in the current context is somewhat inexplicable . The United States has never been more secure internationally , if not domestically , and the only problems it is confronting are themselves part and parcel of the imbroglios that have been engineered by the interventionists and their friends . Speculation is that a Trump victory will actually end their dominance . If that is so , it might just be sufficient reason to vote for Donald Trump .
Charlie Strong will reportedly not leave Louisville to take over the Tennessee Volunteers . This follows Mike Gundy not leaving Oklahoma State , Jon Gruden not leaving ESPN , and any number of other people not leaving their current station in life in order to take over the Vols .
With only a name or two left on the current Tennessee list as best we know it , a number of proactive Vols players have overthrown the athletic department and begun distributing power amongst themselves . That 's not what actually happened , but at least they 're having more fun with it than most Vols fans are .

About
What is Galaxy Shed
Well , in short , it will be a private observatory located in Marathon , Texas that supports remote telescope use over the Internet . This facility will support a virtual astronomy club and provide telescope time to members only . Only people that pledge during our project offering will be able to use these telescopes . We also share telescope time with our affiliate SkyTitan who supplies the educational content and collaboration opportunities we provide .
Why are we building Galaxy Shed ?
Outside of the fact that it is really cool and a blast to do …… .. , it 's because so many people have asked us to . That 's right . We have had hundreds ( maybe thousands ) of individuals ask us over the years if they could use our on-line telescopes that we have developed for education . We have a lot of experience at this and have been doing this successfully with teachers and students for over 15 years . People love astronomy and they want to learn it . And so many people buy a telescope and rarely use it . Either it 's too difficult to set up and take down , too expensive , too technical , or there is just no one to help . And if you do have a telescope and a great location to use it , “ what am I looking at ” ? Our desire is to build an observatory , with great equipment , in a great location , “ and help people learn how ( and why ) to use it ” ! Our experience has shown that a collaborative learning community is a great way to learn astronomy and technology . We want to leverage our success and experience to bring astronomy to thousands of people in a fun and rewarding way .
What are we building ?
What are we building ? It 's in the name . Galaxy S H E D. But really , SHED does n't do justice to what is being constructed . There will be a 6 pier , roll-off roof observatory that is 16 ' x 24 ' . There is also an 8 ' x 16 ' control room . This will include large scale UPS battery systems and emergency power generators to run all of the computers , telescopes , and network equipment to ensure that the facility will be protected in the event of a power failure . A multiple camera , motion detection , and intrusion detection security system will be installed . Because of the amount of data that will be generated by all of the images that will be taken , a small data-center style server rack will be located in the control room that will house servers , backup devices , and redundant storage arrays . This infrastructure will provide Galaxy Shed members a private cloud to access images , collaborate on their work , and share ideas and experiences . We will also have a small data center environmental monitoring system to provide complete monitoring of the observatory . A SCADA control system will be installed to control the roof opening and closing , control lighting and environmental systems , and to perform routine maintenance on the emergency generator . The observatory will have both a heating and cooling system . The heat is used in the winter months to help remove frost build up on the telescopes after a night of observing . The AC system will be utilized to a greater extent in that it is important to keep the telescopes the same temperature as the night time temperatures . Keeping the telescopes cool is critical in obtaining good images and allowing quicker access time . Through our affiliate , we have two telescopes systems . These will be updated with the new , more accurate , pointing and guidance control electronics . New CCD cameras will be added that will provide for higher resolutions and faster download times . Three new , state-of-the-art , telescope systems will be purchased . These will include better optical tube assemblies that will provide better optical quality . Bandwidth is also very critical to the operation of Galaxy Shed . We have worked out with the local Internet Service Provider the design for a dedicated wireless system that will deliver a very large Internet service to the observatory . Our past experience with highly reliable , commercial grade wireless systems has made this possible . Rest assured , these are not your everyday Wi-Fi wireless systems we are talking about . These are very spendy , commercial-grade , radios that will provide a Point-to-Point Internet connection with nearly 7 nine 's of reliability . They will be capable of delivering nearly 150 MB of full duplex , symmetric speeds . To keep an eye on the sky , a web based weather station will be installed . Also , an all-sky cam will provide 180 degree views to watch for approaching clouds . All of this will ensure that Galaxy Shed members will have access to a reliable , secure remote telescope facility .

Why Marathon Texas ?
There are a couple of reasons for selecting this site to build our remote observatory . First , we want a very dark site . Marathon Texas is a Class I site for darkness . This is as dark as it gets . The darker the site , the deeper you can look into the cosmos . Second , we want to be as far south as possible in the Continental US . Marathon Texas is one of the most southerly locations in the Continental US that has a Class I site . Yes , you can get farther south in Florida , but the light pollution is terrible !
Marathon , TX - Clear Dark Sky Chart
A southerly location is good for two reasons :
1 ) the air is more stable at this latitude which provides for better imaging ,
2 ) you can image more objects by being able to see farther into the southern hemisphere . We could of course go a little bit farther south than Marathon , but then we run out of civilization . Remember , our telescopes are accessed over the Internet so we need to purchase an Internet connection and electricity from somewhere . In addition , we hope to have star party events throughout the year , so remaining within the Continental US and being near a community is important to facilitate these events . Marathon is a lovely , small community and a very relaxing get-away ! Check it out at : http : //www.visitmarathon.com/ .
Finally , this part of the US has over 300 nights per year of clear skies . Nothing is more frustrating than to have a beautiful telescope for looking at the night sky and have to cover it up for the night because you are clouded out . A major bummer ! Having access to a great telescope , at a great location , nearly year round , and accessible from the comfort of your home is an awesome thing ! That is , if you love astronomy .
How does it work ?
This is the coolest part ! The telescopes are permanently mounted in a roll-off roof observatory . This is basically a small garage , or a really big shed that has a roof that rolls off to one side to expose the telescopes to the night sky . You simply schedule your observing time , log in to the telescope interface via an Internet connection , and begin taking images of celestial wonders ! You can simply take pictures of deep sky objects or immerse yourself in hunting for super novae or discovering comets . Most importantly , you have control of the telescope and the imaging system . With our interface , you have both the telescope and the CCD camera right at your finger tips . Almost every other on-line telescope provider has you simply upload your targets and exposure times to “ the system ” and you wait for your pictures to show up at some download site . Galaxy Shed can do that too but it is really boring ! Now here is the best part……… . you are not alone . With Galaxy Shed , you have an observatory assistant right there with you . This assistant is both a technician and an astronomy educator . They can provide you with a guided tour of the night sky or simply be there for technical assistance . This is a feature that is unique to Galaxy Shed .
The idea in a logo . You can connect to the shed computer from anywhere over the web !
What is our goal ?
Galaxy Shed has one goal in mind…… . to enable people to learn astronomy in an engaging way . We are about teaching people astronomy with technology in a “ hands-on ” setting . That 's it . Now , there are other on-line telescope providers out there . And we will confess that their optical systems and cameras are a little bit better in some cases . Those systems are typically configured for high-end imaging . We do however use the same ( or equivalent ) telescope mounts , which is the single most important component in Internet astronomy . If you are an experienced astronomical imager , then take a look at some of the commercial options that are out there . Most of them are great facilities with good features . But if you want to learn astronomy and be part of a private use facility , then Galaxy Shed is for you .
Benefits
We kind of alluded to this in the “ Why Marathon Texas ” section above . To steal a real estate term , “ location , location , location ” ! So we have established that Galaxy Shed will be built in one of the last remaining great sites in the US . But here are some other benefits :
1 ) Access to great equipment . You will get access to some advanced , amateur telescope equipment . Each of our telescope systems costs around $ 30,000 . The configuration of our telescopes is even used in some professional and university settings .
2 ) Ease of use . We must admit that it is fun to own your own telescope . But if you do n't have your own observatory , it can get to be a pain to set up and tear down your telescope every night you want to use it . Also , if you are going to take pictures with your telescope , it can take a long time to get it polar aligned so that it will track well enough for long exposures . And remember that “ cloud ” thing we talked about… .. ? ! ? ! With a Galaxy Shed membership , you get access to a great telescope , in a great location , that you can quickly access from the comfort of wherever you and your computer may be located . And remember , Galaxy Shed will have a limited amount of potential users . So your ability to schedule time to use the telescope will not be in competition with everybody on the web !
3 ) You are not alone . Galaxy Shed members have the support and guidance of a real human while they are using the telescope . No need to submit a help desk ticket for assistance . Just put on your headset and start talking . We are right there for you .
4 ) Flexibility . The Galaxy Shed telescope can be used in a variety of ways . We prefer that members use the telescope in “ remote ” mode . This is where you have the mouse and literally drive the telescope to a target by pointing and clicking . But , you can also use the telescopes in “ robotic ” mode . This is where a user builds a scripted “ observing session ” from a graphic interface , uploads the script , and lets the telescope do the work . This mode of operation is typically used for doing research , like looking for super novae or hunting for asteroids or comets . Many advanced users would utilize this mode of operation . As you learn about the night sky and what the telescopes are capable of , you may want to set a goal to reach this level of sophisticated use . Another aspect of flexibility with Galaxy Shed telescopes is the types of images you can take . Most people that want to learn the night sky are happy to take black and white images . These are very easy to take and require shorter exposure times . This also allows you to take more images during an observing session . If however you desire to take awesome , deep-sky color images , you can do that too . These require longer imaging sessions and some extra work with imaging software . But with the level of equipment of Galaxy Shed telescopes and our great location , you can take beautiful deep-sky color images .
Yesterday , the Republican Party released its official platform , a rundown of stuff they like and do n't like . It 's sort of like a child 's Christmas wish list , except instead of wanting presents , the child wants to build insanely expensive war machines and stop abortion and gay marriage because the child is a theocratic megalomaniac . Individual candidates do n't have to endorse all of the positions described by the platform ( and actually , most people ignore it ) , but the guys who wrote it are important party officials and you can more or less assume that it represents “ normal ” Republican views . A lot of it is the freedom-and-American-capitalism-yay-we-must-combat-creeping-socialiasm-and-gays duckspeak you get used to if you spend any time consuming conservative media , but some of it is self-contradictory , bizarre , or just so fundamentally untrue that it deserves to be pointed out and documented so future historians can go , “ Yeah , that was pretty weird back then . Good thing the machines took over ! ” You can find the whole thing here if you want to sift through it for laughs/terrors yourself , but if you do n't have the patience for that , here 's some of the depressing wackiness I found .
We condemn the hate campaigns , threats of violence , and vandalism by proponents of same-sex marriage against advocates of traditional marriage and call for a federal investigation into attempts to deny religious believers their civil rights .
I wonder if Republican operatives have a name for the tactic where they accuse other people of doing exactly what they themselves are doing . It 's pretty much their go-to move—here , they take the decades of oppression and hate gay people have suffered and turn it around so that forcing people to grant equal rights to homosexuals is akin to denying civil rights . If you feel a twinge of conscience writing this stuff , you 're not ready to be a Republican operative . If you feel bile rising in your throat reading it , you 're not ready to read the rest of this platform .
Conservation is a conservative value . [ … ] Congress should reconsider whether parts of the federal government 's enormous landholdings and control of water in the West could be better used for ranching , mining , or forestry through private ownership .
Opening national parks and public land to logging and mining is the opposite of conservation . So that 's probably just a typo .
By uniting our government and our citizens , our foreign policy will secure freedom , keep America safe , and ensure that we remain the “ last best hope on Earth . ”
That last bit is in quotes because it 's a line from a message Abraham Lincoln sent to Congress before signing the Emancipation Proclamation . But I think in context here , “ last best hope on Earth ” means that the Republicans want to make sure that in the event of an alien invasion , the US military is humanity 's best hope for survival . Pretty badass of them to put that in the platform .
As a matter of principle , we oppose the creation of any new race-based governments within the United States .
Um , is the GOP coming out against weird racially homogenous enclaves that govern themselves ? Like a commune of Filipinos that rejects US law and murders non-Filipinos who trespass on their territory ? I guess that sort of thing should be stopped , if it 's happening—but maybe the word “ new ” means that they 're cool with the currently-existing race-based governments in the US , but there 's not room for one more .
The effectiveness of our foreign aid has been limited by the cultural agenda of the current Administration , attempting to impose on foreign countries , especially the peoples of Africa , legalized abortion and the homosexual rights agenda .
Another one that is just straight-up confusing . We 're exporting “ homosexual rights ” to Africa ?
After decades of inept one-party rule , [ Washington DC 's ] structural deficit demands congressional attention . [ … ] To ensure protection of the fundamental right to keep and bear arms , we call on the governing authority to pass laws consistent with the Supreme Court 's decisions in the District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicagocases , which upheld the fundamental right to keep and bear arms for self-defense .
Washington DC has been run by Democrats for some time , possibly because all the black people who live there do n't like Republicans ( for some reason , who knows why ? ) . So the GOP wants to get involved in running the city , and one of the policies they 'd pursue is making guns more available . No way that could go wrong , right ?
The Internet has unleashed innovation , enabled growth , and inspired freedom more rapidly and extensively than any other technological advance in human history . Its independence is its power .
[ … ]
We support the prohibition of gambling over the Internet [ … ] The Internet must be made safe for children .
The GOP is the party of freedom and independence from government interference . They will not tolerate any efforts to suppress anything on the internet—unless they do n't like it . Then they 're 100 percent behind strict regulations .
Liberals do not understand this simple axiom : criminals behind bars can not harm the general public .
Except for when they run meth rings from prison .
Public authorities must regain control of their correctional institutions , for we can not allow prisons to become ethnic or racial battlegrounds .
When the GOP says “ public authorities ” I wonder if they are talking about taking the prison system back from the private operators who , increasingly , are the ones who actually have control over correctional institutions . Something tells me they are n't talking about that and are instead just stringing together words that sound good .
We call for a moratorium on the development of any new major and costly regulations until a Republican Administration reviews existing rules to ensure that they have a sound basis in science and will be cost-effective .
This sounds like an embrace of empirical facts , but remember , these are Republicans . “ Sound basis in science ” actually means , “ Approved by a council of Christian elders . ”
The public must never again be left holding the bag for Wall Street giants , which is why we decry the current Administration 's record of over-regulation and selective intervention .
The bailouts that left us “ holding the bag ” happened in 2008 , when Bush was in office . Clearly , we 're at the point in the platform where they figured , “ What the fuck , it 's late , no one will read this thing , let 's just start lying . ”
[ Abstinence education ] is effective , science-based , and empowers teens to achieve optimal health outcomes and avoid risks of sexual activity .
Yeah , we really are in the “ making stuff up ” section . “ Effective ” ? “ Science-based '' ? Not really . Unless , again , you use the Republican definition of `` science . ''
While our relations with Vietnam have improved , and U.S. investment is welcomed , we need unceasing efforts to obtain an accounting for , and repatriation of the remains of , Americans who gave their lives in the cause of Vietnamese freedom .
“ Hey , remember when we were in your country and burned all those villages and killed your people and supported a fraudulently-elected leader because he served our interests ? Turns out , we left some bodies over there in all the confusion . Could you find them for us ? ”
We must likewise expect the Pakistan government to sever any connection between its security and intelligence forces and the insurgents .
“ Hey guys , you know that intelligence agency that rigs elections , assassinates leaders it does n't like , and funds terrorism ? It would be great if you could deal with that . K thx . ”
While the twentieth century was undeniably an American century—with strong leadership , adherence to the principles of freedom and democracy our Founders ' enshrined in our nation 's Declaration of Independence and Constitution , and a continued reliance on Divine Providence—the twenty-first century will be one of American greatness as well .
This says , literally , “ As long as we rely on God Almighty 's favor , we will be OK. ” What other political parties around the world casually throw around lines like that ? The Muslim Brotherhood ?
Congress—the Senate through its ratifying power and the House through its appropriating power—shall reject agreements whose long-range impact on the American family is ominous or unclear . These include the U.N. Convention on Women 's Rights , the Convention on the Rights of the Child…
Certain elements in the Republican Party are obsessed with the UN taking over America , so in their minds documents that say , “ Let 's give women rights equal to men , and make sure children are not exploited and abused ” are “ ominous. ” That 's what listening only to far-right , super conservative media outlets will do to you . I 'm explaining this plainly because at this point , I 'm all out of sarcasm . Jesus Christ , you guys . This is the platform of one of the two MAJOR PARTIES in America , the most powerful nation on the planet .
We oppose the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or any other scheme to abolish or distort the procedures of the Electoral College .
When your party is advocating a bunch of shit that a lot of the country does n't like because it 's hateful and/or stupid , it 's probably a good idea to be against a popular vote .

Activision and Marvel Entertainment have announced a new video game based on the upcoming feature film The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is coming to Wii U and 3DS next spring .
Developed by Beenox — the studio also responsible for the Wii U and Wii versions of last year 's The Amazing Spider-Man — to coincide with the release of film , this new third-person action-adventure game promises to provide players with an improved open-world gameplay experience that takes place in the webslinger 's usual stomping ground of New York .
The story will not focus exclusively on the events of the new film , and will instead offer an alternative perspective . If it 's anything like the last game then it could well be set after the second movie .
Thomas Wilson , Co-Studio Head of Beenox , gave the following comment about the new title in a press release earlier today :
The first The Amazing Spider-Man game gave players their own beautifully animated , free-roaming city of Manhattan to traverse and explore – a playground of majestic scale in which to live out our common hero fantasies ... and the overwhelming message from fans was : ‘ MORE ! ' That 's what our team is working toward with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 – we 're giving gamers more abilities , more upgrades , more challenges , and more freedom to progress . And with the game launching alongside the new movie , offering an expanded interactive experience beyond the film , fans of the franchise wo n't want to miss playing it .
It 's unlikely that overwhelming message came from Australia , as the country sadly never got to play the first title . Hopefully The Amazing Spider-Man 2 will make it Down Under .
A specific release date has not yet been announced for either version . As per usual , we 'll be sure to let you know as soon as we receive word .
UFC president Dana White has made no secret of his big ambitions for the next year : a pair of `` super fights '' between Middleweight champ Anderson Silva and Welterweight champ Georges St. Pierre followed by Silva vs. Light Heavyweight champ Jon Jones .
Of course many things have to go right for any of that to happen .
First off , Silva has to get past Middleweight contender Chris Weidman at UFC 162 this July in Las Vegas .
White talked to the media following UFC 158 and had the following statements from Weidman to relate :
`` I talked to Chris Weidman myself , and he looked me right in the eye and said , ' I 'm telling you , I apologize that I 'm going to f * * k up your super fights and be your next champion . But what I will do for you is I 'll give him an immediate rematch in Madison Square Garden as soon as he loses . '
`` If you take Anderson Silva out of the mix , the superfights are all gone , '' said White .
Just last month White was talking up his `` super fight '' plans , `` GSP is going to defend his title against Nick Diaz , Anderson Silva will defend his title this summer , and before the end of this year , we will see a super fight with either GSP and Anderson Silva , or Anderson Silva and Jon Jones , '' White said this past month . `` One of them is coming . ''

The exodus of major corporations from the corporate front group American Legislative Exchange Council ( ALEC ) has made headlines nationwide as the group 's agenda has been increasingly scrutinized by the general public .
But as these corporations have fled ALEC , there has also been one other little-noticed exodus from the group : that of legislators . SourceWatch and Keystone Progress have been tracking the defections of lawmakers . Here are 28 who have left so far :
– Sen. Nan Orrock ( D-GA ) : “ As a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council for several years , having joined ALEC with the primary goal of better understanding the corporate-dominated organization , I know first-hand that ALEC is not the innocuous organization it claims to be. ” [ 4/17/12 ] – Sen. Greg Cromer ( R-LA ) : “ ‘ It has been brought to my attention that there have been meetings and/or activities with ALEC staff members within the state of Louisiana that I have not been privy to , ' Cromer wrote in his resignation letter that went out as an email to key lawmakers and staffers. ” [ 4/17/12 ] – Sen. Mike Colona ( D-MO ) : “ ‘ Their agenda is radical and wrong for Missouri . I was a member and saw firsthand the sort of extreme legislation they push on state legislators around the country , ' Cromer said in a statement to the organization “ Progress Missouri. ” [ 4/12/12 ] – Pennsylvania Reps. Kate Harper ( R ) , Sandra Major ( R ) , Mark Mustio ( R ) , Harry Readshaw ( D ) , and Sen. John Pippy ( R ) [ 4/26/12 ] – Sen. George Muñoz ( D-NM ) [ 4/20/12 ] – Rep. Ted Vick ( D-SC ) : “ Recent revelations concerning ALEC 's funding sources from radical elements have proven to be the final straw for me . ALEC has become too partisan and too extreme. ” [ 4/24/12 ] – Nebraska Senators Danielle Conrad ( D ) , Tony Fulton ( R ) , Health Mello ( D ) , and Jeremy Norquist ( D ) [ 4/26/12 ] – Texas Democratic Party Reps. Alma Allen , Armando Martinez , Dawnna Dukes , Hubert Vo , Harold Dutton , Chente , Quintanilla , Eddie Rodriguez , José Menéndez , Ruth Jones McClendon , Eric Johnson , Tracy King , Ryan Guillen [ 4/2012 ] – Rep. Jennifer Selig ( D-UT ) [ 4/9/12 ] – Rep. Kevin Van De Wege ( D-WA ) : “ My membership status is increasingly becoming a divisive issue this year , and I prefer to put my time and energy into efforts that unite our district rather than divide it. ” [ 4/11/12 ]
We applaud these legislators for leaving the corporate front group , which has been responsible for pushing destructive special interest legislation , from climate change denial in schools , to anti-union and anti-consumer bills , to the controversial Voter ID and Stand Your Ground laws .
It is time to lighten the load a little . Here is your chance to purchase trees from my private collection.I continue to strongly resist the urge to create any kind of business out of my hobby . However , the time has come for me to move a few trees so that I can lighten the care load and continue to do the things I like most in bonsai ... the creation process and developing material.I am going to give Bnutters the first opportunity at these trees . I will post here and give you folks a shot first before posting in other venues.One of the issues is going to be shipping . I do n't ship ... please do n't ask . What I am willing to do is deliver any tree purchased to the Carolina Bonsai Expo in Asheville this Oct. or to the Winter Silhouette show in Kannapolis in Dec. Of course you are also welcome to come to the garden to ick up any purchase . I might also be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet someone to deliver trees.I will be posting the various trees I have for sale in this thread . Please PM me if you would like to purchase . For now , I would encourage general questions to be posted on this thread for the good of all . I would prefer payment via paypal but we can talk about alternatives .
Charles Murray writes in the Wall Street Journal :
Why the SAT Is n't a ‘ Student Affluence Test '
A lot of the apparent income effect on standardized tests is owed to parental IQ—a fact that needs addressing . By CHARLES MURRAY
March 24 , 2015 7:11 p.m . ET … The results are always the same : The richer the parents , the higher the children 's SAT scores . This has led some to view the SAT as merely another weapon in the inequality wars , and to suggest that SAT should actually stand for “ Student Affluence Test. ” It 's a bum rap . All high-quality academic tests look as if they 're affluence tests . It 's inevitable . Parental IQ is correlated with children 's IQ everywhere . In all advanced societies , income is correlated with IQ . Scores on academic achievement tests are always correlated with the test-takers ' IQ . Those three correlations guarantee that every standardized academic-achievement test shows higher average test scores as parental income increases . But those correlations also mean that a lot of the apparent income effect is actually owed to parental IQ . The SAT does n't have IQ information on the parents . But the widely used National Longitudinal Survey of Youth contains thousands of cases with data on family income , the mother 's IQ , and her children 's performance on the math and reading tests of the Peabody Individual Achievement Test battery , which test the same skills as the math and reading tests of the SAT . For the SAT , shifting to more than $ 200,000 of family income from less than $ 20,000 moved the average score on the combined math and reading tests to the 74th percentile from the 31st—a jump of 43 percentiles . The same income shift moved the average PIAT score to the 82nd percentile from the 30th—a jump of 52 percentiles . Now let 's look at the income effect in the PIAT when the mother 's IQ is statistically held constant at the national average of 100 . Going to a $ 200,000 family income from a $ 1,000 family income raises the score only to the 76th percentile from the 50th—an increase of 26 percentiles . More important , almost all of the effect occurs for people making less than $ 125,000 . Going to $ 200,000 from $ 125,000 moves the PIAT score only to the 76th percentile from the 73rd—a trivial change . Beyond $ 200,000 , PIAT scores go down as income increases . In assessing the meaning of this , it is important to be realistic about the financial position of families making $ 125,000 who are also raising children . They were in the top quartile of income distribution in 2013 , but they probably live in an unremarkable home in a middle-class neighborhood and send their children to public schools . And yet , given mothers with equal IQs , the child whose parents make $ 125,000 has only a trivial disadvantage , if any , when competing with children from families who are far more wealthy . Why should almost all of the income effect be concentrated in the first hundred thousand dollars or so ? The money itself may help , but another plausible explanation is that the parents making , say , $ 60,000 are likely to be regularly employed , with all the things that regular employment says about a family . The parents are likely to be conveying advantages other than IQ such as self-discipline , determination and resilience— “ grit , ” as this cluster of hard-to-measure qualities is starting to be called in the technical literature . Families with an income of , say , $ 15,000 are much more likely to be irregularly employed or subsisting on welfare , with negative implications for that same bundle of attributes . Somewhere near $ 100,000 the marginal increments in grit associated with greater income taper off , and further increases in income make little difference . Let 's throw parental education into the analysis so that we can examine the classic indictment of the SAT : the advantage a child of a well-educated and wealthy family ( Sebastian , I will call him ) has over the child of a modestly educated working-class family ( Jane ) . Sebastian 's parents are part of the fabled 1 % , with $ 400,000 in income , and his mother has a college degree . But her IQ is only average . Jane 's family has an income of just $ 40,000 and mom has only a high-school diploma . But mom 's IQ is 135 , putting her in the top 1 % of the IQ distribution . Which child is likely to test higher ? Sebastian is predicted to be at the 68th percentile on the PIAT . Jane is predicted to be at the 78th percentile . If you want high test scores , “ choose ” a smart but poor mother over a rich but dumb one—or over a rich and merely ungifted one .
One way of analyzing the effect of “ privilege ” — wealth and parental investment — on test scores and outcomes as adults would be to check how much an only child is advantaged relative to a child in a larger family .
For example , consider my wife v. myself . Harvard social scientist Robert D. Putnam 's new book Our Kids uses a super-simplified definition of class based solely on parents ' educational levels . By Putnam 's standards , my wife , whose mother and father both had masters degrees , would have grown up upper middle class . In contrast , my father had a junior college 2-year diploma and my mother had only a high school diploma , so I 'd be lower middle class , I guess .
On the other hand , I was an only child , while my wife has three siblings . So , growing up , I never felt terribly strapped for money nor , especially , for parental time and energy , while my wife 's upbringing was more exigent .
Although you do n't hear about it much now that small families are the norm , back in my Baby Boom childhood , the privileged nature of being an only child — only children were widely said to be spoiled — was a frequent subject of conversation . This was especially true since I went to Catholic schools for 12 years , where very large families were common . For example , one friend , the class clown and best singer ( his rendition of “ MacNamara 's Band ” in 4th grade remains a vivid memory ) , had eight siblings in his Irish family .
How privileged was I by being one of a family of three rather than one of a family of eleven ?
My friend from the huge family has had a long , successful career as a TV sportscaster , along with some TV and movie credits as a comic actor . If you live in L.A. , you 've seen him on TV dozens of times over the last 30 years . So , growing up in a huge family did n't ruin his life.On the other hand , if he 'd been an only child with a real stage mother for a mom , I could imagine somebody with that much presence ( his affect is reminiscent of that of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman or of a straight Nathan Lane ) becoming a semi-famous character actor with maybe one or two Best Supporting Actor nominations .
Back during my more egalitarian childhood , people did n't think that much about tutoring and Tiger Mothering , but , to some extent it works .
For example , I have had a pleasant life , but looking back I can see wasted opportunities . After my freshman year at Rice I came home and got a summer job at Burger King . After my sophomore year , I repaired dental equipment . Finally , after my junior year I worked as the assistant to the Chief Financial Officer of a big weedwacker manufacturing company . But what did the Burger King and repair jobs do for me other than teach me not to be a fry cook or repairman ? These days I would have plotted to get internships in Silicon Valley or D.C. or Wall Street and had my parents pay my rent .
So , yes , I do think I was privileged to have the extra resources I was afforded by being an only child , even if I did n't exploit my privileges as cunningly as I could have .
Quantifying how big a privilege that was seems challenging but doable . In fact , I 'm sure somebody has done it already , and I invite commenters to link to studies .
It seems to me that measuring the effects of being an only child ought to be the first thing we do when we decide to theorize about Privilege .
By the way , however , there are other factors that may matter more in determining how Privileged you are . For example , my parents happened to turn out to be winners in the Great American Random Lottery of choosing a neighborhood to buy a home in during the 1950s — the demographics of their neighborhood have barely changed since the 1950s .
In contrast , my in-laws had the bad luck to draw what nightmarishly turned out to be one of the shortest straws in America : the Austin neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago . It was almost all white until Martin Luther King came to Chicago in 1966 to demand integration . Being good liberals , my in-laws joined a pro-integration group of neighbors who all swore to not engage in white flight . But after three years and three felonies against their small children , my in-laws were pretty much financially wiped out by trying to make integration work in Austin . And thus after they finally sold out at a massive loss , they wound up living in a farmhouse without running water for the next two years .
Bizarrely , while the once-pleasant street where my wife grew up in Austin looks nowadays like a post-apocalyptic wasteland , a couple of miles to the west is Superior Street in Oak Park , IL where my father grew up in the 1920s . It looks like an outdoor Frank Lloyd Wright museum today . The Wright district was saved by Oak Park 's secret , illegal , and quite effective “ black-a-block ” racial quota system imposed on realtors to keep Oak Park mostly white ( and , these days , heavily gay ) .
So a not insignificant fraction of White Privilege in 2015 actually consists of whether or not the Eye of Sauron turned upon your parents ' neighborhood or not .

Have to solve a problem ? Try taking a nap .
But it has to be the right kind of nap — one that includes rapid eye movement , or REM , sleep , the kind that includes dreams .
Researchers led by Sara C. Mednick , an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California , San Diego , gave 77 volunteers word-association tests under three before-and-after conditions : spending a day without a nap , napping without REM sleep and napping with REM sleep . Just spending the day away from the problem improved performance ; people who stayed awake did a little better on the 5 p.m. session than they had done on the 9 a.m. test . Taking a nap without REM sleep also led to slightly better results . But a nap that included REM sleep resulted in nearly a 40 percent improvement over the pre-nap performance .
The study , published June 8 in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found that those who had REM sleep took longer naps than those who napped without REM , but there was no correlation between total sleep time and improved performance . Only REM sleep helped .
“ Dreams are fanciful , ” Dr. Mednick said . “ They incorporate strange ideas that you would never have put together in waking life . In REM sleep , it becomes more likely that ideas might come together in a solution . ”
Description
utf8rewind is a cross-platform and open source C library designed to extend the default string handling functions and add support for UTF-8 encoded text .
Download
utf8rewind-1.2.1.zip ( 3.17 MB )
Clone in Mercurial
hg clone https : //bitbucket.org/knight666/utf8rewind utf8rewind
Summary
In this release , we have fixed critical issues in the handling of invalid input that could result in unhandled exceptions or crashes . Users of utf8rewind 1.2.0 are strongly advised to upgrade to 1.2.1 as soon as possible . This release is binary compatible with 1.2.0 and can be used as a drop-in replacement .
Bug fixes
One of the bugs that has been fixed in this release is a crash that could occur if the output buffer for one of the conversion functions ( utf8towide , utf8toutf16 and utf8toutf32 ) had an incorrect length and was not a multiple of two or four . The functions will also no longer read past the length of the input buffer if the buffer has an incorrect length specified .
Seeking backwards now deals with overlong or erroneously encoded codepoints correctly .
In-depth
The road to this release was longer than expected and this can be be attributed almost entirely to unit testing . Because bugs in the functions were not caught by unit tests , all tests related to these functions had to be examined , reconsidered and , for a large part , rewritten . This , as you can imagine , took a considerable amount of time . All in all , just under 750 unit tests were added for this release and countless others were refactored .
While the issues with the functions were found and fixed quickly , a lot of time was put into making sure the bugs could not occur anywhere else . While working on these tests , a number of issues were found when seeking backwards in UTF-8 encoded strings . These issues have been addressed as well in this release .
Running the new tests on the previous version shows a significant amount of tests ( 8.4 % ) that either crashed or returned the wrong results .
Test count
As you can see in this chart , the number of tests has been increasing on every release :
In fact , this release marks the second largest increase in total number of tests , only surpassed by 1.2.0 's monstrous 1119 additional tests . Maintaining these tests is starting to become a real issue , especially when they have to be refactored .

What To Do Now That The Heartbleed Bug Exposed The Internet
Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto
With a name like Heartbleed , it 's no surprise it 's bad . A vulnerability in OpenSSL — the Internet 's most commonly used cryptographic library — has been bleeding out information , 64 kilobytes at a time , since March 2012 .
`` I would classify it as possibly the top bug that has hit the Internet that I 've encountered , because of it being so widespread , because it 's so hard to detect , '' says Andy Grant , a security analyst at iSEC Partners .
Are you affected ? Well , users may not even realize they are using OpenSSL . But if you 've ever noticed that websites you access show an `` https '' address , and a lock appears next to the address , you 're on OpenSSL .
OpenSSL encrypts your data , including passwords and personal information , when it travels to a server . That means you may enter a password into your online banking site , but as the information for your transaction travels to your bank , it 's jumbled up and made indecipherable — encrypted — as it 's traveling through the Internet . This is supposed to keep hackers from eavesdropping .
Just before the bug was publicly disclosed , the people who maintain OpenSSL had fixed the vulnerability . But it 's up to Internet companies to enter fixes for their own software — `` swapping out '' the cyberlocks that protected their data .
`` You 're probably protected from this point going forward , '' NPR 's news applications developer Jeremy Bowers told member station WUNC on Wednesday . `` The part that is dangerous is the [ open vulnerability of the ] previous two years and the possibility that at any point since 2012 that your [ logins ] for various places were compromised . ''
While individual users ca n't patch the holes , keep in mind some general Internet hygiene that we should be doing anyway .
Today we are featuring Wajid from Cloudways who would like to share 8 tips for protecting your Magento store against brute-force attacks .
Introduction
Brute-force attacks are becoming very common these days . Most websites are by default vulnerable to such attacks . If you use Magento , WordPress , Drupal or any other popular web software , it 's not unlikely to see hundreds of attempts being carried out by hackers to crack through your website each day as “ admin ” , “ administrator ” or “ root ” .
A brute-force attack is one of the simplest methods to gain access to a website because other than patience it does not require any additional skill or resources . An automated script tries several different combinations of usernames and passwords , over and over again , until the login security is breached .
Brute-force attacks are simply trial and error . During such an attack , certain permutations and combinations of usernames and passwords are used by hackers to attempt to break into an account . Key in understanding the widespread usage of these attacks is that it is relatively simple to add new targets and new permutations at very little cost .
Luckily , it is also relatively simple to protect your Magento store against such an attack . Here are 8 tips for adopting security measures to protect your or your client 's precious Magento store .
1 . Use a strong password
The best way to protect your Magento store against a brute-force attack is to – and advise other administrators to – use a strong password . There are various tools available to do this and they are only a simple Google search away ( this one is pretty good ) .
Though not necessarily effective given the nature of a brute-force attack , you should change your password ( s ) on a frequent basis given your previous password might end up on a common dictionary list used in brute-force attacks over time .
2 . Use a custom admin path
By default , you can access a Magento store backend by navigating to domain.com/admin in the browser . Because the default Magento backend URL is common knowledge in brute-force suites , you can easily get some advantage by cutting the low-hanging fruit .
Changing the admin path can be done in three steps :
Open the / app / etc / local . xml configuration file Locate < ! [ CDATA [ admin ] ] > and replace “ admin ” with the path you would like to use . For example , if you change it to youradmin , the admin path will now become domain . com / youradmin . After you have changed this URL , refresh the Magento caches .
3 . Restrict admin access
Another step is to restrict access to the Magento backend only to a few certain IPs . You can do this by protecting the admin path on a webserver level . This will point you in the right direction for Apache and this for nginx .
4 . Secure local.xml
The local.xml file is one of the most important web files to be secure . This file contains all kinds of sensitive data like the database credentials and the encryption key . If the local.xml file is visible for the public , you have a problem .
To check local.xml file visibility , visit the following URL and check whether any XML is being displayed : http : //domain.com/app/etc/local.xml
To secure the local.xml file , I recommend to 1 ) block web access to the app directory and 2 ) change local.xml its file permissions to 600 ( -rw ) . This will limit read and write access for the outside world .
5 . Require SSL for all login pages
Since Magento is used for e-commerce transactions , the data is often very sensitive . This is why it is recommended that all of your login details should pass through a secure connection .
Implementing an SSL certificate is needed to secure sensitive data such as : credit card information , customers ' information , log in credentials for both administrators and customers and so forth . You can obtain an SSL certificate from any verified Certificate Authority .
6 . Use the latest Magento version
There are many reasons to update the version of Magento . By updating any software or application , you will get the latest security features . It fixes loopholes that might provide hackers a way into your store .
7 . Pick a good hashing algorithm
MD5 was the traditional algorithm of choice for passwords on the web , because it was once considered secure . As technology and computing power has improved , the MD5 algorithm was left behind . However , there are better alternatives available . SHA-256 , Whirlpool , and Tiger-192 would all be good options for you .
8 . Secure the Magento Connect Manager
Magento Connect Manager is a great way to quickly install extensions , but it also poses a security risk as it is a well known entry point for brute-force attacks . Like your admin path , my suggestion is to change the downloader path to make it hard for hackers to force their way in . You can also restrict the Connect Manager on an IP address basis .
Bonus : Get a secure Magento hosting server
Lastly , your infrastructure is also a part of this equation . Every server has an operating system and server stack . These pieces of software also require regular updates . If your Magento hosting provider is not keeping an eye on the server and its security , then you are sitting on a ticking timebomb . This is where Cloudways leads the pack in the Magento hosting industry .
As a Magento Cloud Hosting Platform , Cloudways provides managed and secure cloud hosting services on the top of reliable cloud infrastructure , namely Google Compute Engine , Amazon Web Services , and DigitalOcean . This means you do n't have to worry about the security of your server . You only have to focus on the development and safety of your Magento store .
And you ? Do you have a tip for protecting your Magento Store from brute-force attacks ?
The Rodong Sinmun , the official mouthpiece of North Korea 's Workers ' Party , printed the photo of the meeting of security personnel of the North Korean People 's Army on Nov. 21 edition . The six men sitting to the left and right of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the leadership podium are considered to be the key figures responsible for the purge of Jang Song-thaek . [ Rodong Sinmun ]
The execution of Jang Song-thaek - the uncle of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and the second-most powerful man in the country - unveiled the rise of a new powerful and elite group behind the Communist state 's young ruler.A senior South Korean intelligence source told the JoongAng Ilbo yesterday that six people were critical in influencing Kim to dismiss and subsequently execute his uncle . A handful of senior intelligence officials in the military and leaders of the Workers ' Party emerged as the prime initiators of Jang 's dramatic downfall over recent weeks. “ The meeting of security personnel of the [ North ] Korean People 's Army in Pyongyang last month , attended by Kim , was the prelude to Jang 's purge , ” said the intelligence source.North Korean media covered the meeting , devoting the entire front and second pages of the Rodong Sinmun 's Nov. 21 issue to it . The meeting , hosted at the April 25 House of Culture on Nov. 20 , was the second of its kind . The first meeting took place in 1993.The reports stated that Kim had emphasized the importance of strengthening the military 's security operations , but the North did not elaborate further . The meeting of the military intelligence officials was hosted abruptly for the first time in two decades , and the intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States paid special attention to possible changes in the North Korean leadership.North Korea specialists in the National Intelligence Service concluded that the meeting took place shortly after Jang and his confidantes were purged . In a briefing to the National Assembly on Dec. 3 , the South Korean spy agency reported that Jang 's two closest aides , Ri Ryong-ha and Jang Su-kil , were publicly executed in late November . South Korean intelligence officials believe the young Kim received an oath of fealty from the top military intelligence officials at the Nov. 20 meeting in Pyongyang following the purges.There , the six key men sat next to Kim on the leadership podium . The young ruler sat in the middle , with three men on his left and three on his right . Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae , the director of the Korean People 's Army Politburo , sat to the right of Kim . Choe was considered one of two guardians to Kim , along with Jang.Gen . Kim Won-hong , head of the Ministry of State Security , the highest North Korean intelligence authority , and Lt. Gen. of the Korean People 's Army Ryom Chol-song sat in the next seats . Left of Kim sat Lt. Gen. Jo Kyong-chol ; Maj. Gen. Kim Su-gil ; and Hwang Pyong-so , deputy director of the Organization and Guidance Department of the Workers ' Party , in charge of military appointments and organization.According to North Korean news reports , Choe gave the opening remarks , and Jo gave a briefing to the North Korean leader.Ryom made a conspicuous contribution to the Rodong Sinmun on Wednesday , asking Kim to allow the military to be in charge of punishing Jang and his faction for their wrongdoings . As he proposed , Jang was executed the following day after a special court martial . The court martial was also hosted by the Ministry of State Security , led by Kim Won-hong.Following the meeting of the security personnel of the North Korean military on Nov. 20 , Kim visited Samjiyon near Mount Paektu . Although the North said the trip was to inspect the winter sports facilities and military units , South Korean intelligence officials believe Kim discussed follow-up measures for Jang 's case at a special retreat there.Photos of Kim 's trip to Samjiyon show that Kim Won-hong and Hwang Pyong-so accompanied him with other top Workers ' Party officials.Kim Yang-gon , a secretary of the Central Committee and head of the United Front Department of the North 's ruling party , was also seen in the photos . Han Kwang-sang , director of the party 's Finance and Accounting Department , and deputy directors Pak Tae-song , Kim Byong-ho and Ma Won-chun , also accompanied Kim , indicating that they have risen to power under the young leader 's rule.South Korean intelligence officials concluded that the six men highlighted at the meeting of North Korean military security personnel and the officials who participated in the Samjiyon trip will be the core of the new elite group following Jang 's death.The military officials are expected to lead efforts to ensure regime security and protect Kim 's safety , while the men from the Samjiyon trip will be expected to calm public sentiment in the aftermath of Jang 's execution. “ Choe Ryong-hae and Kim Won-hong are the overlapping members of the two groups , ” said the intelligence source . “ They will be the two highest and most powerful backers of Kim Jong-un 's leadership in the post-Jang Song-thaek era.BY LEE YOUNG-JONG , SER MYO-JA [ myoja @ joongang.co.kr ]
Seven tips and traps that make D7 developers go : - ) and @ # $ & * !
When a steam train like D8 rolls your way , resistance is futile . You either jump aside -- and some `` big '' names have done so -- or you jump aboard .
For D7 developers wanting to join the D8 ride , this article critiques some common D8 misconceptions , hopefully making onboarding less precarious .
1 . `` I need to learn a lot about Symfony . ''
FALSE ! Unless you work on core you need to learn just as much about HTTP Kernel and Symfony CMF , as you learned about the internals of D7 's core menu system , i.e . nothing .
And is n't that little , easy-to-find and easy-to-read .routing.yml file an improvement over the now much leaner hook_menu ( ) ? So stop whinging .
Oh , and if it makes you feel better ... a lot of code perceived to be Symfony , is in fact home grown core D8 .
D8 : +1
2 . `` I 'm using my debugger to step through all this container code , trying to figure out how dependency injection is implemented and I 'm getting frustrated and do n't understand . ''
Stop doing that ! Just accept that when you put your class in the right spot , it will be sucked into the system automagically and leave it at that . Ride the tiger , do n't fight the tiger . You did n't need to know how a Views filter handler in D7 got `` injected '' either , but that did n't stop you writing one .
D8 : +1
3 . `` My hooks are dead and gone and I need to put my implementations into classes . ''
Yeah , so what ? `` Opgeruimd staat netjes ! `` * ) is a Dutch saying that is harder to translate into English than copying your functions from .module and .inc files and pasting them into a .php file that resides in a well-organised auto-findable class file structure . Then put class … extends … { … } around the contents and adjust the method signatures where necessary .
Get over it and get coding . Start here : D7 to D8 upgrade : fields , widgets and formatters .
D8 : +1
4 . `` Ok , so I 've started on my first D8 field formatter ( or widget or field_type or whatever ) class and I get error messages I do n't understand . ''
You mean like this one :
Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationException : [ Syntax Error ] Expected PlainValue , got ' ) ' at position 649 in class Drupal\leaflet\Plugin\field\formatter\LeafletDefaultFormatter .
Yep , not very clear I admit . `` At position 649… '' -- are they expecting us to count the number of characters ? And from where ? What about a line number ? This error is probably due to you inserting a superfluous comma before your closing parenthesis . This is precisely what the Drupal coding standards insist on for arrays , but it 's bad in Doctrine annotations .
However worse than a vague error message is no error at all and your class not working . For classes other than the stock standard , it can be tedious to find the correct spot in the directory hierarchy for the class to be noticed by the auto-loader . Some diagnostic tool would be welcome .
D8 : -1
5 . `` Because D8 requires PHP 5.3.10 or later can I now safely employ some of the language features that 5.2.x did n't have ? ''
Yes ! Most notably const , javascript-style closures ( anonymous functions ) and the nifty binary shorthand for the tertiary conditional operator ? :
$ value = somelongarrayname [ $ key ] [ 0 ] [ 'name ' ] ? somelongarrayname [ $ key ] [ 0 ] [ 'name ' ] : 'empty ' ;
becomes :
$ value = somelongarrayname [ $ key ] [ 0 ] [ 'name ' ] ? : 'empty ' ;
Better ?
D8 : +1
6 . `` { { Twig } } is breaking by back . ''
Oh come off it ! Twig is easy and syntactically not a great departure from PHPTemplate . But your templates end up cleaner and easier to work with for themers . Check out this one-page tutorial . See ? It 's not hard .
Then copy an existing core .html.twig template and adjust to fit your needs .
D8 : +1
7 . `` I need to learn Oh-Oh ... ''
Yes , Object Oriented basics would be good . Copying & pasting and following patterns found in other modules will get you started producing working D8 code . To understand what overriding is and not to forget to call the parent in the first line of the function body will be a bonus . So read up and do n't be baffled by symbols like : : and - > or the use of camelCase .
Also , look at it this way : in the process of learning D8 , you 'll learn how the rest of the world does program . Not a bad skill to have ...
D8 : +1
To summarise , in the words of the goddess of victory : Just do it !
Add your own D8 tips and traps to the comments below !

Lionsgate 's Zygi Kamasa and Elba will judge the entries alongside a panel of industry experts . The winner receives a paid option with Green Door Pictures and Lionsgate , with a view to developing the series for production . Submissions are now open through August 8 . A live event later in the year will feature rehearsed readings from three finalists ' scripts before the winner is announced that evening . The readings will be performed and directed by high caliber professionals alongside up-and-coming actors in order to offer them a similar platform and round off the project 's overall commitment to supporting and elevating talent . There are two categories for entrants . The first is for writers with professional TV credits , but whose original series , miniseries or stand-alone ideas have not been produced or broadcast by a UK broadcaster , including online platforms . The second category is for those with a background in theater , short form content or film , but who have no UK broadcast credits .
REX/Shutterstock English footballer Jamie Vardy may still be smarting from last night 's Euro 2016 ouster at the hands of Iceland , but the biopic of his incredible rise is gaining momentum . The King 's Speech producer Bedlam Productions has joined with Knightsbridge Films to tell the story of the striker who ascended from the sport 's lower divisions to help Leicester City win the 2015-2016 Premier League championship against huge odds , while becoming a record-breaking goal-scorer for the club . Knightsbridge had earlier secured the rights to Vardy 's upcoming autobiography . Adrian Butchart ( Goal ! ) will produce for Knightsbridge , with Simon Egan and Gareth Ellis-Unwin producing for Bedlam . Unwin recently produced the BAFTA-nominated and BIFA-winning war drama Kajaki : The True Story .
We 're one week closer to production hardware shipping with our improved firmware . This past week has been an adventure in closing out any questions by testing our hardware and documenting firmware . Brent is realized just how much firmware he has written for this project . He 's been documenting C code on doxygen for several days straight now ! I have been digging away at closing out hardware questions from Rev B Faraday units in an effort to shore-up any questions about Rev C design which our first users will obtain . We hope you all are enjoying our efforts to stay as transparent as possible with Faraday . This is fun for us and we hope that those interested can learn from our hardware and software design processes .
We hope you all are enjoying our efforts to stay as transparent as possible with Faraday
Firmware Documentation
Clone the Firmware repository and checkout the remote branch “ Documentation ” . The documentation folder has an index.html in it which is the start to the C documentation . Brent is still very much tidying it all up but his work is a large effort that has helped him clean up the code and identify more areas for improvement once we go back to update the Firmware .
Since Faraday ships with a bootloader , any future firmware updates post-shipping can simply be loaded on via USB which makes any upgrades simple . We will provide all instructions and automate it as much as possible .
Production Hardware
Hardware is shaping up ! Check out the Production branch of the GitHub Hardware repository to see my latest efforts . I 've made several changes per my Hardware Issue # 1 ticket which includes some highlights
ADC5 channel is unfiltered for microphone use
Flash IC has been validated in firmware to work so we know the hardware is correct
P3 . [ 0,1,2 ] and P4 . [ 5,6,7 ] swapped so GD0 could be routed to external IO pins with port matting on IT # 6 This allows an eventual firmware update to directly send/receive data with IO pin to RF hardware allowing to offload of processing for high throughput applications !
Logo 's updated including addition of open source hardware logo ( not certifying with OSHW at this time )
Open Source Hardware Logo
Brent and I loved the OSHW idea that Dave Jones of the EEVBlog promoted which suggested that hardware projects put letters indicating which documents they are providing on each cog pin . Using the very handy logo auto-generator we added our own logo to Faraday . We plan on being the leading amateur radio open source digital radio . Therefore our cogs are FULL :
S = Schematic
P = PCB ( Rev B in this post )
F = Firmware and software
M = Mechanical CAD files ( considered PCB mechanical drawings now , eventual CAD files when we get to it . Anyone wants to help some EE 's out : ) ?
D = Design Documentation ( hardware and software )
B = Bill Of Materials ( Rev B in this post )
C = License used allows for commercial use ( TAPR OHL V1.0 )
We wo n't be self-certifying to the official OSHW standards but that does n't prevent the use of this logo . Also , we hope FaradayRF has been open enough to this point to make our intentions clear , Faraday is open source and open hardware . If you have questions , let us know @ FaradayRF .
Power Supply Testing
GitHub Hardware Issue # 5 documents my testing efforts to validate the USB power-on hardware . I 've posted much of my USB power on testing which aimed at testing whether we want just a soft-start circuit or if we want to also use the FTDI FT230X PWREN signal to negotiate with the USB port . Check out the issue ticket to see all test data ! Shown below are the two power on cases which clearly show that the soft start IC , U12 the MIC94072YC6 , prevents bulk capacitance from C17 from causing a USB inrush even by slowly charging up the capacitor over just under 1ms . The oscilloscope capture below shows 100us/division to help show the 1ms soft-start event .
Configuring the FT230X to negotiate with the USB port for high power devices allows more than 100mA to be pulled from the USB port during startup and ensures that Faraday gets as much power as possible during use . The oscilloscope capture below is plotted with 50ms/division and shows the USB power applied instantly rising to 5V ( with some ringing ! ) . The soft-start limits the initial charge-up with some conduction through it but it 's not turned on yet . After 250ms the USB port negotiates with the FT230X triggering U12 to turn on and soft-start to 5V . It appears to be instant but remember each division is 50ms so 1ms soft-start will be very sharp .
Panelizing Faraday Rev C
I 'm now onto finalizing my changes on Rev C and panelizing . Does anyone know of any good medium run fabrication or turnkey companies . Watch my panelization efforts on Issue # 2 or chime in on the ticket to suggest a tip ! Currently I am looking at the following vendors to possibly build Faraday . I 'd prefer fabrication and assembly in one company . Please let us know of others you would suggest !
Suggestions welcomed @ FaradayRF

Canadian farmers will plant more lentils and peas this season , betting that strong demand from drought-stricken India will soften the blow of low prices for wheat , corn and other field crops .
Growers will seed a record 5.1 million acres of lentils , up by 30 per cent from last year , and 4.3 million acres of peas , a rise of 16 per cent , Statistics Canada said in its survey of planting intentions released on Thursday .
`` It 's all-in on India . No one else in the world can consume those numbers . If it does n't go there , it 's not going anywhere , '' said David Newman of Commodious Trading Inc. , a seller and processor of pulse crops in North Saanich , B.C .

Farmers are planting pulses after years of falling prices for their main crops – wheat , canola and corn – amid large harvests in the United States and elsewhere . Wheat prices have fallen 40 per cent in Chicago over the past five years . Corn for grain is down 33 per cent .
`` It 's not hugely surprising to see farmers exploring other options , '' said Aaron Goertzen , an agriculture analyst at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto .
`` Prices across the board have been so low . If you look at corn prices alone , you 'd be surprised to see anybody wanting to plant any of it , '' Mr. Goertzen said . `` But when you consider the fact other crops have been hit really hard the past couple years , you start to see that there are n't many other options . ''
Acreage for wheat , Canada 's largest crop , is expected to be 1 per cent smaller at 24 million . Farmers will trim canola seeding by almost 4 per cent to 19 million acres .
Meanwhile , pulse acreage has almost doubled since 2013 . Canadian pea and lentil exports rose more than 35 per cent to hit a record $ 3.7-billion in 2015 , according to Weber Commodities Ltd .
Prices for some pulses more than doubled late last season as India placed large orders .
Commodious Trading 's Mr. Newman predicts the same thing could happen this year . `` The grower pipeline here is empty . There 's nothing in the bins . Yellow peas , empty . Green peas , empty . Green lentils , empty . Red lentils , empty . India did n't have a great year so , come September , they 're going to be empty , '' he said by phone . `` Growers respond to market signals , '' said Carl Potts , executive director of Saskatchewan Pulse Growers . `` They look to grow the crops that are in demand in the marketplace . ''

India , the world 's biggest consumer of pulse crops , is facing its second consecutive drought and is expected to boost imports by 20 per cent this year to 5.6 million tonnes . The country of 1.2 billion has a large vegetarian population ; lentils , chickpeas and yellow peas are major sources of protein .
In 2015 , India bought 30 per cent of Canada 's pulse exports , or 1.5 million tonnes .
`` India by far is our largest market , '' followed by Turkey , China , Bangladesh and United Arab Emirates , Mr. Potts said .
Canadian farmers grow most of the peas and lentils eaten around the world . Ninety-five per cent of the country 's lentils are grown in Saskatchewan . The province 's short growing season and quick-draining fields are ideal for pulses , which are loved by farmers because they restore the soil 's nitrogen and interrupt cycles of insects and diseases .
Although 85 per cent of the Canadian crop is exported , Mr. Potts said , North American demand is rising as consumers demand healthy sources of protein and fibre .

President Donald Trump 's administration is extremely understaffed , and it 's up to Chief of Staff John Kelly to fill the hundreds of critical jobs that are vacant , according to new reports .
Kelly believes the problem is that the process gets bottlenecked by requiring those staffing decision to be run through the White House , according to Politico . Kelly 's predecessor , Reince Priebus , required most of the major staffing decisions to go through the Oval Office .

As Politico pointed out , Kelly has personal experience dealing with this frustrating issue :
As a Cabinet pick and then as Department of Homeland Security secretary , Kelly was frequently exasperated during the transition and early days of the administration over his inability to choose his own staff . He got into frequent spats with the White House over filling a handful of top jobs in his department , according to one of the people close to him .
One particular problem has been that Trump has demanded potential candidates be loyal to him , including having not spoken negatively about him during the 2016 presidential election . For example , this requirement torpedoed an effort by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to appoint Elliott Abrams , who worked in foreign policy positions under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush , as his undersecretary of state .
`` Look , everyone in the White House is upset . It 's both a problem of getting candidates through the bureaucracy and through the Senate . Of course Kelly is upset . The whole system is totally screwed up , '' said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
In the past , Trump has tried to defend leaving these positions unfilled by arguing that it is part of his larger effort to reduce the size of the administrative state , one of the stated goals of his election campaign .
`` I 'm generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be — because you do n't need them . I mean , you look at some of these agencies , how massive they are , and it 's totally unnecessary . They have hundreds of thousands of people , '' Trump told Forbes Magazine earlier this month .
The problem with this argument is that many of the positions left unfilled are inarguably important . This includes the positions of ambassador to South Korea and assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs , both of which will prove critical as America 's bilateral crisis with North Korea continues to escalate .

In addition to Trump demanding loyalty from his potential staffing picks , experts have observed that he has seemed to misunderstand the fundamental difference between staffing a government and running a business .
`` It 's a failure to understand the operating needs of the government . I think there was n't an appreciation that running a successful campaign would require a different approach in running a successful government versus a successful business , '' Max Stier , president of the Partnership for Public Service , told CNN Money .
Here 's what you need to know ...
Bulking up by increasing body fat will decrease insulin sensitivity and impede muscle growth . The more fat you gain , the more you change your physiology to favor fat storage over muscle growth . Most people who bulk will store fat in just one area , like the belly or love handles , making it tougher and tougher to lean that area out . Bulk up too much and your muscles will get softer due to ectopic fat storage . The body will store excess calories , not just as adipose , but in muscle tissue as well . Repeatedly gaining fat in the off season and then having to lose it all will lead to metabolic damage and stubborn fat storage . You need a caloric surplus to build muscle , but gaining five pounds of fat in order to gain one pound of muscle is a bad idea .
Scale Weight : The Old Barometer for Bulking Success
The rules of off-season bulking used to be simple : Eat every two to three hours and eat until full . While `` clean '' foods like chicken and brown rice were the ideal , no one was docked points for sneaking in a pizza during the post-workout `` window of opportunity . ''
As long as the number on the scale was growing , that was all that mattered . Scale weight became the metric by which you judged the success of a bulk .
It usually was n't a pretty process . Let 's say you decided to bulk up to 250 pounds by Christmas . Pants getting tight at 235 ? Get stretchier pants . Ca n't fit into your suits at 240 ? Make every day casual Friday !
The idea was to just keep eating . When the scale says 250 pounds , you win .
But did you really win ? You gained 30 to 50 pounds in four or five months . You might have a bigger bench and squat . You might also have chipmunk cheeks and a low back that barks even when you do a single rep of tying your shoelaces .
But are you any better after an all out bulk ? No . There are seven reasons why :
1 – Muscle Growth is Slow
Building muscle – actual , contractile muscle tissue – is a painstakingly slow process for any lifter past the beginner phase .
For an experienced lifter , a gain of 1-2 pounds a month of pure muscle would be excellent . It adds up to 10 pounds or more in a single off-season . However , only a scant few bodybuilders can gain muscle at such a rate , and 10 pounds is a far cry from the 40 or 50 pounds you slapped on during your bulk .
2 – Insulin Sensitivity Decreases
When you bulk up and body fat levels rise , you can gradually decrease insulin sensitivity , which can impede muscle growth . Insulin is actually a signaling protein for both muscle and fat cells to utilize amino acids and glucose .
Ideally , insulin-sensitive muscle cells will readily absorb glucose and amino acids when insulin `` signals '' them to open . With increased body fat , though , comes increased levels of insulin , and this can desensitize muscle cells to insulin 's signaling effects .
If you decrease insulin sensitivity , your muscle wo n't use glucose and amino acids as efficiently , and since it 's metabolically less expensive to store fat , your body will convert more of the excess calories into body fat .
The more overweight you are , the more you change your physiology to favor fat storage over muscle recovery and growth .
3 – You Build Anabolic Resistance
This physiological phenomenon where protein synthesis is inhibited and fat storage is elevated is referred to as anabolic resistance , and it 's the last thing you want as a bodybuilder .
The fatter you get , the more likely it is that any excess nutrients you eat are being stored in your butt and gut – not your quads and biceps . And , the less likely it is that your training is leading to any actual muscle growth .
Of course , there are always outliers . I know guys who can gain 50 pounds in an off-season and just get bigger all around . Exceptions do n't make rules however , and simply because the top guys can `` get away '' with a bulking strategy does n't make it a sound option for the majority of us who are less genetically gifted .
4 – Brand New Fat Cells , Accelerated Fat Storage
Past a certain body fat point , you 're simply accelerating fat storage . The average bulker will store most of his fat in just one unsightly area , like the belly or love handles .
Not only is this unhealthy ( fat around the abdomen is directly correlated with heart disease and hypertension ) , it can lead to the creation of new fat cells that make it even harder to diet down once bulking ends . This process is called adipogenesis , and it occurs during periods of intense weight gain and caloric surplus .
When someone is doing heavy-duty bulking , the excess calories all get eventually converted to glucose , which is essentially sugar . Glucose gets used by both muscle and fat cells for energy usage and storage .
But when glucose levels are continuously high , and you have more than you need for just your muscles , all that excess glucose will be stored as fat . This is why hard and fast `` dirty '' bulking rarely leads to large increases in muscle .
Over time , as bulking is repeated , you 're actually fattening up the same parts of your body . This makes for a total bitch of a diet . If it 's already hard to whittle away at that one area , adding even more fat there means you should prepare for 12 weeks of hell .
Even worse , the higher your body fat levels climb , the greater the possibility of it leading to anabolic resistance . Getting that stubborn area down will likely hurt other areas too , and actually make them appear emaciated . Consequently , it can negate any muscle gains .
5 – Softening Muscles
Ectopic fat storage makes matters worse . Because the body is being flooded with excess calories , glucose , and triglycerides , it 'll begin storing the excess not just in adipose tissue , but in the muscles themselves .
This is called intramuscular triglyceride storage . This contributes to dirty bulkers who get a soft appearance to their muscles .
It 's not just cosmetic , though . Intramuscular fat can also inhibit protein synthesis and subsequent muscle growth .
You 've likely seen the occasional bodybuilder who got huge in the off-season but somehow lost all his soft gains when he dieted back down . Ectopic fat storage is only partially responsible for that happening .
6 – Sluggish Metabolism
Getting fat over and over again can make getting leaner more difficult each time .
If you get too fat and then have to kill yourself to diet down , the body will hang onto fat that much harder the next time you diet .
This particular phenomenon is somewhat related to the metabolic damage concept of reducing basal metabolism over and over again to the point where weight loss is nearly impossible and weight gain can be caused by even the slightest of calorie surpluses .
While metabolic damage is often associated with female competitors , male bodybuilders can experience the same effects , but to a very different degree .
Picture a male bodybuilder that bulks up to 300 pounds in the off season but has to diet down to 250 on stage . That 's a 17 % reduction in weight . Basal metabolism will begin to drop whenever there 's a 10 % reduction in weight , so this bodybuilder is going to be slowing his metabolism as he diets .
If , however , he dirty bulked , he probably has to deal with anabolic resistance , too . If he repeats the dirty bulking process again post-contest , he 's reinforcing the increased fat storage and anabolic resistance that he experienced before .
This will make it harder for him to lean down for each contest , and each time he bulks up he 'll be less and less likely to put on any new muscle . He might not be experiencing metabolic damage in the classical sense , but metabolically he 's causing a lot of things to go wrong .
7 – You Probably Ca n't Get Away With It
What the absolute top guys do is often the result of what they can get away with because of their genetics and drug use . It 's not necessarily a model for everyone else to follow . If you want competitive longevity , consider a more conservative approach .
Bodybuilders have bulked up and cut down for decades . This includes more than a few Mr. Olympia winners . It would be silly to say the approach does n't work because it clearly has .
But what you do n't hear about are the thousands of guys who bulked up , got too fat , messed up their insulin sensitivity , and never reached their true potential in either size or conditioning .
Consider also the guys that started out with a bang and looked amazing in one or two shows , but were never able to repeat that level of conditioning or fullness again .
Knowing When to Stop
The decision to bulk or not boils down to knowing your body . You need a calorie surplus to build muscle , and it 's hard to eat just enough to build muscle without some fat gain . But gaining five pounds of fat to gain one pound of muscle is a bad idea .
You 're more likely to lose that pound of muscle because of trying to diet that five pounds of fat off .
There 's no reason for most guys to get above 12 % body fat . Personally , I prefer to stay under 10 % . It will depend on where you start to lose insulin sensitivity – you 'll know you 're there as pumps will decrease and your muscles will start looking soft . If that happens , take it as a sign to end your bulk .

UPDATE : 9:40 p.m. ― John Bolton on Monday clarified his comments a day earlier suggesting election hacks that the intelligence community has blamed on Russia could have been a false flag operation .
Bolton said on “ Fox & Friends ” that the operation could have been carried out by China , Iran or North Korea , and he denied he meant to imply that the Obama administration may have been involved. ” Typical bad reporting , ” Bolton said .
Previously : The man reported to be Donald Trump 's pick for the number two job in the State Department says the election hacks could have been a false flag operation .
John Bolton told Fox News on Sunday that the hacks may not have been carried out by Russia , as the intelligence community believes , but implied the Obama administration itself could 've been secretly responsible .
“ It is not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside , that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation , ” Bolton told reporter Eric Shawn .
“ False flag ” is a term that refers to covert activities undertaken by a government or other entity to advance its own political agenda by making it look as if someone else did it .
“ A really sophisticated foreign intelligence service would not leave any cyber fingerprints , ” he said . “ So the question that has to be asked is why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary [ Clinton ] 's server , but their dumb intelligence services against the election ? ”
Shawn called that a “ very serious charge ” and cited The Washington Post 's bombshell report that intelligence officials believe hackers with ties to the Russian government worked to help Trump win the election .
“ Are you actually accusing someone here in this administration , in the intelligence community , of trying to throw something ? ” said Shawn .
“ We just do n't know , ” Bolton responded , claiming the intelligence community has been “ politicized ” under President Barack Obama .
Bolton later added , however , that if it turns out Russia did attempt to influence the election , “ we should retaliate . ”
There has been a growing bipartisan call for an investigation into the hack .
“ This can not become a partisan issue , ” read a joint statement released on Sunday by senators from both parties . “ The stakes are too high for our country . ”

Jindal may have fudged the facts in his Katrina boat story Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This ( Update at bottom : Jindal aide 'clarifies ' Katrina tale )
Louisiana Governor `` Bobby '' Jindal 's retort to President Obama 's first major address to Congress was not exactly well-received .
One Fox News panelist went so far as to call his oration `` amateurish , '' `` simplistic '' and even `` childish . '' Also , on Thursday , a report by Talking Points Memo strongly suggests Jindal 's critics should add dishonest to the litany of complaints .
`` During Katrina , I visited Sheriff Harry Lee , a Democrat and a good friend of mine , '' said Jindal during his Tuesday night speech . `` When I walked into his makeshift office I 'd never seen him so angry . He was yelling into the phone : 'Well , I 'm the Sheriff and if you do n't like it you can come and arrest me ! ' I asked him : 'Sheriff , what 's got you so mad ? ' He told me that he had put out a call for volunteers to come with their boats to rescue people who were trapped on their rooftops by the floodwaters .
`` The boats were all lined up ready to go - when some bureaucrat showed up and told them they could n't go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration . I told him , 'Sheriff , that 's ridiculous . ' And before I knew it , he was yelling into the phone : 'Congressman Jindal is here , and he says you can come and arrest him too ! ' Harry just told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and start rescuing people . ''
The problem with Jindal 's recounting is that it may not have even happened . However , the one man who could have set the record straight -- Democrat Harry Lee , `` one of the most famous politicians in Louisiana history , '' according to the Times-Picayune -- passed away in late 2007 .
`` According to numerous reports , Harry Lee did not leave the affected area of New Orleans during the crisis , '' wrote TPM 's Zachary Roth . `` But there is no reported evidence of Jindal having set foot in the area during the period when people were still stranded on roofs -- which , based on a review of news stories from the time , was only until September 3 at the very latest . Indeed , the evidence strongly suggests he did not . ''
`` We 've reviewed [ Lexis ] Nexis and other sources , and can find no news reports putting Jindal on the ground in the affected area during the few days after Katrina struck when people might still have needed boats to rescue them from rooftops , '' he added .
Portions of TPM 's research were based on a DailyKos diary by user xgz , who links to a find in CNN 's archives that appears to be `` the final nail in the coffin , '' he said .
Speaking with CNN 's Larry King on Sept. 11 , 2005 , Lee , the sheriff Jindal spoke of , said he did n't learn of the required insurance forms until a week after the boats were needed .
Saying , `` rules and regulations is what got things all screwed up around here , '' the sheriff inadvertently shot down the future governor 's claim .
`` Those boats where not allowed to get into the water when they were needed and I just found out about seven days later one of the reason boats could n't get in was they did n't have enough life preservers and some of them did n't have proof of insurance , '' said Lee . `` And I 'm sure that there 's a FEMA regulation that says that . But when a storm of this magnitude hits , you through those regulations out the window and you do what you have to do and start saving lives . ''
`` Perhaps Mr. Jindal can explain how he learned that lesson during Katrina , when Harry Lee did n't learn about it until a week later ? '' asked DailyKos user Barbara Morrill .
A request for comment to Gov . Jindal 's office was not returned as of press time .
Jindal aide 'clarifies ' Katrina tale
Politico 's Ben Smith spoke to an aide for Governor Jindal who `` clarifies '' his Katrina anecdote , but it may not be enough for some liberal critics .
`` A spokeswoman for Bobby Jindal says the Louisiana governor did n't intend to imply that an anecdote about battling bureaucrats during Katrina directly involved the governor or took place during the heat of a fight to release rescue boats , '' Smith writes . `` The spokeswoman , Melissa Sellers , said the story Jindal told in his response to Obama actually took place some days later in Lee 's office -- though still in Katrina 's chaotic aftermath -- as Lee was 'recounting ' his frustrations with the bureaucracy to someone else on the telephone . ''
Jindal chief of staff Timmy Teepell also told Smith that the `` the exchange took place in the week following Katrina , when Jindal visited Jefferson Parish multiple times . ''
`` He was boots on the ground all the time , '' Teepell claims .
At TPMMuckraker , Zachary Roth responds that this is `` no minor difference . ''
`` Jindal 's presence in Lee 's office during the crisis itself was a key element of the story 's intended appeal , putting him at the center of the action during the maelstrom , '' Roth writes . `` Just as important , Jindal implied that his support for the sheriff helped ensure the rescue went ahead . But it turns out Jindal was n't there at the key moment , and played no role in making the rescue happen . ''
Roth adds , `` There 's a larger point here , though . The central anecdote of the GOP 's prime-time response to President Obama 's speech , intended to illustrate the threat of excessive government regulation , turns out to have been made up . Maybe it 's time to rethink the premise . ''

Terpenes belong to a class of compounds known as aromatic hydrocarbons , and they are made up of chains of linked isoprene units . Isoprene is an abundant naturally occurring molecule with the chemical formula C₅H₈ , and terpenes are formed by two or more linked isoprene units . Thus , monoterpenes ( C₁₀H₁₆ ) are formed of two isoprene units , diterpenes ( C₂₀H₃₂ ) from four , triterpenes ( C₃₀H₄₈ ) from six , and so on . Terpenes are a major component of many plant resins , cannabis being no exception . Most terpenes are strong smelling and often serve the purpose of attracting pollinators or repelling predators . Furthermore , it is thought that certain tree species release terpenes , which react with atmospheric compounds to produce aerosols , which in turn encourage water vapor to form clouds . During hot weather , these trees release higher levels of terpenes , doubling cloud cover and providing a strong cooling effect .
No . I do n't think he should . The hornet 's nest has already been sufficient stirred up , and we 've already heard enough Watergate comparisons without replicating the “ Saturday Night Massacre . ”
But after James Comey 's testimony , there is a new argument for firing Mueller and handing the Russia hacking investigation back to the FBI and its new director . Newt Gingrich explains :
When asked Thursday by Senator Susan Collins of Maine whether he shared the memos he wrote about his conversations with President Trump with anyone outside the Department of Justice , Comey answered : “ I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter – did n't do it myself for a variety of reasons – but I asked him to , because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. ” This statement is tremendously important because it completely delegitimizes Robert Mueller 's so-called independent investigation and reveals it as poisoned fruit .
I do n't see Comey 's actions as necessarily “ delegitimizing ” Mueller 's investigation , but the poisoned fruit analogy is n't far off . Comey leaked the memos , arguably illegally ( I may consider the legal issue in another post ) , for the purpose of creating pressure on the administration to appoint a special counsel . Without the leak , it 's quite possible that no such counsel would have been appointed .
Gingrich continues :
Think about it : Comey was the top law enforcement officer in the nation before he was fired on May 9 . Had he felt a special counsel was necessary to investigate possible Russian influence in the 2016 election , he could have requested one from Congress at any time . If he felt his conversations with President Trump warranted additional attention , he could have approached Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about it . But instead he decided to do nothing . Comey apparently did n't think there was need for a special counsel until the Monday after he was fired , according to his testimony . In a clear act of retaliation , Comey went outside the system and shared secret information with the media via a college professor-friend , in a calculated attempt to inflict pain on the Trump Administration .
The main pain he wanted to inflict was a special counsel . That special counsel turned out to be Comey 's friend Robert Mueller .
During his testimony , Comey effusively praised Mueller several times . This may be another argument in favor of firing Mueller .
The counterargument , apart from the political problems another firing would cause , is that , regardless of how the memos became public , they suggest the need for an investigation headed by someone with as much independence from the president as possible ( assuming the memos state the facts accurately ) . It 's a fair point .
But let 's put the matter of firing Mueller to one side . I find Comey 's leaking inexcusable , and think it undermines any claim that he is the fair-minded , above reproach figure he holds himself out as .
The memos were government documents . Comey removed them , quite possibly illegally .
He then had a third party do the leaking for him , undoubtedly in the hope that he would never be revealed as the real leaker . So much for Comey , the “ stand up guy . ”
As a friend has pointed out to me , Comey handled the matter with callous disregard for the impact of his behavior on the FBI , the agency he claims to revere . Why do I say this ? Because allowing the memos to become public as he did would cause many people to believe that the leakers were high level FBI officials . This would tend to damage the reputation of the FBI and the FBI officials with whom Comey was associated .
If Comey did not understand this problem when he initially contacted the Columbia professor , he should have realized it immediately after the publication . At that point , rather than waiting for a hearing and allowing the reputation of the FBI and Comey 's FBI associates to be questioned , Comey should have acknowledged that he was the real source at the first opportunity .
That 's how a stand-up , beyond reproach guy would behave . Comey behaved like a creature of what President Trump likes to call “ the swamp . ”
So , no , Trump probably should n't fire Robert Mueller . But we should take a dim view of Comey and a suspicious view of his good friend Mueller .
CLOSE Austin and Colin 's video hyping up the Nashville Predators in the NHL playoffs Austin and Colin

Know the new hashtag for the Predators : # Fangerang .
In a historic playoff run marked by overcoming seemingly impossible odds , star-studded National Anthems and skinned ducks on ice , the latest chapter in the 2017 Nashville Predators saga comes with its own dance moves .
Nashville comedy duo Austin and Colin partnered with the red-hot Preds to produce a hype video ahead of Monday night 's Game 6 of the Western Conference finals in Nashville against the Anaheim Ducks . If the Predators win , they will make history by earning their first Stanley Cup berth in team history .
`` One of the things we love doing is taking ordinary life situations and making them a wild and crazy experience . The Predators were a natural group to collaborate with since the whole city is rallying around them , including us . '' said Austin Bever , the `` Austin '' in Austin and Colin .
Originally from Ohio but relocating to Nashville in 2010 , Austin and Colin first struck viral video gold with their homage to Music City `` Welcome to Nashville '' a year ago . The video tour skewered Nashville staples like Lower Broadway with lines like `` where the bachelorette parties are loud and the Honky Tonks are bumping . '' The video has over a quarter million views on YouTube already .
The pair began planning the logistics of their latest hit during the Blues play-off series in April . On a whim , Austin reached out to the Preds organization to see if they would be interested in helping .
`` We were just going to put on a Preds jersey , but I reached out to the Predators and the CEO sent me to the director of marketing and we said 'Let 's do this , ' '' Austin said .
Their latest and most ambitious video takes the duo onto the ice at Bridgestone Arena , dancing with the Gnash and the Predators Ice Girls , and with fans at the playoff watch party last Thursday night . They even created a new dance , complete with gnawing fang fingers and a quick shuffle , which they taught everyone in about 20 minutes before filming last Friday in the arena .
`` They were fantastic , everyone at the Predators organization is fantastic , '' Austin said . The organization worked with the video producers to film Thursday and Friday between concerts , practices and other events at Bridgestone .

Then , the duo watched on the edge of their seats Saturday night as the Predators overcame injuries to steal a game from the Ducks in Anaheim to take a commanding 3-2 series lead .
Working through the night Saturday , the video was uploaded Sunday afternoon and has already been viewed over 500,000 times . Now they 'll be anxiously watching the game tonight , but Austin think its the Predators ' game to lose .
`` The Ducks are a good team and you ca n't ever count them out , but it 's going to be incredibly hard to beat us when you only have 6 guys on the ice and you have to beat the entire city of Nashville that has every intention of making history tonight . '' Austin said .
The puck drops Monday night at 7:00 in Nashville .

CHILPANCINGO Mexico ( Reuters ) - Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto vowed on Monday to hunt down those responsible for the apparent massacre of dozens of students in the southwest of the country that authorities say involved local security officials .
The students went missing after they clashed with police in Iguala in the volatile , gang-ridden state of Guerrero on Sept. 26 . A mass grave was found near the town over the weekend , full of charred human remains .
Guerrero 's attorney general , Inaky Blanco , said on Sunday that 28 bodies have been found at the site so far , and it is “ probable ” that some of the missing 43 students are among the remains found in the graves .
He said the motive of the killings was unclear .
Other local officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters that at least 34 bodies have been discovered .
In his first comments on the incident , Peña Nieto said the federal government would identify those behind the massacre and make sure they face justice .
“ We need to find the truth and make sure the law is applied to those responsible for these outrageous , painful and unacceptable acts , ” he said in a four-minute-long televised statement . He did not take questions .
Blanco said on Sunday that two gang hitmen have admitted killing 17 of the missing students with the help of security officials .
The likelihood of official involvement creates a major headache for Peña Nieto , who has sought to shift attention away from Mexico 's gangland violence and onto a batch of economic reforms he has driven through Congress .
Angel Aguirre , the governor of Guerrero state , said he was certain the students were killed by gangs in cahoots with the police . He added that he expected at least some of the bodies in the mass grave would be those of the students , but said tests still needed to be completed to make sure .
“ It could well be them , I do n't rule it out , it 's a very real possibility , ” Aguirre , who has been criticized for not doing enough to clean up the state and keep a lid on the rampant violence , said in a radio interview .
Some 22 local police have been arrested in connection with the violent incidents in Guerrero .
The fugitive mayor of Iguala , Jose Luis Abarca , is also being investigated for possible involvement in the crimes , as is the head of security for Iguala .

Blanco said the leader of a local gang known as the Guerreros Unidos conspired with security officials to carry out the killings .
Peña Nieto took office two years ago pledging to end a wave of violence that has killed around 100,000 people since the start of 2007 . Though homicides have fallen on his watch , other crimes have increased , including extortion and kidnapping .
Guerrero , which is also home to the resort of Acapulco , has been one of the most lawless states in Mexico for years .
Flight Delayed Over Passenger 's TV Screen Protest
The ultra-Orthodox Jewish traveler objected to the use of in-flight TV screens and refused to sit down until the devices were disabled .
An Israel-bound flight from Kiev 's Boryspil International Airport ( KBP ) was delayed earlier this week when an unnamed ultra-Orthodox Jewish passenger refused to take his seat unless the plane 's overhead TV screens were retracted or disabled . The incident occurred on Thursday just as UP Flight LY2654 was preparing to depart from KBP . UP is the low-cost subsidiary of El Al , Israel 's national carrier .
According to the Times of Israel , the plane was delayed by more than an hour when the devout passenger took objection to the content being shown and he then refused to take his seat unless the screens were disabled .
Sports reporter Amit Horsky , a passenger on the flight , made a mobile phone recording of the incident , in which the man is shown refusing to sit down .
Having posted the clip to Facebook , the outlet reported Horsky as saying , “ Every attempt by the crew and passengers to convince him [ to sit down ] did n't help . The plane , which was already on the runway , returned to the gate . The door was opened and an El Al security guard boarded the plane . After much pleading the ‘ righteous man ' agreed to sit down . ”
“ I want to stress that dozens of ultra-Orthodox passengers on the flight yelled at the man [ … ] They told him that he was wasting important time for the 200 people whom he was detaining . An argument broke out between them which at times got very loud , ” Horsky added .
El Al , UP 's parent company , confirmed that the flight did eventually take off , but only after the man and his family were provided with eye masks to visually block the content being shown on the overhead screens , which were not disabled as per the man 's initial demand .
In a statement quoted by the paper , El Al confirmed the incident saying , “ After a conversation with the plane 's crew and after it was made clear to him that [ the plane ] could not take off if he refused to listen to instructions , the passenger sat in his seat and the flight departed . At his request , he and his family received blindfolds . ”

Although he recently fled his native Damascus for the safety of Hong Kong , Radwan Kasmiya had always been an astute observer of the gaming scene in the Arab and Islamic world . And what he saw did n't please him : Most games , he noticed , did little more than , to quote Vit Sisler , reverse “ the polarities of the narrative and iconographical stereotypes … by substituting the Arab Muslim hero for the American soldier. ” And Kasmiya wanted to do something different . The result was a series of games that not only convey a significant amount of historical information—history , unlike theology , is easier to reduce into bite-sized , game-ready bits—but also a rare emotional impact .
Play Under Siege , for example , a game focusing on five Palestinians and their reactions to the Israeli occupation , and it soon becomes evident that any attempt at picking up a gun and joining the violent resistance is doomed to have you killed . Non-violent efforts are equally futile and just as deadly . This makes for a disturbing game-play experience : Unable to experience the cathartic moment of victory at the end of most video games , anyone playing Under Siege is forced not only to think about the desperation of the Palestinian situation but to feel a tiny fraction of it , too .
And while Kasmiya 's work appeals to the heart , other agit-prop designers have focused on cool rationality . An independent Italian game called Riot , for example , is a tactically minded interactive manual for activists set on clashing with the police . Allowing players to assume the role of both the boys in blue and the anarchists in black , it is a highly effective tool for playing out potential confrontational scenarios . Very little of the traditional titillation of video games is on offer here ; the game is little more than a whiteboard for an uprising .
Of course , in terms of production values and popularity alike , both of these games pale in comparison to the blockbusters that dominate the industry , but they have gained a greater following than the polished , big-budget titles produced by China , Iran , or Hezbollah . What separates effective and ineffective propaganda games , after all , is n't the producer—whether a government or dissident—but the production : whether the story is conventionally told or delivered as a revolutionary alternative to the mainstream .
This debate is nothing new : The Soviet filmmakers working in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution were equally divided between experimentalism and realism . And as the propaganda-game genre continues to grow—the North Koreans , never ones to miss out on a good opportunity for brainwashing , released their own terrible game earlier this year—we 're likely to see more contenders in both categories . And if film history is anything to go by , then straight-forward , big-budget , uncomplicated games are likely to outsell over anything demanding a greater intellectual and emotional investment . But today , almost a century after it was made , we still revere the ground-breaking Battleship Potemkin , even as we 've forgotten nearly all of the Soviets ' realist propaganda schlock . It 's likely we 'll judge Under Siege and Riot just as kindly , even if some of us disagree with their political messages . After all , in video games , like in revolutions , relentless innovation and challenging conventions are what keep the cause alive .
Well , well , well thank you Shel Silverstein .
Family reading time ran amok tonight and I blame you .
It started out so innocently , though .
I just had to pick the books tonight , I could n't bring myself to read aloud any more Curious George ( Why are you so STUPID Man in The Yellow Hat ? Why the heck DO YOU KEEP BRINGING HIM TO THE FIRE STATION ? DO N'T YOU LEARN ? He truly IS a bad little monkey , dude ! ) .
The green dust jacket was calling my name from the bookshelf : `` Remember me , Nicole ? We are old friends , arent we ? ''
Of course I remember you , old friend , I thought as I touched its firm binding .
`` Then you must take me down , you must read me again . Your children will love me . Read me . You will all be happy . ''
Well of course I will read you , old friend . Yes , yes . We will all be happy . You have many lessons to share , I remember them well .
And so my old book and I went down the stairs and curled up with three children under a blanket on the couch .
The Giving Tree I read loudly , so excited to share this special book from my childhoodwith them .
Within four minutes , two children were sobbing uncontrollably and one ( the smallest one ) had run away to escape the mayhem I had created .
My 7-year-old son was actually moaning `` WHY WHY ? '' over and over again .
My older daughter just kept repeating `` The selfish boy ! '' while shaking her head , sounding dangerously off kilter .
It was bewildering . A great big letdown . Sort of like every family holiday meal except no one spilled anything and I had n't spent $ 80 planning the whole shindig out .
I could not understand . It was sad , sure . But it was happy ! Was n't it ? I tried desperately to re-frame the story for them .
`` The tree is GLAD to help the boy out ! He is the boy 's friend . They grow old together . They love each other . '' I said , pointing to the last page . `` Look ! They are FRIENDS ! ''
My son , my Frankie , my sweet son , who at 7 years old still crawls in my lap every day , tears the book from my hand and literally begins punching the picture of Shel Silverstein on the back cover of the book repeatedly .
`` Why did you read us that ? '' asks my daughter hysterically , tears streaming down her face .
`` What kind of weirdo writes a book like that ? '' asks Frankie .
Weirdo ? That 's Shel Silverstein you 're talking about , boy . Author of my youth !
I have almost no words for them . Their reaction is so simplistic , all black or white . They are sad because the tree gives everything to the boy . That the tree is left with nothing , that he gives and gives , with no real gift in return . And then , unfailingly , because time ... and because life , years pass , love and friendship wane and wax .
And then they both grow fragile and they both grow old . End of story .
I want to laugh at the childish hysteria , but something clenchingly begins to grab at me too . I had forgotten how poignant The Giving Tree really was ; It 's message is beautiful . It 's beautiful , right ?
But the meaning diverges down a road that even I ca n't comprehend , after I see my children 's reaction .
Maybe it 's lack of sleep or my place , now , as a mother -- but the book suddenly seems so confusing to me . I have questions and no one to answer them .
Is The Tree supposed to be God ? Why does he -- how can he -- give so much to the boy and take nothing ? Is this what I should be doing , as a parent -- give and give and give and ask for naught ? Is the lesson here that it should be enough just to give , that to make someone else happy should alone be satisfying sometimes ? Or that we can take and take and still not find satisfaction ?
This hardcover book , that sat on my own bookshelf without asking any questions for three long decades , made me suddenly think and wonder and wonder and think .
Could I give so much without needing affirmation ? Am I The Tree ? Am I The Boy ?
I do n't know . I do n't know . Damn it all , I DO N'T KNOW !
But my children knew .
They knew it was wrong to keep asking without offering in return . They thought The Boy was selfish , they thought he was careless . They were heartbroken over the lost things , The Tree 's sad remains .
Maybe I was The Tree to them , maybe they were The Boy . Maybe they cried for the impossible , far off promise that endings were inevitable , that in the end , all we are reduced to , judged by , are the people we love and the people who loved us .
I do n't get it . But even though they ca n't put it into words , my children do .
It took an hour to calm them down and as I sat on the couch once they were in bed , I realized there is one thing I DO understand now . I 'm previewing the content again of all my childhood books before I read them to my children from now on .
I apparently have forgotten to remember that when you are a child some things actually make MORE sense to you .
Maybe we should take our cues from our children . Maybe it really is all much more simple than we want to make it .
If it feels sad , maybe it is sad . If it seems unfair , maybe it is unfair . If he seems selfish , maybe he is selfish .
If we want to cry , maybe we should just cry .
It seems that the older we get , the less we understand .
I am writing this post in the wake of the horrendous terrorist act in Orlando , Florida where 49 innocent people lost their lives at the hands of a terrorist . Within hours of this tragedy , politicians raced to declare that the United States needs to enact gun control laws to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns . Many lies are being told every day about guns in the United States . I will not spend much time refuting those lies but I will instead focus on the right to bear arms and the fallacies of gun control .
The Constitution of the United States was written to create a federal government limited to enumerated powers , many people expressed worry during the ratifying conventions that the federal government may get too powerful so the first congress passed and the states ratified a set of ten amendments to protect some core individual rights such as free speech , owning arms and trial by jury in addition to asserting that all rights not delegated to the federal government belong to the people and the states . The right to bear arms is a fundamental right because it allows people to defend their life , liberty and property . The United States would n't have been a free country if people did n't own guns comparable to the guns owned by the British army that allowed us to gain our independence .
In the wake of tragedies like Orlando 's or Newtown 's shootings , it is easy to let emotions lead us to agree to laws that do little to enhance our security while reducing our liberty . In reality , most of these proposals are made by politicians who live and move under armed guard so they do n't think about the security needs of the normal citizen . Before we think about giving up our liberties we need to see if what is being proposed can actually help us .
One of the main proposals discussed now is to prevent people on the no-fly list or the terror watch list from buying guns . This proposal sounds good on the surface until you ask the fundamental question , why are n't these people in prison ? if the government really thinks that these people are dangerous then the government ought to prosecute them . Why are n't they charged with crimes and brought to justice ? why are they living among us ? The answer is that all the people on the watch list either do n't live in the United States in the first place or the government do n't have evidence that they are actually dangerous . One of the main concepts in our constitution is that people should n't be deprived of their liberty without due process . We have seen the IRS used against groups because of their politics , do we really trust government bureaucrats to maintain a list that denies people their constitutional rights without due process ? What should come next after using a list to deny people their right to bear arms ? should we have a no speech list ? a no jury list ?
Another idea is a ban on semi-automatic rifles , this proposal depends on the fallacy that terrorists and criminals will somehow decide not to commit terror acts if they can not go to a store and buy a rifle . In reality all mass shootings are done by people who planned their crimes and took the time to study the target . Banning drugs did n't make cocaine and heroin disappear , banning alcohol during prohibition did n't make liquor disappear so why does anyone think that they can not buy weapons from the black market ? Or even use some other deadly weapon such as explosives . The Boston marathon and Oklahoma bombers used home-made explosives in their attacks . Who will really be affected by this weapon ban ? law-abiding citizens are the ones who wo n't be able to buy guns to defend themselves .
Another thing worth noting is the bad history of government failing to protect us against terrorist attacks and mass shooting using the powers they already have :
The FBI investigated that terrorist that executed the Orlando attack several times and they could n't see that he is dangerous and capable of murdering people , will anyone be held accountable for that ?
The FBI was tipped about the Boston Marathon Bombers but they failed to follow the lead and stop them before they commit their crimes .
The police in Orlando took 3 hours to enter the club and kill the shooter , is anybody going to be held accountable for the lives that could have been saved if they acted sooner ?
All of the mass shooting in the United States happened in gun free zones , is anyone going or were held accountable for denying the people the right to self-defense in those zones ?
Some people claim that there is a balance between security and liberty , this is a false choice . If someone is dangerous then it is the government duty to make the legal case against that person and bring him or her to justice where a jury can weigh the evidence and decide whether the person is guilty or not . If the government is incapable of finding and prosecuting terrorists and criminals before they strike then they should n't disarm law-abiding citizens and leave them defenseless against potential attacks .
Hillary and the press
Are the news media being beastly to Hillary Clinton ? Are political reporters and commentators - as Bill Clinton suggested , but did n't quite come out and say , in a radio interview Tuesday - basically in the tank for Barack Obama ?
`` The political press has avowedly played a role in this election . I 've never seen this before , '' the former president said . `` They 've been active participants in this election . ... But I do n't want to talk about the press . I want to talk about the people . That 's what 's wrong with this election , people trying to take this election away from the people . ''
Somewhere in there , if I 'm not mistaken , he acknowledged that journalists are people , too , so I guess I should be thankful for that . And I should note that throughout the interview with Washington 's WMAL , Bill Clinton was back in loose-cannon mode . He said Hillary Clinton `` has been the underdog ever since Iowa , '' which is not true . To support that unsupportable assertion , he implied that the political establishment is opposed to his wife 's candidacy , which is not true . And he claimed that `` we 've gotten plenty of delegates on a shoestring , '' which is true only if you do n't count the more than $ 100 million the Clinton campaign has raised ( and mostly spent ) .
The former president also explained some of the campaign 's embarrassing losses by saying that caucuses `` disproportionately favor upper-income voters , '' and said of those rich folks that they `` do n't really need a president but feel like they need a change . '' I do n't recall traffic jams of chauffeured limousines around the caucus sites in Iowa , Maine and the other caucus states Clinton lost .
The theme of press bias , however , is woven through the Clinton campaign 's narrative of the story thus far . There are two basic allegations : that journalists look at Obama uncritically while subjecting Hillary Clinton to microscopic scrutiny ; and that we react with hair-trigger reflexes when attacks on Obama have the slightest whiff of racism , but do n't seem to notice , or care , when Clinton is subjected to rank sexism .
The first charge is just bogus , in my view . Like Clinton , Obama has developed position papers on all the major issues . Clinton has been able to highlight the differences between her proposals and Obama 's - for example , the fact that her plan for universal health insurance includes a mandate , whereas Obama 's does not . In debates , she has had the chance to challenge his approach and defend her own . It is not the media 's fault if voters fail to agree with Clinton that nominating Obama would be a `` leap of faith . ''
It is true that the candidates ' stump speeches are markedly different : Clinton 's is about competence and diligence , Obama 's about hope and change . But journalists did n't write those speeches , campaign speechwriters did . And any reporter or commentator who failed to note that Obama is an exceptional public speaker would be guilty of journalistic malpractice .
Reporters are busy combing through Obama 's personal , professional and financial history , just as they have examined the lives of the Clintons . Obama has facilitated this process by releasing his tax returns , which Clinton has declined to do . It is not unfair to point this out .
The contention about racism versus sexism is harder to dismiss out of hand . Being unapologetically racist or sexist is no longer acceptable in this country , at least in most settings . The social censure for being publicly racist , though , is well codified ; the perpetrator must recant and repent , and may never completely eliminate the taint . There 's also pretty solid consensus on what 's racist and what is n't . The views on sexism are less settled .
When John Edwards , in one of the early ensemble-cast debates , mentioned Hillary Clinton 's attire , I think everyone agreed he had made a mistake . Yet it 's not always out of bounds to comment on a presidential candidate 's wardrobe and appearance , or else we would n't have chuckled at Edwards ' $ 400 haircut or Mitt Romney 's game-show-host mien .
When people refer to Hillary Clinton as strident , is that a sexist code word ? I think it probably is .
But when her speaking voice is described unfavorably , is that blaming her unfairly for physiology that 's obviously beyond her control ? Are male journalists just not used to hearing a woman 's voice speak with presidential authority ? Or are they making a valid observation about dynamics and tone , which are within her power to modulate ?
Is sexism in the coverage of the Clinton campaign excusable ? No , and we deserve to be called on it . But it was n't the media that decided she should take for granted all those states Barack Obama has been winning .
As the social media taunts the huge subsidy to India 's parliamentarians in their canteen within the complex , Biju Janata Dal MP Jay Panda on Thursday shot off a letter to Speaker Sumitra Mahajan 's office asking for the privilege to be removed to ensure `` greater public trust and confidence '' in the lawmakers .
`` As you would know , recent media attention has focussed on this issue with citizens remarking on the oddity of this privilege , '' the politician from Odisha writes in his letter to Mahajan . `` I am of this opinion as well as believe the removal of the food subsidy for the MPs will be a right step in effecting greater public trust and confidence in our role as lawmakers , '' he adds .
`` The recent efforts by the government to encourage the voluntary giving up of the subsidised cooking gas by those citizens who can afford it , is laudable ... In appreciating this logic , I believe that we MPs too should be willing to give up the food subsidy extended to us , '' Panda writes , referring to the Give It Up campaign launched by the NDA government regarding the LPG subsidy .
Parliamentarians , earning over Rs 1.4 lakh per month with perks , relish items like fried fish with chips at Rs 25 , mutton cutlet at Rs 18 , oiled vegetables at Rs 5 , mutton curry with bone at Rs 20 and masala dosa at Rs 6 with rates subsidised by 63 per cent , 65 per cent , 83 per cent , 67 per cent and 75 per cent , respectively .
The cost for procuring raw items of dish like stew vegetables comes to about Rs 41.25 while the MPs are getting it for Rs 4 , which is a subsidy of about 90 per cent . Papad costs Rs 1.98 but sold at Rs 1 in these canteens with a whopping subsidy of 98 per cent .
For the non-vegetarian meal , raw items are procured at Rs 99.05 while the prepared dish is served at Rs 33 to MPs with 66 per cent subsidy , the reply provided to RTI activist Subhash Agrawal shows , adding that the present rates of dishes have not been revised since December 20 , 2010 .
Others also eat here , says government
Last month , the government had said it was wrong to blame only the lawmakers for enjoying sumptuous meals in the canteen at highly subsidised rates , claiming that bureaucrats and journalists covering Parliament also used the facility . The government response came a day after an RTI query revealed that it got a total subsidy of Rs 60.7 crore during the last five years with items like puri sabzi being sold at 88 per cent subsidised rates .

Previous social media fails like # McDStories may have left users with a bad taste in their mouth , but it is hard to imagine a bigger fail than Koch Industries ' efforts . To be fair , it 's challenging to whitewash a brand that many people associate with election shenanigans , but it is hard to imagine a worse social media fail . In conjunction with the company 's national TV blitz , viewers were directed to the # WeAreKoch hashtag . However , a prankster registered the @ WeAreKochs username for use as a parody , and unleashed a torrent of insulting and hysterical posts pointing out the company 's ethical lapses and fringe politics , concurrent with the TV media blitz . The posts struck a chord with users , who retweeted at a strong pace despite the account 's initial lack of following . That left the hashtag populated with posts like :

They attempted to disconnect us from homeland , erase our native tongue , and shun our native religions . They attempted to beat us physically , emotionally and spiritually into submission . But we held on . We held on to our ways of life , our creativity , our spirituality and our dignity .
Outlawing and denying us the rights to read and earn an education , we relied strongly on our long African oral tradition . This tradition manifest itself in the black church , as well as in our music today .
Oh , our music .
We created jazz , rock & roll , rhythm and blues and hip hop . Sounds that influenced many , transcending races . Giving joy and hope to millions . Robbed to the point its now American Music , drop the African and hyphen .
We created cuisine from scraps during slavery and economic hardships thereafter .
Hughes knew rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of blood in human veins . And Maya Angelou spoke how a cage bird , wings clipped and feet tied , still sung of freedom .
The persistence of Black Life to survive in the face of annihilation . Turning , bending , leaping , Alvin Ailey 's Revelations told a story of faith to endure slavery to freedom . Jacob Lawrence with vibrant Harlem colors in The Great Migration , showed what the Black experience is , a Beautiful Struggle .

When it comes to Auburn football , Shedrick Jackson has the ultimate pedigree . Shedrick 's great-uncle , Bo Jackson , won the Heisman Trophy while playing for the Tigers in 1985 en route to a memorable career in both the NFL and MLB .
Thirty-two years after taking home college football 's highest individual award , Bo 's nephew announced his commitment to Auburn in an epic two-minute video .
The Class of 2018 wide receiver can be seen watching football highlights of his uncle , before a sequence of clips showed Shedrick working out , running routes and fitting an Auburn cap on his head to conclude the video . Shedrick is coming off a Class 7A State Championship with Hoover ( Alabama ) and according to AL.com , committed to Auburn over offers from Missouri , Mississippi State Georgia Tech and Memphis .
Shedrick also told the outlet he plans to sign in December , enroll early at the university and eventually play inside receiver . His great-uncle , of course , played running back and even has a statue outside the Tigers ' stadium to commemorate his Heisman season . Extreme expectations should n't be anything new to Shedrick , and he appears comfortable following the path of Bo .
`` My family gave me my name , '' Shedrick said in the video . `` Now it 's up to me to live up to that name . ''
SOCHI , Russia – How dominating are the U.S. and Canadian women 's hockey teams ?
Consider that the U.S. won the first Olympic gold in women 's hockey in 1998 , followed by three Canadian victories . The lone final that did n't have both teams was in 2006 in Turin , when Sweden won silver and the U.S. captured bronze .
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Consider that in the Vancouver Olympics , the U.S. and Canada defeated their six preliminary round rivals by a combined scored of 72-3 .
Consider that because of their supremacy , the International Ice Hockey Federation reinvented its tournament format to avoid having teams ' spirits crushed as badly as they were crushed on the scoreboard .
The U.S. and Canada literally forced the Olympics to rearrange its tournament , for them .
The new format has the top ranked teams placed in the same division , rather than having the U.S. and Canada as the top seeds in opposite divisions . Here are the divisions for the Sochi 2014 women 's tournament , which begins on Feb. 8 with the U.S. playing Finland and Canada facing Switzerland :
Recognizing how self-defeating it would be to place its best teams in a “ group of death , '' the IIHF essentially formalized what we all knew anyway : That the preliminaries are a cake-walk for the tournament 's best teams . So the four teams in Group A are already qualified for the medal round ; the prelims are for seeding purposes , with Canada and the U.S. the top two teams getting a bye through to the semifinals .
The top two teams from Group B face the other two teams from Group A in the quarterfinals of the medal round , with a royal arse-smashing awaiting them in the penultimate games .
Story continues
“ I think it 's great , ” said U.S. women 's coach Katey Stone of the format change , after he team 's first practice in Sochi on Monday . “ It 's great for the game , it 's great for the spectators . Obviously , you come to an Olympic event and you want to play the best competition you can when you put on the jersey .
“ We 've learned in the last two world championships what kind of excitement it can bring to the game . It 's all good in my opinion . ”
It 's also a necessity .
The IOC had made noise after the Vancouver Games about women 's hockey and its viability as an Olympic sport , considering how the scales tipped so dramatically in the elite teams ' favor .
“ We can not continue without improvement , ” said Jacques Rogge , head of the IOC .
The IIHF reacted with a $ 2.1-million plan to increase participation in the women 's game around the world . One way to encourage that : Give weaker nations a taste of Olympic glory , even if it 's before they meet their inevitable end at the hands of the North American mega powers .
Hence , the new tournament format was enacted for the 2012 world championships . The result ? There were 10 one-goal games at that tournament , only two games with margins of victory greater than 10 goals and the Swiss medaled for the first time in their history .
So it appears the format will be a way for teams like Japan and Russia to linger longer in contention , or simply play tighter games , than they would have under the previous format . More drama , better competition and a more compelling product ; perhaps compelling enough to attract more players to the sport .
But while this new format helps the lesser teams , it also creates a tougher road for the favorites .
Julie Chu of the U.S. women 's team was unfazed by that .
“ We like the worlds format . The competition 's great . But it 's not something you can ever control , ” she said .
“ They give us a schedule . We see who we play . And it 's ‘ game on . ' ”

White House spokesman Jay Carney dodged a question from Politico reporter Glenn Thrush Tuesday about whether President Obama would address the American people directly about the NSA 's extensive surveillance program .
THRUSH : On the NSA thing , it 's obviously a big deal . You 've got members of the president 's own party questioning what the DNI said about this . This clearly has repercussions that are far more significant than some of the other things we 've talked about . Is n't it time for the president to address the American people directly ? Is n't this sort of litmus of leadership to tell people when you are taking them in a new direction and when they are confronted with these various challenges ?
CARNEY : Well , Glenn , the president took questions and answered them at length on this specific issue on Friday . I think he answered for a total of 14 minutes . Two multi-part questions on these issues that probably given the standards here , that 's six or eight questions . And the fact of the matter is he will continue to discuss this , and he will continue — he is interested in and believes in a debate about these issues and believes it 's worthy and important to engage in that debate . I would just note , as I did earlier , that prior to these revelations , the president addressed this specific issue in a speech at the National Defense University — you were n't interested until there were revelations .
THRUSH : Most Americans were not aware of this . Do n't you think former —
CARNEY : Let me just say that the Patriot Act is a public statute . There is spirited and animated debate about the re-authorization of the patriot act every time it comes up for re-authorization , which includes most recently in 2011 . The provisions under which the sections of the law under which these programs exist have been and are debated and they have been since the first re-authorization , updated in a way that made sure that oversight that did not exist over programs in the previous administration , in the first years of the previous administration , does exist . And that was at the insistence of lawmakers , including then-Senator Obama , that kind of enhanced oversight by the — all three branches of government take place and exist with programs that are vital to our national security .
THRUSH : Mike Mukasey has said the president ought to have a fireside chat with the American people about this . Why not do that ?
CARNEY : I 'm not saying — I think i just said , Glenn , although I appreciate yours and the former Attorney General 's specific recommendations about the modalities of presidential communication , the president has and will speak about this subject .
Colorblind casting is essential to opera 's future . Still , in this day and age , it can be startling to see Caucasian singers made up to look Japanese , even in the artist Jun Kaneko 's striking “ Madame Butterfly ” production ( seen here at the San Francisco Opera last year , but coming to the Washington National Opera in May ) . ( Cory Weaver )
Here we go again : Beginning on Saturday , the Washington National Opera is staging Puccini 's beloved and oft-performed “ Madame Butterfly , ” the story of a Japanese woman betrayed by her American husband . The production , originally created in 2006 , is designed by a Japanese artist , Jun Kaneko , last seen in Washington with his opulent “ The Magic Flute. ” But of the four sopranos appearing in the lead role on different nights , two are Korean ( including the promising soprano Sae-Kyung Rim , in her U.S. debut ) , one is Latina and one Albanian — Ermonela Jaho , who will sing the part opening night . And on the company 's Facebook page , the debate has started about the inappropriateness of non-Asian singers portraying a Japanese heroine .
Two years ago , it was Verdi 's “ Otello ” at the Metropolitan Opera — the company 's decision not to put dark makeup on the Caucasian tenor singing the main role opened up a discussion about blackface and cultural appropriation in opera . Such discussions are happening with more frequency , in part because the culture is slowly waking up to the subtle ways that systemic racism plays out . At the same time the “ Otello ” debate was happening , the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players canceled an upcoming production of “ The Mikado ” over concerns about how the mainly white cast was going to present the work 's broad Japanese stereotypes . ( This is a long-standing problem with “ The Mikado , ” which spoofs British society through a faux-Japanese lens . )
We need to be having these discussions if we truly want to keep opera relevant and viable . The point is not to stop performing “ The Mikado , ” but to find acceptable ways of doing it .
One problem is that some opera aficionados see in such allegations only an attack on their beloved art form . Political correctness run amok , people say , pointing out that “ Madame Butterfly ” was written in 1903 , at a time when Japanese sopranos did not appear in Western opera houses . “ Butterfly , ” it could be argued , is less Japanese than an Italian-American hybrid , a creature of opera .
Yoko Watanabe , one of the first Japanese sopranos to play the role frequently in the West , who died in 2004 , summed up the part in a 1991 interview that the Los Angeles Times quoted in her obituary . “ It is true that my figure is Japanese , so when the public sees me as Cio-Cio San , it is more convincing , ” she said . “ But when it comes time to sing , it is not a Japanese singer , it is Italian verismo opera . The accent has to be clear , the gestures are big ; it 's so far from Japanese that it 's completely different . ”
Certainly , many Caucasian sopranos over the years have approached the role of Butterfly with love , seriousness and dedication . Indeed , they may have redeemed the role from the original conception of “ Butterfly 's ” originator , the American writer David Belasco , whose Cio-Cio San is a figure of such broad stereotype , speaking in pidgin English , that she is literally difficult to read , on more than one level .
But this does n't alter the basic fact that opera still has a lot of trouble with diversity . Female composers and conductors remain in a minority ; African American singers still face challenges getting hired in works other than “ Porgy and Bess ” and “ Show Boat. ” And opera 's pace of change is arguably slower than that of the larger entertainment world — # oscarssowhite notwithstanding — because opera can always fall back on the very real argument that casting is all about voice type , not race .
[ Talking race and “ blackface ” in opera . ]
Indeed , opera singers of color are among the most likely to argue against racially correct casting . For singers who have had to fight their whole careers for colorblind casting , to enable a black bass-baritone to sing Macbeth or an Asian American tenor to sing Candide , it might feel like taking two steps backward to say that only a Japanese singer should take on Butterfly — implicitly closing a door , perhaps , on other roles for that same Japanese soprano . ( This does n't even start the debate of whether it 's better to have a Korean soprano in the role than a Caucasian one . Is that equally incorrect ; does it imply that all Asians look alike ? )
These days , the opera field itself is effectively sabotaging the argument that voice type comes first . Opera is increasingly trying to present itself as just another form of drama , a musical equivalent of spoken theater or film , with its cinematic broadcasts and emphasis on younger , more attractive performers . That argument is problematic : Opera is n't , in fact , equivalent to a TV show and does n't hold up well in the comparison ; its strengths lie elsewhere . But if you 're going to make that argument , then you have to accept that you 're going to be held to the same entertainment-world standards , which means being blasted for racial insensitivity when casting white performers in Asian or black or Latino roles . Witness the recent kerfluffle when Scarlett Johansson was cast in the lead role of “ The Ghost in the Shell , ” a film based on a popular manga and animé series .
[ ‘ Ghost in the Shell ' : the most intriguing arguments on whitewashing charges . ]
Colorblind casting is essential to the future of opera : I want to be able to hear Mary Elizabeth Williams as Tosca or Russell Thomas as Don Carlo ( which he will sing with the Washington National Opera in March ) . And , therefore , I defend the choice to cast non-Asian singers in the title role of Madame Butterfly — such as when the soprano Latonia Moore , who happens to be African American , recently sang the role at the San Diego Opera . But it 's imperative that opera start being more sensitive to these issues , first by working harder to make its casting diverse across the board ( an area in which the Washington National Opera does better than most other opera companies in this country ) . Another solution , perhaps , is to have more open , public discussions about the issues involved — a discussion involving singers of color rather than just white administrators . The point , after all , is to emphasize the ability of the art form to communicate , meaningfully , to a wide range of people — not by clinging to old habits and traditions , but by showing today 's world just how much it has to offer .
Madame Butterfly runs through May 21 at the Washington National Opera . Tickets are $ 25 to $ 300 . Go to kennedy-center.org or call 202-467-4600 . The May 19 performance will be sung by current and past members of the Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program .

Steve Yzerman 's name has stood out since last Wednesday night 's report that he was on the short-list for the Tampa Bay Lightning general manager vacancy . I 've tried to play it down because team owner Jeff Vinik has made it a point ( and stressed it ) that a GM will not be hired by the club until a CEO is in place ( thus my obsession with the CEO rumors of late ) .
But it 's really impossible to play down a name like Steve Yzerman . Not with his on-ice accomplishments in Hockeytown USA and for his country in international play .
But is he ready for Hockey Bay , USA ? Is he willing ?
Chris Botta , renown for his work at NYI Point Blank and writing for NHL Fanhouse , reported today that Yzerman is candidate one for the Tampa Bay Lightning GM gig ... Or at least an un-named source told him as much .
A source tells NHL FanHouse the job could be Yzerman 's if he is able to convince management of his commitment for the long haul . Yzerman , the Detroit legend , currently holds a desk job with the Red Wings . His departure from the city where he is beloved will not come easily .
With new owner Jeff Vinik dedicated to building a winner and spending , and Steven Stamkos on the verge of superstardom , the Tampa Bay job is an attractive opportunity .
We 're told that Vinik does not believe he has to go to the `` old boys ' club '' of NHL GMs . Although Yzerman managed Team Canada to gold at the Olympics , this would be his first position as an NHL general manager . The Lightning are said to have interviewed a handful of candidates also seeking their first shot behind the big desk .
We touched on the potential of someone outside `` the old boy club '' could be a candidate for a role with the Bolts ( either as CEO or GM ) . Yzerman may not be a traditional GM entrenched in front office politics , but in different ways , he still is an Old Boy . He 's got his connections in the hockey world and they could serve him in one fashion or another as GM .
But Damian Cristodero 's story at Lightning Strikes from a few days ago , talking about Yzerman as a candidate , throws cold water on the idea Yzerman 's hiring is imminent . That comes by way of former coach ( and Times Palace press box mainstay ) Scotty Bowman :
`` I 'd be surprised if he leaves , '' Bowman said Friday . `` He 's like the son to the owner . He 's been there nearly 30 years , and I think he 's in line to move up the chain . ''
There are other points , not from the former coach , about why Yzerman may be hesitant to head south . His family being the number one reason . This would n't be the first time family has factored in on a move , of course .
Whatever the case , we likely wo n't have a clue what is going on with the Lightning and Yzerman until the Red Wings are eliminated from the playoffs . The last thing Steve would want to be for his club is a distraction .

Hope Solo has disappeared from the World Cup .
Make no mistake : She has started every match for the U.S. women 's national soccer team ahead of Tuesday 's World Cup semifinal against Germany at Olympic Stadium .
On and off the field , though , there are few signs of her .
For both the squad and the player , this is a welcome development .
Early this month , on the eve of the group opener in Winnipeg , the goalkeeper 's dark past resurfaced after fresh details about her 2014 domestic violence case emerged .
It rekindled debate about whether she should have been allowed to continue playing , and it tugged attention from the team 's championship campaign .
Hope Solo , the flawed woman , had again superseded Hope Solo , the sport 's premier shot-stopper .
She had not done anything new to bring it about , but her personal drama had again caught up to her and , by extension , drawn the team into it . This was the risk the U.S. Soccer Federation took when it kept her on the squad during the legal saga and when it reinstated her after a month-long suspension stemming from an unrelated incident .
The timing of the latest story , which included allegations of an alcohol-fueled tirade against police officers , could not have been worse .
As the Americans began the quest for their first title in 16 years , Coach Jill Ellis and the players found themselves answering questions about matters unrelated to the upcoming matches in the so-called Group of Death .
But over the course of three weeks across Canada , Solo has become almost inconspicuous . The most polarizing figure in American soccer has kept quiet behind the scenes , and thanks to an immaculate defensive corps , she has become an ancillary figure on the sport 's grandest stage .
She has not spoken publicly since after the first game . In subsequent days , she did not respond to comments by Swedish Coach Pia Sundhage , the former U.S. boss , who called her a “ piece of work . . . . It 's a little bumpy road ” coaching Solo .
After each of the past four games , she has strolled through the media mixed zone politely declining interview requests . Before practice sessions , when a rotation of two or three different players is typically made available for interviews , the USSF has not forced her to take questions .
From all indications , Solo has been a good teammate and positive influence during the World Cup odyssey .
“ I have really noticed her — on the field , off the field — just [ having ] a really good focus , ” Ellis said after a 1-0 quarterfinal victory against China on Friday in Ottawa .
Solo has benefited from a defense guarding her like deep-woods mosquito repellent . Since rescuing the Americans with several sensational saves in the 3-1 opening victory against Australia , she has recorded four consecutive shutouts . The 423-minute streak is the third longest in tournament history .
Along the way , Solo , 33 , has set the record for most victories ( 134 ) and appearances ( 175 ) by a U.S. goalkeeper and extended her marks in shutouts ( 88 ) and starts ( 169 ) .
“ She has made some saves that have kept us in games , ” midfielder Morgan Brian said . “ That 's what her job is . That 's what she 's been used to . ”
Opponents are n't scoring because they are n't getting chances . In the past four matches , the defense has conceded seven shots on goal . Solo 's intermittent saves have been routine , and for most of the 90 minutes , she is a lonely figure watching over an unthreatened fortress .
“ I think she is very happy about that , ” right back Ali Krieger said . “ She is prepared , no matter what . She 's professional enough to be ready whenever that moment comes , especially when we have to play the ball back to her . . . . She 's always on her toes , always prepared and ready for a big play . ”
Krieger , a Prince William County native , and Meghan Klingenberg have staffed the corners of the back line , while Julie Johnston and Becky Sauerbrunn ( University of Virginia ) have formed the World Cup 's best center-back combination . The United States and Brazil are the only teams to concede a single goal . ( Brazil was eliminated by Australia in the round of 16 . )
Solo 's tranquility on two fronts might end soon , though .
On the field , she and the second-ranked U.S. squad will face their stiffest test to date against No . 1 Germany , which leads the tournament by wide margins in goals with 20 ( albeit 10 in one game ) , as well as shots and shots on goal .
And when the U.S. World Cup effort ends , whether against Japan or England in the third-place match Saturday in Edmonton or Sunday 's final in Vancouver , Solo might face a fresh round of legal issues . Prosecutors have appealed a judge 's decision last winter to dismiss the assault charges .
The two sides of Hope Solo may take turns stepping into the shadows , but for better and worse , they never fade away .
High energy costs are undermining efforts to tackle fuel poverty says Executive as Scottish Power announce price hikes .
© STV
Efforts to lift people in Scotland out of fuel poverty are being undermined by ever-increasing energy prices , the Scottish Government has said .
Responding to news that Scottish Power has likely sparked a further wave of energy bill rises , the Scottish Government has called on energy regulator Ofgem to `` wake up '' and examine why energy companies are not doing more to manage the effects of `` price volatility '' .
Scottish Power announced on Tuesday it will charge its gas customers an extra 19 % on average and electricity customers an extra 10 % , as of August 1 .
Other suppliers seem certain to follow suit , blaming rising wholesale costs .
A Scottish Government spokesman said : `` Time and again the Scottish Government 's efforts to lift people out of fuel poverty are being undermined by high fuel prices . Energy companies choose to pass price fluctuations on in full to the consumer , meaning that those least able to do so are the ones bearing the full brunt . ''
He added : `` It 's time Ofgem woke up to this significant issue and looked at why the energy companies are not doing more to manage and mitigate more of the effects of price volatility . ''
SNP Westminster energy spokesman Mike Weir said the UK Government must now step in , adding : `` Soaring prices are particularly hard to swallow when Scotland is such an energy-rich country yet faces steep rises in prices .
`` We must have a top level review of the domestic and international energy market . ''
According to Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray , the Scottish Government needs to `` get its act together '' to help those most vulnerable to the price spike .
He added : `` Fuel prices can go up by 10 % or 20 % but pensions wo n't rise in line with this . ''
Liberal Democrat Scottish energy spokesman Liam McArthur said the Scottish Power 's increased charges will lead to a `` domino effect '' as other energy companies make similar announcements .
He said : `` This reduces the options available for customers looking to try to keep their bills down and increases the challenge in tackling fuel poverty . This news will be of particular concern to more vulnerable individuals and households .
`` Ensuring measures are put in place to help meet their needs must be the priority of Scottish ministers over the course of the coming months . ''
Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie said energy is `` too important to leave to market forces '' .
He added : `` It 's time for serious government action to shift to a robust and diverse mix of renewables and away from oil and gas , otherwise this country will always be vulnerable to ever-rising prices and worsening fuel poverty . ''
Citizens Advice Scotland chief executive Lucy McTernan agreed that Scottish Power 's announcement is likely to encourage other firms to do the same .
She said : `` The regulators , Ofgem , have made clear that they are unhappy with the way the fuel companies are behaving . It is time for government to take a serious look at this issue and take whatever action is required to ensure that Scottish consumers get fair treatment . ''
Shelter Scotland 's Gordon MacRae said prices can not keep going up , adding : `` Something 's got to give . Either the short-term profit margins of utility companies or , for families , the choice of heating or eating . ''

Donald Trump 's already badly wobbling presidency just took another major hit thanks to Republican House Freedom Caucus members , who somehow found Paul Ryan 's version of “ repealing and replacing ” the Affordable Care Act too generous , and are blocking its passage .
Reacting Thursday night like a losing gambler , Trump raised the stakes on health care by threatening to leave the entire ACA in place if House Republicans do not accede to Ryan 's bill . ( The frantic Trump has even discarded his own counsel from The Art of the Deal , where he warns , “ Never seem desperate . ” )
The Ryan bill , contrary to Trump 's longstanding pledge not to cut Medicaid , slashes about $ 880 billion from the program , but Freedom Caucus members want to go much further . They seek to jettison even provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions and preventing lifetime limits on coverage , both of which have proven to be intensely popular across a broad political spectrum .
Their intransigence sent Ryan rushing to the White House Friday afternoon with bad news for Donald Trump : despite the President 's arm-twisting , deal-making , and ultimatum , he still did n't have the votes to repeal Obamacare .
The Freedom Caucus members have badly embarrassed Trump by halting Ryan 's American Health Care Act proposal . The resistance appears extraordinary , given how closely Ryan 's plan meets the ultimate policy dreams of arch-conservatives .
The bill is a $ 600 billion trickle-down tax cut for the top 1 percent , big drug companies , and other corporate interests , coupled with a sweeping set of proposals that would devastate care for the most vulnerable ACA beneficiaries like the poor , disabled , and elderly . The Ryan plan would produce more deaths by swelling the ranks of the uninsured whose untreated conditions prove fatal .
“ The Republican plan to replace the ACA would leave 52 million people uninsured in 2026 , ” concluded health professionals in an article published in the American Journal of Public Health this week . “ We know that will lead to many deaths—at least 41,969 and perhaps many times that number . ”
Yet Ryan did not apply the chainsaw vigorously enough for Freedom Caucus members who reject even provisions requiring that insurers cover vital needs like pediatric dental care . They also ignore the viciousness of the plan 's regressive shifts in tax credits—away from older , poorer patients .
For example , the average sixty-four-year-old making $ 26,500 in one area of Ryan 's Wisconsin district would see a premium increase from $ 1,598 to an incredible $ 10,572 . It 's no wonder that Ryan has shied away from town hall meetings in his district .
Whatever bill arises from the rubble in the House—if one does—will still face an entirely different set of concerns from Senate Republicans alarmed by the prospect of what Ryancare cuts would mean to their constituents . The loss of fervor for obliterating “ Obamacare ” reflects a major shift among Republican voters and the general public . Notably , the share of Republicans who believe government must ensure access to healthcare for all has climbed from 31 percent late last year to 52 percent currently . More broadly , American voters now oppose the Republican plan by a whopping 56 percent to 17 percent margin , with 26 percent undecided , according to a new Quinnipiac University poll .
Are we witnessing the emergence of a public consensus that insists the nation build upon , not blindly destroy , the ACA 's gains in providing health care to Americans ?
If so , perhaps this might provide some traction for going beyond protecting the ACA to addressing the massive barriers that still exist to affordable , easily accessible , and high-quality care . “ Unaffordable under-insurance ” afflicts people across income boundaries . As the American Journal of Public Health authors stated powerfully , “ The ACA extended coverage to 20 million Americans . But it offered little help to 90 percent of the population , including the 26 million who remain uninsured and millions more with unaffordable copayments and deductibles . ”
Ironically , Trump 's failed bet on Ryancare could help push more Americans toward demanding a Medicare-for-all option . Trump has raised the public 's expectations about what American health care should provide , hammering on the pervasive problems of ever-rising premiums and unaffordable deductibles and declaring that “ insurance for everyone ” is his goal .
The way to get there is clearly not through Ryancare .
Utah police officer Jeff Payne , who dragged screaming nurse Alex Wubbels , is fired
Posted
A Utah police officer who was caught on video roughly handcuffing and `` dragging '' a nurse out of hospital because she refused to allow a blood draw from an unconscious patient has been fired .
Key points : Jeff Payne is fired after it is found his conduct was `` inappropriate , unreasonable , unwarranted … [ and ] disrespectful ''
His lawyer says he will appeal the `` unfair and over-the-top '' decision
Alex Wubbels , the nurse at the centre of the case , says she is pleased by the decision
Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown made the decision to fire Detective Jeff Payne after an internal investigation found he violated department policies when he arrested nurse Alex Wubbels and dragged her screaming from the hospital , department spokesman Sergeant Brandon Shearer said .
Mr Brown said in a disciplinary letter that he was `` deeply troubled '' by Mr Payne 's conduct , which he described as `` inappropriate , unreasonable , unwarranted , discourteous , disrespectful '' and said brought `` significant disrepute '' on the department .
`` You demonstrated extremely poor professional judgment [ especially for an officer with 27 years of experience ] , which calls into question your ability to effectively serve the public and the department , '' Chief Brown wrote .
Attorney Greg Skordas , who represents Mr Payne , said his client plans to appeal a firing he considers unfair and over the top .
Mr Skordas said Mr Payne would still be employed if the body camera footage had not generated so much attention and blown the events out of proportion .
Mr Payne 's supervisor , Lieutenant James Tracy , was demoted to officer .
His lawyer , Ed Brass , could not immediately be reached by the Associated Press .
Mr Tracy made an impulsive decision in ordering Mr Payne to arrest Ms Wubbels without first taking time to understand the facts of the situation and the law , Chief Brown wrote in his disciplinary letter .
He said the order created chaos and unnecessarily escalated the situation .
`` Your lack of judgment and leadership in this matter is unacceptable , and as a result , I no longer believe that you can retain a leadership position in the department , '' Chief Brown said .
The letter said Ms Wubbels told investigators that Mr Tracy minimised her concerns , intimidated and lectured her , and made her feel like she was to blame for the events .
The Associated Press obtained the disciplinary letters for Mr Payne and Mr Tracy through a public records request .
Nurse grateful for bodycam footage
Ms Wubbels ' attorney , Karra Porter , said they are pleased that Chief Brown took action and recognised that the officers made crucial mistakes that have eroded public trust .
Ms Porter said she hopes the events are a catalyst to more public conversations about appropriate police behaviour .
The case shows the vital importance of officers wearing body cameras and making those videos available to the public , Ms Porter said .
`` Without the body camera footage , it would have been a she-said , they-said , '' Ms Porter said .
`` Alex feels very strongly that her story would have never been told if it were n't for the body camera footage . ''
Asked about a potential lawsuit , Ms Porter said she expects to meet soon with city officials to discuss next steps that could include settlement talks .
The officers have five business days to appeal the decisions by the chief .
Flashpoint in US conversation about use of force
The case received widespread attention after police body camera video was released by Ms Wubbels and her lawyer in late August .
The video showed her explaining that hospital policy required a warrant or formal consent to draw blood from the patient , who had been injured in a car crash .
The patient was not suspected of wrongdoing . He was an off-duty reserve Idaho police officer driving a semi-trailer when he was hit by a man fleeing police in a utility vehicle .
Mr Payne nevertheless insisted on the blood draw , saying the evidence would protect the man .
Mr Payne told Ms Wubbels his supervisor said he should arrest her if she did not allow the draw .
Ms Wubbels was later freed from the handcuffs and has not been charged .
Both officers were investigated and placed on paid administrative leave after the video became public .
Salt Lake City police apologised and changed their policies .
Prosecutors , meanwhile , opened a criminal investigation into the arrest and asked the FBI to determine if there were any civil rights violations .
Mr Payne was also fired from a part-time job as a paramedic after he was caught on camera saying he would take transient patients to the University of Utah hospital where Ms Wubbels worked and transport `` good patients '' elsewhere .
Mr Payne had previously been disciplined in 2013 after internal affairs investigators confirmed he sexually harassed a female co-worker in a `` persistent and severe '' way .
His tenure also brought commendations for solving burglary cases and being shot in the shoulder during a traffic stop in 1998 .
Mr Tracy , meanwhile , earned commendations for drug and burglary investigations .

North and South Korea reached an agreement early Tuesday to resolve the showdown on the divided peninsula , with Pyongyang promising to express regret for recent provocations , including a land-mine attack that severely injured two South Korean soldiers .
In return , Seoul agreed to turn off the loudspeakers that have angered Pyongyang so much that it had entered what the North called a “ quasi-state of war. ” Shortly after noon Tuesday , South Korea announced that it had stopped the broadcasts .
The deal came after three days of marathon talks during which North Korea was moving troops and military equipment to the border , apparently trying to signal that it was ready for combat , while South Korea declared that it would retaliate against any provocation .
Initial details suggested that the deal was a win for South Korea , although it fell short of the full-throated apology Seoul wanted from Pyongyang for the attack this month in which two soldiers stepped on a North Korean box mine on a known patrol path just over the southern side of the border . One soldier lost both legs , while the other lost one .
Kim Kwan-jin , the South Korean president 's national security adviser , told reporters in Seoul shortly after 2 a.m. that North Korea 's willingness to express regret was “ very meaningful . ”
“ We expect the two sides will implement the agreement in good faith and create trust through dialogue and cooperation , ” Kim said , according to the Yonhap News Agency .
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 's regime also promised not to stage any more provocations and said it would start talks to allow the resumption of reunions between relatives who were separated when the division of the Korean Peninsula was cemented at the end of the Korean War . The estranged neighbors said they would continue talking to try to resolve other differences .
“ We welcome this agreement and are hopeful it leads to decreasing tensions on the peninsula , ” said John Kirby , a State Department spokesman , although he also said the United States would judge North Korea by its actions .
Ban Ki-moon , the U.N. secretary general and a South Korean , said he hoped that the ­inter-Korean talks would “ lead to the resumption of talks for addressing the nuclear issue . ”
Although Pyongyang promised only to express regret for the injured soldiers and did not take responsibility for causing the injuries , the concessions made by the North underscore the lengths to which Kim 's representatives were prepared to go to silence the loudspeakers . They had been blaring messages into North Korea that amounted to outrageous treachery , at least to regime ears .

“ Kim Jong-un 's incompetent regime is trying to deceive the world with its lame lies , ” a kind-sounding woman would say in a slow , deliberate voice emanating from one of the banks of 48 speakers set up along the South Korean side of the military demarcation line . The messages can travel about 12 miles at night and about half that distance during the day , well into North Korean territory .

Another message noted that Kim Jong-un , who took over from his father , Kim Jong Il , at the end of 2011 , has n't traveled abroad as leader or met a single foreign head of state .
“ President Park Geun-hye has . . . visited many countries since she became the president , including three visits to China , ” one of the recorded messages says , referring to the South Korean president and her close relationship with Beijing , North Korea 's supposed patron . “ However , Kim Jong-un has n't visited any other countries in the three-plus years since he became leader . ”
The speakers also play peppy southern K-pop songs such as “ Tell Me Your Wish ” by Girls ' Generation . ( “ Tell me your wish , tell me your little dream , imagine your ideal type in your head , and look at me , I 'm your genie , your dream , your genie . ” )
In North Korea , state media holds up the ruling Kim family as demigods , raving about their miraculous feats and broadcasting such songs as “ Our Leader Loved by the People. ” The regime indoctrinates children into its personality cult beginning in kindergarten and strictly controls the flow of information into the country .

“ For the North Koreans , the broadcasts are dangerous , because this is about the survival of the regime , ” said Chun Yung-woo , a former South Korean nuclear negotiator who has sat across the table from North Korean negotiators on many occasions .
“ They are worried that this could destroy the soldiers ' loyalty to the ‘ supreme leader ' and shake their faith in the system that 's central to regime survival , ” Chun said .
But John Delury , an associate professor at Yonsei University in Seoul , said the idea that any North Korean soldiers would defect because of overt propaganda they had heard over the loudspeakers was “ laughable ” and that there were much more effective ways to be subversive .
But , he added , it is hard to overestimate how fundamental the dignity of the leadership is in North Korea 's political system .
It 's “ what makes the whole place tick , ” Delury said . “ From their perspective , the speakers are slandering their leader and it 's reprehensible , so everyone involved needs to be able to report back to Pyongyang : ‘ I just screamed at the South Koreans for 24 hours and told them to take the speakers down . ' ”

Both Koreas routinely blasted messages at each other until 2004 , when , during the “ sunshine policy ” period of improving ties , both agreed to take down their speakers .
However , after blaming the North for the 2010 torpedoing of the South Korean warship Cheonan , which killed 46 sailors , Seoul ordered that the speakers be reinstalled at 11 locations . North Korea threatened to turn Seoul into a “ sea of fire , ” and the speakers had not been turned on until this month .
Earlier , as the marathon talks continued Monday , Park , the South Korean president , said that her government would “ continue the loudspeaker broadcasts ” unless North Korea apologized and promised not to stage any more provocations .
Seasoned American and South Korean diplomats said they doubted that Pyongyang would issue an apology , noting that it had spent 60 years denying responsibility for its actions in the face of overwhelming evidence . Not only did the North deny responsibility for the land-mine and Cheonan attacks , but it also denied starting the war in 1950 .
But this “ modest agreement ” constituted an indirect admission of responsibility for the incident , which North Korea had denied prior to the talks , said Scott Snyder of the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ Both sides have also shown that they have the wherewithal to negotiate their way out of a crisis , ” he said . “ For this reason , the test of whether this agreement marks a real turning point in inter-Korean relations will lie in the ability of both sides to keep their agreements and to institutionalize future dialogue and cooperation . ”

Next time you tuck into a Red Lobster “ Endless Shrimp ” special or score some $ 7-per-pound salmon at a supermarket , consider this : You 're very likely eating imported seafood raised on a factory-style farm in Asia—and it almost certainly was never inspected by the Food and Drug Administration on its way into the country and onto your plate .
Is that…safe ? Big retailers like Walmart and restaurant chains like Darden ( owner of Red Lobster ) say yes , in part because some of the seafood they buy bears the Best Aquaculture Practices label . Who issues that label ? The Global Aquaculture Alliance , an industry endeavor—its board consists of representatives from ( you guessed it ) Darden , as well as Cargill , the Chilean salmon industry , and a large farmed-shrimp importer called Eastern Fish Company . Not surprisingly , BAP standards for farmed fish placed near the bottom ( 16 of 20 ) in a 2012 ranking of aquaculture labels by the University of Victoria 's Seafood Ecology Research Group . ( Darden says it independently tests its shrimp for contaminants but declined to share its results ; Walmart did not answer our questions about inspections . )
But the responsibility for ensuring the safety of our food does n't fall to retailers and restaurants alone . The oversight authority belongs to the FDA , and the task is massive . In 2011 , Americans consumed 4.7 billion pounds of seafood , 91 percent of which was imported . And yet the FDA only inspects a tiny amount of this giant haul : 2 percent at most . ( The equivalent agency in Canada inspects 15 percent of imported seafood ; in the European Union the figure is 50 percent . )
That 's worrisome because imported seafood has a spotty track record . According to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 44 percent of the 39 foodborne-illness outbreaks caused by imports from 2005 to 2010 involved seafood—more than any other type of food .
And then there 's the drug problem . Like US meat farms , Asia 's shrimp operations rely heavily on antibiotics to control diseases among creatures packed tightly together , and also to make them grow faster . That creates the risk of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in the final product . In a 2012 study , FDA scientists tested 330 samples of shrimp farmed in Thailand—the No . 1 US shrimp supplier—and bought in Little Rock , Arkansas , supermarkets . Sixty-seven turned up positive for strains of the bacteria klebsiella that are resistant to a range of antibiotics—32 of them showed resistance to no fewer than eight different antibiotics . The researchers concluded that “ imported shrimp is a reservoir for multidrug-resistant Klebsiella , ” which can trigger urinary-tract infections and pneumonia .
And it 's not just nasty bugs that can end up in our seafood . Testifying before Congress in 2008 , Don Kraemer , then-deputy director of the FDA 's Office of Food Safety , warned of “ clear scientific evidence ” that drug residues make it into the fish we eat . In 2011 , the FDA tested just 0.1 percent of imported seafood products for drug traces . In 2008 , the agency tested only 34 shrimp samples for residues of nitrofurans—a class of antibiotics banned because they 're carcinogenic . Six samples tested positive .
The FDA does inspect processing facilities in exporting countries , the most prolific of which are China , Thailand , Canada , Vietnam , Indonesia , and Ecuador . But here , too , the program is lax . According to a scathing 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office , the agency had inspected just 1.5 percent of seafood processing facilities in the previous six years in China , the source of nearly a quarter of US seafood imports . Meanwhile , in Vietnam , a Bloomberg Businessweek investigation discovered that some US-bound shrimp are stored in heaps of ice made from water teeming with bacteria . And tilapia in a growing number of China 's fish farms literally feed on pig manure—even though it contains salmonella and makes the fish vulnerable to disease .
In an October letter to the FDA , the Southern Shrimp Alliance , a trade group for the US wild-caught shrimp industry , identified three Vietnamese shrimp processors that were ordered to put their products through mandatory testing in Canada after authorities there found traces of fluoroquinolones , a banned antibiotic . Yet all three can still export freely to the United States . Another major Vietnamese shrimp supplier to the US , Soc Trang Seafood Joint Stock Company ( which , incidentally , is BAP-certified ) , had three different shipments turned back by Japan in 2012 due to the presence of banned chemicals—but the United States routinely welcomed its products .
Since I do n't have much faith in either the industry 's self-certifying effort or the FDA 's porous testing program , I 've taken to eating shrimp only as an occasional treat . When I do indulge , I pay up for the wild-caught kind . But it should n't be left to each of us to protect ourselves . Just as the government inspects Red Lobster 's kitchens , so too should the FDA scrutinize the suppliers that keep them stocked with endless shrimp .
Global Rat-Perch : Jewish Misdirection in the Work of Michel Chossudovsky
Michel Chossudovsky , Emeritus Economics Professor with Ottawa University , is also the founder and director of the Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal and serves as editor of the anti-war website Global Research . Much of the information Chossudovsky makes available through his efforts is highly valuable , and Global Research is a useful resource in countering mainstream messaging on U.S. foreign policy issues . His is one of the names that come to mind when one tries to think of “ good Jews ” . There are , however , disingenuous aspects to Chossudovsky 's work , and his book Towards a World War III Scenario : The Dangers of Nuclear War presents a pertinent case study .
The treatise is largely concerned with the provocative shift in U.S. foreign policy toward a preemptive rationale in its dealings with “ rogue ” governments like those of Iran and North Korea and the erosion of any distinction in war planning between “ tactical ” nuclear weapons and the “ conventional ” war toolbox . Towards a World War III Scenario also concerns itself in a few problematic passages with the role of Israel in the “ War on Terror ” . Chossudovsky acknowledges the existence of Israel 's nuclear arsenal and its collusion with the U.S. ; but , for him , “ Tel Aviv is not a prime mover ” for intervention against Iran and “ does not have a separate and distinct military agenda ” from that of the Pentagon . Israel , for Chossudovsky , is only “ part of a military alliance ” – practically a pawn – that might “ be used by Washington to justify , in the eyes of world opinion , a military intervention of the U.S. and NATO with a view to ‘ defending Israel ' , rather than attacking Iran. ” 1
Chossudovsky 's defense is that Israel is a not a truly sovereign military power . “ The U.S. military oversees Israel 's Air Defense system , which is integrated into the Pentagon 's global system , ” he explains . “ In other words , Israel can not launch a war against Iran without Washington 's consent . Hence the importance , ” Chossudovsky avers , “ of the so-called ‘ Green Light ' legislation in the U.S. Congress sponsored by the Republican party under House Resolution 1553 , which explicitly supports an Israeli attack on Iran ” . “ In practice , ” he continues , “ the proposed legislation was a ‘ green light ' to the White House and the Pentagon rather than to Israel ” and “ constitutes a rubber stamp to a U.S.-sponsored war on Iran which uses Israel as a convenient military launch pad , ” a mere “ pretext to wage war ” 2 .
The real culprits , Chossudovsky alleges , are the “ Anglo-American oil giants ” . “ The U.S.-led war in the broader Middle East Central Asian region consists in gaining control over more than sixty percent of the world 's reserves of oil and natural gas. ” 3 The best the professor can produce in the way of evidence for his claim is a Clinton-era National Security Statement citing the strategic interest of the U.S. in ensuring the security of Middle East oil reserves . As Aryan Skynet has already discussed in greater detail , however , analysts Dr. James Petras and Muhammad Idrees Ahmad have already lain this lamestream liberal canard to rest . “ Through its all-out campaign in the U.S. Congress and Administration , ” Petras observes in his book The Power of Israel in the United States , “ the U.S.-Jewish-Israeli lobby has created a warlike climate which now goes counter to the interests of all the world 's major oil companies including BP , the UK-based gas company , SASOL ( South Africa ) , Royal Dutch Shell , Total of France , and others. ” 4 Chossudovsky is not unaware of the work of Dr. Petras ; he is simply engaging in racial and ideological obfuscation .
Professor Chossudovsky betrays his instinctive anti-Christian bias in referring to an “ American Inquisition ” that is engaged in conducting a “ holy crusade ” in the Middle East . Note that it is not an “ American Sanhedrin ” or an “ American Synagogue of Satan ” . Rather , it is “ an ideological construct which is , in many regards , similar to the inquisitorial social order prevailing in France and Spain during the Middle Ages. ” 5 Chossudovsky 's writing presents a thematic parallel with the vocabulary of Neoreaction , with its excoriation of a hegemonic “ Cathedral ” – all of which only seems to suggest that , ideological trappings aside , a Jew 's political thought remains Judaic in all of its permutations .
As for the putatively authoritative role of the U.S. Congress that Chossudovsky cites as evidence of Israel 's lack of agency in America 's foreign policy agenda , that is only a sickening joke in consideration of the fact that those in the know have for decades acknowledged that Israel 's U.S. lobby , AIPAC , grips the House and Senate . “ I believe that Israel has a powerful stranglehold on the American government , ” late Representative Jim Traficant told Greta Van Susteren in an interview conducted after Traficant 's release from imprisonment on charges Michael Collins Piper scrutinizes in his exposé Target : Traficant6 . “ They control both [ … ] the House and the Senate , ” Traficant continued . “ They have us involved in wars in which we have little or no interest . [ … ] They 're controlling much of our foreign policy. ” 7 “ It is no overstatement to say that AIPAC has effectively gained control of virtually all of Capitol Hill 's action on Middle East policy , ” Paul Findley concurs in his book They Dare to Speak Out : People and Institutions Confront Israel 's Lobby . “ Almost without exception , House and Senate members do its bidding , because most of them consider AIPAC to be the direct Capitol Hill representative of a political force that can make or break their chances at election time. ” 8 John J. Mearshimer and Stephen M. Walt give a sense of the breadth of the “ stranglehold ” Traficant describes in their study The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy :
Not only does it exert significant influence over the policy process in Democratic and Republican administrations alike , but it is even more powerful on Capitol Hill . The journalist Michael Massing reports that a congressional staffer sympathetic to Israel told him , “ We can count on well over half the House – 250 to 300 members – to do reflexively whatever AIPAC wants. ” Similarly , Steven Rosen , the former AIPAC official who has been indicted for allegedly passing classified government documents to Israel , illustrated AIPAC 's power for the New Yorker 's Jeffrey Goldberg by putting a napkin in front of him and saying , “ In twenty-four hours , we could have the signatures of seventy senators on this napkin. ” These are not idle boasts.9
Is a scholar as erudite as Michel Chossudovsky pretending not to have read these well-known books ?

× Expand Levar Stoney talks with Gloria Taylor ( center ) and Charlotte Coleman about some of Taylor 's concerns about Richmond alleys . ( Photo by Jay Paul )
Back in May , the response was the same every time Kevin Zeithaml climbed porch steps , knocked on a front door and readied his pitch for Levar Stoney 's fledgling mayoral campaign . Few who answered were tuned into the local election at that point . Fewer still knew of the candidate who would ultimately win the race .
“ They 'd say ‘ Levar who ? ' ” Zeithaml says .
The reaction came as no surprise to Stoney or his newly minted staff , built around a core of young , but experienced , out-of-town campaign hands that included Zeithaml , 23 , spokesman Matt Corridoni , 27 , and campaign manager Hannah Burke , 26 . The trio were a few months removed from the end of their previous gigs when they signed on . All had worked for Maryland Democrat Martin O'Malley 's short-lived presidential bid .
In six and a half months , Stoney 's campaign transformed him from a virtual unknown into Richmond 's mayor-elect , delivering an improbable outright win that few , if any , outside of his team predicted . How did they do it ?
“ Our biggest challenge was that nobody knew who he was , ” Burke says . “ We had to do two things : The first thing was just introduced him in a favorable way . The second piece of it was making the sell that this person that they like should be their mayor . ”
Fewer than one in 10 voters recognized Stoney 's name when he announced his candidacy in the spring , Burke says . Put simply , winning or losing would hinge on whether the campaign could sell Stoney to a city that has always harbored suspicion of come-heres and , historically , has prized longevity above all else .
Knowing his opponents would seize on his inexperience , Stoney 's campaign cast the candidate as a fresh face with no mud on his hands ( “ More of the same , or something new ? ” ) . His personal story formed the foundation of the candidate 's message . He was the product of teenage parents . His grandmother raised him . He stood in the free and reduced lunch line at school . He was the first in his family to graduate from high school and college . Stoney recited the stump speech across the city 's nine districts . The refrain reinforced that he rose from circumstances that many in the city have experienced and segued neatly to his top priority : improving public education for the city 's children , the No . 1 issue among voters , polls showed .
The message would stick only if the field team , headed by Zeithaml , put in the legwork . They canvassed early and often . The ground game , paired with Stoney 's “ earned media ” — campaign-speak for being in the news – produced a quick shift , Zeithaml says . After securing a spot on the ballot in June , the most common response went from “ Levar who ? ” to “ Oh , yeah , he seems interesting . Tell me more , ” Zeithaml says .
Summer vacations and blistering heat stymied any semblance of progress in the dog days of July and August , but Stoney 's camp says it was ready for the slog . “ It 's delayed gratification , ” Zeithaml says . “ Basically , you spend 60 days banging your head against a wall , and it 's not until October that you actually see the cracks . ”
Late August brought the first public poll of the campaign . It showed Stoney running fifth in the field of eight candidates , behind Joe Morrissey , Jack Berry , Michelle Mosby and Jon Baliles . The numbers mirrored Stoney 's internal polling at the time , and did not come as a surprise , Burke says . Publicly , though , the poll hurt perception of Stoney 's chances . It was a difficult end to a trying month , but they were about to round a corner .
The post-Labor Day television ad blitz was planned from the outset of the campaign . What was a record-breaking fundraising haul to that point ensured Stoney 's camp would be able to execute it . They rolled out three commercials in the final nine weeks . Some mocked their largely biographical approach , a deliberate choice that Corridoni says was intended to cast Stoney as the candidate with whom viewers could empathize . “ When you do political communications , one of the first things they say is voting is emotional . It 's not rational , ” he says .
Stoney 's field team swelled in the fall as people tuned in . Scores of volunteers and interns contacted some 75,000 people before all was said and done , either by door-knocking or phone-banking . McAuliffe and his wife , Dorothy , each led door-to-door canvasses for Stoney . Other ranking state Democrats threw their weight behind him , too , as did several local interest groups . Crucially , he earned the endorsement from the Richmond City Democratic Committee , ensuring his name would appear on the official sample ballot that poll workers would hand out on Election Day .
A mid-October poll showed 2 out of 5 voters were undecided . Stoney had made gains citywide , but still trailed Morrissey and Berry . The former Venture Richmond executive courted voters , in part , by casting himself as the candidate most capable of defeating Morrissey . His was the only campaign to exceed Stoney 's spending and rival his organization . In spite of this , Burke says it was Morrissey whom they always viewed as their most formidable adversary .
“ [ Morrissey ] is good at campaigns . He 's good at politics … and you do n't always know what to expect , ” she says . “ You knew what to expect from everyone else in the race , pretty much . ”
In the final stretch , canvassers flooded the 3rd and 5th districts , where jockeying among the three leading candidates was intense . Burke says they were all in on winning the so-called battlegrounds , but had reason to be confident of their chances in other wards as well . Months before Election Day , Zeithaml says he predicted the East End 7th District would break Stoney 's way based on what he heard on the ground . The 6th District was trickier to call , but not out of their reach , he adds . Each of the three publicly released polls showed Morrissey winning both the 6th and the 7th , but if enough undecided voters came aboard , it could swing each back in Stoney 's favor .
Then there 's the 2nd District , comprising the Fan , Carver and Jackson Ward , as well as a chunk of Virginia Commonwealth University 's student body . Again , the polls showed the district as firmly Berry territory , but Burke and Zeithaml bet on a win . The majority of VCU students were eager to vote in the presidential race , but unfamiliar with the down-ticket candidates , making it a matter of retail politics : Who could shake the most hands and make the best impression ? Stoney reigned .
“ Gaggles of students would , like , squeal when they 'd see him , ” Burke said . “ They 'd say ‘ Oh my god , that 's the guy I met ! ' They 'd get a selfie . They were Snapchatting all over the place . That was when I was like , ‘ We might do this tonight . ' ”

By midnight , Stoney had claimed five districts . A tally of absentee ballots the next day confirmed his victory .
How had the polls been so wrong ? Burke attributes it to variables that could n't be accounted for – Stoney 's get-out-the-vote effort , his name appearing on the sample ballot , and yes , the Baliles bump in the final weekend . Although tough to quantify , she hypothesizes that the West End councilman 's decision to drop out and endorse Stoney swayed undecided voters in his favor .
In the aftermath , the candidate admitted the outright win surprised even him . His staffers privately held out hope he would win outright , but were mentally prepared for six more weeks of campaigning . “ I had several speeches written , because it 's my job … I was prepared for a runoff , but I never thought [ winning outright ] was n't possible , ” Corridoni says .
The win was an affirmation of the team and strategy Stoney put in place in the spring , Burke says .
“ We took a lot of heat for the way we did things , ” Burke says . “ A lot of people wanted to be campaign manager in the weeks leading up to the election . That 's difficult sometimes , especially when polling is not going in in your favor . Ultimately , we stuck with what we knew would work . ”
With the Carolina Panthers running their undefeated record to 12-0 , it means that they are joining some very impressive company .
As Gil Brandt of NFL.com reports , only eight teams before this season have done this in the Super Bowl era . To make things even more interesting , six of those eight made it to the Super Bowl .
So 50 percent of those teams have actually won the Super Bowl . If you were to tell Panthers fans they had a 50 percent chance to win it all at this very moment , most would probably be pretty ecstatic about it .

Entering 2015 , 8 teams in the Super Bowl era started 12-0 . All 8 teams made playoffs , 6 advanced to Super Bowl and 4 won the Super Bowl . — Gil Brandt ( @ Gil_Brandt ) December 7 , 2015
Let 's not go there just yet though , as there 's plenty of football left to play , but the Panthers do look like the class of the NFL at this point .
The logo of messaging app Snapchat is seen at a booth at TechFair LA in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters Instagram Stories may be on the upswing , but advertisers are not entirely discounting Snapchat , at least not yet .
Since its launch in August 2016 , Instagram Stories has had Snapchat in the crosshairs , and has even surpassed it in some respects . The feature , which allows users to post ephemeral stories for a 24-hour period just like Snapchat , has not only accumulated more users using it daily ( 250 million as of June versus Snapchat 's last reported 166 million ) , but also attracted a growing chunk of ad dollars .
But while Instagram 's pure reach and targeting capabilities have made it an attractive bet for brands , a lot of them are still sticking with Snapchat .
`` Advertisers are excited about the expanded ad space size , but we have n't seen too many shifts in spending from Snapchat to Instagram outside of its core capabilities , '' said Danielle Johnsen Karr , director of social and editorial strategy at Deutsch New York . `` As an ad unit , Instagram Stories is still relatively expensive , and acts as a separate unit outside standard buys within Facebook and Instagram . ''
Karr did not provide names of specific advertisers who had not yet made the leap to Instagram Stories , but the agency 's clients include Volkswagen and Taco Bell .
For other brands , including Honda and Universal Pictures , it all boils down to the target audience . The rationale is simple : if your audience is engaged on the platform , it makes sense to target them there . Add to that the fact that each daily user spends an average of 30 minutes on Snapchat , with over 60 % of daily users creating content on the platform everyday , and it becomes hard to ignore for marketers .
`` While Instagram is a behemoth , we and our clients still understand the value of Snapchat , and will continue to evaluate it as it innovates and adds targeting and measurement capabilities , '' said Hartman Wong , supervisor of digital strategy at RPA , Honda 's ad agency . `` We 're going to pursue our audiences wherever it makes sense , and that factors in everything from cost efficiency to ability to impact brand lift to user engagement . ''
Honda has run ads in the Discover section within Snapchat for some recent campaigns . Meanwhile , Universal Pictures has been all over Snapchat for the latest film in its Despicable Me franchise , which comes out this week . The studio has bought several Snap ads in the run-up to the film 's release , including swipe-up ones with quizzes tied to Father 's Day , as well as World Lenses , which let you add augmented reality elements to anything you take a picture or video of .
`` Snapchat remains a very substantial platform for us to reach our audience , '' said Doug Neil , EVP of digital marketing at Universal Pictures . `` If you have the right call-to-action , the Snapchat audience is one that really engages with content , with our engagement metrics often being two times the usual benchmarks . ''
It helps that Snapchat is also revving up as far as innovation goes , said Tom Buontempo , president at Attention . For him , while it may take some time , Snapchat 's focus on its new media partnerships and platform innovation has helped it tackle Instagram 's offensive .
`` They 're helping traditional media figure out how to be relevant to cord cutters , they 're transforming the traditional advertising model and they 're trying hard to scale self-serve quickly to show advertising revenue growth , '' he said . `` They 've also done a great job of delivering pioneering ad products such as lenses and geofilters , that have been custom built on the back of their audience 's nuanced behaviors . ''
In other words , as long as Snapchat continues to scale its new ad alternatives with self-serve options , templates and quicker review windows , advertisers are here to stay .
`` There 's still the opportunity to innovate with web builds and with comprehensive plans touching upon filters and lenses , '' said Deutsch 's Karr . `` The new ability for brands to be integrated into sponsored media content on the platform could be a huge game changer . ''
More than 370,000 people have signed a Change.org petition calling on Citibank and Barclays to condemn Uganda 's so-called `` Kill the Gays '' bill .
In the introduction to the petition , creator Collin Burton of Washington , D.C. , explains :
Ugandan legislators have re-introduced the dangerous Anti-Homosexuality Bill , a proposed law that would criminalize homosexuality in the country with extreme penalties . Under this proposed law , LGBT people could be killed or sentenced to life in prison , solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity . As the bill 's author , David Bahati , has said he believes the government of Uganda should “ kill every last gay person. ” ( 1 ) And recently , the Speaker of the Ugandan Parliament vowed to pass this dangerous legislation before the end of the year , calling it `` a Christmas gift . '' ( 2 ) The vote is expected to happen any day .
As Joe Mirabella , Director of Campaigns at All Out , pointed out in a recent blog post , the Ugandan parliament officially added the bill to its schedule last Wednesday and could be voted on this week .
`` It is expected to easily pass , and then it will be up to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to veto the bill , '' Mirabella wrote in a blog for The Huffington Post .
Museveni 's veto could still be overturned by the assembly , however .
In an email to subscribers of the petition site on Tuesday , Mark Anthony , a Change.org senior campaigner said that `` one way to stop this bill is to get pressure from banks that have significant resources invested in the country , such as Citibank and Barclays . ''
The two banking giants , explained Anthony , together `` have hundreds of millions of dollars invested in Uganda and wield significant influence in the country , just as banking lobbyists wield influence with Congress in the US . '' A vocal condemnation of the `` Kill the Gays '' bill by Citibank and Barclays might therefore `` be the best -- and only -- chance to stop it . ''
This , says Burton , a gay Citibank customer and LGBT advocate , is why he chose to spearhead this call to action .
`` I expect Citibank and Barclays to live up to the values of equality and fairness , not just list them on their websites , '' he said earlier this year , according to a press release .
Citibank and Barclays are well known for their LGBT-positive policies . Both banks received a 100 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign 's Corporate Equality Index this year , earning them the accolade of the `` best places to work for LGBT employees '' in the United States . Earlier this year , Barclays -- regularly ranked as one of the best companies for LGBT employees -- was also named the most LGBT-friendly company in Scotland .
The petition , which is addressed to the two banks , reads :
With the “ Kill the Gays ” moving quickly in Uganda 's parliament , you have unique and necessary voice that could help stop this bill in its tracks . Your presence in Uganda is significant , and your voice in opposition to the Anti-Homosexuality Bill could have a profound impact in keeping LGBT people safe in Uganda .
In 2010 , the UN Special Rapporteur on health , Anand Grover , warned that the bill is “ not only a violation of the fundamental human rights of Ugandans , but will also undermine efforts to achieve universal access to HIV prevention , treatment , care and support . ”
Like in many other sub-Saharan African countries , same-sex relations are already criminalized in Uganda . However , the bill , first introduced in 2009 , would make the penalties far more severe .
Although the BBC and other news organizations reported last week that Uganda 's parliament has dropped the controversial death penalty provision of the bill , Think Progress notes that it would be `` irresponsible to suggest that the death penalty has been removed without a thorough investigation of the bill 's new language '' -- something that has not been made public .
Regardless , even without a death penalty , the law would still “ represent a barbaric regression for Uganda 's human rights record , ” wrote Jim Burroway on Box Turtle Bulletin after dissecting the bill .
A weight off your chest : Scientists invent the lightest-ever breast implants that will prevent your bust from sagging
B-Lite implants , to be introduced in Britain later this year , will weigh 30 per cent less than any others on the market
They are designed to avoid the kind of sagging that can occur after time with conventional cosmetic breasts
A revolutionary breast implant - the lightest ever created - is due to be introduced in Britain later this year
A revolutionary new breast implant – the lightest ever created – is due to be introduced in Britain later this year .
The new implants , called B-Lite , will weigh 30 per cent less than any others on the market – and are designed to avoid the kind of sagging that can occur after time with conventional cosmetic breasts .
Up to now , implants have been made of weighty silicon gel or a saline water solution .
The new type consists of a silicone shell filled with minute balls of silicate , a solid form of silicone gel , but much lighter .
Inventor Dael Govrin , an Israeli biochemical engineer , said : ‘ Breast implants have n't got any lighter in weight since they were first introduced in 1962 . There has been no change in what goes into an implant since day one .
‘ We know that after ten or 15 years , these implants will need replacing . When you put an implant in , it is a dead weight . That 's why they start to sag after a number of years and why women get through two or three sets if they want to maintain good-looking breasts .
‘ We think it is important to make an implant as light as possible . '
The average conventional implant weighs just over 1lb , while the average real breast is slightly lighter than that . The new implant weighs a third less than than the conventional type .
Nearly 40 Israeli women have already been fitted with the new breasts and say they hardly notice they are there .
Mr Govrin was challenged to create the new implants by his brother Jacky , an Israeli plastic surgeon .
Dael Govrin said : ‘ The feedback from our first patients is extremely positive . Some of the women are having implants for the first time and they say they are lighter than their own natural breasts .
‘ The breast still move naturally – from side to side – as they would if you saw a young woman on a beach walking along in a bikini .
‘ Any lighter and they would have taken off . And that would n't have been natural . '
Light touch : Surgeon Jacky Govrin created a breast 'like a young woman 's on a beach '
Mayaan Peled , 27 , from Tel Aviv , who has had the surgery , said : ‘ My boobs were sagging because I had lost an enormous amount of weight . The only things that sagged after shedding 40 kilos [ 88lb ] were my boobs .
‘ The result of the surgery is fantastic . I do n't feel as if my breasts are there . They are fuller than before but not as heavy and I 'm still wearing the same-size bra . '
The new implants have been given European ‘ CE Mark ' approval .
There has always been a tension between individual liberty and governmental power . National security issues are a natural fault line , given the difficulty of protecting the nation while simultaneously upholding the values of freedom and liberty . And politicians , bless their hearts , always try to find ways to consolidate their power while pretending to do so in the public interest — and not their own and that of their cronies who benefit in some way from their decisions .
They miscalculated this time regarding how many people in America are paying attention to civil liberties concerns these days . And it is our job to make certain that they learn just how badly they have misjudged this .
It is one of the many reasons we are working so hard to build incentive through our Blue America FISA actions . ( You can donate here . )
Kathy G wrote a thoughtful essay about the intersection of human frailty , politicians , and the public interest , discussing Obama 's candidacy and a number of other issues . It 's worth a read and some thought on a number of levels , but this is what I want to highlight :
…If we want real change in this country , the place to look for it is not in our so-called leaders , but in ourselves… . Obama , like just about every other politician out there , is cautious , but also highly pragmatic . Like everyone else , he responds to incentives . As activists , what we need to do is to move the political center of gravity in this country to the left . To change the incentive structure so that it will be easier for him to do the right thing . This is a far sounder strategy , over both the short and the long term , than waiting for saints or messiahs to come along . I 'll close with one of my favorite political stories . It concerns my all-time favorite president , FDR . He was meeting with a group of reformers trying to persuade him to support one of their goals . After they finished speaking , FDR said to them , `` You 've convinced me . I want to do it . Now make me do it . `` …
And what 's the incentive to push on FISA ? McJoan details the potential :
Strategically , if immunity is removed , the bill is once again veto bait . Another stalling tactic , maybe , but one that might work to finally kill this damned thing once and for all this session . Delaying it past the Independence Day recess is the goal for now . Pushing it into the short remaining work period for the session in August would land in the middle of a packed schedule of `` must pass '' bills . There 's the slimmest chance that time would once again work in our favor . Granted , that outcome is not likely . Our Congress , including our nominee , seems intent , as Hunter says , `` to quite so cravenly negate their own oversight duties . '' It 's our job to try to stop them , and to convince our leaders that it 's the right thing to do and they 'll have our support in doing so .
The objective is to strip immunity from the bill . We need to figure out a way to make that happen before leadership caves on this altogether . Sen. Feingold 's office has put up a handy fact sheet on the problems with the bill . One way to push on this is to flood the offices of Senators with calls and FAXes telling them to do just that . If they do n't hear from you , then they wo n't know you are pissed — so let 's get to work…

Several Senators could use extra contact on this — uncommitted or wavering Democrats , leadership folks , members of the Gang of 14 , and a number of wavering Republicans . Tell them no telecom immunity — period . It is well past time that respect for the rule of law and the role of Congress in the balance of powers was restored :

Civil engineering is , perhaps , the oldest engineering discipline , and is one that virtually all individuals have encountered at some point in their lives . Indeed , from laying down a log to cross a stream , to constructing a model airplane , civil engineering encompasses all actions that lie within the built environment . Of course , while everyday individuals may perform basic civil engineering tasks , professional civil engineers are responsible for much greater endeavors ; to be sure , a civil engineer may be part of a team tasked with designing and constructing a new bridge , or even developing a new water transportation system that supplies families throughout an entire municipality .
And because of the wide scope of possible tasks available to civil engineers , the job outlook throughout the next decade is fairly positive . In fact , according to statistics presented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , employment opportunities are expected to grow by eight percent through 2024 , resulting in 23,600 new jobs in total .
Ultimately , a career as a civil engineer can be truly rewarding ; however , before an individual has the option to pursue work as a civil engineer , he or she must complete , at minimum , a four-year degree from a quality institution and obtain a degree . And while the quality of the university from which the individual obtains a degree is likely essential to his or her success , so too is the ability of the educators there to impart essential knowledge to that individual .
So if you are interested in working as a civil engineer in the future , consider studying with one or more of these 20 educators , who are known to be some of the best in their field .
Counterparty , the technology for decentralized financial tools on the Bitcoin blockchain , and Storj , the first decentralized , end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that utilizes blockchain technology , have teamed up and combined resources to develop payment channel technology for use on the Counterparty network .
Cointelegraph spoke to Trevor Altpeter and Matt Young , directors of the Counterparty Foundation , about the partnership with Storj , micropayments , and the Lightning Network .
Storj 's micropayment streaming of SJCX
Starting in the third quarter of this year , Storj 's micropayment streaming of SJCX ( Storjcoin X ) , will be beta tested for those storing data on the Storj network .
“ Payment channels allow for instant , ‘ streaming ' payments of SJCX , which is a Counterparty token , in exchange for storage space on our network , ” Shawn Wilkinson , CEO of Storj , recently said in a press release .
Codenamed picopayments , Storj 's original proof-of-concept project was led by Storj developer Fabian Barkhau . Around a month ago , Barkhau and Counterparty lead developer , Ruben de Vries , started collaborating to make the code ready for addition to counterparty-lib , the Counterparty reference client .
“ We 're excited about this development and appreciate the initiative Storj took here , ” said Ruben de Vries , in a press release .
He notes :
“ This is a huge step forward that will truly allow for rapid , almost frictionless Counterparty token payments , as well as eventual use of Counterparty tokens on the Lightning Network . ”
Distributed object storage
Speaking to Cointelegraph , Matt Young , director of the Counterparty Foundation , said that it was a privilege to have one of the highest profile projects on Counterparty contribute to extending the functionality of the protocol , working together to develop the payments channel feature .
Young explains :
“ It 's a win win and truly everyone benefits : Storj , Storj users , the Counterparty protocol and its users . We ca n't say enough about Shawn and Fabian and we 're looking forward to collaborating with other projects . ”
This partnership between Counterparty and Storj will be highly visible given Storj 's partnership with Microsoft 's Blockchain-as-a-Service ( BaaS ) earlier this year .
In a recent Storj blog post companies such as Coca-Cola , Cox Enterprises , The Weather Channel , and Capgemini , are noticing the impact of distributed object storage and are exploring the benefits that Storj can produce in their businesses .
In the blog post , Ethereum founder , Vitalik Buterin said :
“ Distributed file storage systems like Storj have the potential to eliminate high mark-up costs and market inefficiencies , and provide a much higher level of privacy , reliability , and quality of service than we see today . ”
Speaking to Cointelegraph , Trevor Altpeter , director of the Counterparty Foundation summed it up by saying that “ it was a great match for both parties and the Counterparty community at large . ”
Unidirectional and bidirectional micropayments and the Lightning Network
Previously , each Counterparty transaction was undertaken through the Bitcoin blockchain . However , while this was a secure process each transaction was impacted by Bitcoin 's ten-minute block times and high transaction fees .
According to Counterparty , payment channels allow two users of Bitcoin to pay between them in a process time that is much quicker than Bitcoin 's 10-minute block times .
Young explained to Cointelegraph that discussions are circulating regarding what will happen to Bitcoin 's utility for small transactions as the block reward continues to decrease and the price per transaction increases .
Young notes :
“ Payment channels and the Lightning Network are helping to solve that problem by allowing a number of transactions to be bundled together and paying a much smaller fee per transaction . We 're very excited that Storj was able to implement this functionality on Counterparty and we look forward to working with them on other efforts in the future . ”
In its current state , the technology facilitates unidirectional payment channels , where Storj and other Counterparty users can stream payments in SJCX or other assets to users .
With a unidirectional micropayment channel , an individual can utilize this channel to pay for goods or a service as long as that channel remains open between both parties thus removing the worry of double spends , fraud , and excessive transaction fees .
However , this form of payment channel is limited due to the fact that while Peter can pay Bob several off-chain transactions , Bob ca n't pay Peter through the same channel .
This is where the upcoming Lightning Network comes in with the proposed bidirectional payment channel by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja .
Even though it 's still under development , the Lightning Network aims to provide a secure network that delivers off-chain payments between two parties .
The most anticipated technological invention
Since the introduction of the payment layer by Poon and Dryja , the Lightning Network has quickly become the most anticipated technological invention to be put into place on top of Bitcoin .
Its aim is to preserve Bitcoin 's decentralized qualities while delivering a secure transaction network minus Bitcoin 's cost , speed , double spend issues , and scalability limitations .
The use of micropayments is also a crucial first step in Counterparty 's long-time stated goal of enabling bidirectional micropayments allowing two parties to swap Counterparty assets in return for Bitcoin or other Counterparty assets .
Just like the unidirectional micropayments , the bidirectional payment channel wo n't be subject to Bitcoin 's ten-minute block time .
Some potential uses for micropayments include buying in-game items with Counterparty-based games such as Spells of Genesis or SaruTobi , donations to charities , rewarding users for contributing content to a blog or even buying more storage with Storj .
Of course , while there are some shortcomings of the bidirectional payment channel such as having a limit on the number of transactions individuals can make with a microchannel , Altpeter says that “ it will be a huge advance that will enable rapid , cheap , off-chain transactions for numerous uses of Counterparty . ”
The official Dutch inquiry into the 1995 Srebrenica massacre , released last week , contains one of the most sensational reports on western intelligence ever published . Officials have been staggered by its findings and the Dutch government has resigned . One of its many volumes is devoted to clandestine activities during the Bosnian war of the early 1990s . For five years , Professor Cees Wiebes of Amsterdam University has had unrestricted access to Dutch intelligence files and has stalked the corridors of secret service headquarters in western capitals , as well as in Bosnia , asking questions .
His findings are set out in `` Intelligence and the war in Bosnia , 1992-1995 '' . It includes remarkable material on covert operations , signals interception , human agents and double-crossing by dozens of agencies in one of the dirtiest wars of the new world disorder . Now we have the full story of the secret alliance between the Pentagon and radical Islamist groups from the Middle East designed to assist the Bosnian Muslims - some of the same groups that the Pentagon is now fighting in `` the war against terrorism '' . Pentagon operations in Bosnia have delivered their own `` blowback '' .
In the 1980s Washington 's secret services had assisted Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran . Then , in 1990 , the US fought him in the Gulf . In both Afghanistan and the Gulf , the Pentagon had incurred debts to Islamist groups and their Middle Eastern sponsors . By 1993 these groups , many supported by Iran and Saudi Arabia , were anxious to help Bosnian Muslims fighting in the former Yugoslavia and called in their debts with the Americans . Bill Clinton and the Pentagon were keen to be seen as creditworthy and repaid in the form of an Iran-Contra style operation - in flagrant violation of the UN security council arms embargo against all combatants in the former Yugoslavia .
The result was a vast secret conduit of weapons smuggling though Croatia . This was arranged by the clandestine agencies of the US , Turkey and Iran , together with a range of radical Islamist groups , including Afghan mojahedin and the pro-Iranian Hizbullah . Wiebes reveals that the British intelligence services obtained documents early on in the Bosnian war proving that Iran was making direct deliveries .
Arms purchased by Iran and Turkey with the financial backing of Saudi Arabia made their way by night from the Middle East . Initially aircraft from Iran Air were used , but as the volume increased they were joined by a mysterious fleet of black C-130 Hercules aircraft . The report stresses that the US was `` very closely involved '' in the airlift . Mojahedin fighters were also flown in , but they were reserved as shock troops for especially hazardous operations .
Light weapons are the familiar currency of secret services seeking to influence such conflicts . The volume of weapons flown into Croatia was enormous , partly because of a steep Croatian `` transit tax '' . Croatian forces creamed off between 20 % and 50 % of the arms . The report stresses that this entire trade was clearly illicit . The Croats themselves also obtained massive quantities of illegal weapons from Germany , Belgium and Argentina - again in contravention of the UN arms embargo . The German secret services were fully aware of the trade .
Rather than the CIA , the Pentagon 's own secret service was the hidden force behind these operations . The UN protection force , UNPROFOR , was dependent on its troop-contributing nations for intelligence , and above all on the sophisticated monitoring capabilities of the US to police the arms embargo . This gave the Pentagon the ability to manipulate the embargo at will : ensuring that American Awacs aircraft covered crucial areas and were able to turn a blind eye to the frequent nightime comings and goings at Tuzla .
Weapons flown in during the spring of 1995 were to turn up only a fortnight later in the besieged and demilitarised enclave at Srebrenica . When these shipments were noticed , Americans pressured UNPROFOR to rewrite reports , and when Norwegian officials protested about the flights , they were reportedly threatened into silence .
Both the CIA and British SIS had a more sophisticated perspective on the conflict than the Pentagon , insisting that no side had clean hands and arguing for caution . James Woolsey , director of the CIA until May 1995 , had increasingly found himself out of step with the Clinton White House over his reluctance to develop close relations with the Islamists . The sentiments were reciprocated . In the spring of 1995 , when the CIA sent its first head of station to Sarajevo to liaise with Bosnia 's security authorities , the Bosnians tipped off Iranian intelligence . The CIA learned that the Iranians had targeted him for liquidation and quickly withdrew him .
Iranian and Afghan veterans ' training camps had also been identified in Bosnia . Later , in the Dayton Accords of November 1995 , the stipulation appeared that all foreign forces be withdrawn . This was a deliberate attempt to cleanse Bosnia of Iranian-run training camps . The CIA 's main opponents in Bosnia were now the mojahedin fighters and their Iranian trainers - whom the Pentagon had been helping to supply months earlier .
Meanwhile , the secret services of Ukraine , Greece and Israel were busy arming the Bosnian Serbs . Mossad was especially active and concluded a deal with the Bosnian Serbs at Pale involving a substantial supply of artillery shells and mortar bombs . In return they secured safe passage for the Jewish population out of the besieged town of Sarajevo . Subsequently , the remaining population was perplexed to find that unexploded mortar bombs landing in Sarajevo sometimes had Hebrew markings .
The broader lessons of the intelligence report on Srebrenica are clear . Those who were able to deploy intelligence power , including the Americans and their enemies , the Bosnian Serbs , were both able to get their way . Conversely , the UN and the Dutch government were `` deprived of the means and capacity for obtaining intelligence '' for the Srebrenica deployment , helping to explain why they blundered in , and contributed to the terrible events there .
Secret intelligence techniques can be war-winning and life-saving . But they are not being properly applied . How the UN can have good intelligence in the context of multinational peace operations is a vexing question . Removing light weapons from a conflict can be crucial to drawing it down . But the secret services of some states - including Israel and Iran - continue to be a major source of covert supply , pouring petrol on the flames of already bitter conflicts .

US Marines take part in a joint amphibious landing exercise with their Philippine counterparts in San Antonio , Zambales province , on October 7 , 2016 ( AFP Photo/Ted Aljibe )
Manila ( AFP ) - The Philippines announced Friday it had officially informed the United States that joint patrols in the South China Sea patrols had been suspended , following orders from President Rodrigo Duterte .
`` They have been suspended for the time being . They ( Washington ) know it already , '' Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters , adding he had relayed the decision to the commander of the US Pacific Command when he was in Hawaii at the start of this month .
Still , Lorenzana indicated he was still not 100 percent sure of Duterte 's final plans .
`` They will not be conducted anymore until we clarify if he ( Duterte ) means what he says , '' Lorenzana said .
The longtime allies began planning joint patrols under the previous Philippine government , which had sought to attract a greater US military presence in the region to counter Chinese efforts to take control of the South China Sea .
China claims nearly all of the sea , even waters close to the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations , and has in recent years built artificial islands in the disputed areas that are capable of hosting military bases .
Lorenzana said the United States and Philippines had conducted two `` passing through '' manoeuvres over the section of the sea claimed by Manila this year , but not actual `` combat patrols '' .
Duterte , who began his six-year term on June 30 , quickly shredded Aquino 's strategy on China , seeking co-operation and dialogue with Beijing while diluting the Philippines ' alliance with the United States .
He also repeatedly railed against the Philippines ' former colonial ruler for criticising his war on crime , which has claimed more than 3,300 lives and raised concerns about extrajudicial killings .
`` I have lost my respect for America , '' Duterte said on Tuesday , as he threatened to break ties completely with the United States .
Duterte had previously branded US President Barack Obama a `` son of a whore '' .
- Concrete actions -
He had also said he wanted US Special Forces out of the southern region of Mindanao , where they have been helping to quell Islamic militants , and threatened to scrap a 2014 agreement granting American troops increased access to Philippine bases .
Duterte also said he would cancel all 28 military exercises the two sides hold annually .
However , until Friday , officials from both sides had said Duterte 's pronouncements were not necessarily policy .
US officials had repeatedly said they had not been officially informed of Duterte 's comments .
So the announcement that the joint patrols had been suspended was the first public confirmation that one of Duterte 's anti-US comments had become policy .
Lorenzana said none of the other Duterte pronouncements had been officially delivered to the Americans .
But he did say the Philippines was planning to eject the US forces in the southern Philippines in the `` near future '' , as he disclosed details of their normally secretive activities .
The US Special Forces began short-term deployments in 2002 to train Filipino troops in how to counter Islamic militants , with the American personnel peaking at about 600 before the operation was scaled down in 2014 .
`` There are actually very few of them ( now ) , just about 157 people , '' Lorenzana said , adding they were stationed inside a large military camp on the outskirts of Zamboanga city on the main southern island of Mindanao .
`` All they do is operate their drones and some intelligence equipment to help our troops in the south . ''
He said the drones flew over the militant strongholds of the Basilan and Sulu island groups , as well as central Mindanao where another small armed group had pledged alliance to the Islamic State group .
Lorenzana said those US forces would be asked to leave when the Philippines acquired its own drones .
`` The president said that he does n't want them to leave immediately but maybe in the near future , '' Lorenzana said .
Flash floods have left seven people dead in the southern Philippines after more than a month 's worth of rain fell in just one day .
Disaster relief agencies in the area said that thousands of people had to be evacuated from their homes on Monday .
Torrential downpours and a high tide left many areas underwater . More than 6,800 people were forced to leave their homes as the water rose waist-high in Mindanao .
The city of Dipolog recorded a staggering 205mm of rain in the 24 hours up to 06:00 GMT on Tuesday . Dipolog 's average January rainfall is 99mm .
Around 300km to the east , Cagayan De Oro has been left underwater . Disaster officials declared a state of calamity following the massive flooding in the city , and authorities carried out forced evacuations , especially for those living near the River Ipunan River .
The City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Department said thousands of students and workers were left stranded in the city on Monday afternoon .
The heavy rains and landslides blocked dozens of roads , and affected the power supply to the city . It was eventually cut off by the Cagayan de Oro Electric Power and Lights Company .
Further north in Eastern Samar , Borongan had 136mm of rain on Monday . This brings their three-day total rainfall up to 306mm . The January average is 290mm .
Further showers are forecast over the next few days , but they are not expected to be as heavy or persistent . It will take a while for the flood waters to recede and as a result warnings will stay in place for some time to come .
( Natural News ) Radiation levels inside a damaged nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan have hit a record high since the plant suffered a triple nuclear meltdown almost six years ago . The latest readings – described by experts as “ unimaginable ” – now pose a serious challenge as officials prepare to dismantle the disaster-hit facility safely .
Tokyo Electric Power ( Tepco ) , the plant 's operator , said atmospheric readings inside the containment reactor No 2 are as high as 530 sieverts an hour , which is far greater than the previous record of 73 sieverts an hour . Reactor No 2 is one of three reactors that experienced a nuclear meltdown when the plant was crippled by a huge earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 .

A one-square-meter hole created by melting nuclear fuel
Tepco said recent image analysis revealed a one-square-meter hole in the metal grating beneath the reactor 's pressure vessel . The hole was probably created by melting nuclear fuel that penetrated the vessel , Tepco 's spokesman Tatsuhiro Yamagishi told AFP . Also , for the first time since the disaster , images were released showing dark lumps beneath reactor No 2 . Experts believe the dark matter to be melted uranium fuel rods .
Even though specially-made robots designed to probe the underwater depths around the reactors have previously crumbled and shut down due to the highly toxic conditions , Tepco intends to send another remote-controlled robot to check the actual conditions inside the containment vessel .

The robot , however , will not last long . They are designed to withstand exposure to a total of 1,000 sieverts , meaning it will only survive for less than two hours in the presence of these dangerously high radiation levels . Nonetheless , Tepco 's spokesman Tatsuhiro Yamagishi said that the captured images will offer very useful information regarding the actual conditions inside the reactor .
A huge challenge in the history of nuclear power
These extraordinary high readings will make it very hard , and dangerous , for thousands of workers involved in dismantling the power plant , a process expected to take about four decades . Furthermore , medical professionals have never considered dealing with this level of radiation in their work , an official of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences told Japan Today .
To give you an idea of the severity , radiation doses of only 0.1 sieverts already significantly increase the risk of cancer . A single dose of one sievert is enough to cause radiation sickness , nausea , infertility , loss of hair , and cataracts . Exposure to five sieverts could kill half of those exposed within a month while a single dose of 10 sieverts could prove fatal within weeks .
After six years , Tepco and its business partners at the Fukushima Daiichi plant have yet to identify the location and condition of melted fuel in the three most severely damaged nuclear reactors . As reported by The Guardian , “ the government has now estimated the cost of decommissioning the plant and decontaminating the surrounding area , as well as paying compensations and storing radioactive waste , to rise to 21.5tn yen [ or about $ 190 billion ] , ” which is nearly double the estimate released in 2013 .
Even if they manage to clean up this nuclear mess shortly , Yosuke Yamashiki , Doctor of Engineering from Kyoto University , told RT that the complete reduction of the radiation will take hundreds of thousands of years .

President Barack Obama on Wednesday declared unequivocally that the United States has “ concluded ” that the Syrian government carried out a large-scale chemical weapon attack that killed hundreds of civilians . Yet U.S. intelligence officials say questions remain about whether the attack could be linked to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or high officials in his government .
Obama says the U.S. has examined evidence and does n't believe the opposition fighting the Syrian government possessed chemical weapons or the means to deliver them .
We can take limited , tailored approaches , not getting drawn into a long conflict
While Obama said he is still evaluating possible military retaliation , he said the U.S. wo n't become ensnared in the Syrian civil war , now in its third year .
“ We can take limited , tailored approaches , not getting drawn into a long conflict , not a repetition of , you know , Iraq , which I know a lot of people are worried about , ” he said .
Still , the possibility Assad or his allies in Iran and Hezbollah will respond in unpredictable ways , or that an attack may go awry , also poses a challenge to Obama and U.S. allies .
The president 's declaration comes as Canada 's Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird vowed Wednesday the Syrian regime will face “ appropriate consequences ” for its use of chemical weapons . But he said it was too soon to tell whether Canada would contribute to any military response .
Justin Trudeau says Parliament should be recalled to discuss what role Canada should play as the international community prepares to respond to atrocities in Syria .
The Liberal leader says the use of chemical weapons is “ unacceptable ” and requires a “ significant response . ”
Trudeau , who was briefed Tuesday by Baird on his conversations with allies in the United States , the United Kingdom and elsewhere , says he fully expects Canada will have a role to play in helping civilians .
He says Canadians — and MPs — are united in wanting to provide humanitarian aid and help settle refugees .
But Trudeau , who has previously expressed reservations about military intervention , says anything more than that should be discussed , in a non-partisan fashion , by parliamentarians .
After meeting Syrian opposition leader George Sabra in Montreal , Baird blamed the Assad regime for what he called an “ abhorrent and repugnant ” attack . “ The Syrian regime has charted a dangerous path and appropriate consequences will follow . ”
Baird said Ottawa was working “ in lock-step ” with the United States , United Kingdom and France to review a range of options , although he seemed to downplay the likelihood of a role for the Canadian forces .
“ Obviously I think we are of one mind that these weapons have been used and a firm international response is needed , ” he said . “ We have n't made the decision to be part — or do n't know whether we have the capacity to be part — of any military engagement , which by all accounts will be limited in focus . ”
Obama did not present any direct evidence to back up his assertion that the Syrian government bears responsibility for the attack . U.S. officials were searching for additional intelligence to bolster the case for a strike against Assad 's military infrastructure and rule out the possibility that a rogue element of the Syrian military could have used the weapons on its own authority .
Obama vowed that any American response would send a “ strong signal ” to Assad , and any move by the U.S. would be a limited “ shot across the bow , ” he said .
“ We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out , ” Obama said during an interview with “ NewsHour ” on PBS . “ And if that 's so , then there need to be international consequences . ”
“ We want the Assad regime to understand that by using chemical weapons on a large scale against your own people — against women , against infants , against children , that you are not only breaking international norms and standards of decency , but you 're also creating a situation where U.S. national interests are affected , and that needs to stop , ” Obama said .
The U.S. is concerned that letting the Syrian government go unpunished would send a signal to other countries , including North Korea , that have large inventories of chemical weapons , as well as making it likely that the Assad government will attack civilians with such weapons again , according to a U.S. official who asked not to be identified discussing war-planning .
New hurdles emerged that appeared to slow the formation of an international coalition that could use military force to punish Syria . Earlier Wednesday , the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council failed to reach an agreement on a draft resolution from the British seeking authorization for the use of force . Russia , as expected , objected to international intervention .
Obama administration officials said they would take action against the Syrian government even without the backing of allies or the United Nations because diplomatic paralysis must not prevent a response to the alleged chemical weapons attack outside the Syrian capital last week .
British Prime Minister David Cameron promised British lawmakers he would not go to war until a U.N. chemical weapons team on the ground in Syria has a chance to report its findings , pushing the U.K. 's involvement in any potential strike until next week at the earliest . Cameron called an emergency meeting of Parliament on Thursday to vote on whether to endorse international action against Syria .
Even so , British Foreign Secretary William Hague suggested that U.S. military action need not be constrained by Britain . “ The United States are able to make their own decisions , ” he told reporters late Wednesday , just after speaking with Secretary of State John Kerry .
“ By far the best thing would be if the United Nations could be united , unlikely as that seems in the face of the vetoes from Russia and China that we 've had in the past , ” Hague told reporters in London . “ If there is n't agreement at the United Nations , then we and other nations still have a responsibility on chemical weapons . ”
More intelligence was being sought by U.S. officials . While a lower-level Syrian military commanders ' communications discussing a chemical attack had been intercepted , they do n't specifically link the attack to an official senior enough to tie the killings to Assad himself , according to one U.S. intelligence official and two other U.S. officials . They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the intelligence publicly .
The White House ideally wants intelligence that links the attack directly to Assad or someone in his inner circle , to rule out the possibility that a rogue element of the military acting without Assad 's authorization .
That quest for added intelligence has delayed the release of the report by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence laying out evidence against Assad . The report was promised earlier this week by administration officials .
The CIA and the Pentagon have been working to gather more human intelligence tying Assad to the attack , relying on the intelligence services of Jordan , Saudi Arabia and Israel , the officials said . The administration was planning a teleconference briefing Thursday on Syria for leaders of the House and Senate and national security committees in both parties , U.S. officials and congressional aides said .
Both the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency have their own human sources – the rebel commanders and others who cross the border to brief CIA and defense intelligence officers at training camps in Jordan and Turkey . But their operation is much smaller than some of the other intelligence services , and it takes longer for their contacts to make their way overland .
The CIA , the Pentagon , and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence all declined to comment on the intelligence picture , and the White House did not respond to requests for comment .
Obama said he was not seeking a lengthy , open-ended conflict in Syria , indicating that any U.S. response would be limited in scope . But he argued that Syria 's use of chemical weapons not only violated international norms , but threatened “ America 's core self-interest . ”
“ We do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us , that they are held accountable , ” he said .
Baird said speculation was that military action would come in the form of cruise missiles or armed drones — neither of which Canada possesses . Nonetheless , he made it clear Canada would support a U.S.-led strike on Syrian regime forces .
“ I thought perhaps William Hague , the British Foreign Secretary , put it best when he said that , in 2013 , that someone could use these types of weapons of mass destruction with impunity would not only set a very bad precedent for the ongoing conflict in Syria but also , frankly , would give a green light to any dictator to use these weapons of mass destruction against their own people in future conflicts . ”
A week after the purported chemical attack on rebel-held areas outside Damascus , momentum has been building for a possible strike against the Assad regime .
However , the U.S. and its allies are looking beyond the UN Security Council to legitimize military action against Syria , trying to build a cohesive rationale for a strike and win broad international backing .
Laying out a legal justification for a U.S. response , Obama said Syria was violating the Geneva Protocols , an agreement signed in 1925 in the wake of World War I to ban the use of chemical gases . The White House has also cited the Chemical Weapons Convention , a 1992 agreement that builds on the Geneva Protocols by prohibiting the development and stockpiling of chemical weapons .
Syria is a party to the original Geneva accord , but not the latter chemical weapons agreement .
Syria , which sits on one of the world 's largest stockpiles of chemical weapons , has denied the charges . Moreover , Syria 's U.N. ambassador , Bashar Ja'afari , is demanding that United Nations experts investigate three alleged chemical weapons attacks against Syrian soldiers . He said the attacks occurred on Aug. 22 , 24 and 25 in three suburbs of the Syrian capital and dozens of soldiers are being treated for inhaling nerve gas .
“ This is the first use of chemical warfare in the 21st century . It has to be unacceptable . We have to confront something that is a war crime , something that is a crime against humanity , ” Hague said .
Speaking from The Hague , Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said no action should be taken until the UN chemical weapons inspectors had finished their investigation , which was expected to take another four days .
“ They are working very hard , under very , very dangerous circumstances , ” he said . “ Let them conclude their work for four days , and then we will have to analyze scientifically with experts . And then I think we will have to report to the Security Council for any actions . ”
He pleaded for time to give diplomacy another chance to end the conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people . “ Here in the Peace Palace , let us say : Give peace a chance . Give diplomacy a chance . Stop fighting and start talking , ” he said .
The U.S. has not presented concrete proof of Syrian regime involvement in the alleged chemical weapons attack , and UN inspectors have not endorsed the allegations — though the UN envoy to Syria , Lakhdar Brahimi , said Wednesday that evidence suggests some kind of “ substance ” was used to kill hundreds on Aug. 21 .
In a separate declaration after discussions at NATO , the alliance 's secretary-general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , also sharply criticized Assad 's government , saying that “ information available from a wide variety of sources points to the Syrian regime as responsible for the use of chemical weapons in these attacks . ”
“ This is a clear breach of longstanding international norms and practice . Any use of such weapons is unacceptable and can not go unanswered . Those responsible must be held accountable , ” the statement added . But Rasmussen gave no indication that NATO was contemplating any specific action .
Two of Syria 's staunchest backers , Iran and Russia , warned of dire consequences if the U.S. and its allies attack in Syria . Such strikes “ will lead to the long-term destabilization of the situation in the country and the region , ” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov .
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday that attacking Syria would be catastrophic for the entire Middle East .
“ Intervention of foreign and extra-regional powers in a country has no result other than sparking fire , ” Iran 's state TV quoted Ayatollah Khamenei as saying . “ Waging a war is like a spark in a gunpowder store … its dimensions and consequences ca n't be predicted . ”
Also on Wednesday , the Canadian government outlined $ 43-million worth of contributions to humanitarian groups for Syrian relief . Most went to United Nations agencies providing food and emergency aid to Syrians .
The major recipient was the UN World Food Programme . Ottawa has provided $ 17.5-million to feed refugees who have fled to surrounding countries , as well as $ 14.5-million for those within Syria who are affected by the crisis .
In a joint statement , Baird and International Development Minister Christian Paradis called the Syrian crisis “ one of the most significant humanitarian catastrophes of the 21st century ” and pledged to do more .
“ Canada has been a generous and steady hand to the Syrian people during this brutal struggle , ” Baird said . “ We understand that as this struggle drags on Canada will need to do more ; and we are wiling to do so . ”
Certain members of Congress are expected to get a classified U.S. intelligence report laying out the case against Assad . An unclassified version is to be made public . Officials say it wo n't have any detail that would jeopardize sources and methods .
Some lawmakers have argued that Congress must authorize any military action unless there has been an attack on the U.S. or the existence of an eminent threat to the U.S . Both Democrats and Republicans on Wednesday pressed the White House to provide a clear explanation of how military action would secure U.S. objectives .
Specifically , in a letter to Obama , House Speaker John Boehner asked him to make his case to Congress and the public about how military action would “ secure American national security interests , preserve America 's credibility , deter the future use of chemical weapons , and , critically , be a part of our broader policy and strategy . ”
Boehner said it was “ essential you address on what basis any use of force would be legally justified . ”

What a day ! What a freaking day ! While I planned on writing about trades all day , I got something better . David “ Big Papi ” Ortiz has officially joined THE LIST , the PED 2003 List . At least that 's what the New York Times has been reporting today and you know what how can you not believe them ? Every name that 's been leaked so far has been correct .
First to my Red Sox fans , I 've got plenty of them . I want to be a good friend and say I feel for ya , everything will be ok . But I just ca n't . When it comes to Manny Ramirez I can , because he 's addressed the issue this year and even served his time for it . But when it comes to David Ortiz , I just ca n't be the good friend . Not at all , Not one bit .
In the end David Ortiz is a cheat ! Nothing but a cheat ! Wait , I think . Wait , I ca n't . Nope , I 'm not going to call him a cheat . If I did , I 'd be just as hypocritical as he is .
When Alex Rodriguez was named , when Andy Pettitte was named and even when Roger Clemens was named , I replied who cares . They may have taken the substances but when they did they were n't banned . I 've said that with Barry Bonds , Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa .
David Ortiz was named as being on the 2003 list when the substances were n't banned , not in 2009 like Manny Ramirez was . Therefore David actually nothing wrong , he did what he felt was best for his career . The problem is the harsh words he 's used since the testing was enacted .
“ I would suggest everybody get tested , not random , everybody , ” he said . “ You go team by team . You test everybody three , four times a year and that 's about it. ” And if they tested positive ? “ Ban 'em for the whole year . ”
That 's what he said when testing was started and players were still getting caught . Looking deeper in the situation you can see the brilliance in this man . I 'm actually convinced this man is a genius , or actually just a master at the art of word play .
Let me explain .
Here was Ortiz 's response to testing in February .
“ I think you clean up the game by the testing , ” Ortiz said Monday . “ I know that if I test positive by using any kind of substance , I know that I 'm going to disrespect my family , the game , the fans and everybody , and I do n't want to be facing that situation. ” … “ So what would I do ? I wo n't use it , and I 'm pretty sure that everybody is on the same page . ”
Looking at that , he 's actually saying how the game should be cleaned up . He said he wo n't use it . He never said he actually never used it , just that he wo n't .
When conversations turned the 2003 list and the federal probe into it . His response was much like mine , who cares it was n't banned
“ All the drama , bringing that to court and acting like those [ are ] serious criminals , it does n't look good for the game , ” Ortiz said . “ It 's not like something that is happening right now . Everybody that has been taken to court , it 's because they did it in the past when it was n't banned from the game . ”
Now knowing what we know , we can see he was defending the players in baseball and in a way defending himself . He even added that the percentage at the time of players not using was very low . Something that could of and should of hinted that he was probably using too .
“ I would say it was certainly low , the percentage that was n't using it . Like he said in the interview [ with ESPN ] , that was what was going around the league at the time . ”
There 's something even more telling thou . In today 's New York Times article there is one section that everyone is ignoring . Everyone is so focused on Papi once using that they 're missing something very big .
In 2007 , Ortiz said that he used to buy a protein shake in the Dominican Republic when he was younger and did not know if it contained a performance-enhancing drug . “ I do n't do that anymore because they do n't have the approval for that here , so I know that , so I 'm off buying things at the GNC back in the Dominican Republic , ” Ortiz told The Boston Herald . He added : “ I do n't know if I drank something in my youth , not knowing it . ”
He basically did admit in 2007 that he could of been taking banned substances and stopped . This would naturally be due to testing . He used the same tired excuses of youth and not knowing , but still he planted the seeds of doubt . Something all of us failed to notice .
So yes , I really believe David Ortiz is a genius , a master of word play . He 's much like my buddy over at Josh Q Public , he can spin words like no other . The hurt , the laughter , and the anger in the baseball world today should be focused on Ortiz but he should n't be called a cheat .
He should face the wrath of the baseball world for how he has misled everyone over the past few years . He 's made himself out to be a poster boy for the non-steroid player , when in fact he was not and knew he was not .
Everything that 's thrown upon him these next few days is well deserved and his own fault . He 's got to come public and apologize . He 's got to come out and put on that Big Papi charm that made Boston fall in love with him .
As long as he 's saying “ no comment ” he 'll be labeled a cheat , actually he always will be .
But just like A-Rod , Clemens , Pettitte , Bonds , Sosa and McGwire , he really is n't . They just played the game the way it was played at that time .
David 's problem is he led us all on and made us all believe he did n't play that way .
Season 2 of `` The Americans '' is about more than KGB spies and sex in bars . The critically-acclaimed FX show starring Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys as undercover Soviet operatives who pose as travel agents in mid-'80s Washington , D.C. returns for a second season on Feb. 26 . Season 1 introduced viewers to Elizabeth and Philip Jennings ' intricate web of lies . But Season 2 will further complicate the deceptive honey trappings , geopolitical conflicts and -- oh yeah -- those insane wigs .
On a recent visit to `` The Americans '' set in Brooklyn , executive producer Joel Fields and members of the cast spoke freely about the portrayal of women , sex and violence in Season 1 and what we can expect from the super secretive Season 2 .
Elizabeth turns her focus to her family . She wants to be a better parent .
At the end of Season 1 , viewers saw Elizabeth ( Keri Russell ) get shot and since then , she 's been in recovery . Russell teased that in one of the opening scenes of Season 2 , she 's in a dramatic , messy and violent scene . `` She spends all these months away and just wants to get back because it 's [ her son ] Henry 's birthday , '' she said . `` She 's involved in this really sketchy scene and that 's her entrance back into reality , but then they 're like , 'Oh , it 's good to be home for his birthday . ' '' In another early scene in Season 2 , Russell said Elizabeth does something `` really hardcore '' to her daughter Paige . `` It involves waking her up and making her clean in the middle of the night , '' she said . `` The direction was like , 'Yeah , just a Russian mother . '' Even though this does n't sound like the best parenting advice , she 's trying .
Stan is lonely as hell , and his relationship with Nina probably wo n't end well .
Noah Emmerich , who plays the Jennings ' neighbor and FBI agent on the hunt for Russian spies , Stan , insisted his character is not a bad guy , despite starting an affair with his Soviet informant , Nina ( Annet Mahendru ) . `` He 's a victim of circumstance to some degree , '' Emmerich said on set . But after he began his sexual relationship with Nina , Stan kept more and more secrets from his wife and son . `` In Nina , he encounters someone who 's equally sort of lonely and isolated in a foreign land , '' he said . `` The first thing that draws Stan into that possibility is the sense of being known , of being seen , of a shared experience , which we all need in life . Stan is drowning in a sea of loneliness and he bumps into a fellow traveler and they hold onto each other . ''
Curious teenagers can not be stopped .
Paige knows something is up . At the end of Season 1 , viewers saw her poking through her parents ' things , hoping to find some answers . `` In Season 2 it picks up and I just become more and more curious , '' Holly Taylor , who plays Paige , said . `` It 's kind of really suspicious that my parents are travel agents and they 're out at 4 a.m. '' She comes into her own and questions everything . `` Paige ca n't cope with the fact that she does n't know what 's going on . It 's really frustrating for her . '' If Paige finds out her whole life is a lie , who knows what she 'll do or who she 'll tell .
KGB sex training was real and would have impacted both Elizabeth and Philip .
When asked why the creators wrote Elizabeth 's rape scene into Season 1 , executive producer Joel Fields said , `` On some level , both of these characters are sexual abuse victims . '' During this time period , the KGB had extensive sex training for both male and female spies and Fields and creator Joe Weisberg felt it was in keeping with reality . `` The show , in not too overt a way , but certainly in the second season , deals with the dynamic of sexuality in marriage , the sexuality in relationship and sexuality that 's challenged by past and current other experiences . ''
Things get messier .
It 's clear that in the beginning of Season 2 , Elizabeth and Philip are trying to find their footing . After Elizabeth 's injury , she 's just not all there yet . `` I think she 's faltering and I think in the first half of the second season , she 's definitely not on her game , '' Russell said . As Elizabeth and Philip try to mend their marriage and make it real for the first time , their comfort levels seem to change . `` There 's the other thing of really being in love with someone and then having to constantly use your sexuality for someone else , '' Russell said . `` I do n't think she 's so comfortable in that anymore . ''
Women will continue to kick all the ass .
Margo Martindale will be back to reprise her role as Claudia , the Jennings ' KGB handler , and Elizabeth is bearing down , despite her earlier missteps . `` The Soviets were matriarchal in their outlook , '' Mathew Rhys said . `` [ Russia ] was always referred to as the Motherland , you know ? So , it 's incredibly feminine and was viewed incredibly strong . ''
The sex gets sexier ... and maybe a little kinky .
Hair and wardrobe must perform miracles in order to get those crazy wigs to stay on the actors ' heads , especially in the sex scenes . But , Russell teased that while Elizabeth and Philip become closer , her character gets intrigued by her husband 's disguises . `` She 's like , 'What do you mean that you do that with this person ? What does that person like ? Why do n't you do that with me ? It 's this weird blurry thing that happens . ' ''
Forget everything else . `` The Americans '' is really about Elizabeth and Philip .
`` At the end of the day , it 's a character show , '' Fields said . `` The spy stories that we have , we want them to be interesting and engaging and to heighten the stakes , but they 're really there to amplify the character dynamics . ''
Hamilton started from the pit lane and finished fourth in Brazil , making 10 passing moves along the way .
However , he admitted that it would have been harder to repeat his charge at other venues , because the laptime advantage required to overtake cars ahead would have been greater than it is at Interlagos .
`` When I was in GP2 that was good fun . It was easier in GP2 to overtake , '' Hamilton said . `` The way their floors are it was easier to be close . So to come back through the field [ was easier ] .
`` This actually is a race track where it is difficult to get past here , but the delta is slightly smaller than it is in other places .
`` But if you look at most of the circuits we go to , the delta to be able to overtake the car in front is usually a second and a half , or something like that .
`` You 've got to be a second and a half faster , that 's a whole tyre compound and a bit .
`` So that just shows there 's obviously a flaw in the cars ' design , and whilst the cars are fantastic this year , that 's an area we can improve on for the future . ''
Asked if his Brazil charge suggested that reverse grids would make F1 more entertaining , he said : `` Reversing the grid , I mean , you did n't see the top four moves around , did you ?
`` So reversing the grid , you 'll just reverse that role , and it 'll be the same . ''
- Detroit police are asking for the public 's help identifying a man who was caught on a home doorbell cam with a gun .
Saturday morning around 1:34 a.m. in the 20200 block of Asbury Park , police say an unknown male suspect walked onto a porch of a residence and rang the doorbell . That 's near 8 Mile and Greenfield roads .
While waiting for a response , the suspect was captured on camera holding a firearm .
After a few seconds , the suspect attempted to cover his face with his jacket then ran off the porch , where another unknown male wearing dark clothing was waiting for him .
Both suspects fled towards Trojan Avenue on foot . Police say the homeowners did not know who the suspects were .
If you recognize either of the men , you 're asked to contact the Detroit Police Department 's Eighth Precinct at ( 313 ) 596-5840 , or at ( 313 ) 596-5800 .
Chief Keef 's 19-year-old stepbrother Ulysses “ Chris ” Gissendanner III has become yet another victim of Chicago , Illinois ' shooting epidemic .
According to DNA Info ( via SOHH ) , Gissendanner was shot in the back of the head on the Far South Side on January 2nd . The aspiring rapper was killed in a car near 124th Street and South Ave. while visiting his uncle in West Pullman . He later died at Roseland Hospital .
Alfonso Cozart , who claims to be Keef 's biological father , was stepfather to Gissendanner , whose rap name was YPN Boomtown . Keef was related to Gissendanner through marriage .
Cozart , who no longer speaks with Chief Keef , said that Gissendanner 's murder makes him worry about Keef 's well being . “ As a caring father , who would n't worry about that ? ” Cozart asked . “ I do want my son to have success and have a long , positive life , and I hope the best for him . ”
He added that he does n't want Keef 's fame to overshadow Gissendanner 's passing . “ He just graduated from high school , and was in college and had a job . He was a positive person , ” Cozart said . “ I 'm not trying to get publicity of Chief Keef being my son . I want you to focus on Ulysses . He 's the one that 's gone . ”
This marks yet another recent death for Chicago teens due to gunfire . Keef 's alleged enemy Lil JoJo lost his life at 16 , while Joshua was murdered at 18 years old , both late last year .

These artists 's concept gives an impression of how common planets are around the stars in the Milky Way . A six-year search that surveyed millions of stars using the microlensing technique concluded that planets around stars are the rule rather than the exception .
Alien planets are incredibly common in our Milky Way galaxy , outnumbering stars by a large margin , a new study suggests .
On average , each of the 100 billion or so stars in our galaxy hosts at least 1.6 planets , according to the study , bringing the number of likely alien worlds to more than 160 billion . And large numbers of these exoplanets are likely to be small and rocky — roughly Earth-like — since low-mass planets appear to be much more abundant than large ones .
`` This statistical study tells us that planets around stars are the rule , rather than the exception , '' said study lead author Arnaud Cassan of the Paris Institute of Astrophysics . `` From now on , we should see our galaxy populated not only with billions of bright stars , but imagine them surrounded by as many hidden extrasolar worlds . ''
Using a cosmic gravity lens
To date , astronomers have discovered more than 700 planets beyond our own solar system , with 2,300 additional `` candidates '' found by NASA 's Kepler space telescope awaiting confirmation .
The vast majority of these exoplanet detections have been made using two different techniques : transit photometry and radial velocity . [ Gallery : The Strangest Alien Planets ]
Kepler employs the transit method , which watches for the tiny , telltale dips in a star 's brightness caused when a planet crosses the star 's face , blocking some of its light . Radial velocity looks for minuscule wobbles in a star 's movement caused by the gravitational tugs of orbiting planets .
While these two methods have been highly productive , they 're biased toward finding planets that orbit relatively close to their parent stars . In the new study , Cassan and his colleagues employed a different technique , known as gravitational microlensing , that feels this bias less strongly .
In gravitational microlensing , scientists watch what happens when a massive object passes in front of a star from our perspective on Earth . The nearby object 's gravitational field bends and magnifies the light from the distant star , acting like a lens .
This produces a light curve — a brightening and fading of the faraway star 's light over time — whose characteristics tell astronomers a lot about the foreground object .
In many cases , this nearby body is a star . If it has any planets , even ones in relatively far-flung orbits , these can generate secondary light curves , alerting researchers to their presence .

Studying millions of stars
In the new study , the researchers looked at data gathered by a variety of Earth-based telescopes , which scanned millions of stars from 2002 to 2007 for microlensing events .
The team closely analyzed about 40 of these events and discovered that three betrayed the presence of an alien planet around a star . One of these planets is a bit more massive than Jupiter , one is comparable to Neptune and the third is a so-called `` super-Earth '' with a mass about five times that of our home planet .

Considering how perfectly aligned multiple bodies must be to yield an explanet detection via microlensing , that 's a pretty impressive haul , researchers said .
The astronomers used all of this data , as well as information about seven additional planets detected by other microlensing efforts , to put a number on their planet-detection efficiency — and , by extension , the number of alien worlds that may populate the Milky Way .
The team determined that about one-sixth of our galaxy 's stars harbor Jupiter-mass planets , half have Neptune-like worlds , and nearly two-thirds host super-Earths . And that 's just in the stretch of orbital space from 0.5 to 10 astronomical units from each star , the limit of the study 's sensitivity . ( One astronomical unit , or AU , is the distance from Earth to the sun , about 93 million miles . )
`` Moreover , we confirm that low-mass planets , such as super-Earths ( up to 10 Earths ) and Neptune-like planets are much more abundant than giant planets such as Saturn and Jupiter ( with estimates that there are 6 to 7 times more low-mass than giant planets ) , '' Cassan told SPACE.com in an email .
Further , according to the researchers ' calculations , every star in the Milky Way harbors an average of 1.6 planets in the 0.5-10 AU range , which in our solar system corresponds roughly to the swath of space between Venus and Saturn .
Since astronomers estimate that our galaxy contains about 100 billion stars , that works out to at least 160 billion alien planets . A fair number of these alien worlds are likely to have two sunsets like the planet Tatooine in the `` Star Wars '' films ; a separate study , also announced today , related the discovery of two exoplanets that orbit a pair of suns .
Cassan and his team report their results in the Jan. 12 issue of the journal Nature .
Planets bound and unbound
The true number of alien worlds may be quite a bit larger than 160 billion . Some planets hug their host stars more closely than 0.5 AU , after all , and others are more far-flung than 10 AU . And a great many likely have no host star at all .
Last year , a different team used microlensing observations to discover a huge population of Jupiter-like planets that zoom through space unbound to a parent star . These free-flying `` rogues '' likely outnumber `` normal '' alien worlds with obvious parent stars by at least 50 percent , according to the 2011 study .
`` The two results obtained by microlensing show that planets are everywhere , and not only around stars , '' Cassan said .
For those of us clinging to the notion that Earth is special , these and a raft of other recent exoplanet discoveries may be tough to stomach .
`` We used to think that the Earth might be unique in our galaxy , '' study co-author Daniel Kubas , also of the Paris Institute of Astrophysics , said in a statement . `` But now it seems that there are literally billions of planets with masses similar to Earth orbiting stars in the Milky Way . ''

Update : Gillian Anderson 's official website says she will indeed be a part of the panel . Thanks to @ XFSista for the heads-up .
Update 2 : SDCCBlog.com have now confirmed David Duchovny will be a part of the panel as well . Mulder and Scully are back together , at least for one day !
JESUITS IN SPACE AND IN THE VATICAN by Mary Doria Russell was originally published in September-October 2014 issue of Health Progress , the journal of the Catholic Health Association of the United States .
Old joke . A Franciscan , a Dominican and a Jesuit are having dinner one night . Suddenly the lights go out .
The Franciscan says , “ Let us welcome Sister Darkness and wait patiently for Brother Sunlight to return . ”
The Dominican says , “ God gives us darkness of ignorance so that we might , by contrast , discern the light of truth . ”
The Jesuit gets a flashlight and goes downstairs to flip the breaker .
*
I 'm not a Catholic , but that 's the kind of practical , pragmatic “ just do it ” attitude that brought the Jesuits to mind on 500th anniversary of Columbus 's arrival in the New World .
On October 12 , 1992 , a serious Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) began at the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico . I asked myself , What would happen if we really heard something ? What if we picked up incontestable evidence that there were other sentient species in the universe ? And what if it were possible to go there ? Who would attempt the mission ?
It would take an international organization with scientific expertise , the money to back the mission , and a compelling motive to go . What about a group with a 500-year history of making first contact ?
What about the Jesuits ?
During the Age of Discovery , Jesuit priests were never more than a year or two behind other Europeans making initial contact with previously unknown peoples ; indeed , Jesuits were often the vanguard of exploration . And what could be a more compelling motive than the desire of Jesuit scientists to know and love God 's other children ? So that 's how my science fiction novels The Sparrow and Children of God got started . They 're about Jesuits in space , making first contact with God 's other children on an alien planet .
Fast-forward 22 years .
When the stunningly improbable papacy of Francis I was announced , I got congratulatory emails from readers around the world , as if I had somehow predicted this turn of events .
Actually , I had predicted an African pope , not a South American , and my Gelasius III certainly was n't a Jesuit . I try to keep my novels realistic . Jesuits sometimes serve as bishops in what used to be called mission lands and in old age , esteemed Jesuits have sometimes been raised to the cardinalate , but those are exceptions to the rule . Jesuits actually take a vow to forgo ecclesiastical dignities . A Jesuit pope was n't impossible but it was about likely the mayor of Toledo , Ohio , going straight to the White House .
Fiction has to be plausible . Real life ? Not so much .
And here we are in the real-life future , when the College of Cardinals has elected a Jesuit pope whose predecessor was choppered into retirement at Castel Gandolfo . Which , in case you were wondering , is not actually named after a Tolkien character . Trust me on that . I do a lot of research for my books .
The papacy of Francis I is so astonishingly unprecedented , it seemed apocalyptic to some of the Church 's more excitable children . There are those who believe St. Malachy prophesied in 1143 that Francis I will be the last pontiff . They 're pretty convinced that the end of the world is nigh , but more than a year has passed and the apocalypse tarries .
Meanwhile , Pope Francis has enthralled the world much as the current Dalai Lama has over the years : simply by being a manifestly nice guy . Good-natured . Humble . Compassionate . Funny and self-deprecating .
Francis carries his own suitcase , remarking , “ It 's normal to carry a bag when traveling ! We have to get used to this being normal for a pope. ” The world swoons .
Francis turns down the lavish , if lonely , papal apartments in favor of a perfectly nice room in the Vatican guest house where he can share meals with others . The world smiles .
Francis removes from office Germany 's notorious Bishop of Bling , who spent $ 43 million renovating his mansion . Prelates around the world are shamed into giving up lavish digs.The world applauds .
“ It breaks my heart , ” Francis says , “ to see a priest or nun with the latest model of car . Cars are necessary , but take a more humble one ! Think of how many children die of hunger. ” The pope 's own ride is a Ford Focus . The world sighs with admiration .
Asked about homosexuals in the clergy , Francis replies , “ If a gay person seeks God , who am I to judge ? ” The world is amazed . Seriously ? Did he really just say that ? Wow .
Francis publicly embraces people with severe disfigurements and deformities . “ He is teaching us about looking at the Other as Jesus looks at them : with tenderness , kindness and love , ” says Jean Vanier , founder of an international federation where people with and without disabilities live and work together in community . The world wipes a tear from its eye . What a guy !
According to the Pew Research Center , positive comments about Francis outnumbered negative ones on the Internet by 5 to 1 during his first year . This pope is a rock star and he 's got the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine to prove it . But as his papacy goes forward , Francis will have to lift things heavier than his suitcase .
“ Women in the Church are more important than bishops and priests , ” he has declared , “ just as Mary is more important than the apostles. ” That 's nice . Mother 's Day is nice , too , but respect year-round is better . And what about divorce ? Remarriage ? Birth control ?
The Church , Francis says , “ must act decisively to root out and punish pedophile priests. ” Measures must be taken “ to protect minors and to help those who have suffered violence in the past. ” Okay , but will records be turned over to police ? Are priestly pedophiles going to do time ? And what about the cover-ups ?
Sometimes the devil really is dancing in the details . There are decades , if not centuries , of scandal that can no longer be hidden . The breathtaking evil perpetrated by Marcial Maciel Degollado and the Legionaries of Christ has been luridly exposed . The glaring hypocrisy of clerics who preach celibacy while practicing promiscuity has been uncovered , filmed and broadcast on PBS , no less . The corruption of the Vatican bank , and the involvement of the members of the Curia in Mafia money-laundering , is oozing into the light .
Historically , revolutionaries fare better than reformers . Rip the past away and you can leap into the future while people are still gasping at the speed of change . Reformers , by contrast , chip away at the past , bit by bit . Reformers give those who fear change plenty of time to prepare opposition and to counter every move . Meanwhile , those who yearn for decisive change are disappointed . Fond hopes and expectations are dashed . Cynicism sets in . It 's only been a year , the world admits . We 'll cut Francis some slack for now . But the question remains . Can this personable , good-hearted pope bring about genuine reform or just…rebranding ?
Another question , equally important : will the world 's admiration for Francis go beyond fandom ? As St. Ignatius Loyola , founder to the Jesuit order , wrote , “ Love in action is preferred to love in words. ” To put it plainer : talk is cheap . What are you prepared to do ?
There is a long and honorable Catholic tradition of preference for the poor , the sick , the despised . It started with Jesus of Nazareth and has been carried on , generation after generation , by those who take his teaching seriously . To date , Pope Francis has directed much of his scolding at Curia careerists and Vatican hypocrites , but there have been clear signs that he will become insistent about drawing the world 's attention toward the beam in its own eye .
Already , he has decried rampant consumerism and the modern “ throw-away culture. ” He has denounced unbridled capitalism , “ the idolatry of money , ” and “ the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose. ” Perhaps some people have made quiet changes in their own lives in response to the Pope 's calls for social and economic justice . Maybe somebody somewhere bought a little car or settled for a more modest house , and gave the leftover cash to charity . But the loudest response came from those who clutched their wallets and cried , “ Francis is a Marxist ! ”
Clean-up operations at the Vatican are well and good , and long overdue . Still , I think it 's fair to say that the first Jesuit papacy will be judged by the degree to which Francis I can transmute his personal charm into food , shelter , education and dignity for the poor , the sick , the delinquent , the marginalized .
Can he do it ? He 's a Jesuit . I have no doubt that he will try . To the watching world , I say this . Do n't just wish him well . Help .
The lack of the iconic Home button in iPhone X due to its all-new stunning edge-to-edge screen design has raised some questions .
We were able to figure out how to do things on the iPhone X without the Home button like accessing the Home screen , accessing the multitasking app switcher to switch between apps or close apps , accessing the Control Center , Notification Siri , and Apple Pay . However , it seemed like iPhone X wo n't support Reachability .
In case you 're new to the world of iPhones , Reachability is a feature that Apple introduced for iPhones with big screens such as the iPhone 6s , iPhone 6s Plus and later . The purpose of Reachability is to push all the contents of the screen towards the bottom half when activated , which allows you to easily reach the corners of an app and makes one-handed use easier .
The good news is that Brazilian iOS developer Guilherme Rambo has shared a video , which suggests that Reachability will be supported in iPhone X. Guilherme has a shared the video of Reachability working on the iPhone X simulator in the Xcode 9.1 beta that was released with iOS 11.1 beta .
https : //twitter.com/_inside/status/913158732128845824
Guilherme points out that he has n't been able to figure how to use Reachability though . It would be intuitive if a user could double tap on the indicator at the bottom to access Reachability .
I do n't use Reachability a lot but it can be quite handy for people especially on the Plus iPhones . If you were worried that Apple had ditched it , then you do n't need to worry , it looks like iPhone X will support Reachability , after all , we just do n't how it will work currently .
iPhone X goes up for pre-order on October 27 , and on sale on November 3 .
Any guesses on which gesture would activate Reachability on iPhone X ? Let me know in the comments .

( CNN ) The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether Chicago police have made a habit of violating the law or the U.S. Constitution in their policing , Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday .
The `` pattern-and-practice '' probe , as it 's known , will focus on use of force , deadly force , accountability and how the Chicago Police Department `` tracks and treats '' those incidents , she said .
Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he welcomes the investigation and promised the city 's total cooperation in achieving the `` mutual goal '' of keeping Chicago safe while respecting citizens ' rights .
`` Nothing is more important to me than the safety and well-being of our residents and ensuring that the men and women of our Police Department have the tools , resources and training they need to be effective crime fighters , stay safe and build community trust , '' Emanuel said in a statement .
He later told reporters that the city will be made better because of the investigation .
`` We accept it , and we need it , '' he said , describing the current moment as an inflection point .
`` None of the measures we have taken have ever measured up to the seriousness , the scope , the scale of the challenge in front of us as a city , '' Emanuel said .
City , department under fire
Word of the federal probe comes about two weeks after police released the October 2014 video of Officer Jason Van Dyke fatally shooting Laquan McDonald on a Chicago street , and it comes after reports released by the city over the weekend indicate that accounts from police on the scene appear to contradict what the footage shows
The video of McDonald 's fatal shooting outraged many Chicagoans , who took to the streets to protest what they felt was an excessive use of force and dishonesty by the city and Van Dyke 's fellow officers , who initially accused McDonald of threatening officers . The demonstrators also questioned why it took more than 400 days to release the video , despite the city paying McDonald 's mother $ 5 million in April .
The spotlight on the case shone bright enough to illuminate another case -- that of Ronald Johnson , who was killed by police eight days before McDonald 's death . Video from that incident was shown to reporters Monday , as Emanuel promised last week . Cook County State 's Attorney Anita Alvarez said Monday that there will be no charges against the officer responsible for Johnson 's death .
The federal investigation -- which places the Chicago Police Department in the company of forces in other cities such as Cleveland ; Ferguson , Missouri ; and Albuquerque , New Mexico -- is necessary , Lynch said , because failing to hold police accountable for misconduct creates `` profound consequences '' for communities .
`` When suspicion and hostility is allowed to fester it can erupt into unrest , '' she said , adding that the investigation will not home in on individuals but will aim to `` improve systems . ''
Leadership changes in Chicago
Calls for a federal probe intensified after Chicago police on November 24 released the video of McDonald being shot 16 times last year . Political upheaval came quickly on the heels of Chicago 's demonstrations , with Emanuel asking for ( and getting ) Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy 's resignation .
On Sunday , the mayor announced that Scott Ando , head of the authority that investigates police shooting incidents such as the McDonald and Johnson cases , had stepped down .
Sharon Fairley will be the new chief administrator for the city 's Independent Police Review Authority , replacing Ando , a veteran Drug Enforcement Administration agent who joined the IPRA in 2011 and took its reins last year . Fairley was general counsel to the city 's Office of the Inspector General and previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney where she prosecuted national security , financial and government fraud cases .
`` Sharon brings the experience and independence to ensure that when an officer breaks the rules , they will be held accountable , '' the mayor said in a statement , adding that `` new leadership is required as we rededicate ourselves to dramatically improving our system of police accountability and rebuilding trust . ''
This follows a series of initiatives taken by Emanuel 's office in the past two weeks , including expanding the body camera program and establishing a task force to review police discipline procedures , according to the statement .
The City Council formed the IPRA in 2007 `` in response to concerns about how allegations of police misconduct were being investigated , '' according to its website . It is staffed by civilian investigators charged with independently reviewing allegations against police .
Latest in federal police probes
Federal police probes like the one undertaken in Chicago are nothing new to President Barack Obama 's administration . Many cities have fallen under the federal microscope during his administration . A few examples :
-- In Ferguson , federal authorities determined after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown that the police department had engaged in discriminatory and unconstitutional practices .
-- A federal probe that began in Cleveland in 2013 documents several instances of unnecessary force after two unarmed civilians were shot more than 20 times after a high-speed police chase .
-- In East Haven , Connecticut , federal investigators determined Latinos were subjected to more traffic stops , harsher treatment and more retaliation over discrimination complaints , a 2011 Justice Department report said . The following year , four officers were arrested and charged with targeting Latinos .
-- The Justice Department and Missoula , County , Montana , officials reached an agreement last year after a federal probe highlighted allegations of gender bias against victims of sexual assault . The agreement to approve policies , training , communication and data sharing , among other measures , ended a lawsuit in which the county attorney accused the feds of bullying and defaming prosecutors .
-- A 2011 report on New Orleans found minorities were subjected to excessive force , illegal stops and pat-down searches . It also found that more African-American residents were arrested , compared with white residents , and that police targeted transgender people for arrest on prostitution charges .
-- The Justice Department accused the Albuquerque , New Mexico , police department of engaging in `` a pattern '' of using excessive force after a two-year investigation . In some instances , the department alleged , officers failed to turn on their cameras and recorders before such encounters .
Following the announcement of the Ferguson probe in September 2014 , CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin explained -- much as the attorney general did Monday -- that these types of investigations focus more on reform than punishing individuals for past misconduct .
Still , Toobin said , `` it 's very serious because it can lead to a virtual federal takeover of the police . ''

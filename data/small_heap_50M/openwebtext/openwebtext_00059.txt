After a Hall of Fame baseball career , Mike Piazza has turned his focus to ownership with Italian side Reggiana .
Italian soccer is famous for , among other things , the passion of its derbies . There 's the Derby della Capitale between Rome-based sides Lazio and AS Roma , the Derby della Madonnina between AC Milan and Internazionale , as well as the Derby della Mole between Turin-based clubs Juventus and Torino . The list goes on .
But last weekend , a very different derby was contested in an otherwise nondescript match in Lega Pro , Italy 's third tier , between Venezia and Reggiana . The two clubs are n't traditional rivals by any means , and both have been away from Italy 's top flight for over 15 years , but the match has now been dubbed the Stars and Stripes Derby .
Granted , the moniker was applied somewhat tongue in cheek , but it was done as a nod to a pair of American owners , Venezia 's Joe Tacopina , and Reggiana 's Mike Piazza - yes , that Mike Piazza - the baseball Hall of Famer .
`` It 's a big game from a pride standpoint , '' said Piazza before the match . `` Obviously because it 's two American owners it 's gotten a lot of attention over here . ''
Piazza relayed how the two owners had joked that they should engage in a boxing match afterward . When reminded of the jest , Tacopina wisecracked , `` As a New York Mets fan I would feel bad knocking out Mike Piazza , but a bet is a bet and I 'd have to comply . ''
Given that the match ended in a 1-1 draw , that would have proved to be a unique tiebreaker . Raffaele Nol√® put Reggiana up 1-0 just four minutes into the match , but Venezia largely dominated thereafter , and equalized midway through the second half through defender Marco Modolo . Afterwards , Piazza sounded somewhat disappointed with the result , but enthusiastic about his new venture .
`` My whole trip was crazy , I had meetings the whole week , '' said Piazza after returning stateside . `` The game was kind of relaxing which was weird . But it 's such great football , it 's such a great product , dude . I love the football over there . It 's got passion . ''
Beyond the result , the match highlighted the increasing wave of foreign ownership in Italian soccer - a group that includes American James Pallotta at AS Roma and Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir at Inter - who bring with them a very different approach to running the clubs .
Italy has a long history of fan-owners , who did not treat the club as a business . Prior to the implementation of Financial Fair Play , owners such as Silvio Berlusconi at AC Milan and Massimo Moratti at Inter plowed money into the club regardless of the losses they incurred . In the FFP era , new owners have had to pinch pennies while also avoiding the implication that the previous owner ran the club into the ground .
Tacopina has been at the vanguard of foreign ownership for the better part of the last decade , though he admits the journey has n't been for the fainthearted .
`` It was easier being a fan , '' he said via telephone . `` It 's a level of suffering that I really do n't wish on anybody . ''
It was back in 2008 that Tacopina first tried to take over his beloved AS Roma and then Bologna , only to have both deals fall apart . He eventually succeeded with Roma in 2011 with an investment group headed by Thomas DiBenedetto .
`` People were telling me , 'You 're crazy . What are you doing ? You 'll lose money on Italian soccer , ' '' he said . `` I said , 'Okay , thank you . ' I generally do n't listen to conventional wisdom in my life , I go with my gut , and I just knew there was something here , something special , a real opportunity . So I kept going . ''
Tacopina left Roma in 2014 and then took over Bologna with the help of Montreal Impact owner Joey Saputo . Despite engineering Bologna 's promotion to Serie A in the 2014-15 season by way of a playoff , the pair 's relationship fell apart , and Tacopina was out . He soon set his sights on a new target , but one much further down the Italian soccer food chain . The city of Venice had seen its team endure multiple bankruptcies , allowing Tacopina to come in and acquire the rights to the club debt free , though he did provide a cash injection of $ 6.7 million .
The New Yorker is clearly a man with a plan , one that centers around business , soccer , and mining the cash cow that is Venice 's tourism industry .
`` To me it was a no-brainer . Having come from Roma and Bologna , two beautiful cities , Venice is a global brand before I even field a team , '' he said .
American businessman Joe Tacopina believes Venezia FC is more than worth a gamble from a business perspective .
`` Last year , in Serie D , we had 350 journalists at press conferences . We had more articles about Venezia than I did at Bologna . Why ? Because it 's Venice . I have [ 20 ] million tourists a year who are potential customers . We 're built to cater towards a tourist crowd . We have our local community , but how many churches and museums are you going to see ? People want to do something different . ''
Not that Tacopina plans to overlook the hardcore support that has stuck with the club over many years - and through many owners .
`` We will obviously cater and always appreciate the fact that we are custodians of the team , the team is owned by the community , and I mean that because in Italy , the teams are very important to the community , '' he said . `` We have to remember that and we wo n't forget it . ''
Adding to Tacopina 's potential upside is how Italian soccer has lagged behind other leagues in terms of commercial revenues . And with a plan for a new stadium moving forward with the backing of Venice 's mayor , the game day revenue is poised to skyrocket as well .
`` Owners in Italy , they really buy these clubs for social currency , '' he said . `` There 's no commercial model in place , there 's no marketing . The main bulk of the revenues there is the media rights . Eighty percent of the revenues come from that , as opposed to the Premier League where it 's an even third , like a pie , among media rights , game day revenues and commercial revenues . Up until recently , with the influx of foreign owners , they have n't been focused on that . It 's sort of perplexing that these smart people do n't really run their teams like businesses . But that 's changing . ''
The only downside was that the revived Venezia would have to start over in fourth-tier Serie D , but Tacopina did n't let that sway him . He brought in former Roma , Napoli , Palermo , Bari and Siena sporting director Giorgio Perinetti to serve in the same role with Venezia .
After cruising to promotion to Lega Pro , Tacopina brought in AC Milan legend Filippo Inzaghi to be the manager . He said that his player payroll is the highest in Lega Pro , but he does n't fear the influx of other foreign owners .
`` The secret is now getting out , '' he said . `` Mike has jumped in , I brought in Joey Saputo to Bologna , I helped Erick Thohir get into Inter Milan . Italian soccer is really one of the most undervalued properties in sport . ''
If Tacopina was the first to leap into the shark-infested waters - and has the scars to prove it - Piazza is the latest to join him , having acquired Reggiana last summer . Piazza 's affinity for the game started when he was growing up in the Philadelphia area , attending Philadelphia Fury games in the old NASL , and later indoor games with the Philadelphia Fever . His Italian heritage made him a fan of Italy 's national team , and he has fond memories of the Azzurri 's World Cup triumph in 1982 .
`` I just really enjoyed the game as a kid , '' he said via telephone . `` I never could play it skill-wise , but I always admired the athleticism of it . ''
Piazza is nearly a decade removed from his baseball career , but admitted that when it came to owning a sports team , he was looking for something different , and after exploring a few options , settled on Reggiana due to its existing fan base , as well as the fact that its location in Reggio Emilia is in the center of the country between Milan and Bologna .
`` I wanted to reinvent myself , '' he said . `` I tell people , 'Never be afraid to step out of your comfort zone . ' I 'm never afraid to fail , and that 's something I 've done obviously with my baseball career . With that said , I have a lot of challenges but I have a lot of great people working for me , and everybody seems to be more invested in our success than our failure . I know we 're going to fall down and make some mistakes , but generally we have a good framework here . ''
That has n't stopped Piazza from following Tacopina 's playbook to a degree . Piazza has allied himself with former Cagliari goalkeeper Maurizio Franzone to be his general manager , Andrea Grammatica serves as sporting director , and has tabbed former Bologna youth team manager Leonardo Colucci to be his manager .
`` I 'm not shy about our intentions , '' he said . `` It 's about trying to move up as difficult as that may be . We feel we 've put a team on the field that has the potential to get to Serie B and obviously with those improvements comes more revenue from TV rights and things like that , so with the open system and the promotion/relegation system in Italy , we feel it 's a good bet . ''
That has left Piazza to focus on the business side of the club , and like Tacopina , he believes there is some low-hanging fruit in terms of growing sponsorships and tapping into other revenue streams . That is n't to say making the transition from being a player to an owner has been easy .
`` It 's a whole new appreciation for the business side of the game , '' he said . `` I 've been taking meetings with sponsors , and trying to form sponsorship relationships . I 'm worried about payroll and expenses and line items on the budget . I 'm worried about attendance and other things and factors that come to our game day revenue . It 's been extremely eye opening . I have a whole new respect for owners in other teams . I know a lot of players wo n't like to hear me say that . ''
Piazza is also aware of the deep history involved , and that decisions ca n't be made without thinking of how fans might be impacted . That said , Piazza does offer Reggiana 's fans something it has n't always had , and that 's stability .
`` Even if we 're moderately successful we want to build a strong business model that is stable for the community because some of the Lega Pro teams have been , for lack of a better word , on a financial rollercoaster , some issues with financing , '' he said . `` We want to give a strong team to the community because it has such strong fan support . We know it 's not going to be easy , but we 're excited about the project . ''
For now , the thoughts have shifted to the next game , but January 21 will be circled on the calendar . That 's when the latest installment of the Stars and Stripes Derby will take place .

What if you could transmit data without link layer flow control bogging down throughput with retransmission requests , and also optimize the size of the transmission for network efficiency and application latency constraints ? Researchers from MIT , Caltech and the University of Aalborg claimed to have accomplished this with stateless transmission using Random Linear Network Coding , or RLNC . The universities have collaborated to commercialize this promising technology through joint venture called Code On Technologies .
Last week , according to data released by Code On , RLNC performed 13 % to 465 % faster than the industry standard Reed-Solomon encoding in Storage Area Network ( SAN ) erasure application testing . The Kodo library , using RLNC to encode and decode data on a SAN for error correction and fault tolerance , was compared to Intel 's Reed-Solomon library implementation , called ISA-L , and an open source library implementation called Jerasure . The Kodo/RLNC implementation ran consistently faster on identical SAN hardware .
Other testing by Code On shows that RLNC applied to other types of data transmission such as Wi-Fi and LTE can improve performance . Earlier this month , Code On released to industry analysts test data showing improved performance of mobile video over Wi-Fi . The effect of a 3 % error rate when streaming a four-minute video over native Wi-Fi was compared to an identical transmission of video packets encoded and decoded using RLNC . The RLNC-encoded transmission improved video quality because packet loss in the RLNC case did not require the retransmission of lost packets . The RLNC-encoded video was downloaded five times faster than the native video stream time , and the RLNC-encoded video streamed fast enough to be rendered without interruption . By comparison , the native video took five minutes to download and had 13 spinning wheel interruptions .
Code On has an elegant approach to stateless transmission , avoiding altogether the network congestion from error correction and retransmission that degrades network performance . Comparatively , flow control error correction leads to network congestion because TCP-IP native error correction is limited , resulting in retransmission of lost packets .
An RLNC transmission can recover from errors with neither sender nor receiver retaining and updating transmission-state information and requesting lost packets to be retransmitted . This is because RLNC can recreate any packet lost on the receiving side from a later sequenced packet . In over-simplified terms , each RLNC encoded packet sent is encoded using the immediately earlier sequenced packet and randomly generated coefficients , using a linear algebra function . The combined packet length is no longer than either of the two packets from which it is composed . When a packet is lost , the missing packet can be mathematically derived from a later-sequenced packet that includes earlier-sequenced packets and the coefficients used to encode the packet .
Since the RLNC encoding sender does n't need to listen for acknowledgements of successful transmission and perhaps retransmit , the sender can continuously transmit at near-wire speed optimized for latency and network throughput . More importantly , RLNC encoding can ride on top of the TCP-IP protocol , so implementation does not require the replacement of communications equipment . But it does require software incorporating RLNC-licensed technology to execute on both ends .
There are other interesting use cases for RLNC . It can be used to encode 4G LTE and Wi-Fi data streams in channel bonding applications , utilizing both channels simultaneously to maximize throughput to a handset or minimize the use of the more expensive LTE connection unless quality will degrade . RLNC can extend the quality of mobile data transmission at the edge of 4G LTE cells to reduce base station deployment without degrading the user experience or overloading the network with error correction congestion .
The trends to higher-performance multicore processors and parallel operations everywhere in the network and on mobile devices lends itself to an encoding scheme utilizing linear algebra and matrix equations that might not have been possible in the past .
RLNC is fascinating because early implementations and tests show it could deliver dramatic potential gains in many use cases that are emerging with the explosion of mobile , video , and the increasing complexity and scale of the internet . It 's unlikely that the approach to encoding and decoding on the internet will change en mass overnight , but targeted use cases that promise significant improvements , such as video transmission or the reliability of mobile data transmission on the edge of 4G LTE cells , will happen first .

Alexander Rossi has confirmed he has had talks with fellow American Gene Haas about driving for his F1 team when it joins the grid in 2016 .
Haas , who deferred entry for Haas Formula until 2016 in order to get the correct structure in place , has said he would prefer to form a team with an experienced driver and an American at the helm . Marussia reserve driver Rossi is confident he can do a good job as the latter .
`` I am thrilled for Haas , '' Rossi told Crash.net . `` His passion and commitment to enter F1 and bring Americans closer to the sport deserves serious respect . America is growing every year and the amount of support I receive personally is phenomenal . Americans love to have an athlete to get behind and I think having a team in the sport , particularly with someone as well known and successful as Gene would be fantastic . ''
`` We 've obviously spoken with Haas and the final step is to have an American driver in F1 that fans can support . If the opportunity comes my way and timing is right , I know I 'll be prepared and could do a good job for them . ''
Since leaving Caterham and linking up with Marussia last month there has been speculation about a senior race seat at the team next season , but Rossi says he is prepared for his debut whenever it arrives .
`` I 'm confident , prepared and very ready [ for F1 ] . Ultimately my goal is to have a full time Formula 1 seat , that 's always been pretty clear . So racing full time is certainly the target I 'm working towards . ''

Google has been rumored to be developing another high-end Chromebook for some time . Today , a new report claims to have the first image , and some more info , on this device . The report claims the Chromebook will be called the Google Pixelbook , and will be able to fold its display so it can work like a tablet in addition to a notebook .
Unfortunately , the report from Droid Life does n't have much in the way of info in terms of the Pixelbook 's hardware features . It does say it will come in a silver color and will be priced starting at $ 1,199 for 128 GB of onboard storage . The Pixelbook will also be released in a 256 GB model for $ 1,399 and in a 512 GB version for $ 1,749 .
The same report also claims that an stylus for Google 's new Chromebook will also be made available . The Pixelbook Pen will be priced around $ 99 on its own , and the story claims it will be pressure sensitive with no lag , along with tilt support . It 's unclear if Google plans to offer the Pixelbook with the pen in a bundle deal .
As with the other new Google devices that are reportedly coming soon , including the two new Pixel 2 phones , we expect the Pixelbook to be officially announced on October 4 . In the meantime , what do you think of the look of this Pixelbook ? Let us know your thoughts in the comments !

Sally Yates To Testify In Russia Hearing . Susan Rice ? Not So Much
Enlarge this image toggle caption Pete Marovich/Getty Images Pete Marovich/Getty Images
Updated at 1:30 p.m . ET
A Senate hearing Monday on Russian meddling in the 2016 election is expected to feature two powerful Washington women , one of whom will be in the room ‚Äî and one of whom will not .
Former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , both of whom served under President Barack Obama , are set to appear before South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham 's crime and terrorism subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
But Graham and his fellow Republicans also may focus heavily on former national security adviser Susan Rice , who declined to appear .
Democrats want Yates to describe what she told White House officials shortly after President Trump 's inauguration about the FBI 's investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn . Yates ' Jan. 26 meeting in the executive mansion reportedly was to notify the administration that the FBI believed Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail . He resigned weeks later .
A former member of the Obama administration says that was n't Trump 's first caution about Flynn . The former official says Obama gave then-President-elect Trump a warning about Flynn , based on his job performance as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . Flynn ran that agency for two years during the Obama administration but was fired , reportedly over management issues .
White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Obama `` made it clear that he was not a fan of Gen. Flynn 's '' but suggested that could be interpreted as `` bad blood '' motivated by Flynn 's criticisms of Obama , rather than a substantive warning .
`` If President Obama was truly concerned , why did n't he suspend Gen. Flynn 's security clearance ? '' Spicer asked at a press conference Monday .
Since his brief tenure as Trump 's national security adviser , Flynn has offered to tell his story to congressional committees in exchange for immunity from prosecution ‚Äî an offer that so far no one has accepted .
Trump fired Yates , who had continued serving into his administration before he had nominated his own attorney general , in late January over another controversy .
Graham and Republicans , however , want to ask the witnesses about how details of Flynn 's conversations , and other classified information , found their way into The Washington Post and other newspapers ahead of Trump 's inauguration .
That 's why Graham wanted Rice to be there . Republicans say the real issue in the Russia imbroglio is that she might have run a secret political snooping operation , abusing her power to view intelligence so she could spy on Trump and his aides .
Rice has denied any wrongdoing , then or now , and supporters who have viewed the classified material related to the recent surveillance case say there 's no evidence of anything illegal .
Graham and Rice have a long track record . He criticized her fiercely over her role in explaining the cause of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi , Libya , and was one of the leaders in the successful effort to block Obama 's effort to make her secretary of state .
Trump has sometimes accepted the intelligence community 's verdict that the Russian meddling took place , sometimes said its causes were unknowable , and sometimes says he believes the whole story is a smoke screen created by Democrats . He accused Obama of wiretapping him during the transition and told The New York Times he thought Rice may have committed a crime .
Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday that he hoped Yates is asked how reporters got the news about her discussions with the White House .
Spicer , asked whether Trump had any evidence to support the implication that Yates was connected to the leak , said in a press conference that the president 's tweet `` speaks for itself . ''
Republicans argue this story is really about the abuse of classified information , and partisan skirmishing along those lines sidelined the House Intelligence Committee 's inquiry into the Russian mischief , although the leaders of that panel tried to make a case last week that they 're back on track .

Yates was originally slated to appear before a House Intelligence Committee hearing that was canceled .
White House officials rejected the notion they tried to throw up a roadblock to her appearance before members of Congress . Spicer said March 28 that the administration had no objections and that he hoped Yates would testify ‚Äî as she is scheduled to do at 2:30 p.m . ET Monday .
Similar feuding complicated Rice 's involvement in Monday 's Senate subcommittee hearing . Graham wanted her to appear . But the panel 's top Democrat , Sheldon Whitehouse , did not agree to invite her , calling the Rice storyline a `` distraction . ''
Citing this `` significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses , '' an attorney for Rice wrote the subcommittee last week to say Rice would not testify . The letter was first reported by CNN .
Before that , the question of Yates ' testimony also was a sticking point . Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , told NPR he believed the Trump administration had tried to stop Yates from appearing because it feared the embarrassment she might cause .
Yates reportedly told White House Counsel Don McGahn in January that Flynn had n't told the truth about his discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition ‚Äî and that the Russians could use that knowledge to blackmail him .
Kelsey Conophy On a mission to create a new way to match employees and employers , it was fitting that Kelsey Conophy used an unusual method for recruiting her co-founder .
The 2012 Parsons School of Design Graduate was looking for someone with both technical chops and a psychology background to complement her own design and business background .
She spent some four months searching in the usual ways : networking , going to Meetups , and reaching out on various professional sites , all to no avail .
After that , Conophy took the more unusual step of posting that she was looking for a potential co-founder with that particular experience on a profile on OkCupid , the popular dating site . Shortly after , she heard from Julian Diaz , who had studied both subjects at Penn and had similar frustrations with the recruiting world .
`` Within a week of posting , I did have a few responses , some kind of sketchy . Luckily Julian Diaz responded ... we met up for dinner and hit it off , '' Conophy told us .
The pair never dated , but they did work together to create workZeit , a HR tech startup that uses data to analyze company culture . The company offers a `` cultural fingerprint analysis '' that companies can run on applicants and their own workers through in order to create better matches , based on preferences and practices related to how the company measures performance , how they motivate people , the pace of work , and the social culture .
`` Most people think companies know what their culture is , but a lot them do n't . We 've found that a lot of companies have a really hard time discussing what [ their culture is ] and finding out what they actually have , '' Conophy said .
About a year and a half into the Brooklyn startup 's existence , clients include New York area companies like Annalect and Compstak .

In recent years , Deadpool , Ant Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy have joined Batman and Superman as household names .
Anyone with a pair of eyes or ears is aware of the crushing avalanche of comic-book movies that seem to perpetually pour into the nation 's theaters . The release schedule for the next several years is fuller than a pastrami sandwich from Katz 's Deli . And they perform with a Michael Phelps-like consistency : ‚Äú The Avengers ‚Äù grossed $ 623 million at the box office , ‚Äú The Dark Knight ‚Äù grossed $ 538 million , and the second ‚Äú Avengers ‚Äù movie reached $ 459 million . That 's just domestically . Worldwide , the numbers jumped to $ 1.5 billion , $ 1 billion and $ 1.4 billion , respectively , according to Box Office Mojo .
Comic books themselves have trod a much more uneven path . According to leading comic-book sales analyst John Jackson Miller , who runs ComiChron , a blog on comic sales , unit sales of the top 300 comics were down for 15 years ‚Äî some years significantly ‚Äî after a high in 1997 .
Dovetailing unsurprisingly with the rise in movies , though , comic books have seen an increase in sales during each of the past five year . As a fitting cap , recently released sales numbers show that June was the industry 's best-selling month since December 1997 .
As explained in Vulture , there are no records of comics bought directly by consumers . Instead , Miller and others track the number of units bought by retailers , in anticipation for demand . Some of those units may never be sold to actual readers .
The system is n't perfect , but it 's the best we 've got .
With that in mind , retailers purchased 8.5 million copies of the top 300 comics , the highest number since December 1997 , when retailers ordered about 9 million comics , Vulture reported .
That 's a 42 percent increase from five years ago this month , and a 56 percent increase from 15 years ago this month , Miller wrote on his blog .
Much of the increase comes from the releases of the first issues of two major comics ‚Äî Marvel 's ‚Äú Civil War II No . 1 ‚Äù and DC 's ‚Äú Batman No . 1. ‚Äù Retailers bought 381,737 copies of the former and 280,360 copies of the latter , IGN reported .
These high-profile releases certainly boosted sales numbers , but there are likely many factors in play in the increased popularity in comics .
For one , comic books are more accessible than ever before , partially because of the Internet . Comics , previously purchased at newsstands or in dedicated comic-book stores , can easily be bought and , in some cases , even read digitally ‚Äî a trend that digital giants have noticed . In 2014 , Amazon bought ComiXology , the largest digital comics platform , which sold more than 4 billion pages of comics in 2013 , Wired reported . In fact , from 2012 to 2013 , digital comic sales rose from $ 70 million to $ 90 million , according to the New York Times .
Meanwhile , the number of brick-and-mortar comic-book shops has also risen in recent years , their numbers growing by 4 percent in 2013 , according to Publishers Weekly .
Second , the aforementioned hyper-popular films ‚Äî Marvel 's ‚Äú Avengers ‚Äù is the most successful franchise in box-office history ‚Äî work as a sort of Trojan horse , sneaking comic-book stories into the mainstream . The movies generate interest in their print counterparts , allowing the latter to reach more ( and more diverse ) readers .

Milton Griepp , chief executive of the pop culture blog ICv2 , told Business Insider in 2014 , ‚Äú The movies have helped expand the audience beyond the core young adult male demographic to include females of similar ages , as well as older and younger readers . ‚Äù
Augie De Blieck Jr. , a columnist at Comic Book Resources , agreed that comics have a more diverse readership , though he still thinks that readership is not being catered to enough .
‚Äú With the boom in movie and television superheroes , there 's an audience out there that craves this superhero material now , ‚Äù Blieck told CNBC . ‚Äú Those people are n't always being marketed to , like children , women and ‚Äò insert your favorite ethnic minority in the United States here . ' ‚Äù
Finally , the genre is attracting outside talent to write its comic books .
Atlantic magazine writer and social critic Ta-Nehisi Coates followed up his National Book Award-winning ‚Äú Between the World and Me ‚Äù not with another biting , controversial tome but with a comic book . Coates , a longtime comic fan , wrote an 11-issue run of ‚Äú Black Panther. ‚Äù The Black Panther character , which debuted in 1966 , was the first mainstream black comic-book superhero .
[ Ta-Nehisi Coates 's new Black Panther comic provides a debut fit for a king ]
‚Äú I loved Marvel all my life . As a young person , it was basically one of the first places I really learned to think about writing , ‚Äù Coates said in an interview with the Atlantic . ‚Äú So any opportunity to think about writing for Marvel , I just could n't turn it down . ‚Äù
He continued , saying that part of the appeal of comics for him were the escapism they provided .
‚Äú I think if you 're like a young man in West Baltimore , and all around you is a considerable amount of powerlessness , you probably have an attraction to people with power , ‚Äù Coates said . ‚Äú I could lose myself for long periods of time with comic books . ‚Äù
So far , his run has certainly elevated the character , and the attention it has garnered arguably raised the profile of comics in general . ‚Äú Black Panther No . 1 , ‚Äù the first issue in his series , had sold 253,000 copies in April , making it the best-selling comic of the year at the time .
‚Äú There have been many Black Panther series over the years from Marvel , but the title has never been one to appear near the top of the sales charts , ‚Äù Miller wrote .
The record-setting sales in June might not be sustainable . As Vulture noted , first issues tend to sell far more than its sequels ( as witnessed by the drop-off in sales for ‚Äú Black Panther ‚Äù ) .
Still , comic-book fans can breathe a bit more easily knowing the trend of rising sales from the past five years appears to be continuing .
Successfully Learning English : Year 5 represents , probably , the end of an edutainment era . Across DSiWare and WiiWare , Freddy the Vampire has appeared in over 20 titles covering a few different subjects in relentless detail for young pupils , all with the same style , structure and bland presentation . The final part of the Wii 's entries in the Learning English series has arrived , and the final bell is about to ring . We 'd like to say we 're disappointed , but that would be something of a lie .
Much of what follows feels like a repeat of what 's come before - partly because it is . Due to the series ' legacy as a smaller group of retail Wii discs in mainland Europe , these downloads often bring with them a heavy dose of deja-vu , with constantly re-used assets looping ad infinitum . As we 've said before , Tivola has n't fixed something that is n't broken in terms of what this download delivers : pupils are gently guided through themed exercises and given a grade of one to three stars ; the more stars the more play time in the bonus game , simple but effective .
The ten categories on offer are the same as those seen in the previous three entries in this particular series , covering topics such as Where I Live , Animals and School . All do the job , with the curriculum showing the now-standard quirks and silly moments , such as a real bear being represented by a picture of a teddy bear , and strange `` odd-one-out '' examples and explanations such as `` standing straight is not something you do every day '' . Last we checked , it was .
Those eccentricities aside the educational material seems solid and , undoubtedly , represents a genuine step up from the previous entry . In fact we had to engage our brains , albeit in a limited sense , with some early questions that involved reading the time from old-school clocks ; no digital time nonsense here . Pupils need to use a little more logic than before , while filling gaps into sentences correctly and generally showing a stronger grasp of basic words and phrases .
Pupils that do well get time in the bonus game , which is easily the most fiendish we 've seen in the series . In principle it looks simple as you move a ball in four directions to reach a portal , but the mazes to navigate , and the fact that momentum in each move is only halted by walls , mean that only one route will work and will take a bit of figuring out . After grinding through the lessons we genuinely found ourselves scratching our heads in some of the earliest levels , with a lot of trial and error needed . In truth this is likely to be too difficult for young children on their own , but will be a perfect challenge with an adult helping out .
In terms of the audio-visual presentation the complaints remain the same : the interface is uninspiring but competent , and truly lacking in imagination . Should Tivola work on further educational downloads on 3DS or Wii U we hope that , rather than break up a cohesive retail package into multiple parts , more stimulating themes and styles will be incorporated . Working through lessons is pleasant enough , but it 's certainly not enjoyable or interesting .
‚Äú The test of first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function ‚Äù - F. Scott Fitzgerald
At some point this year , amid news of heated Twitter disputes , ‚Äú sinister ‚Äù interviews and that too-good-to-be-true tracklist , it became pertinent again to ask the question : just who the hell is Lana Del Rey ? She is perhaps the most divisive artist of 2014 ; and yet for all the hearsay about lip surgeries , millionaire fathers and teenage alcohol addictions , we know surprisingly little about the twenty-eight year old starlett . Elizabeth Grant adopted the moniker of Lana Del Rey before the rollout of Born to Die , which dropped hot on the heels of the ‚Äú Video Games ‚Äù viral marketing smash . The video 's drunken collage of retro images gave us only a glimpse of what was to come : six smash singles , plenty of expensive music videos ( including the 27-minute ego/drug trip Tropico ) and heated accusations of anti-feminism . But three years later , as Ultraviolence rakes in the album sales , we still know very little about this lonesome Lolita . Del Rey only shrouds herself more in the vaporous veil of Ultraviolence , a dark departure from even her own bleak past . The record itself is a triumph , a modern portrait of beatnik American womanhood ; one that tactfully weaves narratives of lust and adoration , confidence and ambition into an abyss of disappointment , disloyalty , obsession and heartbreak . Were you were expecting a happy ending ? Then you have n't been paying attention .
If Ultraviolence is the tearful swansong , then Born to Die was the Vegas strip premiere ; grand in spectacle , dripping with pouty elegance and a sassy savoir-faire . The juxtaposition of 50 's and 60 's lounge acts with the swagger of modern hip-hop was refreshing , often smart and compelling . Still , the record could n't escape the nagging impression of being a well-intentioned farce . The high expectations set by the dark , evocative yearning of 2011 's viral to hit ‚Äú Video Games ‚Äù could only detract from Born To Die 's modish , even trendy fixation on Golden Age Hollywood . The follow-up Paradise EP decently fleshed out the poetry of Lana 's ‚Äú misunderstood mistress ‚Äù persona , but begged further questions : where is the appeal in living a fantasy that 's doomed to perpetual tragedy ? Why worship the flawed icons of bygone eras when Beyonce and Katy Perry are living the life of the flawless , the Roar-ing immortals of today 's Femi-nation ?

On Ultraviolence , Lana Del Rey does n't seek to answer those questions so much as flesh out the complex characters in her world . Her men treat her like royalty and pray to God for peace ; meanwhile , they 're shooting up and planning their next booty call . Lana herself wrests between profound pain and pleasure , desiring only the freedom to exist in that perilous limbo . Her temperance swings between brazen bravado and forlorn naivet√© , often many times within a song . In spite of the persistent criticism she receives regarding her apparent lack of musical talent , Del Rey has frequently displayed a keen understanding of America 's unrealistic idealism concerning women . The entirety of Ultraviolence asks ugly questions , and begets uglier answers : if he hits you and it feels like a kiss , is anyone in the wrong ? What if a woman acknowledges and still rejects those feminists who tell her what she is supposed to be , supposed to want ? Only ‚Äú Young and Beautiful ‚Äù from last year 's Great Gatsby soundtrack and ‚Äú Video Games ‚Äù before it managed to expose the kind of saddened pathos lurking behind the veiled logos of Lana Del Rey 's ambiguous nature . Finally we have an entire record of defeated optimism and desperately blind love . Like the woman herself , Ultraviolence is broken and dejected , often confused and contradictory . She 's finally allowed herself to feel the misery of getting exactly what she wants , and we are spoiled because of it .
If you ca n't tell by now , Ultraviolence is sad to its core . ( Music bloggers have already coined the term ‚Äú Hollywood Sadcore ‚Äù to describe Lana 's work . I 'm not so eager to embarrass myself . ) Comically titled tracks like ‚Äú Sad Girl ‚Äù and ‚Äú Cruel World ‚Äù at least live up to their namesakes ; the latter opens the album with a lonely , mournful guitar as Lana confesses : ‚Äú I shared my body and my mind with you/ That 's all over now. ‚Äù She repeats the line ‚Äú you 're crazy for me ‚Äù as if she is assuring herself of the fact . She tackles her feminist haters head-on with the first lines of ‚Äú Sad Girl , ‚Äù basking in the pleasure of being a ‚Äú mistress on the side. ‚Äù Critics who stuck around after the controversy of the ‚Äú Ride ‚Äù music video will surely take up arms against ‚Äú Shades of Cool , ‚Äù whose blue-eyed immortal Lana exalts as ‚Äú unfixable. ‚Äù At one point a fiery guitar solo drowns out her accusations aimed at a neglectful lover , as though burying any defiant thoughts might save her from loneliness . ‚Äú Fucked My Way Up To The Top ‚Äù is delightfully droll , a nonchalant call to the snobs who think that everyone wants dignity . A heart-wrenching cover of Nina Simone 's ‚Äú The Other Woman ‚Äù closes the record , and paints Del Rey a vain spectre in silk , dying for a mere sideglance look of approval .
Ultraviolence mostly ditches the hip-hop verse stylings of Born to Die in favor of a bluesier , midtempo drone . The beat often drops out completely , giving the record a dreaded sense of isolation . Indeed , if Born To Die was all flashing lights and dazzling audiences , Ultraviolence could be sung in a dark , smoke-filled bar for a faceless crowd . Her jazzy low register is more confident and emotive than ever , and her pained wails raise each chorus to devastating new heights . She takes cues from jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Nina Simone ( whom she considers her favorite singers ) while bringing her own brand of breathy , sensuous slink to the mix . The marked transition from baroque pop to melancholy blues is owed almost entirely to producer Dan Auerbach , who completely reworked the album with Del Rey back in December . The dark grooves of live studio drums combined with Auerbach 's melancholy guitar gives Ultraviolence an eerie ambience comparable to the monochrome cinema it was inspired by . The flowery strumming and thumping kicks in ‚Äú Brooklyn Baby ‚Äù is like a wash of golden light , and elevates what is perhaps the only optimistic tune of the bunch . Of course there is still ‚Äú West Coast , ‚Äù a sunburnt beach anthem that would fit nicely in the next Bond flick . This song 's otherworldly swagger is hypnotizing , made all the more masterful by the downtempo shift into reverb-soaked heaven just a minute in . It positively oozes with cool , finally making good on Del Rey 's oft-promised dark paradise .

Lyrical nods to her inspirations are more subtle this time around , allowing us to more clearly explore her fascination with that unattainable status of American legend . ( Even if Lana Del Rey does n't want to die , she 's at least entertained the thought . ) Ultraviolence sees her finally forgoing the tired hero worship in order to take up the mantle herself ; like the gods in her own short film Tropico ( who include John Wayne , Elvis Presley and Jesus ) she seems suspended in time , hovering above the world of man 's sins , neither a part of it nor ignorant to its ills . Her divine beauty is both her weapon and her crux ; it allows her to occupy the moment , but always for another . It 's difficult to relate to such notions of fame and financial freedom , when the simple response to all this would seem to be ‚Äú just get over it. ‚Äù Yet the real charm of Lana Del Rey has always been in her complex sadness . Her allure is in her ambiguity , that sexually-charged indecisive nature that keeps us all from getting what we want . A song like ‚Äú Old Money ‚Äù seems to give finality to the matter by portraying money and sadness as one and the same . Do we really think it 's enough to have it all when there 's no one to share it with ? Lana Del Rey may seem foolish , but that just means that Fitzgerald was right all along .
So is Del Rey finally the serious artist that she so craves to be , or , as quoted previously from Dan Auerbach himself , a ‚Äú flash in the pan ? ‚Äù Consider how many other female pop artists have gained both chart success and critical acclaim solely from torch ballads . Six chart-toppers ( if you count that Cedric Gervais swill ) and a few hundred million Youtube views do n't lie : the world loves her . But how much of that popularity goes beyond the stylish aesthetic of her music videos , the department store branding , or that godawful ‚Äú Summertime Sadness ‚Äù remix ? By now her fandom is unquestionable ; and yet , I think it took a divisive album like Ultraviolence to show the world just how gracefully she could ( always ) navigate complex , sophisticated themes . Like fellow pop contemporary Lorde , Lana Del Rey strikes me as a devoted artist who got caught up in the creative suckhole that is viral media marketing . The bleak sadness of Ultraviolence seems to stem from a disillusionment with superstardom , to being subjected to constant invasions of privacy and a barrage of baseless criticism . One of many poignant moments in Ultraviolence is a paraphrased diary entry from the late Marilyn Monroe : ‚Äú They judge me like a picture book/ By the colors , like they forgot to read. ‚Äù It is an uncomfortable truth that we romanticize dead icons , exalting them to impossible standards that they could n't have realistically lived up to . Ultraviolence seems to ask : ‚Äú Was it Cobain who pulled the trigger , or the world ? ‚Äù The name itself seems a double entendre for an unseen kind of violence , our collective grip that strangles all the same . Perhaps it really is lonely at the top . Ultraviolence insists that we are n't any closer to understanding Lana Del Rey , but that we may just save her yet . 9/10
A man by the name of Vinny Ohh from Los Angeles , California has reportedly spent $ 50,000 on over 110 procedures intended to transform him into a genderless alien .
He 's prepared to spend another $ 160,000 to further fund his dream .
According to the Daily Mail , Ohh ‚Äì a makeup artist ‚Äì believes he is neither male nor female and , as such , is having his genitals removed .
He is also getting rid of his nipples and belly button and wears black contact lenses .
‚Äú I want to be a sexless alien being , ‚Äù he says . ‚Äú I want my outside to reflect how I feel . ‚Äù
‚Äú I do n't want people to think I 'm trying to change into a woman . I could live without sexual organs so why should I have a penis or a vagina . ‚Äù
Ohh ‚Äì now 22 ‚Äì reportedly began getting facial fillers at the age of 17 and went on to have two rhinoplasties as well as several cheek and brow bone fillers .
‚Äú I do kind of look like a martian , I have a really big head , no eyebrows and I 've just been connecting with that , ‚Äù he says .
Ohh also says he labels himself as an ‚Äú extra-terrestrial , hot mess , self-obsessed ‚Äù creature .
Oh , and he dresses like this .
‚Äú I do n't look real and people love it , ‚Äù he declares . ‚Äú Some people have said they want their kids to be like me and that I 'm an inspiration for children who feel like they do n't belong . ‚Äù
Ohh is reportedly going to appear on The Plastics of Hollywood ‚Äì a reality show featuring plastic surgery addicts and their attempts at fame .
Marcela Iglesias , the show 's producer , predicts , ‚Äú Vinny is an alien new generation of people who want to look different . In 15 years , hundreds of people will want to look like him . ‚Äù
He has already been featured on E ! Entertainment .
A Microsoft spokesman has told WinRumors that the minor update that started shipping on Monday has been suspended for Samsung handsets after many users reported that it failed to install , and in some cases bricked their phones .
So far , it appears that the update has n't actually been taken down ; owners of Samsung handsets that have been notified of the update are reporting that they are still able to attempt to install it . One possible explanation is that Microsoft has stopped sending out new update notifications , but left existing ones intact .
While exact numbers are hard to come by , the withdrawal of the update is an indication that the problems are no mere isolated incidents . Reports of the update failing to install ( but not damaging the phone ) are widespread , and there are numerous reports both on Microsoft 's support forum and Twitter ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) of outright bricking . Both the Omnia 7 and Focus handsets are confirmed to be affected .
Susceptibility to the problem , as well as the extent of the damage caused , both appear to have some dependence on the firmware version used on the handset . Samsung has released several different firmware versions for the Omnia 7 , and while the newest versions seem to generally work fine , certain older ones do not . These firmware issues might also be compounded by bugs in the Samsung bootloader ; phones with version 4.10.1.9 of the bootloader apparently can not switch into download mode , which is used to recover from bad flashes . Both newer and older bootloaders are fine .
Whatever the cause , this is something that needs to be fixed soon . The first `` real '' feature patch will be shipping shortly , and because all Windows Phone 7 updates will be cumulative , it will include the current problematic patch within it . There 's no getting around the problem .
‚Äú Yesterday was a great day for the women of Saskatchewan , ‚Äù the Feb. 15 , 1916 , issue of the Regina Morning Leader proclaimed .
At the time , the Dominion Elections Act , which dictated how provincial elections were run , stipulated ‚Äú No woman , idiot , lunatic or criminal shall vote. ‚Äù On Valentine 's Day 100 years ago , the government decided it was time that change .
‚Äú It was the end of one phase of the struggle of women to be recognized as the equal of man in the matter of the franchise , ‚Äù the Morning Leader reported . ‚Äú It marked the opening of bigger responsibilities , greater tasks in the struggle for the victory of the highest ideals in the home and in the state . ‚Äù
On March 14 , 1916 , Saskatchewan women were officially granted the vote through royal assent , making the province the second to extend the franchise after Manitoba .
Prove you want it
The struggle for suffrage in Saskatchewan was a relatively short one , punctuated by repeated proclamations of support by a provincial government that insisted enfranchisement would n't happen until women proved they actually wanted the vote .
In December 1912 , MLA J. Bradshaw introduced his first resolution to extend the franchise to women . It passed . Only one member dissented . But it did n't happen .
Minister of Agriculture W.R. Motherwell said , ‚Äú when the time arrives at which any considerable number of women approach this government urging the extension of the franchise to women , their case will receive very favourable and just consideration at the hands of the government . ‚Äù
So would begin a four-year-long trend of passed resolutions , publicly stated support for suffrage , reams of petitions , throngs of delegations and , yet , a hesitation from government to actually grant the vote .
‚Äú It just was n't important to the government at the time , ‚Äù says Donica Belisle , an assistant professor of history at the University of Regina .
Thus , the fight for suffrage in Saskatchewan became more of a niggling battle in the legislature than one in the public sphere . Residents ' opposition to women 's voting rights was minimal . Christine MacDonald in her piece ‚Äú How Saskatchewan Women Got the Vote ‚Äù writes ‚Äú while a few prairie dwellers were definitely opposed , many more were simply indifferent to women 's suffrage . ‚Äù
The suffrage movement in Saskatchewan is considered to have taken place from 1911 to 1916 , a time when the province 's some 275,000 women were lacking more than the right to vote . They could n't claim a homestead unless they were a widow with dependent children . They could n't name a guardian for their children unless they were a single mother . They could n't serve on a jury .
That 's why , MacDonald argues , the franchise was seen by many women as a ‚Äú prerequisite ‚Äù to achieve other rights , not an end in itself . And it was a struggle largely borne , at least in the early stages , by rural women .
The rural connection
June Menzies posits in ‚Äú Votes for Saskatchewan 's Women ‚Äù that one of the first signs of the suffrage movement ‚Äî and surely of the rural thrust that would prove pivotal to its success ‚Äî came in a poll conducted by the Grain Growers ' Guide in January 1912 . Few people replied , but a month later the Saskatchewan Grain Growers ' Association , an all-male organization , passed a resolution to support women 's suffrage .
Belisle says rural support for suffrage is evident in how Canada 's prairie provinces and ones in the western United States were the first to grant women the vote . She says that an urban-rural power struggle had developed , and farmers were looking to increase the strength of the rural vote in support of agrarian initiatives .
Enter Violet McNaughton , the woman whose name would become synonymous with the suffrage movement in Saskatchewan .
A farmer 's wife , McNaughton became a tour de force when she teamed up with Grain Growers ' Guide 's editor Francis Marion Beynon . In early 1913 , Beynon published an editorial rallying women to organize around suffrage , write to the premier and sign petitions . A petition campaign organized by McNaughton and sponsored by the Grain Growers ' Association followed .
Despite these efforts , the reaction from government echoed that of 1912 .
In December 1913 , Bradshaw introduced a second resolution for women 's suffrage , which was carried . Premier Thomas Walter Scott had received 170 letters and more than 100 petitions with 2,500 signatures . ‚Äú Such a number , however , could not be considered as representative of the women of the province as a whole , ‚Äù the Morning Leader reported .
The article said the premier ‚Äú did not think that the time was ripe for woman 's suffrage ‚Äù but ‚Äú could see no reason why women should not vote as soon as they showed themselves ready to do so . ‚Äù
Of mothers and liquor
If rural support was one element of suffrage 's success in Saskatchewan , another was religion and the province 's social conservatism , says Belisle .
At that time , white women were increasingly being seen as moral exemplars or ‚Äú mothers of the race , ‚Äù she says . So-called ‚Äú maternal feminism ‚Äù emerged , arguing that since women are mothers , they are more moral and therefore could clean up politics , Belisle explains . This branch of feminism was ‚Äú more palatable , ‚Äù she says , than its counterpart , equal rights feminism .
That 's where prohibition comes into play . To Banish the Bar movement had been growing alongside the suffrage one . It called for the outlawing of open bars in Saskatchewan . Temperance organizations began to push the government to allow women to vote in a referendum on the matter .
They ended up , some historians argue , inadvertently becoming one of the strongest advocates for suffrage as a whole . Meanwhile one group , the Women 's Christian Temperance Union , purposely adopted a key role in the fight for the vote .
Not to be forgotten is women 's involvement at home in First World War , an argument cited in a number of publications at the time . But Belisle says she does n't find that connection ‚Äú entirely fair because I think it 's more complex than that . ‚Äù
More important was the spread of the suffrage movement to urban areas .
The vote finally granted
In the second half of the suffrage movement , urban women got involved , adding critical mass to the campaign .
Political equality leagues popped up first in Moosomin , then Prince Albert and Battleford . McNaughton headed up a new Women 's Grain Growers ' Association and partnered with the Women 's Christian Temperance Union to connect the urban and rural factions of the suffrage movement . In early 1915 , the Provincial Equal Franchise Board met for the first time .
In May 1915 , 100 women armed with more than 10,000 signatures descended upon the legislature to reiterate their demand . ‚Äú You have demonstrated to our Legislative Assembly ‚Ä¶ that the adoption of equal suffrage will not lessen but will greatly augment the standard of effectiveness and eloquence in debate on the floor of the House , ‚Äù the premier told the delegates . But , on their question of suffrage , he would have to think on it .
Married female property owners did get the right to vote in civic elections that year , though .
Then , in January 1916 , Manitoba granted the franchise to women . That same month , in the speech from the throne , Saskatchewan 's lieutenant-governor hinted women might be granted the vote that session . Belisle and Menzies argue Saskatchewan was falling over itself to nab second place .
It was n't either long until that fateful Valentine 's Day came around . Addressing the House , Mrs. C.O . Davidson of the Regina Equal Franchise League joked , ‚Äú you do n't want petitions anymore . The world is full of petitions and no one pays any attention to them . It is n't as if we were strangers , who were asking this of you . We are your mothers , your sisters and your wives , and we ask you to honour us as we deserve . ‚Äù
And so it was . The decision announced , the premier cautioned , ‚Äú If you keep in mind the supreme importance of the step you ask and the responsibility you are now undertaking , I am inclined to think instead of any lightheartedness you will feel it is the time for serious consideration of these responsibilities . ‚Äù
To that , Mrs. Lawton , head of the Provincial Equal Suffrage Board , replied , ‚Äú we know the responsibility it carries . We must now ask that the women will study to do that which is right for our country and homes . Our consciences are clear . ‚Äù
Who got left behind
‚Äú As Saskatchewan women we owe a lot to the women in the past who worked so hard on this , ‚Äù says Saskatchewan Lt.-Gov . Vaughn Solomon Schofield , who is hosting an anniversary celebration featuring Kim Campbell ‚Äî Canada 's only female prime minister ‚Äî on Monday . Government House is also putting on an exhibit on suffrage beginning the same day .
MLA Laura Ross shares Schofield 's gratitude : ‚Äú I 've very thankful for those women . Because of them , I have the opportunity to sit in the House here and participate fully . ‚Äù
But Belisle cautions against celebrating this centennial .
‚Äú I think what 's often left out of these discussions is the issue of race , and it should be remembered that Chinese people and aboriginal people were n't allowed to vote in Saskatchewan during this time , ‚Äù she says .
‚Äú Historians used to take a more celebratory approach to the history of suffrage , but I think now it 's hopefully more recognized that suffrage is kind of a privilege that 's bestowed by the state to different groups depending on who is seen as exempt and who is seen as acceptable . ‚Äù
Winona Wheeler , an associate professor of indigenous studies at the University of Saskatchewan , agrees : ‚Äú I think it 's a historical event worthy of recognition and commemoration by those who reap the benefits of it . ‚Äù
First Nations people were not granted the vote in Saskatchewan until after it occurred at the federal level , in 1960 .
Wheeler notes indigenous women were not part of the suffrage movement here , and that the ‚Äú franchise has really negative connotations in our historical experience , so we do n't use the language and we do n't celebrate that language. ‚Äù The vote was seen by some as an element of assimilation , she says .
Schofield and Ross do n't want to dismiss the importance of the anniversary as quickly as Belisle , though .
‚Äú The achievement of getting the women 's vote in Saskatchewan in 1916 was remarkable , but was really the first step ‚Äî an important first step ‚Äî on a long journey of achieving equality for all peoples in Canada , ‚Äù says the lieutenant-governor .
Meanwhile , Ross says , ‚Äú I 'm going to focus in on celebrating the opportunity for women to get the vote , because we could always look at ‚Äò What about them ? ' And , yes , that 's ( indigenous people not getting the vote ) very significant , but I think let 's celebrate the challenges and the good things that did happen , then , and not take anything away from what those women worked hard to accomplish . ‚Äù
Wheeler , though , wants to leave people with this thought : ‚Äú the women 's rights movement that grew out of suffrage movement was not inclusive. ‚Äù And it wo n't be , she says , until it ‚Äú recognizes its own privilege . ‚Äù
After the vote
Not only was suffrage exclusive , it also did n't quite garner the results some had hoped .
Women in Saskatchewan had their first opportunity to vote in December 1916 , in a referendum on the abolition of liquor stores .
While women tended to vote together on that issue , the opposite was true in the 1917 provincial election , writes Elizabeth Kalmakoff in ‚Äú Naturally Divided. ‚Äù The election ‚Äú divided women along political lines just as it divided men , making a mockery of the idea of gender unity , ‚Äù she writes .
Over the next few years , the women 's movement in Saskatchewan became increasingly fractured , she says . ‚Äú The political differences among the suffragists , the entrenched structure of the political parties and the divisions in Saskatchewan society combined to ensure that women would not quickly wield political power . ‚Äù
In the 1917 election , Zoa Haight became the first woman to run for provincial office , but lost . Two years later , Sarah Ramsland became the province 's first female MLA , winning a byelection after her husband 's death .
Progress since then , though , has been slow , something Schofield is swift to point out .
‚Äú We 're a hundred years later and unfortunately it 's still very hard for political parties to get women to run for office , ‚Äù she says .
She advises Saskatchewan women not to take the right to vote for granted : Keep the momentum going .

Introduction
As international oil companies turn away from large and expensive oil projects in favour of other developments , there is increasing interest in natural gas . In Europe , there is particular interest in schemes aimed at supplying the UK , where the phasing-out of coal from the electricity generating mix , combined with falling British production of gas , provides an opportunity to develop a number of new gas production schemes .
In 2015 , the British government announced that it would phase out coal-fired electricity generation by 2025 . Last year , it accounted for about 9 % of UK generation and this year 's total could well be lower , with about 40 % of the UK 's power now comes from gas . A number of nuclear reactors are also due to be decommissioned between now and 2030 . Part of the loss of coal and nuclear capacity will have to be made-up from more gas generation . The UK , however , is a net importer of gas and its production is in long-term natural decline .
Power dynamics
The UK 's decision to phase out coal-fired power by 2025 has elevated the importance of gas in its energy matrix . The elimination of coal means gas will be the only base-load conventional power option available to act as a backup to the country 's sizeable renewable fleet .
Gas-fired generation will also enjoy a favourable position in future UK power capacity auctions , in which renewable energy suppliers might not participate .
Shifting dynamics in the nuclear power sector could also be a win for gas . If Hinkley Point is scaled back or delayed , gas fired capacity would be likely to step in and make up in generating shortfall .
Brexit
The UK 's decision to exit the EU in a referendum in May 2016 is also likely to have an impact on demand . The flow from mainland Europe is vital for balancing the British market , especially as UK North Sea output falls and low prices and political wavering deter extensive exploitation of shale reserves .
However , the UK can no longer assume that gas supply will be guaranteed via the UK-Belgium Interconnector ( IUK ) post-Brexit , and even if it was , new tariffs or pricing formulas would most likely have to be applied .
The solutions to the problems posed by the status of IUK are twofold . First , the UK could build more gas storage capacity . Second , it could look to import more LNG .
In practice , it is likely that both will happen . Until now , gas storage has largely been a secondary part of the market , mainly owing to the safety net provided by IUK . But with the risk that the inter-connector might not be as reliable in future , gas storage has become a more strategic concern .
New Gas supplies
Some of the additional flows could also come from waters off the UK , where there is some potential for new finds in the underexplored area to the west of the Shetland Islands ; but the chances of a really large find there at present look slim . The UK is therefore going to require increasing volumes of imports .
One possible supplier , perhaps on a large scale , is Russia ; but any additional Russian supplies would have to come via the pipeline systems of the EU , and it is not clear what form of energy relationship the UK will have with the EU once it has left it . A further complication is the bad political relations between the EU and Russia over Ukraine , added to which is the stated desire of the EU 's Commission to reduce the role of Russia in the EU 's energy mix . One way in which this could affect increasing imports of Russian gas by the UK is if the UK wanted to take gas from the proposed Nord Stream 2 pipeline .
EU opposition
The plans for Nord Stream 2 have aroused opposition from several EU members in Eastern Europe , particularly Poland , which want the EU to reduce its reliance on Russian imports . In this they have the backing of the EU Commission , which has sought to ban the pipeline on the grounds that it would be contrary to the rules of the EU 's internal energy market by preventing the EU from diversifying its sources of supply .
Nord Stream 2 continues to be backed by countries further west , including Germany , where the country 's energy regulator has recently ruled that the line is not subject to the EU 's energy laws . It had earlier been proposed that the UK would take gas from Nord Stream 2 via existing pipelines crossing Germany and the Netherlands . At present , though , the fate of the scheme is uncertain , and in a recent move , the Danish government has indicated that it has reservations about the pipeline .
Is Norway the answer ?
All of this could prompt the UK to look elsewhere for additional supplies of gas , and one likely source is Norway , which has the triple advantage of being close at hand , of having existing pipeline connections with the UK , and of not being in the EU . Norway has the largest proven reserves in Western Europe as well as being the largest exporter .
Norway 's production , however , is almost certainly at its peak . Some of its older fields are already in decline and , while several new ones are due on-stream in the near future , more will be needed , especially after 2020 . These are likely to be remote and high cost fields in Arctic waters , such as the Barents and Norwegian Seas , and they may do little more than prolong the present plateau in Norwegian output .
In that case , the Nord Stream 2 project may yet have an important part to play if the UK is to increase its off-take from Norway . Some of Norway 's other European customers will have to import more Russian gas in order to allow the Norwegians to sell more to the UK : a development that the EU Commission will not exactly be enthusiastic to see .

Roy Hodgson has dismissed concerns about Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere smoking a shisha pipe by revealing that he has tried the hookah himself and found it left him with nothing more than ‚Äú a faint fruity taste in the mouth ‚Äù .
The England manager , 67 , was speaking for the first time since the long winter break for international football and addressed a number of topics , including the drink-driving conviction for the West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino .

A picture posted this month on Instagram of Wilshere in a London club caught the injured player with a shisha pipe in his hand , the third time in the last two years he has either been photographed smoking or with the means to do so . Hodgson will pick his squad later this month for March 's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and friendly against Italy in Turin .
Asked about the incident , the England manager said : ‚Äú I thought tobacco was smoking and shisha pipes were water with flavour. ‚Äù He said he was unclear on whether nicotine was involved .
‚Äú Well , you are blowing in and you 're blowing out . As an ex-cigar smoker , when I tried it [ shisha ] I thought it was a complete nonsense , I could n't understand who would do it . Apart from a faint fruity taste in your mouth that was about the end of it .
‚Äú As far as I am concerned that is a club matter and Ars√®ne [ Wenger ] dealt with it very , very well . If you are asking me , in an ideal world , is that an ideal thing to happen ? Of course it is n't but we do n't live in an ideal world . I am happy it has been dealt with and it wo n't occupy a lot of my time with Jack when I see him because we have a football match to win . ‚Äù
The British Heart Foundation has warned that smoking shisha could be as dangerous as smoking cigarettes , potentially even more so . In a warning , the BHF said : ‚Äú The average shisha-smoking session lasts an hour and research has shown that in this time you can inhale the same amount of smoke as from more than 100 cigarettes . ‚Äù
Wilshere has been back in full training this week and is expected to be in the Arsenal squad to face Middlesbrough on Sunday in the FA Cup fifth round .
Hodgson also revealed that Berahino , 21 , who pleaded guilty to drink-driving last month , was contacted by the Football Association and reminded of his responsibilities as an England footballer by Dan Ashworth , the FA 's technical director . Berahino , a key player for the Under-21s , was selected in Hodgson 's last senior squad but is yet to make his senior debut .
Hodgson said : ‚Äú It 's been dealt with . He [ Berahino ] has been reprimanded and as far as we are concerned the matter is closed . It is up to him to put that behind him and show with his future behaviour that he has taken the reprimand on board . ‚Äù

The Supreme Court is back in action this week , and on Wednesday it will hear arguments in a trio of cases involving the Environmental Protection Agency and its regulation of power plant pollutants . ( The cases are being rolled together and heard in 90 minutes of oral argument , rather than the usual 60 . ) Before we lift up the robes to look for some data , here 's a bit of background on the case .
The Case
This suite of cases is a challenge to how the EPA regulates pollutants from power plants . Here 's the question before the court : ‚Äú Whether the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities . ‚Äù
Essentially , what the petitioners ‚Äî mainly Republican-led states and industry groups ‚Äî claim is that the EPA , unlawfully , did not perform the ‚Äú cost ‚Äù part of a cost-benefit analysis . In its petition for a writ of certiorari , the National Mining Association wrote , ‚Äú No rational person would see spending $ 9.6 billion for $ 4-6 million in return as an appropriate exchange . ‚Äù
On the other side , the respondents ‚Äî the federal government and some allied groups ‚Äî argue that the EPA took costs into account properly . Specifically , they argue that the relevant statutes require taking costs into account when determining the precise level of regulation to bring down on a plant , but not when determining whether or not to regulate a plant in the first place . They also argue with the petitioners ' calculations , citing huge potential benefits down the road from the elimination of toxic emissions like mercury .
Stepping back : Some see these cases as part of a series of cases that are meant to provoke the court 's suspicion of the Obama administration 's regulations . First on health care , now on environmental regulation , and perhaps in the near future on immigration .
The Combatants
It 's a counsel clown car at the court for this case , with a quartet of combatants . Arguing for the petitioners are Aaron D. Lindstrom , Michigan 's solicitor general , and F. William Brownell , a partner and Hunton & Williams . According to the Oyez Project , neither have argued before the Supreme Court before .
For the respondents , it 's U.S . Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and Paul Smith , a partner at Jenner & Block . Verrilli last argued before the court earlier this month , and did quite well , according to court watchers . This will be his 41st appearance before the court . It will be Smith 's 16th appearance . His record thus far : 7-7 ( one case is excluded here as it was ruled that certiorari was improvidently granted ) .
The Role Of The Government
Verrilli has been busy lately , and is arguing this case hot on the heels of his defense of Obamacare . He 'll be arguing , of course , on behalf of the EPA , a federal government agency .
According to the Supreme Court Database , since 1946 , petitioners ( the EPA opponents , in this case ) win 64 percent of the time . However , if the respondent is a federal government agency ( the EPA , in this case ) , the respondent wins 54 percent of the time . Your federal government hard at work !
( And if the petitioner is a federal government agency , it wins 77 percent of the time . )
The Predictions
As usual , we 'll turn to two sources : the wisdom of the FantasySCOTUS crowd and the machine learning algorithm { Marshall } + . But they wo n't tell us too much ‚Äî the predictors see the cases completely differently . As I write , the crowd views all three cases as likely affirms ‚Äî wins for the EPA ‚Äî including two 9-0 affirms . The algorithm , on the other hand , sees them all as reversals : 9-0 , 9-0 and 7-2 losses for the EPA . In Michigan v. EPA , the two are diametrically opposed , predicting 9-0 votes in opposite directions .
The crowd predictions may change , and improve , however , after the court watchers have had a chance to dissect what happens in oral argument . But for now , you might as well toss a coin .
Around 252 million years ago , life on Earth collapsed in spectacular and unprecedented fashion , as more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land species disappeared in a geological instant . The so-called end-Permian mass extinction ¬≠‚Äî or more commonly , the ‚Äú Great Dying ‚Äù ‚Äî remains the most severe extinction event in Earth 's history .
Scientists suspect that massive volcanic activity , in a large igneous province called the Siberian Traps , may have had a role in the global die-off , raising air and sea temperatures and releasing toxic amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over a very short period of time . However , it 's unclear whether magmatism was the main culprit , or simply an accessory to the mass extinction .
MIT researchers have now pinned down the timing of the magmatism , and determined that the Siberian Traps erupted at the right time , and for the right duration , to have been a likely trigger for the end-Permian extinction .
According to the group 's timeline , explosive eruptions began around 300,000 years before the start of the end-Permian extinction . Enormous amounts of lava both erupted over land and flowed beneath the surface , creating immense sheets of igneous rock in the shallow crust . The total volume of eruptions and intrusions was enough to cover a region the size of the United States in kilometer-deep magma . About two-thirds of this magma likely erupted prior to and during the period of mass extinction ; the last third erupted in the 500,000 years following the end of the extinction event . This new timeline , the researchers say , establishes the Siberian Traps as the main suspect in killing off a majority of the planet 's species .
‚Äú We now can say it 's plausible , ‚Äù says Seth Burgess , who received his PhD last year from MIT 's Department of Earth , Atmospheric , and Planetary Sciences and is now a postdoc at the U.S. Geological Survey . ‚Äú The connection is unavoidable , because it 's clear these two things were happening at the same time . ‚Äù
Burgess and Sam Bowring , the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Science at MIT , have published their results in the journal Science Advances .
A singular event
Around the time of the end-Permian extinction , scientists have found that the Earth was likely experiencing a sudden and massive disruption to the carbon cycle , abnormally high air and sea temperatures , and an increasingly acidic ocean ‚Äî all signs of a huge and rapid addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere . Whatever triggered the mass extinction , scientists reasoned , must have been powerful enough to generate enormous amounts of greenhouse gases in a short period of time .
The Siberian Traps have long been a likely contender : The large igneous province bears the remains of the largest continental volcanic event in Earth 's history .
‚Äú It 's literally a singular event in Earth history ‚Äî it 's a monster , ‚Äù Burgess says . ‚Äú It makes Yellowstone ‚Ä¶ look like the head of a pin . ‚Äù
It 's thought that as the region erupted , magma rose up through the Earth 's crust , essentially cooking sediments along the way and releasing enormous amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere .
‚Äú The question we tried to answer is , ‚Äò Which came first , mass extinction or the Siberian Traps ? What is their overall tempo , and does the timing permit magmatism to be a trigger for mass extinction ? ' ‚Äù Burgess says .
Dates pinned
For the answer , Burgess , Bowring , and colleagues traveled to Siberia on multiple occasions , beginning in 2008 , to sample rocks from the Siberian Traps . For each expedition , the team traveled by boat or plane to a small Siberian village , then boarded a helicopter to the Siberian Traps . From there , they paddled on inflatable boats down a wide river , chiseling out samples of volcanic rock along the way .
‚Äú We 'd have a couple of hundred kilos of rocks , and would go to the market in Moscow and buy 15 sport duffle bags , and in each we 'd put 10 kilos of rocks ‚Ä¶ and hope we could get them all on the plane and back to the lab , ‚Äù Burgess recalls .
Back at MIT , Burgess and Bowring dated select samples using uranium/lead geochronology , in which Bowring 's lab specializes . The team looked for tiny crystals of either zircon or perovskite , each of which contain uranium and lead , the ratios of which they can measure to calculate the rock 's age . The team dated various layers of rock to determine the beginning and end of the eruptions .
They then compared the timing of the Siberian Traps to that of the end-Permian extinction , which they had previously determined using identical techniques .
‚Äú That 's important , because we can compare green apples to green apples . If everything is done the same , there 's no bias , ‚Äù Burgess says . ‚Äú Now we 're able to say magmatism definitely preceded mass extinction , and we can resolve those two things outside of uncertainty . ‚Äù
Richard Ernst , a scientist-in-residence at Carleton University in Ottawa , Ontario , says the new timeline establishes a definitive , causal link between the Siberian Traps and the end-Permian extinction .
‚Äú This paper nails it , ‚Äù says Ernst , who was not involved in the study . ‚Äú Given that they have dated a portion of the Siberian Traps occurring just before , during , and only for a short time after the extinction , this is the ‚Äò smoking gun ' for this large igneous province being fully correlated with the extinction . At this point , additional dating and other studies will simply provide more details on the link . ‚Äù
Now that the team has resolved the beginning and end of the Siberian Traps eruptions , Burgess hopes others will take an even finer lens to the event , to determine the tempo of magmatism in the 300,000 years prior to the mass extinction .
‚Äú We do n't know if a little erupted for 250,000 years , and right before the extinction , boom , a vast amount did , or if it was more slow and steady , where the atmosphere reaches a tipping point , and across that point you have mass extinction , but before that you just have critically stressed biospheres , ‚Äù Burgess says . ‚Äú Now we 've pinned it down in time , and others can go in with other techniques to get a more fully fleshed out timeline . But we need it to start someplace , and that 's what we 've got . ‚Äù

Jerry Sloan has talked to the Milwaukee Bucks about their vacant coaching position . ( Photo : Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports )
In the category of unemployed Hall of Fame coaches , Phil Jackson has been capturing the large majority of the spotlight in recent weeks .
But while it remains to be seen if the former Lakers and Bulls coach will re-enter the NBA anytime soon , another member of this rarest of clubs may be getting closer to making his return : Jerry Sloan .
According to two people with knowledge of the situation , the former Utah Jazz coach who resigned abruptly in Feb. 2011 has already met with the Milwaukee Bucks about their vacant coaching position and is being seriously considered . The people spoke to USA TODAY Sports the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the coaching search .
JACKSON : Tells Nets he 's not interested
SUNS : Hire exciting new GM from Celtics
Sloan has been looking for a landing spot for quite some time , but he could be a tailor-made fit for a Bucks situation that has much in common with the Utah job he held for 23 years . Milwaukee 's locker room dynamic was shaky from training camp on , and the midseason departure of coach Scott Skiles and insertion of Jim Boylan as an interim did little to change the fact that the Bucks are in need of a coach who will command respect . While Sloan was reportedly being considered by the Brooklyn Nets , a reunion with former Jazz point guard Deron Williams is not on the horizon .
As was first reported by Yahoo ! Sports , a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed that the Bucks interviewed Lakers assistant Steve Clifford for the job on Monday . According to various reports , the Bucks have also interviewed former Portland coach Nate McMillan and Houston assistants Kelvin Sampson and J.B. Bickerstaff .

Microsoft said it expected another tricky quarter .
Microsoft has reported disappointing results for the April to June quarter , with profits down by almost a third .
Net profit for the period was $ 3.1bn ( ¬£1.9bn ) , down by 29 % from the same period a year earlier . Revenue came in at $ 13.1bn , down 17 % from a year ago .
The results were worse than analysts had been expecting .
The world 's largest software maker said it had been affected by weakness in the global personal computer ( PC ) and server markets .
Cost cutting
In after hours trading , Microsoft shares fell more than 7 % , reflecting the market 's disappointment with the results .
`` It looked like a pretty tough quarter for Microsoft . The top line was very weak , '' said Toan Tran at Morningstar .
The one bright spot was the company 's cost-cutting measures .
`` In light of the environment , it was an excellent achievement to deliver over $ 750m of operational savings compared with the prior year quarter , '' said Chris Liddell , Microsoft 's finance chief .
Microsoft makes most of its profit selling the Windows operating system and business software such as Office .
However , demand has been hit by falling sales of PCs as consumers and businesses trim spending .
Microsoft - which became a public company in 1986 - has been looking at ways of cutting costs .
In January , it said it would cut up to 5,000 jobs over the next 18 months , including 1,400 immediately .
Increasing pressure
To make matters worse , the company is coming under increasing pressure from internet search engine Google , which recently announced a better-than-expected rise in second quarter profits .
Google is developing an operating system for personal computers in a direct challenge to market leader Microsoft and its Windows system .
Microsoft itself is poised to launch its new operating system , Windows 7 , this autumn .
9 Questions for Mr Robot to Answer in Season 2
Cloudbric Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 9 , 2015
Warning : there are obviously spoilers ahead . Do n't proceed if you have n't finished season 1 yet .
Well‚Ä¶that was one hell of a first season . I do n't think I 've been this floored by a show since Hannibal ( RIP Hannibal‚Ä¶maybe ? ) . Creator Sam Esmail has been explicit that the whole show was planned as a feature film , and ‚Äú the ending of Season 1 is really what would have been the ending of Act 1 , ‚Äù so if this is just the start , we 're in for one hell of a journey when the main plot begins in season 2 .
Here are the unanswered questions I 'm most looking forward to in the coming season , and my own musing on the answers .
1 . What are Whiterose 's true intentions ?
Leader of the Chinese hacker group Dark Army , Whiterose was a real scene-stealer back in episode 7 . Played by the always excellent BD Wong , Whiterose is introduced as a transgendered woman who does n't have much time to give Elliot when he pleads his case for the Dark Army to re-establish their support of fsociety 's grand plan . Then , in a post-credits scene in the finale , we see Evil Corp CEO Phillip Price meeting with Whiterose , dressed as a man at a lavish house party . What 's up with that ? Is Evil Corp in league with the Dark Army ?
We know thanks to a very detailed interview with Wong that Whiterose is being played to be in disguise as a man , and as her true self as a woman . So Elliot has met the real Whiterose , while Price may have not . So , what is the true relationship between Evil Corp , the Dark Army , and fsociety ? Who 's pulling the strings ? Right now , Whiterose seems to be the puppeteer . But if she 's a free agent or taking orders from the Chinese government , we 'll find out in due time .
How does the CEO of Evil Corp know Whiterose ? ( USA )
2 . So , was everything Mr Robot did really just Elliot 's actions ?
In the finale , the cafe scene makes it clear that Elliot and Mr Robot inhabit the same body . Was it Elliot threatening Ron Cephas Jones ' character Romero with a gun ? So then was it really Elliot behind the mask in this ultimatum to Evil Corp ?

3 . What 's in store for Allsafe ?
Allsafe is shut down , which can be expected after such a critical security breach of their main client . But I 'm not convinced they 're out of the picture , or at least we have n't seen the last of CEO Gideon Goddard , Elliot 's boss . He seems to care about Elliot , and also harbors a suspicion of Elliot 's extracurricular activities with fsociety . Will he be the brother-in-law Hank to Elliot 's Walter White ? Or will the show put him in a newer , unpredictable role ?
4 . How does Wellick know Mr Robot ?
So if Elliot and Mr Robot are one and the same , what about that scene in episode 8 where Wellick meets with him in a van ? Mr Robot was in charge , and Wellick was n't acting like he was looking into Elliot 's face . Either he has an understanding of Elliot 's fractured personality , or there 's more to Mr Robot than just ‚Äú he 's Elliot 's invisible ghost dad that nobody else can see . ‚Äù
5 . What 's the deal with Joanna Wellick ?
Stephanie Corneliussen had one tense scene in the finale , confronting a paranoid Elliot at her front door when he is looking for her husband . She really gets under his skin , causing him to wonder if she can hear his inner monologue with his imaginary friend ‚Äî us , the audience .
Corneliussen 's character has been praised by fans of the show , who 've been comparing her to a Lady Macbeth character manipulating her husband in the background . And it 's also been said that her presence will increase in the next season .
6 . Has Angela gone to the dark side ?
Angela has taken a job at Evil Corp , and at her first day of work , she watches Evil Corp 's EVP of Technology commit suicide during a live news broadcast ( hey , I warned you about spoilers ‚Äî anyway , this is why the finale was delayed a week ) . Given money to go shopping for new shoes ( not covered in blood ) , she has a surprising encounter with a shoe clerk . The clerk first realizes where the blood comes from , and wonders how she could work for such an evil corporation .
Angela , the woman who had an axe to grind with Evil Corp , who stood up to former CTO Terry Colby , rather than defend her actions or let him in on her secret plan to bring the company down from the inside , instead says ‚Äú I do n't know who you think you 're taking to , but I 'll try the Pradas next. ‚Äù Is she still in shock , is she numbed , and how will she recover next season ?
‚Äú I do n't know who you think you 're taking to , but I 'll try the Pradas next. ‚Äù ( USA )
7 . What will happen to fsociety ?
The hack has been carried out , even if Elliot does n't remember , and fsociety is famous . They 've always felt like a stand-in for Anonymous , at least through their use of masks and dramatic video declarations . Now , they may evolve into something much closer to Anonymous , in which anyone can put on a mask and join in . And it 's likely that the fsociety crew we 've come to know ( and suspect of being imaginary ) is going to lose control of the beast they 've created .
8 . What are the effects this hack will have on the world ?
Debts have been wiped out , and the public is mobilizing in the streets . Just how much will this change the world ? Esmail has been upfront about how the Arab Spring helped inspire components of the show , so are we going to see an American Spring in Mr Robot 's world ? Considering this is a world where Obama is president and the Ashley Madison hack happened , where does it diverge from our own reality ? Or will the final reveal be that Elliot is real , and we 're the fictional creation monitoring his inner thoughts ?
Is this the end of the world ? ( USA )
9. Who 's at Elliot 's door ?
Right before the credits , there 's a knock at Elliot 's door . I feel like we 've seen more than a couple episodes end this way , but this time the visitor is n't revealed . The most obvious answers : Mr Robot ( he did that a couple episodes ago ) or Wellick ( he did that last episode ) , either who could give a lot of exposition about what 's happened . I doubt Darlene would bother to knock , so who is it going to be , and why do we have to wait until next summer to find out ?
SAN FRANCISCO ( November 10 , 2017 ) ‚Äì Humans have lived under the same roof with bugs since we first began building shelters 20,000 years ago . Now , scientists are studying how physical factors of our homes‚Äîfrom the floor plan and the number of windows to even how tidy we are‚Äîmay play a role in the diversity of the multi-legged communities populating the indoor environment . Researchers from the California Academy of Sciences , North Carolina State University , and the Natural History Museum of Denmark published findings today in Scientific Reports revealing that a greater number of bug species can be found in high-traffic , ground-level , carpeted rooms with many windows and doors . ( And a word of comfort for pet owners with messy habits : do n't worry , bugs do n't really care . )
‚Äú We are just beginning to realize‚Äîand study‚Äîhow the home we create for ourselves also builds a complex , indoor habitat for bugs and other life , ‚Äù says Dr. Misha Leong , lead author and postdoctoral researcher at the Academy . ‚Äú We 're hoping to better understand this age-old coexistence , and how it may impact our physical and mental well-being . ‚Äù
Humans spend the majority of their time indoors . Aside from pests , most life within the home‚Äîbe it bacteria , fungi , or arthropods ( a group that includes insects and their close relatives like spiders and millipedes ) ‚Äîhas rarely been studied . The scientific team surveyed 50 urban homes in Raleigh , North Carolina to see what it is about a home that might lead to a buggier abode .
From the attic to the basement
Next time you climb the stairs , remember that insects , too , prefer lower levels . Survey findings revealed that as floor numbers increase , fewer types of insects thrive . Larger rooms , especially on the ground floor ( or even below ground ) , harbored more insect diversity . More varied types of insects were also observed in carpeted rooms versus those with bare floors as well as ‚Äú airier ‚Äù rooms with more windows and doors offering greater accessibility to the outdoors . Species diversity within the home tends to mirror the life thriving outside , with neighborhood affluence playing an important and recently studied role .
‚Äú While the idea of uninvited insect roommates sounds unappealing , bugs in houses may contribute to health in a roundabout way , ‚Äù says Dr. Michelle Trautwein , senior author and the Academy 's Schlinger Chair of Diptera . ‚Äú A growing body of evidence suggests some modern ailments are connected with our lack of exposure to wider biological diversity , particularly microorganisms‚Äîand insects may play a role in hosting and spreading that microbial diversity indoors . ‚Äù
Room to room
Bugs can also vary from room to room . An analysis of core representative species‚Äîlike booklice , fruit flies , and ladybugs‚Äîrevealed how common areas like living rooms hosted more diverse communities when compared to bathrooms , kitchens , and bedrooms . Basements also proved unique : these dark , damp , and cavernous spaces lent to diverse communities of cave-dwelling insects like spiders , mites , millipedes , camel crickets , and ground beetles .
Every room within the home revealed a complex ecological structure of predator and prey‚Äîwith scavenger species , strays from the outdoors , and transient go-betweens all playing critical roles . The study also noted how indoor ecology is much like island ecology‚Äîa scientific discipline that examines what lives where , and why . Once species permeate inside , they tend to colonize their new ‚Äú island ‚Äù habitat and disperse across the household .
‚Äú We 're beginning to see how houses can be a passive go-between for insects traveling through the surrounding landscape , ‚Äù says Trautwein . ‚Äú The more numerous the entry points of windows and doors , the more diverse the community that thrives inside . ‚Äù
No need to de-clutter ; cats and pups are a-ok
For the messy among us , rest assured : study findings revealed that tidiness does not play a significant role in insect diversity except for the presence of cellar spiders‚Äîdelicate , long-legged critters of the family Pholcidae typically spotted in damp crawl spaces . While more cluttered areas hosted a greater number of these web-spinners , on the whole human behavior played a minimal role in determining the composition of bug communities in the survey .
The presence of cats or dogs , houseplants , pesticides , and dust bunnies revealed no significant impact , suggesting that our indoor communities are more strongly influenced by the environment outside the window than how tidily we live inside with Fido and Kitty .
‚Äú Even though we like to think of our homes as shielded from the outdoors , wild ecological dramas may be unfolding right beside us as we go about our daily lives , ‚Äù says Leong . ‚Äú We 're learning more and more about these sometimes-invisible relationships and how the homes we choose for ourselves also foster indoor ecosystems all their own . ‚Äù
This study is part of a seven-continent exploration to understand overlooked life in the home : how our tiniest roommates arrive and thrive , and the unknown impacts‚Äîboth harmful and benign‚Äîthat stem from living together in close quarters .
The New York Times Best Seller list is widely considered the preeminent list of best-selling books in the United States . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Published weekly in The New York Times Book Review , [ 1 ] the best-seller list has been published in the Times since October 12 , 1931 . [ 1 ] In recent years it has evolved into multiple lists in different categories , broken down by fiction and non-fiction , hardcover , paperback , and electronic , and different genres .
The list is based on a proprietary method that use sales figures , other data and internal guidelines that are unpublished - how the Times compiles the list is a trade secret . [ 3 ] In 1983 ( as part of a legal argument ) the Times stated that the list is not mathematically objective but rather editorial content . In 2017 a Times representative said that the goal is that the lists reflect authentic best sellers . [ 4 ] The list has been the source of controversy over the years .
History [ edit ]
External image New York Times Best-seller List
Oct. 12 , 1931 The first best-seller list was published with little fanfare for books sold in New York City only .
Although the first best seller list in America was published in 1895 , in The Bookman , the best seller list was not published in The New York Times until 36 years later with little fanfare on October 12 , 1931 . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] It consisted of five fiction and four non-fiction books for New York City only . [ 6 ] The following month the list was expanded to eight cities , with a separate list published for each city . [ 6 ] By the early 1940s , fourteen city-lists were included . A national list was created on April 9 , 1942 , in The New York Times Book Review ( Sundays ) as a supplement to the regular city lists ( Monday edition ) . [ 6 ] The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists . [ 6 ] A few years later the city lists were eliminated entirely , leaving only the national ranking list , which was compiled according to `` reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities '' . [ 6 ] This methodology of ranking by bookseller sales figures remains to this day although the exact data compilation process is a trade secret and has evolved over time . [ 3 ]
By the 1950s , The Times 's list had become the leading best seller list for book professionals to monitor , along with that of Publishers Weekly . [ 6 ] In the 1960s and 70s , mall-based chain bookstores B. Dalton , Crown Books , and Waldenbooks came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best-sellers with mass-market appeal . They used the best-selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales , thus placing increased emphasis on the New York Times list for book readers and book sellers . [ 6 ]
Composition [ edit ]
The list is compiled by the editors of the `` News Surveys '' department , not by The New York Times Book Review department , where it is published . [ 7 ] It is based on weekly sales reports obtained from selected samples of independent and chain bookstores and wholesalers throughout the United States . [ 7 ] The sales figures are widely believed to represent books that have actually been sold at retail , rather than wholesale , [ 8 ] as the Times surveys booksellers in an attempt to better reflect what is purchased by individual buyers . Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores . [ 9 ]
The New York Times reported in 2013 that `` we [ generally do not ] track the sales of classic literature , '' and thus , for example , new translations of Dante 's Inferno would not be found on the bestseller list . [ 10 ]
The exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret . [ 3 ] Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method `` is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people ca n't try to rig the system . Even in the Book Review itself , we do n't know ( the news surveys department 's ) precise methods . `` [ 7 ] In 1992 , the survey encompassed over 3,000 bookstores as well as `` representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets , including variety stores and supermarkets . `` [ 3 ] By 2004 , the number was 4,000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers . [ 6 ] Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores , which are underrepresented in the sample . [ 6 ]
The lists are divided among fiction and non-fiction , print and e-book , paperback and hardcover ; each list contains 15 to 20 titles . The lists have been subdivided several times . `` Advice , How-To , and Miscellaneous '' debuted as a list of five on January 1 , 1984 . It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general non-fiction list . [ 11 ] Its inaugural number one bestseller , The Body Principal by Victoria Principal , had been number 10 and number 12 on the non-fiction lists for the two preceding weeks . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In July 2000 , the `` Children 's Best Sellers '' was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time . [ 14 ] The children 's list was printed monthly until Feb. 13 , 2011 , when it was changed to once an issue ( weekly ) . In September 2007 , the paperback fiction list was divided into `` trade '' and `` mass-market '' sections , in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself . [ 15 ] In November 2010 , The New York Times announced it would be tracking e-book best-seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011 . [ 16 ] `` RoyaltyShare , a San Diego-based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers , will ... provide [ e-book ] data '' . [ 16 ] The two new e-book lists were first published with the February 13 , 2011 , issue , the first tracks combined print and e-book sales , the second tracks e-book sales only ( both lists are further sub-divided into Fiction and Non-fiction ) . In addition a third new list was published on the web only , which tracks combined print sales ( hardcover and paperback ) in fiction and nonfiction . In December 16 , 2012 , the children 's chapter books list was divided into two new lists : middle-grade ( ages 8‚Äì12 ) and young adult ( age 12‚Äì18 ) , both which include sales across all platforms ( hard , paper and e-book ) .
Criticisms [ edit ]
The list has been criticized by authors , publishers , book industry executives , and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status . [ 6 ] These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated . [ 6 ] A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales , since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales ( see `` fast sale '' criticism below ) . [ 6 ] A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were `` smoke and mirrors '' ; while a report in Book History found that many professionals in the book industry `` scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate '' . [ 6 ]
Specific criticisms include :
Controversies [ edit ]
In 1983 , author William Peter Blatty sued The New York Times for $ 6 million , claiming that his latest book , Legion ( filmed as The Exorcist III ) , had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood , saying it should have been included due to high sales . [ 6 ] The Times countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech . [ 6 ] Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court , which declined to hear the case . [ 6 ] Thus , the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content , not objective factual content , so the Times had the right to exclude books from the list . [ 6 ]
In 1995 , Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema , the authors of a book called The Discipline of Market Leaders , colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts . The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookScan . Because of the benefits of making The New York Times Best Seller list ( speaking engagements , more book deals , and consulting ) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself . The book climbed to No . 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks ; it also peaked at No . 1 on the BusinessWeek best seller list . Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage , chart success often begets more chart success . Although such efforts are not illegal , publishers consider them unethical . [ 20 ]
In 1999 , Amazon.com announced a 50 percent decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition , Barnes & Noble . [ 21 ] After a legal dispute between Amazon and The New York Times , Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order . [ 22 ] By 2010 , this was no longer the case ; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best-selling titles first . [ 23 ]
In 2013 , Forbes published a story titled `` Here 's How You Buy Your Way Onto The New York Times Bestsellers List . '' [ 24 ] The article discusses how ResultSource , a San Diego-based marketing consultancy , specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list , even guaranteeing a No . 1 spot for those willing to pay enough . The New York Times was informed of this practice and responded : ‚Äú The New York Times comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers . We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions . '' The New York Times did not alert its readers to this , unlike The Wall Street Journal , which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource 's campaign . [ 25 ] Soren Kaplan , the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book , Leapfrogging , on The Wall Street Journal 's bestseller list , revealed the methodology on his blog ; he posted : `` If I could obtain bulk orders before Leapfrogging was released , ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula . Three thousand books sold would get me on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list . Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all , The New York Times list . '' [ 26 ]
In 2014 , the Los Angeles Times published a story titled `` Can bestseller lists be bought ? `` [ 27 ] [ 28 ] It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company ResultSource to place his book Real Marriage ( 2012 ) on The New York Times Best Seller list for a $ 200,000 fee . The contract was for ResultSource `` to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book , 'Real Marriage ' on the week of January 2 , 2012 . The bestseller campaign is intended to place 'Real Marriage ' on the New York Times bestseller list for the Advice How-to list . '' To achieve this , the contract stated that `` RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week . '' This took place , and the book successfully reached No.1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22 , 2014 . [ 27 ]
In July 2015 , Ted Cruz 's book A Time For Truth was excluded from the list because the `` overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [ of Cruz 's book ] were limited to strategic bulk purchases '' to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list . In response , Cruz called the Times `` a liar '' and demanded an apology . [ 29 ] The Times said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation .
In August 2017 , a young adult fiction book , Handbook for Mortals by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list , where it was in initially in the # 1 spot . According to a statement issued by the Times , `` after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle , we decided that the sales for Handbook for Mortals did not meet our criteria for inclusion . We 've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover ' list for September 3 , 2017 which does not include that title . `` [ 30 ] It was uncovered , by author Phil Stamper , that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales . [ 31 ] The book is published by GeekNation , an entertainment website based in Los Angeles . [ 30 ] The book was originally written as a script , and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise . [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
In August 2017 , conservative publisher Regnery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim `` New York Times best-selling authors '' due to its belief the Times favors liberal books on the list . The Times responded the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list . The Associated Press noted the Times is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans . [ 34 ] The Washington Post called Regenery 's ban a `` stunt '' designed to increase sales , `` What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the New York Times does n't like it ? '' The Post compared the list to best seller lists from Publishers Weekly looking for bias but could not find anything convincing . [ 35 ]
In February 2018 , Toronto Star published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best-selling book 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson , who topped Publishers Weekly chart list , did not even chart on The New York Times bestsellers list , without reliable answers from NYT . The NYT stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company . [ 36 ] According to Random House Canada , the book was handled properly for the U.S . market . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for National Review titled `` The Times Best-Seller List : Another Reason Americans Do n't Trust the Media '' in which contends that the issue with Peterson 's book , as well his The Rational Bible : Exodus , is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media 's manipulation . [ 39 ] NYT denied any bias . [ 40 ]
Studies [ edit ]
A Stanford Business School analysis suggests that the `` majority of book buyers seem to use the Times ' list as a signal of what 's worth reading '' . [ 41 ] The study concluded that lesser-known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list , while perennial best-selling authors , such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel , see no benefit of additional sales .

Gabi has said he is in the best moment of his career .
Atletico Madrid captain Gabi has suggested he would like to continue at the club as a coach after he retires as a player .
Gabi has spent most of his senior career at the Estadio Vicente Calderon -- and skippered Diego Simeone 's side to their recent successes , including the 2013 Copa del Rey and 2014 La Liga title , and into two Champions League finals .
The former Atletico youth teamer , 33 , recently renewed his contract with the club up until June 2018 , which is also when current Colchoneros coach Diego Simeone 's deal ends after the Argentine surprisingly shortened the agreement last summer .
The Madrid-born midfielder was asked by AS whether he saw himself managing the team after he finally hangs up his boots .
`` It 's clear that I am an Atletico fan and I would love to continue to help , '' Gabi said . `` When my time as a player ends , then I will set some other goals . ''
Gabi said he was currently playing well and felt fully comfortable in all aspects at the Calderon club .
`` I 'm in the best moment of my career , '' he said . `` I have found my place inside the club , in the dressing room , in the team , on the pitch , and that is reflected in my performances . ''
Simeone is currently fielding Gabi as a central midfielder alongside playmaker Koke , with the duo helping the team to play some impressive football -- such as when beating Granada 7-1 in La Liga last weekend .
`` I 'm very comfortable with him , we complement each other well , '' Gabi said . `` Koke is a complete player -- he works hard , defends , sets up goals , takes set pieces ... He can play any position , and in the centre is where he can perform best for us .
`` Playing there , he gives the team more options . In the centre he is on the ball more , and that helps the team . ''
Atletico had evolved over time into a team who can dominate games , Gabi said .
`` I see the team now dominates all areas of the play , '' he said . `` Two or three years ago we defended well , but we did not have a clear attacking style .
`` Now the team knows how to read games very well . Atletico play with authority , know what to do in every moment , and that is shown in the games . ''
Gabi was asked if the current team reminded him of the side which won La Liga in 2014 .
`` No , I do n't see it that way , '' he responded . `` Then we had more veteran players , more experience , with players like [ David ] Villa , Diego Ribas , Diego Costa ... This team is more motivated to win , more hungry for victory . It is similar in the objectives , but with a different way of playing . ''

In less than two years the RIAA has sent copyright infringement notices to 1.8 million Internet subscribers and 269,609 to colleges and universities . Despite this staggering average of more than a million infringement notices every year from the recording industry alone , the effect on file-sharing levels seems unnoticeable .
For years , content owners such as record labels and movie studios have been sending copyright infringement notices to Internet users . They hire companies such as DtecNet and BayTSP , who monitor file-sharing networks and automatically send infringement notices to Internet providers . The Internet providers on their turn are legally obliged to forward these to their customers .
Although these copyright infringement warnings are nothing new , little was known about the scope of these operations , until now .
This week the RIAA revealed that , since October 2008 , it has sent out infringement warnings to 1.8 million Internet subscribers and 269,609 to colleges and universities in the United States . This translates into an average of well over a million infringement warnings a year .
Since the RIAA stopped pursuing individuals for sharing music online a long time ago , these infringement notices are merely a warning . However , the RIAA is confident that a significant number of the recipients will change their downloading habits once they 're notified .
An RIAA spokesman declined to inform TorrentFreak whether the number of infringement notices sent out are increasing or declining . The RIAA has no hard facts on the effectiveness of the notices either , but told us that university administrators usually see ‚Äú very few ‚Äù repeat offenders .
It does indeed seem plausible that some who are warned will think twice before they fire up their BitTorrent client unprotected , especially with all the talk about lawsuits recently . However , the effect of the warning campaigns are not noticeable in the number of file-sharing users and the traffic that they generate . Both are still increasing year after year .
RIAA 's openness with regard to their infringement notices comes right after the US put into effect a new requirement for colleges and universities to stop illicit file-sharing on their networks .
Starting this month , a provision of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 puts defiant schools at risk of losing federal funding if they do n't do enough to stop illicit file-sharers on their campus .
In recent years colleges and universities had to undertake measures to reduce piracy , and go after students who use file-sharing networks to share copyrighted files . Those who failed to do so will now lose their eligibility for federal student aid .
Effective or not , the new rules have proven to be quite costly for US educational institutions who spend between $ 350,000 and $ 500,000 a year to decrease piracy . With continuing doubts , even from the Government , as to whether or not piracy is causing losses to the entertainment industry , one has to wonder if it 's all worth it .
Whether the measures installed at colleges and universities are successful has to be doubted . We 've reviewed the effectiveness of a few of the measures in the past and they provided little hope . If we add that users of file-hosting services such as Rapidshare and Megaupload are untraceable by the RIAA and its partners , the newly installed anti-piracy measures seem to be just symbolic .
The organic compound citrulline is an Œ±-amino acid . Its name is derived from citrullus , the Latin word for watermelon , from which it was first isolated in 1914 by Koga and Odake . [ 2 ] It was finally identified by Wada in 1930 . [ 3 ] It has the formula H 2 NC ( O ) NH ( CH 2 ) 3 CH ( NH 2 ) CO 2 H. It is a key intermediate in the urea cycle , the pathway by which mammals excrete ammonia by converting it into urea . Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine , catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase . [ 4 ]
Biosynthesis [ edit ]
Citrulline is made from ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate in one of the central reactions in the urea cycle . It is also produced from arginine as a byproduct of the reaction catalyzed by NOS family ( NOS ; EC 1.14.13.39 ) . [ 5 ] It is made from arginine by the enzyme trichohyalin at the inner root sheath and medulla of hair follicles . [ 6 ] Arginine is first oxidized into N-hydroxyl-arginine , which is then further oxidized to citrulline concomitant with release of nitric oxide .
Function [ edit ]
Several proteins contain citrulline as a result of a posttranslational modification . These citrulline residues are generated by a family of enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases ( PADs ) , which convert arginine into citrulline in a process called citrullination or deimination . Proteins that normally contain citrulline residues include myelin basic protein ( MBP ) , filaggrin , and several histone proteins , whereas other proteins , such as fibrin and vimentin are susceptible to citrullination during cell death and tissue inflammation .
Circulating citrulline concentration is a biomarker of intestinal functionality . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]

Flickr/interdimensionalguardians In modern finance , you can hedge against anything .
But the market for hedging against alien invasions is pretty thin .
Marginal Revolution 's Tyler Cowen pointed us to an interesting proposal addressing the matter .
In an article for the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society , Jacob Haqq-Misra of the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science proposes a novel way to insure against the coming close encounter , while also helping fund the search for extraterrestrial intelligence .
He proposes a bond which pays out when extraterrestrial life is proved to exist by researchers on earth . It would be a `` lottery bond , '' which is a security usually issued to fund projects when the issuer foresees low demand for the bonds . In order to drum up demand , some randomly selected bonds within the issue are redeemed at a higher value than the face value of the bond once the project is completed ; this enhances the value of the bond .
All of the bonds get a regular , but low coupon payment , and once the project is completed , the holders of the `` lucky '' bonds get a high payout , while everyone else gets less or nothing .
According to Haqq-Misra 's paper :
`` I propose the establishment of a SETI Lottery Bond to provide a continued source of funding for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) . The SETI Lottery Bond is a Ô¨Åxed rate perpetual bond with a lottery at maturity , where maturity occurs only upon discovery and conÔ¨Årmation of extraterrestrial intelligent life . Investors in the SETI Lottery Bond purchase shares that yield a Ô¨Åxed rate of interest that continues indeÔ¨Ånitely until SETI succeeds‚Äîat which point a random subset of shares will be awarded a prize from a lottery pool . SETI Lottery Bond shares also are transferable , so that investors can benefact their shares to kin or trade them in secondary markets . The total capital raised this way will provide a fund to be managed by a Ô¨Ånancial institution , with annual payments from this fund to support SETI research , pay investor interest , and contribute to the lottery fund . Such a plan could generate several to tens of millions of dollars for SETI research each year , which would help to revitalize and expand facilities such as the Allen Telescope Array . ''
What makes these bonds unusual is that they assert with certainty that we will find alien life in the future . The probability of this occuring is determined by the Drake equation , an equation that tries to determine the probability of finding alien life in a galaxy , depending on several factors including the number of planets it has and the average rate of star formation . According to this , t he Milky Way probably has about 12,000 alien civilizations .
Given our current zero knowledge about alien life , these lottery bonds would probably be a hard sell , but they 're a fun way to help underfunded space research . And if we do end up finding a hostile alien civillization- you ' or your descendants will be able to cash out big time .
The city of Santa Clara 's showdown with the San Francisco 49ers over handing budget documents to show who 's spending what on running the place got kicked up a notch before Thanksgiving , with the city council voting to find the team in violation of its lease , a move that could lead the city to seize operational control of the stadium if the Niners owners do n't cough up the documents by December 22 :
‚Äú We hired ManCo . They work for us . They do n't get to decide what is withheld from the owners of the stadium , ‚Äù [ Santa Clara Mayor Lisa ] Gillmor said . ‚Äú How do we know we are managing this public asset in the proper manner if we can not get the documents from the management company that we hired to manage the stadium ? ‚Äù Representatives for the 49ers countered that the team has been giving the city regular reports and has lived up to its end of the deal . They said the team is withholding information in two areas it considers confidential : security plans and financial information related to non-NFL events . Making security information available would put the public at risk , while disclosing the details of the non-NFL events would damage ManCo 's ability to effectively negotiate with promoters such as LiveNation and AEG Live , the team says .
This is a weird dispute to crop up just two years into a team 's move to a new city , needless to say , though Gillmor and friends have a point that it 's hard to determine revenue-sharing shares when your partner wo n't fess up to what their total revenues are . That it 's coming up now seems to come down to a bunch of factors : new city officials elected since the stadium project was approved who are less starry-eyed about the arrival of the NFL ; a crappily written lease that did n't specify what documents the 49ers would turn over or how the city would audit their finances ; and a team that 's so dismal on the field that even 49ers fans are probably happy ( or indifferent ) enough for the city to take them to task . ( ‚Äú The 49ers are broken all around the place , ‚Äù resident Dorothy Rosa told last week 's council hearing . ‚Äú They do n't know how to run a football team . They do n't know how to run anything . ‚Äù )
And speaking of the Niners ' on-field woes , the terrible team continues to be terrible news for people who bought the high-priced personal seat licenses that helped fund the new Santa Clara stadium , only to find themselves forced to choose between paying through the nose for near-worthless tickets every year or unloading their PSLs at a huge loss :
[ Tom ] Addison wanted out after the 2015 season . He wanted to sell what the team called his Stadium Builder Licenses so he did not have to keep spending $ 5,000 annually for four-season tickets in the corner of an end zone , a requirement to maintain the licenses . He was able to sell all four on the secondary market , but at $ 2,000 apiece after dropping his asking price , and recouped only $ 8,000 of the original $ 20,000 investment . The alternative would have been walking away from the licenses and getting none of the money back . ‚Äú I was relieved to get rid of them , ‚Äù Addison said in the dining room of his Burlingame home . ‚Äú I was so happy when the guy wanted to buy all four . I was happy to get out . ‚Äù
Which , you know , there 's that thing that P.T . Barnum never said about suckers ‚Äî plus , about half of the PSLs were bought up by ticket brokers , who will just write this off as a bad bet . Still , with things so bad that 6 % of all PSL holders have just defaulted on their annual payments and walked away with nothing rather than have to keep plunking down money for tickets every year , you have to wonder how eager , say , Los Angeles Rams fans will be to put down cash for PSLs once those go on sale next year .
I n a slight revision of the old trash and treasure aphorism , it is also true that one man 's utopia is another man 's hell ‚Äî and almost always a woman 's hell . The thing is , the worlds we each dream of all look very different , and there are many great authors‚Äîbeyond the go-to guys like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke‚Äîwho tell stories of imagined worlds . Below is a list of stories that envision planets and places that are better , or at least an alternative , to the Earth you 're currently reading this from .
The Green Book , Jill Paton Walsh
Pattie and her family are among the last refugees to flee a dying Earth in an old spaceship . And when the group finally lands on the distant planet which is to be their new home , it seems that the four-year journey has been a success . But as they begin to settle this shiny new world , they discover that the colony is in serious jeopardy . Nothing on this planet is edible , and they may not be able to grow food . With supplies dwindling , Pattie and her sister decide to take the one chance that might make life possible on Shine .
The Dispossessed , Ursula K. LeGuin
Shevek , a brilliant physicist , decides it 's time to bridge the distance and overcome that hatred that have separated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe . To do this will mean giving up his family and life on Anarres , and traveling to the utopian mother planet Urras , where he challenges the structures of life , society , and government . This is a book about the illusions of a utopia , and the pitfalls of both communism and capitalism .
An Unkindness of Ghosts , Rivers Solomon
Solomon has been called an heir to Octavia Butler , and her debut novel does bring Butler 's seminal work Kindred to mind . The story follows a sharecropper , Aster , who lives in the lowdeck slums of the HSS Matilda , a space vessel organized much like the antebellum South . For generations , Matilda has ferried the last of humanity to a mythical Promised Land ‚Äî and ship leaders have imposed deep indignities on workers like Aster . As the story moves towards civil war , the novel becomes both a reflection of history , and a warning for the future .
The Sparrow , Mary Doria Russell
Russell is a trained paleoanthropologist , and she brings that expertise to her first novel , The Sparrow , about a Jesuit priest and linguist , Emilio Sandoz , and his expedition to the planet Rakat . The story follows two narratives , one that begins in 2059 after the voyage , and one that begins in 2019 when an astronomer first intercepts the transmissions of songs from Rakat 's people , the Alpha Centauri . Sandoz arranges to bring a mission to the singing planet even though 17 years will pass on Earth . He is the sole survivor . An unusual juxtaposition of religion and alien culture , the book won the Arthur C. Clarke and the James Tiptree , Jr. awards , the Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis , and the British Science Fiction Association Award .
The Wanderers , Meg Howrey
The Wanderers follow three astronauts‚ÄîHelen Kane , Sergei Kuznetsov , and Yoshihiro Tanaka‚Äîwho have been selected by the private aerospace company Prime Space to pilot a trip to Mars . They 've all been to space before , but for this mission 's training , they must endure 17 months of the simulated world of Eidolon , created in the Utah desert . While it 's a novel about a vision of another world , it 's as much a story about relationships , interpersonal dynamics , and what survival reveals about humanity .
A Modern Utopia , H. G. Wells
Wells , who‚Äîfun fact‚Äîwas once serialized by Cosmo , is most often celebrated for his scientific romances such as War of the Worlds and The Time Machine , which paved the way for the modern sci-fi genre . But I 'm putting him on here so we can mention A Modern Utopia , written in 1905 . It 's full of beautifully written hard truths ( see : ‚Äú a Universe ceases when you shiver the mirror of the least of individual minds ‚Äù ) , and it presents a truly fascinating new world : there is gender equality , no capital punishment , and every individual shares the plan for ‚Äú comprehensive onward development. ‚Äù In the words of Tina Fey , I want to go to there .
The Skolian Saga books , Catherine Asaro
While Asaro , a doctor of chemical physics , writes many books about other worlds , she spends a lot of time looking out for this one : she 's a member of SIGMA , a think tank of speculative writers that advises the government as to future trends affecting national security . So she knows some stuff about‚Ä¶worlds . In the Skolian saga books , the titular Empire rules a third of the civilized galaxy through its mastery of faster-than-light communication . There is war and power struggle with the rival Eubian Concord , several generations of characters , political intrigue , and of course , romance .

[ 39 ] At the club , he was linked up with his uncle , assistant manager Steve Agnew . [ 40 ] The signing of Rhodes led to the departure of fellow striker , Kike , as the latter player felt that he would not be able to make as much first team appearances , due to the fact with the club having Rhodes and David Nugent as strikers . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] He was given the number 9 shirt , previously worn by Kike . [ 43 ]

[ 48 ]
Following the signing of √Ålvaro Negredo on loan from Valencia , Rhodes ' future with the club did not look certain , creating extra pressure for him to be in the first-team squad . [ 49 ] He managed to play six league games for the 2016‚Äì17 season , but was unable to score a goal . [ 50 ]
Sheffield Wednesday
On 1 February 2017 , it was announced that Rhodes had signed for Sheffield Wednesday , on loan for the rest of the season . [ 51 ] He made his debut for the club on 3 February 2017 , in a 1‚Äì0 away victory to Wigan Athletic . [ 52 ]

After a 1‚Äì1 aggregate score , Wednesday lost 3‚Äì4 on penalties to Huddersfield Town , thus confirming their stay in the second level of English football for the 2017‚Äì18 EFL Championship season . [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
He joined Sheffield Wednesday on a permanent basis on 1 July 2017 , as agreed at the time of the loan deal . [ 51 ] [ 55 ]
Loan to Norwich City
On 10 July 2018 , Rhodes joined fellow Championship side Norwich City on a season-long loan . [ 56 ]
International career
Under-21
Rhodes became eligible to play for Scotland because he attended school there for more than five years while his English father Andy Rhodes played for Scottish clubs . [ 57 ] In July 2010 , it was reported by The Scotsman newspaper that Rhodes was being considered for selection by the Scotland national under-21 football team . [ 57 ] He received his first call-up to the Scotland under-21 squad in November 2010 , but was immediately withdrawn because Huddersfield were due to play an FA Cup replay against Cambridge United on the day before the under-21 match . [ 58 ]
Rhodes eventually made his debut for Scotland under-21s on 24 March 2011 , in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Belgium in Deinze . [ citation needed ] He made his home debut on 10 August 2011 , in the 3‚Äì0 win over Norway at St Mirren Park . [ citation needed ] He scored his first goals for Scotland with a hat-trick in a 5‚Äì1 win against Luxembourg at Stade Josy Barthel , Luxembourg City on 6 October 2011 . [ 59 ] Four days later , Rhodes scored both of the Scotland goals in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Austria . [ 60 ] He also scored in Scotland 's 2‚Äì1 victory over the Netherlands in an U21 qualifier for the 2013 U21 European Championships . [ citation needed ] After scoring two goals against Bulgaria in only his eighth appearance for the team , he became the all-time leading scorer for the Scottish U21s . [ 61 ] [ 62 ]
Senior team
Rhodes was included in the full Scotland squad for their match against Cyprus at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in Larnaca on 11 November 2011 , as a reward for his October form for Huddersfield and the under-21s . [ 63 ] He was an 87th-minute substitute for Jamie Mackie and had a stinging shot parried by the Cyprus goalkeeper in injury time . Scotland won the match 2‚Äì1 . [ 64 ] Rhodes said to the press after the game , `` It was never in doubt I would be sticking with Scotland . I 'm Scottish through and through . I had all the jerseys as a kid and grew up watching Scotland . `` [ 65 ]
Rhodes made his first start for the Scots in the friendly against Australia at Easter Road . He marked the occasion with a goal , a superb header to draw Scotland level , after Mark Bresciano opened the scoring for the Australians . Scotland went on to win 3‚Äì1 with an own goal from Jason Davidson and a third from Ross McCormack . [ 66 ]

Want to Know How Your Neighborhood Looked 150 Years Ago ?
0 SHARES SHARES
Ever wonder what your neighborhood looked like 150 years ago ? That Duane Reade across the street just might have been a slaughterhouse and your corner Starbucks , well , that was likely a grain storehouse , or maybe the local malt house‚Ä¶
The New York Public Library is nearly finished digitizing its collection of more than 10,000 historical maps , which illuminate the shifting character of the city over time . Some maps highlight the long defunct shops and factories that once dotted the landscape , while others show how the street patterns of entire neighborhoods were reconfigured . The coolest part ? These maps can be loaded into Google Earth , allowing you to view the old map atop a modern view of the same area .
MetroFocus looked at three historic New York City maps alongside their modern counterparts . Have a look , then learn how to make your own maps .
Lincoln Tunnel Entrance : Today and 1857
These two maps show the section of Hell 's Kitchen bordered by West 40th and West 39th streets , and 10th and 11th avenues . The map on the left shows what 's there today : winding lanes coming out of the nearby bus depot , a sparsely populated construction site and the on-ramp to the Lincoln Tunnel passing over a bustling 10th Avenue .
The map on the right paints a very different , boozier portrait of the same geographical area . In 1857 , the construction site was home to a consortium of beer making businesses , including two breweries , a granary ( a storehouse for grain ) , stable , malt house and kiln . The rest of the block has a tightly packed collection of small buildings marked as slaughterhouses . While the entrance ramp to the Lincoln Tunnel is n't exactly known today for its pleasant odors , the map shows that the Hell 's Kitchen of 1857 was likely a far stinkier place .
Lower Manhattan : Today and 1854
In these maps , we see the changes to Lower Manhattan over 158 years , with Battery Park in the lower left-hand corner of the map , and Fulton Street butting into South Street in the top right-hand corner . While Water Street has been widened since 1854 , and the far West Side of Lower Manhattan now includes West Street , the makeup of Lower Manhattan is largely unchanged .
However , in 1854 , Washington Street was Manhattan 's westernmost border . In 1966 , Gov . Nelson D. Rockefeller announced plans to use landfill material from the construction of the World Trade Center to create Battery Park City . If a modern resident of this planned community were to be suddenly transported back to 1854 , they would find themselves swimming in the Hudson River .
Peter Cooper Village : Today and 1916
Here we see a slice of Manhattan 's East Side , bordered by First Avenue to the west , the East River to the east , 21st Street to the south , and 24th Street to the north . In 1916 , the area was known as the Gas House District , evidenced on the map on the right by the sprawling Consolidated Gas facility and various cylindrical gas tanks . Although the map shows tightly cornered residential buildings adjacent to the industrial facilities , as well as a large public bath house , the area was considered an undesirable place to live . This was due in part to the abundance of noxious leaking gas fumes , as well as roving street toughs like the Gas House Gang , which later joined forces with the notorious Five Points Gang .
On the left hand map we see that this area is now the northern section of Peter Cooper Village-Stuyvesant Town . In 1942 , due to a growing lack of residential housing , the city ‚Äî motivated by Robert Moses ‚Äî razed 600 buildings and displaced 3,100 families to make room for the massive redevelopment project . The first families moved into Stuyvesant Town in 1947 .
Election 2016 : Micro parties undeterred in WA despite Senate voting changes
Posted
Senate voting changes appear to have had little impact on the number of micro parties running in Western Australia , with only a small reduction in the number seeking a spot in Federal Parliament 's upper house .
Twenty-eight groups of candidates will be vying for a share of the 12 available Senate spots representing WA , a slight reduction on the 33 group tickets which ran in the special 2014 election .
There are also six `` ungrouped '' candidates , including four independents , running in WA .
The long list of candidates comes despite the Federal Government 's Senate voting reforms , making it much harder for micro parties to be successful .
The changes were implemented in the wake of a rise of micro party candidates being elected despite receiving only small percentages of the vote .
Election analyst William Bowe said the reduced prospects of success had not deterred candidates from running in WA .
`` Perhaps they have n't yet adapted to the reality that the new system is n't favourable to them as they are used to , '' Mr Bowe said .
`` I guess micro parties want to test the waters , they are not willing to just throw away all the work they have done in getting prepared for the election .
`` No one really knows how the new environment is going to play out or the extent to which micro parties are going to be disadvantaged . ''
WA 's 2016 Senate ballot paper has a very different look to that of the special 2014 election .
Of the 33 groups or parties which contested the 2014 election , only 16 are running this time .
Among the parties running in WA in 2016 but not seen in 2014 are some high-profile names , such as the Nick Xenophon Team , Pauline Hanson 's One Nation and Fred Nile 's Christian Democratic Party .

[ Remy ] has access to a very nice Fluke thermal camera , so when his Raspberry pi came in he pointed the thermal camera at the Raspi ( Spanish , Google translation ) to see how far this neat computer could be pushed before it overheated .
There are three main sources of heat on the Raspberry Pi : the voltage regulator , the USB/Ethernet controller and the Broadcom SoC . At idle , these parts read 49.9¬∞ C , 48.7¬∞ C and 53¬∞ C , respectively ; a little hot to the touch , but still well within the temperature ranges given in the datasheets for these components .
The real test came via a stress test where the ARM CPU was at 100 % utilization . The Broadcom SoC reached almost 65¬∞ C while the Ethernet controller and regulator managed to reach the mid-50s . Keeping in mind this test was performed at room temperature , we 'd probably throw a heat sink on a Raspberry Pi if it 's going to be installed in an extreme environment such as a greenhouse or serving as a Floridian or Texan carputer .

Food waste has met its most innovative opponent yet , a new supermarket in Denmark , where the vegetables are dirt cheap ‚Äî and too ugly or old to sell elsewhere . WeFood , which opened in Copenhagen this week , stocks only food that is past its official expiry date or unworthy of other supermarket shelves because of esthetic imperfections and damaged packaging . The grocer , opened by Danish NGO Folkekirkens Nodhjaelp , is hoping to lure shoppers of all socioeconomic backgrounds by selling its food at steep discounts ‚Äî somewhere between 30 to 50 per cent cheaper than other standard supermarkets .
On monday Danish Princess Marie opened Denmark 's first every supermarket stocked with surplus food , named WeFood . ( WeFood / Facebook )
The new supermarket is a not-so-subtle swing at the modern food system , which often prioritizes food safety at the expense of waste . Roughly one-third of all food produced worldwide ends up in the garbage , complicating efforts to alleviate hunger around the globe . But the problem is especially pronounced in developed countries , thanks in large part to stigmas attached to unappealing fruit and vegetables and overly conservative expiration dates . In Denmark , the unreasonable standards send 700 million kilograms of edible produce to landfill , undermining efforts to bring nutrition to households that struggle to put food on the table . Elsewhere , the consequences are equally grave : For instance , a 2014 report by Value Chain Management said Canadians waste $ 31 billion in food annually , with 51 per cent of that waste coming at home . That price tag is only slightly less than the $ 32 billion Canada spent importing farmed food in 2012 , the report said . To fill its shelves with unwanted but perfectly edible food , WeFood has established a web of partnerships with local supermarkets and butchers , produce importers , and even manufacturers of organic granola bars , according to The Independent . It has also won the support of the Danish government , which publicly lamented the country 's contribution to food waste .

‚Äú It 's ridiculous that food is just thrown out or goes to waste , ‚Äù Eva Kjer Hansen , the Danish minister for food and environment , said at a recent event organized by WeFood . ‚Äú It is bad for the environment and it is money spent on absolutely nothing. ‚Äù The news comes on the heels of what has already been impressive progress by the Scandinavian country , which has managed to reduce food waste by 25 per cent in just five years , according to a recent government report . It also follows an unprecedented announcement by France last year . The European country 's parliament voted unanimously to make it illegal for supermarkets to throw away any food that is considered edible . As of this coming July , large supermarkets in France ‚Äî those 400 square metres and larger ‚Äî will either have to donate the food to charity or make sure it 's used as animal feed . Retailers that fail to comply will face fines of up to $ 110,000 . The launch of WeFood follows a pledge by the European Union to reduce food waste by 50 per cent by 2025 . If the steep discounts the supermarket is dangling succeed in making ugly and expired food in something people buy , the model could serve as an example onto developed countries throughout the region , and even the world .
The list of candidates for Congress on Maine 's 2018 ballot continues to grow , including some from a new political party in Maine : The Libertarian Party .
Chris Lyons of Brunswick has announced he has launched a campaign to oust fellow Brunswickian Angus King , an independent , from the U.S. Senate . Farther north , Brian Kresge of Winterport has launched his own bid as a Libertarian against 2nd Congressional District Rep. Bruce Poliquin , a Republican .
Both are leaving the starting gates with similar messages : that Republicans and Democrats in Washington and at the state level have failed to lead and govern . And both are starting a considerably steep uphill slog as fourth-party candidates taking on established incumbents .
Call the prospect of a Libertarian candidate being elected a long shot , but that 's also what was said about the party gaining official status in Maine in 2015 and 2016 as supporters sought to register the 5,000 voters they needed to take the first step .
The Secretary of State 's office rejected some of the signatures in January 2016 , spurring the Libertarian Party of Maine Inc. to sue . That lawsuit went on for months , resulting in a federal judge first ruling against the party 's bid to be a party and then reversing his decision on appeal a month later . That allowed the libertarians to collect the additional registrants they needed and propelled their contention that Maine 's process for creating a new political party is unconstitutionally rigid .
Being an official political party in Maine affords candidates from that party a much easier path to the ballot , setting up a simple registration system in place of a more formidable petition-based system . The party 's efforts are not over . It has to send at least 10,000 registered Libertarians to the polls in November 2018 , according to new legislation enacted this year .
Lyons , who is a contractor by trade , ran a write-in campaign against U.S. Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , in 2014 . He has yet to file for his 2018 candidacy against King with the Federal Election Commission but has already launched a series of campaign events . He said he is in the race to win it and that converting independents or voters enrolled in major parties is easy .
‚Äú One thing I 've learned in the past couple of years is that it is n't so much that people become a Libertarian , ‚Äù he said during an interview on Wednesday . ‚Äú They simply realize they are one . I 've heard this time and time again . ‚Äù
Kresge , a senior software developer for RKL eSolutions LLD of Pennsylvania and Army veteran , said his priority as a candidate and congressman is to advocate for ‚Äú smaller , more effective government , ‚Äù which is at the core of the Libertarian ideology . Kresge also has not filed yet with the Federal Election Commission .
‚Äú The Libertarian Party is here and is serious about representing your interests , ‚Äù Kresge said in a written statement on Wednesday .
The candidate lineups against King and Poliquin are still developing . So far , only Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey has jumped into the race against King .

Off the bat you need to know that Washington-Arizona is my favorite rivalry . Competitively it 's been phenomenal . From The Block I and II , to Cold Blooded , to Roy v. Adams in 2005 , the purple and red have had no shortage of high paced games full of points and story storylines . I love it and still hate Ryan Appleby 's t-shirt .
Maybe I 'm biased as my best friend from college was from SeaTown ‚Äì a Mercer Islander named Jared ‚Äì who both point-guarded our rec efforts ( a team who 's shooting guard was an ASU fan and somehow the three of us managed to cohesively wreck shop between a Cat , a Dawg , and a Devil amongst all the UCSD Tritons ) and busted me out of whatever shell I needed busting out of us an awkward 21-year-old . For such I felt indebted and thus hosted Jared in 2008 : second row , mid-court in McKale ! As he wore his purple tank and accepted compliments from Wildcat fans about what a wonderful city Seattle is , Jerryd Bayless and Chase Budinger were dropping 51 en route to an 84-69 Wildcats victory . Jared has never hosted me in HecEd .
But enough about Jared and me . This is about the rivalry and what my man Griffin ( also opperates @ MontlakeMadness ) has to say about his Dawgs . You see , Griffin and I go back to last year 's Cats and Dawgs fight when he graciously did a Q & A with me ( my first ! ) . He runs the great Dawg Blog , Montlake Madness ‚Äì which recently made the transition on to SI ‚Äì congrats . He 's worth a follow and a read to be certain . That is if you like thorough insight and quality work . If that 's not your bag then‚Ä¶I really do n't know .
Game time :
Going to come right at it : What is this Husky team 's identity ?
That 's a great question . I can tell you that it SHOULD be hard-nosed defense and perimeter shooting . The team is built with long athletes that should make it difficult for teams to score . They also have two exceptional shooters in Wilcox and Suggs who can give teams nightmares .
During the first four games of the Pac-12 season you saw what this team could be . Unfortunately , they do n't have the testicular fortitude as a team to sustain those types of efforts on a nightly basis .
This team is an army without a general . The long-time players like Abdul Gaddy , Scott Suggs , and CJ Wilcox do n't have the types of personalities that inspire a team . UW has been blessed in the past with players like Isaiah Thomas , Nate Robinson , Jon Brockman , and Brandon Roy who could pull a team together in a timeout and fix things then and there .
This team just stares into each other 's eyes and hopes it will just fix itself .
Tell me about Abdul Gaddy 's career ? What do you make of it ?
It 's so tough to talk about Gaddy . One of the hardest working , nicest , best teammates I 've ever seen at UW . Unfortunately it seems like he was doomed from the beginning of his career . As many know , he came in as the second highest rated PG in the nation , a five star , McDonald 's All-American and it seems like he was never that player to begin with .
His confidence was shot early when he did n't meet those insanely high standards and Isaiah Thomas was already here and he was clearly the superior player and took up a lot of time at PG .
In 2010/11 he looked like he was making the jump as through 13 games he was averaging 8.5 ppg , 3.5 apg , and shooting 40 % from three but then he tore his ACL and everyone would say that he 's lost a step or two ever since then .
Now he has no momentum , no confidence in his shot , a better and younger PG behind him ( Andrews ) , and the entire leadership load on his shoulders . He 's gotten crushed under the constant pressure during his career and all of Husky Nation is ready to move on .
What is his legacy ?
To be harsh : one of the biggest busts in Husky history . I will remember him as a teammate that every player loved and a guy who just wished he could hit the reset button once .
Have you ever ended a 151-game winning streak ?
Yes ! I love that you asked me this one again . I 'll tell anyone who 's willing to listen as it 's the pinnacle of my athletic career . Long story short , I played football at Bellevue High School ( Bellevue , WA ) and we ended De La Salle 's ( Concord , CA ) 151 game winning streak , the longest in HS Football history .
Glory days are great .
There you are , they 've picked you , Griffin , to be First Captain and the lineup at the schoolyard includes Terrence Ross and CJ Wilcox , who are you taking ?
Terrence Ross , especially for a pickup game . Wilcox may have the better shot but Ross can do everything . Even though he certainly made the right choice in leaving early and getting drafted 8th overall , his presence on this UW team probably would have salvaged this lost season and sent them back the NCAA tournament .
Wilcox is turning into a very special player , though . He 's just starting to gain confidence in his dribble-drive game as he 's finally developing a better handle on the ball . As most know in the Pac-12 , he has the best shooting stroke in the nation . As this season continues to fall apart , UW fans are starting to look forward to next season and we hope he does n't leave early to the NBA .
What 's the song you 're telling everyone about these days ?
Well , as a Seattleite , I 'm required to recommend Macklemore and Ryan Lewis ' new album The Heist . All of it is just amazing . As for one song though , ‚Äú Wild For The Night ‚Äù by A $ AP Rocky ft. Skrillex is probably my most played lately .
Cold blooded . Go ahead‚Ä¶
Perhaps the pinnacle of the rivalry right there . Now if we could just get Isaiah Thomas and the Kings to move up to Seattle‚Ä¶
The MillerCats are just 2-5 against the Dawgs and he talked about that at Media Day . Thoughts on this rivalry :
It has been insanely entertaining . Even before Miller arrived , they were the must-watch game . I fell in love with the match up back in 2005 when Arizona beat UW in double overtime in Montlake on New Year 's Eve . It was the single greatest college game I 've witnessed .
There has been no better rivalry over the past decade than UW/Arizona in the Pac-12 . None .
As Romar teams have done over the years , they almost always play up to their opponent and Arizona has always brought the best out of them .
Give a grade and additional comments for Romar 's work this season .
This is a real tough one . The hiring of Brad Jackson as a new assistant has really helped with implementing the new high post offense but everyone knew there would be some struggles in year one of the transition . Romar 's number one criticism over the last few years is a lack of a half-court offense so it 's a much-needed change .
The real struggle of this team is a lack of motivation , especially to start games . They come out flat often and have to play from behind . Now is that an issue that Romar can fix ? I 'm not too sure . Usually that 's up to the captains and players to figure out on their own .
Another criticism of Romar is that UW had zero recruits come in this year . They had a couple transfers but they have to sit out the entire year . It 's really hurt their bench and overall versatility . That can certainly be pinned on him .
What makes this group of Huskies tick ? How do they ‚Äì if you think they can ‚Äì win this ball game ?
I thought these Huskies thrived on adversity and playing up to the challenge but their efforts in last week 's Oregon road trip certainly proved that wrong . Honestly , I think UW has no shot at winning on Thursday . Arizona is everything that UW wants to be in terms of pace , athletes , and experience . Barring a complete collapse from Arizona , I would be shocked if UW kept it close in the second half .
Prediction time , go !
Arizona 75 , UW 63 . Hopefully this marquee game finally awakens the Hec Ed crowd and that energy helps fuel the Huskies but my faith in this team is non-existent .
For those of you watching the game at home , I suggest playing the Gaddy Drinking Game . There 's only one rule : drink every time you find yourself saying ‚Äú GADDY ! ! ! ! ‚Äù ! You 'll get a good buzz going by halftime .
/endQA
Big thanks to Griffin for his insights on the Huskies , music , and helping to relive the glory days . At PacHoops we choose not to believe we peaked in High School so long live the dream . I also really think I could get into that drinking game : GADDYYYY ! ! ! !
See you guys on the other side .
Image caption On the east - and poorer side - of Troost Avenue in Kansas City , the city 's racial dividing line
Legal segregation in the US may have ended more than 50 years ago . But in many parts of the country , Americans of different races are n't neighbours - they do n't go to the same schools , they do n't shop at the same stores , and they do n't always have access to the same services .
In 2016 the issue of race will remain high on the agenda in the United States . The police killings of unarmed black men and women over the past few years reignited a debate over race relations in America , and the reverberations will be felt in the upcoming presidential election and beyond .
Ferguson , Baltimore and Chicago are three cities synonymous with racial tensions - but all three have another common denominator . They , like many other American cities , are still very segregated .
In my reporting across the United States I 've seen this first hand - from Louisiana to Kansas , Alabama to Wisconsin , Georgia to Nebraska . In so many of these places people of other races simply do n't mix , not through choice but circumstance . And if there 's no interaction between races , it 's harder for conversations on how to solve race problems to even begin .
Newly released census data , analysed by the Brookings Institution , shows black-white segregation is modestly declining in large cities , but it remains high . If zero is a measure for perfect integration and 100 is complete segregation , analysis from Brookings showed most of the country 's largest metropolitan areas have segregation levels of between 50 to 70 .
According to the Brookings report , `` more than half of blacks would need to move to achieve complete integration '' .
Some have pointed out that the wording of this part of the report itself highlights the challenges in these issues - why ca n't this be measured in the number of whites who would have to move ?
America in Black and White , a four-part radio documentary , will air next on BBC World Service on 14 January 2016 . Listen to the first episode .
Racial and socioeconomic segregation are closely linked - if you 're a black person in America , you 're more likely than a white person to live in an area of concentrated poverty .
This is n't simply a matter of choice , or chance . Some of it is by design - and down to decades-old housing policies which actively prevented African Americans from living in certain areas .
Image caption East of Troost Avenue in Kansas City
Kansas City , Missouri , is one of the country 's most segregated cities . Drive around the west of Troost Avenue and there are large houses , their vast porches overlooking equally vast driveways . Properties are anything from $ 356,000 ( ¬£243,000 ) to $ 1.2m .
But you only have to go east to see a very different picture . Abandoned houses and unkempt lawns greet you at most corners . One building I pass is completely boarded up , with piles of rubbish outside , and the words `` Stay Out '' in spray paint .
The housing on either side of Troost is very much split down race lines .
The US government had a hand in creating this segregation due to practices it instituted back in the 1930s , which prevented many blacks from getting on the property ladder in certain areas .
When the federal government began underwriting home loans for Americans to help boost the economy as part of the New Deal , strict guidelines were drawn up regarding where mortgages could be issued .
Areas where minorities lived were seen as risky investments and black families were routinely denied mortgages , locking them out of the housing market .
The practice was known as redlining because red ink marked out the minority areas . As Kansas City-based historian Bill Worley explained to me , these policies continued right into the 1960s , and excluded African Americans from one of the greatest motors of wealth in the 20th Century - home ownership .
Image caption A map of recent US Housing and Urban Development data shows segregated housing patterns . Each dot represents five people , with green representing black residents and orange representing whites
Redlining is now theoretically outlawed in the United States , and has been since the 1970s , but it 's still happening to this day .
`` Banks continue to build and structure their lending operations in a way that avoids or fails to meaningfully serve communities of colour , based on assumptions about the financial risk , '' Vanita Gupta , the justice department 's top civil rights lawyer , said last September , as she pledged more action to stop discriminatory lending .
Another factor which made access to housing prohibitive were the restrictive racial covenants written into housing contracts .
Until 1948 , it was perfectly legal for a black person to be prevented from buying or living in a house .
Bill Worley showed me an example of a restrictive racial covenant drawn up in Kansas City by the city 's best known property developer during that time , JC Nichols .
`` None of the said lots shall be conveyed to , used , owned nor occupied by Negroes as owner or tenants , '' it read . Other groups , including Jews , were also written into this kind of contracts .
The covenants created affluent white suburbs for middle- and upper-income families . By World War One , Nichols met developers in other cities who were also doing this . Huge new all-white suburbs sprang up across the country and the migration of white families to the suburbs became known as white flight .

Between redlining , racial covenants , and another practice known as blockbusting - where estate agents specialised in transitioning areas from white to black - segregation continued in the United States
Residential segregation in America peaked in 1970 . More black families are moving into the suburbs and back to Southern cities they left after slavery ended , explains economic historian Leah Boustan .
`` It may seem odd because we have stereotypes of the South , but residential segregation levels are lowest in Southern cities such as Atlanta , Houston and Dallas , '' she says .
But even though Atlanta is one of the least segregated cities in the United States , challenges persist .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One St Louis street has been known to residents as the 'dividing line '
On a visit to the city I met Nicole and Lewis Anderson , two African Americans who work in corporate jobs .
They told me they 'd been profiled by estate agents , who 've only shown them homes in certain `` black '' areas .
`` When we started out we had a few whites in our area , but within a few years they all moved out , '' said Lewis Anderson .
`` For us African Americans when we see a group of white people move to the neighbourhood we think that 's good , we 're cool with that . But for many white families that 's not the case - they start to get discouraged , they start to worry about the property value and leave . ''
Image caption The Andersons said they 've been discriminated against when looking for houses
There is plenty of evidence to suggest that Lewis and Nicole are n't alone in being encouraged to live in so-called `` black '' areas . Research from the US government shows that minorities looking for housing are shown fewer properties than their white counterparts .
The Fair Housing Act was passed more than 40 years ago to end discrimination in housing , but it 's not been properly enforced .
Last year President Obama pledged to toughen up this law , with new rules . Now government money can only be given for new housing projects if they 're shown to further integration in neighbourhoods , and there 'll be penalties for those who do n't adhere to this . But it only applies to public housing . Private developers can continue to build without such conditions .
`` The Fair Housing Act commanded that communities that received government money do what they can to affirmatively further fair housing , '' Housing Secretary Julian Castro told me in an interview .
`` The problem was that for many years that requirement was never adequately defined or enforced . ''
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Julian Castro tells the BBC the Fair Housing Act was never properly enforced
Mr Castro , who sits in the president 's cabinet , said one way his department will ensure areas of poverty are n't ignored is by giving towns and cities access to demographic data , so they can plan housing better .
The key challenge remains - decades on from the civil rights movement , many black and white Americans simply do n't mix . And as the US contends with race problems , getting to know each other better is one step in understanding and fixing some of those problems .

Although he has signaled opposition to same-day voter registration , Gov . Scott Walker accompanied his college-age son to a Wauwatosa polling place to register and vote on Aug. 14 - the day of the GOP Senate primary .
Matt D. Walker , a freshman at Marquette University , registered to vote at Jefferson School in Wauwatosa , just blocks from the Walker home , according to election records .
A witness who was at the polling place told the Journal Sentinel that the governor accompanied his son .
In a speech in California last month , Walker said he was considering ending same-day voter registration but has since said it wo n't be a priority for him in the next legislative session .
Walker also said that proponents of same-day registration , some of whom held a news conference this week urging him to leave the issue alone , had turned it into a `` ridiculous issue . ''
`` My priority is about jobs , creating jobs . . . . It 's not a part of my legislative priorities . It has n't been something we 've talked about , '' Walker said .
Jocelyn Webster , a Walker spokeswoman , said Friday in an email that the governor had made it clear in a Journal Sentinel 2010 candidate survey that ending same-day registration would make election day operations more efficient for poll workers .
`` At the same time , he believes people can and should use any registration opportunity legally available to them , and same-day registration currently is , '' Webster said . `` All this said , the governor has repeatedly said legislation on this issue is not a priority for him . If Matt did register on election day , I think it would highlight that point . ''
Two Republicans - Rep. Joel Kleefisch of Oconomowoc and Sen. Alberta Darling of River Hills - are writing a bill to end election-day registration .
Kleefisch said he believed there was a greater potential for fraud or simple errors with election-day registration . That 's a charge supporter of the law , which has been on the books for 35 years , have disputed .
Proponents say the law encourages turnout and has made Wisconsin a traditionally high-turnout state .
In Milwaukee alone , more than 57,000 people registered on Nov. 6 . The Milwaukee Election Commission said much of the same-day turnout occurred in wards at or near the Marquette University , University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Milwaukee School of Engineering campuses .

The Obama administration plans to reward Navient Corp , the student loan specialist formerly owned by Sallie Mae , with new business some three months after federal prosecutors accused the company of intentionally cheating troops on their federal student loans , according to three sources familiar with the administration 's plans .
The move is likely to stoke comparisons to recent multi-billion-dollar settlements reached between big banks and federal authorities over financial crisis-era misdeeds . Banks agreed to pay sizable sums , but public interest groups have criticized the settlements because the banks suffered few business consequences and their executives escaped criminal and civil charges .
`` It 's very disappointing , '' said Jason Collette , national organizer for Alliance For A Just Society , a network of state-based advocacy groups . `` Until a company loses its federal contracts or a senior executive is punished , these fines are just the cost of doing business . ''
In May , Navient and its former parent , Sallie Mae , agreed to pay a combined $ 139 million to resolve Department of Justice allegations that the two companies had swindled up to 60,000 service members out of tens of millions of dollars and forced other borrowers to pay unfair fees on their student loans . At a news conference announcing the settlement , Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he had instructed his staff to immediately conduct a review to determine `` what appropriate actions , if any , '' should be taken against Navient in response to the allegations .
Asked then if the Department of Education would cancel Navient 's lucrative contract , Duncan said , `` Every option is on the table . '' During the ensuing months , the Education Department considered punishing Navient , according to people familiar with the matter , by excluding it for a year from the group of companies allowed to service American college students ' federal loans .
Instead , Duncan 's department is expected to announce as early as Friday that it will require more college students to deal with Navient , rather than the department 's numerous other loan servicers , according to people familiar with the matter . As a result , more taxpayer funds will flow to Navient . The company already handles 5.8 million student loan accounts under its contract with the Education Department .
On Tuesday , President Barack Obama boasted to veterans at an American Legion convention about how his administration had made it easier for troops to access the same benefits the Justice Department accused Navient of willfully preventing soldiers from enjoying . Dorie Nolt , an Education Department spokeswoman , did n't respond to multiple requests for comment .
Companies and government agencies often make public potentially embarrassing news on Friday afternoons , especially before holiday weekends .
`` If the Education Department is really allocating Navient new loans after its history of unlawful practices , it shows that the department is n't prioritizing the safety of borrowers . Instead , they 're prioritizing their contractors , '' said Chris Hicks , an organizer who leads the Debt-Free Future campaign for Jobs With Justice , a Washington-based nonprofit that has called on Duncan to suspend the department 's contract with Navient .
The announcement is among several planned by the Education Department regarding its troubled student loan servicing system . The agency announced Friday that it will change the way it evaluates the companies it pays to collect borrowers ' monthly student loan payments -- placing more emphasis on how borrowers rank the companies -- and that it will significantly increase the share of student loans assigned to smaller , not-for-profit loan specialists . The department had previously hoped to reduce the role of not-for-profit loan servicers , but their recent performance surprised department officials . As a result , the companies will be rewarded with new business . Some federal officials hope that as a result , the department will be less reliant on large companies such as Navient .
The department also announced that it will change the way it pays its loan specialists , a move Obama suggested in June , in hopes that the change will lead servicers to enroll more borrowers in repayment plans that cap monthly payments relative to borrowers ' incomes .
The Education Department awards new loans to its servicers based on a system that grades their ability to prevent borrower defaults and measures customer satisfaction . Increasing the importance of borrower survey scores could hurt Navient , as borrowers have consistently ranked the company as being among the department 's worst .
Over the last two years , Navient -- as part of Sallie Mae -- has finished in last place among the department 's four major loan specialists . The company is expected to finish in third this year , according to analysts at Compass Point Research & Trading , a Washington-based financial firm .
In May , the Justice Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , a federal bank regulator , accused Navient of intentionally overcharging troops on their federal student loans and willfully obtaining default judgments against service members over an eight-year period , in violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act . The FDIC alleged the companies illegally told troops they had to be deployed to receive entitled benefits and improperly required them to meet other tests .
Neither Navient nor Sallie Mae admitted or denied wrongdoing as part of their settlement agreement with federal authorities . The company told investors it was being punished for not complying with what it described as new standards . Navient 's chief executive , John Remondi , apologized in a statement for ‚Äú processing errors. ‚Äù Navient spun off from Sallie Mae on May 1 , taking the company 's loan servicing and collections business . Sallie Mae is now a bank .
By the Education Department 's reckoning , Navient has improved its performance in the wake of the settlement . Data released for the first time this month suggests Navient has improved the way it treats borrowers with federal student loans . Among the department 's four major loan servicers , in the most recent quarter , the company had the highest share of borrowers with federal student loans who are repaying their debts as expected . Navient also had the second highest share of borrowers using income-driven repayment plans . The White House has promoted these plans , which cap payments relative to borrowers ' incomes , in hopes of reducing borrowers ' debt burdens and defaults .
Navient has long ranked among the department 's top servicers in preventing defaults .
Now that the Department of Justice has withdrawn its lawsuit against Apple in the case concerning the San Bernardino shooter 's iPhone , it 's clear that the legal and media battles of the last month and a half have produced more questions than they 've answered . Chief among those remaining questions is this : What was the point ?
The FBI , Department of Justice , and their many , many attorneys have spent the last few weeks advancing and building supporting arguments for the theory that the San Bernardino case was a standalone , a unique case that requires unique assistance from Apple . Because the iPhone 5C used by one of the killers was protected by a passcode and would erase its data automatically if too many incorrect codes were tried , the government wanted Apple to help it unlock the phone by building and signing a compromised version of iOS to load on the device . The government has said consistently in its filings that without the help of Apple , it would n't be able to unlock the phone and also that it was not trying to set a precedent with this case , only trying to get to the data on this specific device .
Apple , meanwhile , has contended from the beginning of the fight that the government is overreaching by asking the company to subvert its own security features and has resisted complying with the court order to do so . Company executives also maintain that the San Bernardino case is the beginning of what could be a long series of such requests , far from an isolated incident .
‚Äú If a court can ask us to write this software , think about what else they could ask us to write . Maybe it 's an operating system for surveillance , maybe the ability for law enforcement to turn on the camera , ‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month . ‚Äú I do n't know where this stops , but I do know this is n't what should be happening in this country . ‚Äù
The government ultimately got what it wanted in this case , but it also underestimated Apple 's institutional fortitude .
The case is now out of the court 's hands , after the government on Monday said it had been successful in unlocking the iPhone without Apple 's assistance . The Department of Justice said in a filing last week that an ‚Äú outside party ‚Äù had come forward with a method that could retrieve the data from the device and that method has been successful .
‚Äú The government has now successfully accessed the data stored on Farook 's iPhone and therefore no longer requires the assistance of Apple Inc. , ‚Äù the government 's filing says .
Apple said in a statement that the case was a mistake all along .
‚Äú From the beginning , we objected to the FBI 's demand that Apple build a backdoor into the iPhone because we believed it was wrong and would set a dangerous precedent . As a result of the government 's dismissal , neither of these occurred . This case should never have been brought , ‚Äù the statement says .
‚Äú Apple believes deeply that people in the United States and around the world deserve data protection , security and privacy . Sacrificing one for the other only puts people and countries at greater risk . ‚Äù
So what exactly was this fight all about ?
For the Department of Justice , the FBI , and the rest of the law enforcement community , the case represented an extraordinary opportunity to test the limits of its power to compel technology vendors to comply with assistance requests . The government quickly discovered what those limits are , at least when it comes to Apple . Whether other vendors have those same limits remains to be seen . But the case also became a public referendum on security and privacy , a situation that the government chose to create when it made its court filings public . That likely did n't turn out the way the FBI expected , as tech companies and politicians lined up behind Apple .
‚Äú The fact that the FBI ultimately found an alternative solution suggests that it did not conduct full due diligence before filing the lawsuit . The entire episode underscores the need for the executive branch to use extraordinary restraint when it comes to exerting extraordinary powers , ‚Äù Rep. Ted Lieu ( D-Calif. ) said in a statement Monday .
And for Apple , a company that places enormous value on its public image and has spent the better part of a decade hardening iOS and the iPhone hardware , the case was a minefield . The company made clear in its public statements and filings that it had complied with all of its legal responsibilities to turn over the data it had in the case . But Apple also has built a reputation for security and privacy and it showed no interest in undermining that , whether publicly or privately .
The government ultimately got what it wanted in this case , but it also underestimated Apple 's institutional fortitude . That underestimation likely wo n't happen a second time , whether it 's with Apple or another vendor . Future battles of this kind may not be as public or resolved as cleanly .

NEW YORK ( AP ) ‚Äî It 'll be a ( mostly ) white Christmas cup for Starbucks this year . The coffee chain 's latest holiday design lets customers color it in themselves .
The cups ‚Äî which are typically red-themed ‚Äî were available Wednesday . Cup sleeves to go with them are red .
A plainer red cup from 2015 spurred an outcry from critics upset that it lacked snowflakes , reindeer or specific symbols of Christmas . Even President Donald Trump , who was a candidate at the time , suggested boycotting the chain .
This year the cups feature splashes of red and green amid illustrations of presents , snowflakes and a Christmas tree with star on top . But the black-and white illustration is mainly blank for customers to personalize .
‚Äú We hope they 'll color it in to represent what the holidays mean to them , ‚Äù said Leanne Fremar , a creative director at the company .
Reaction was predictably mixed , with some people tweeting that they loved it , some saying they were disappointed and wanted red ones , and others just joking about what this year 's controversy would be .
Starbucks said it started working on the design in January and decided to go with a color-in version because it said many customers liked to draw on them . The Seattle-based chain said most of its nearly 5,000 U.S. locations will have colored pencils available for customers to borrow .
Last year , it released about a dozen holiday cups that were designed by its customers . The holiday cups have been released since 1997 .

Colorado is facing a major shortage of foster parents , with a new analysis finding the state needs 1,200 more foster families within the next two years .
Nearly 10,000 children spent time in foster care last year , either with foster families or in group homes or residential care centers . On average , 14 children each day are removed from their parents and placed temporarily in the child welfare system , according to data released Tuesday by the Colorado Department of Human Services .
‚Äú You can be single ; you can be married , ‚Äù said Luis Guzman , acting director of the state Office of Children , Youth and Families . ‚Äú You can own your home ; you can rent your home . You can have tons of parenting experience ; you can have no parenting experience . All that matters is that you are 21 years old and you are able to open your heart and your home to a child in need in Colorado . ‚Äù
While there are 5,000 children now in out-of-home-placements , Colorado has just 2,000 certified foster families . The shortage means children are more likely to move to a foster family in another county , away from their school , sports teams , activities and friends . It also means they are more likely to split up from the siblings .
‚Äú It 's crucial for us to recruit in a variety of communities in Colorado , ‚Äù Guzman said . ‚Äú When there are n't foster homes in a variety of communities , we end up moving kids to different locations , to different schools . That just enhances the trauma and the difficulty they have . ‚Äù
The number of children placed in foster care has increased steadily in the last three years . Meanwhile , Colorado child welfare officials have tried to shift more children into homes and out of the more institutional options of group homes and residential facilities .
While the amount of time children and teens spend in group homes and residential centers has decreased , the number of children placed in those ‚Äú congregate care ‚Äù options has not , Guzman said .
The state is in extreme need of foster families who are Latino , black and American Indian , or who identify as gay , queer or transgender . Almost 2,000 of the state 's 5,000 children currently placed in foster care are Hispanic , yet Colorado has only 450 foster families who identify as Hispanic .
The system currently has 600 children who are black , but about 200 black foster parents , according to the new data .
The state Division of Child Welfare has notified counties and child placement agencies the state needs a pool of 2,500 foster families by July 2019 , a goal reached by retaining 75 percent of currently certified parents and recruiting 1,200 new ones . ‚Äú This is the number we need in order to make sure that all the kids in Colorado who need foster homes get foster homes , ‚Äù Guzman said .
State officials said no data is available to show how many children and teens who could have gone to a foster family went to a residential care center or group home because of the foster parent shortage .
The state recently sent $ 100,000 in grants to county child welfare departments and child placement agencies for marketing and recruitment efforts and has an additional $ 100,000 in grant funding to dispense .

The Basics of Making a Save
By Coach Damon on November 14 , 2016 Saves , Techniques Posted In : Lacrosse Goalie
Every lacrosse goalie has to start somewhere . If you 're brand new to this position and are looking for the basics on how to make a save , this post is for you .
Even if you are a more experienced goalie who has gotten away from the basics , reviewing this post can help you improve your save percentage by getting back to the fundamentals of making a save .
I always recommend that experienced goalies who are going through a slump to get back to the basics .
Lacrosse goalie can be a very complex position but let 's break down the save in the simplest way we can ‚Äì a full anatomy of a lacrosse save if you will .
Before I start with the basics of making a save , be sure to get protected . An injured goalie ca n't make saves and feeling protected will increase your confidence . So before you step into goal be sure to strap on all the required lacrosse goalie gear and perhaps even some optional protective gear .

Get Setup in a Proper Lacrosse Goalie Stance
In many different sports there is a ‚Äú ready position ‚Äù . For lacrosse goalies that is no different and its extremely important that goalies are in a good , athletic ready position prior to the shot .
The ready position is the foundation for all your saves . A good ready position gives you the best chance to make a save . It puts your body into an athletic position ready to spring and explode towards shots .
Here are the 7 elements of a perfect lacrosse goalie stance :
Feet a little wider than shoulder width apart Bent Knees Arms out and away from body Proper grip on the stick Straight , flat back with slight bend at the hips Hands well positioned Body Relaxed
What you 'll notice about different lacrosse goalies at the top levels is that there are several different styles of play , and all can be successful .
So instead of obsessing over the 7 elements , I encourage lacrosse goalies to ask themselves this question : are you in an athletic position ?
If you 're having trouble with a particular type of save , it 's often because your ready stance is missing one or more of these elements .
Check out a few top level goalies and their ready stances . Try to imitate this in your own ready stance .
So the first step in lacrosse goalie save basics is to get into a good ready stance .
Position Yourself Properly on the Arc
Sometimes making a save is all about being in the right place at the right time . That means being in the right place on the goalie arc .
A lacrosse shot is fast , especially in today 's game where stick technology and stronger players has upped the average velocity us goalies must face .
The idea of the lacrosse goalie arc is being setup in the right position to limit the amount of movement you need to reach the shot .
For beginning goalies I recommend you start with a traditional arc that has 5 points ‚Äì pipe left , 45¬∞ left , top center , 45¬∞ right , pipe right .
Represented visually the traditional 5 point arcs looks like this :
Properly positioning yourself on the arc is something that 's done pre-shot that will give you the highest chance to make the save .
For the beginner goalie , the objective is to be directly in the center of the goal from the shooter 's perspective . This allows the goalie to efficiently cover every single inch of the 6‚Ä≤ by 6‚Ä≤ goal .
We want to limit the amount of movement along the arc because when a goalie is moving from point to point on the arc they 're not in the ready position . Therefore we use the 5 point arc vs. constantly moving every time an attackman dodges .
Notice how in the picture below of MLL goalie Jordan Burke he 's splitting the cage directly in half from the shooter 's perspective . As you 'd expect from a pro , he 's also in a great ready stance .
Wherever we are on the arc we want to be square to the shooter . This means our toes , our knees , our shoulders and our face mask are all pointed at the shooter .
Being comfortable finding your spot on the goalie arc and fluidly moving from one spot to another on the arc takes a lot of practice .
As you get more advanced you can consider different lacrosse goalie arcs , such as the flat arc popular in today 's game . But for beginners I recommend the 5 point traditional arc .
Top Hand Drives Straight to the Ball
First a definition ‚Äì our ‚Äú top hand ‚Äù is the right hand for righties , and the left hand for lefties . It controls the head of the stick and is placed right against the plastic of the head .
On the shot , the goalie drives his/her top hand straight to the ball with rattlesnake-like quickness .
Does n't matter where the shot goes ( stick side high , off stick high , off stick hip , etc . ) top hand goes in a straight line to the ball .
‚Äú Straight to the ball ‚Äù is an important concept . Many goalies have no problems moving their top hand straight to the ball with no stick . However once the stick is in their hands , all of a sudden you 'll see the top hand take indirect or circular routes to the shot .
This is especially common on off stick hip or off stick low shots .
If a shot goes to our off stick hip side the top hand should follow the red path , not the brown :
Remember the shortest distance between 2 points is a straight line : so practice moving your top hand directly to the shot .
One tip I learned from MLL pro Brian Phipps is to ‚Äú cut the clock ‚Äù on off stick saves . Meaning your top hand cuts the clock instead of moving in a circular motion like normal clock hands :
Here 's MLL goalie Scotty Rodgers practicing driving his top hand directly to the shot :
A video posted by Scotty Rodgers ( @ scottyrodg42 ) on Oct 31 , 2016 at 5:22pm PDT
Lead Foot Steps Into Path of the Shot
As we throw our top hand at the ball , we 're going to use our body to give it support .
We 'll find that if we support our hand with our body we can get our hand ( and thus our stick ‚Äì stick controls head ) to where it needs to be faster .
We 'll also put our body in position to help with a save in the event we miss the ball with our hand/stick . While the goal of every shot is to catch it in our stick , we 'll often make body saves as a result of this lead step .
So we 'll combine our lead hand with a lead step .
The simplest way to to describe the lead step is whatever side the ball is shot on , that side becomes the lead foot .
Drawing a line perpendicular to the ground down the center of body . If the shot is to the left of the line , we step with our left foot . If the shot is to the right of the line , we step with our right foot . This is our lead step .
For beginner goalies I recommend this step is at a 45-degree angle to help cut down the angle of the shot .
As goalies get more advanced you can have a look at this post to understand the different type of steps we can use : 45 degree vs lateral step : which is best ?
Finish with a Shuffle Step
When you watch video of yourself making saves , if you pause the tape at the moment you make contact with the ball , for the majority of saves , the only things that will have moved are your lead hand and lead foot .
However a lacrosse goalie must finish every save .
To finish the save I teach lacrosse goalies to use a ‚Äú shuffle step ‚Äù . The shuffle step looks like this :
With the trail foot ( i.e . foot that did not take lead step ) we 'll step and then we 'll step again with our lead foot to land in a balanced ready position .
We also finish the save with our bottom hand too . Using the bottom hand to aid in stick rotation .
Here 's another GIF of former MLL pro demonstrating the shuffle step to finish his saves .
The idea of finishing a save is to be ready to make another save in the event of a rebound or to be in a good athletic position to make an outlet pass .
Ridiculous Eye Focus on the Ball
The final element of the anatomy of save is : the lacrosse goalie needs to be incredibly focused on the ball .
From the time the ball is in the shooter 's stick until it is in your own goalie stick our eyes should be ridiculously focused on the ball .
I like the word ridiculously focused because it implies a level of focus that is extremely high .
As you 're taking warmup shots in practice or going through lacrosse goalie drills ensure that you 're ridiculously focused on the ball .
Putting It All Together
When all the elements of the save process are put together you get this :
Or this :
And perhaps this :
The lacrosse save : ai n't it a thing of beauty ?
Conclusion
The position of lacrosse goalie can get pretty complex but if you had to distill ‚Äú making a save ‚Äù down to its roots , it would be this :
Good ready position Well positioned on the arc Top hand drives to the shot Lead foot steps into shot path Shuffle step to finish the save Ridiculous Eye Focus
Whether you are brand-new goalie or an experience goalie going through a rut , learning the anatomy of making a save is critical to being a great goalie .
Once you understand the basics of making a save its time to hit the practice field . Just like you ca n't learn to swim by reading a book , you ca n't learn to make saves simply by reading this post .
It takes experience to develop your technique . Practice , practice , practice !
Until next time ! Coach Damon
Anything I missed regarding the basics of making a save ? Any questions ? Let me a comment down below .
Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) heads to the stage in Phoenix after being declared the winner in the Arizona Republican primary on Aug. 30 . ( Ross D. Franklin/AP )
Senate Republicans , for the second straight election cycle , have surrendered none of their primary fights to conservative challengers .
In doing so , they left conservative hard-liners without a single banner victory to claim as their own in recent years . And Sen . Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) increased his chances of keeping the Senate in Republican hands in 2017 by ensuring that his crop of nominees is more palatable to general-election voters .
The handy victories by Sens . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) and Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) in primaries Tuesday completed the sweep for the Republican establishment , duplicating a feat McConnell first set as a goal during the 2014 election season .
[ McCain and Rubio win their primaries , face tough fights ahead ]
The dominance by Senate Republicans could provide the road map for GOP strategists in other races , particularly future presidential campaigns . It could also mean the overall weakening of the conservative movement 's ability to raise money and pressure senators to vote their way for fear they will draw a strong primary threat .
Time and again , Senate Republicans have quashed challenges from fringe conservatives ‚Äî candidates who on paper sound a lot like Donald Trump , who overwhelmed establishment candidates in the presidential primary but has struggled to expand his message and gain traction in the general election against Hillary Clinton .
After seeing three senators fall during primaries in 2010 and 2012 and insurgents knock off establishment-backed Republicans in key seats , GOP strategists adopted an overwhelming-force doctrine for handling primary challenges . They leveraged their financial edge and set out to define the opponents early , before they could gain momentum among the conservative grass roots , using modern technology and also spending heavily on positive TV ads to improve the incumbent 's standing among conservative voters .
That strategy was considered essential in protecting GOP incumbents such as Sens . Pat Roberts of Kansas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee in the 2014 midterms .
‚Äú The culture of primaries within the Senate GOP campaign apparatus is where the entire party needs to go , ‚Äù said Josh Holmes , who was McConnell 's 2014 campaign manager and whose firm , Cavalry , worked for McCain and several Republican incumbents . ‚Äú If your job is to win elections , you do n't just throw up your hands and say , ‚Äò Gosh , I sure hope voters do n't pick the guy who ca n't possibly win . ' ‚Äù
Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( N.H. ) is the last Republican facing a primary this cycle , on Sept. 13 , but she is facing only token opposition and all sides expect her to win the nomination .
The old sports adage that winning begets winning , and the corollary that losing begets losing , might apply here . In early 2014 , a collection of Washington-based groups with ties to tea party activists were on the march , helping challengers in a clutch of primaries , including in a challenge to McConnell .
Now , after losing big in 2014 and barely engaging in 2016 , those groups are a shell of their former selves .
Take Senate Conservatives Fund , a group originally founded by Jim DeMint , the former senator from South Carolina who is the political godfather to the Republican anti-establishment movement .
In the 2012 elections , SCF raised $ 16 million , $ 6.5 million of which was steered directly into the coffers of the most-conservative candidates . An additional $ 3.5 million went to its own independent campaigns , including TV and radio ads benefiting those conservative challengers . That year , SCF helped knock off Sen. Richard Lugar ( R-Ind . ) , a 36-year veteran , and helped elect Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . ) over an establishment Republican .
In the 2014 elections , SCF raised $ 16.6 million , directing $ 5 million in contributions to candidates and spending $ 3.6 million on its independent campaign to benefit conservatives . This year , however , SCF 's finances crumbled ‚Äî as of June 30 , the group had raised just $ 4 million and spent less than $ 600,000 on its own campaign for conservatives .
With so little cash , the group focused on direct mail instead of broadcast ads , its largest expenditure being $ 65,000 in mailings to boost Darryl Glenn , a conservative who won the Colorado primary . Glenn trails Sen. Michael Bennet ( D ) badly and has been left for dead , politically speaking , by national Republicans .
SCF 's staff declined requests for comment this week about the group 's plans .
What changed , according to Holmes and other GOP establishment operatives , was the declaration from McConnell that winning the general election was the only thing mattered . ‚Äú I think we are going to crush them everywhere , ‚Äù McConnell boasted to Carl Hulse of the New York Times in March 2014 .
The establishment did n't exactly crush those conservatives everywhere . Aside from McConnell 's primary win by 30 percentage points , the GOP incumbents often won in ugly fashion , but establishment Republicans took every race of consequence in 2014 .
The ultimate win for McConnell came in Mississippi , where Sen. Thad Cochran 's narrow runoff win , boosted by African Americans crossing into the GOP fold , deflated conservatives who 'd rallied around Chris McDaniel , a state senator .
The 2016 field looked moderately promising for insurgents , given it included a trio of octogenarians with at least six Senate terms under their belt . Also , the retirement of Sen. Dan Coats ( R ) set up an ideological clash in the Indiana primary , and before Rubio reversed course to run for another term , the GOP race in Florida was fertile ground .
All those races fizzled for conservatives .
Their finances fell to a fraction of past insurgent campaigns ' , and the candidate quality was subpar . Rep. Marlin Stutzman , running in Indiana , went through multiple layers of campaign staff . Stutzman received modest help from SCF and the Club for Growth , a conservative group that remains well-stocked financially , while Rep. Todd Young 's campaign had millions of dollars in support from establishment-friendly super PACs . Young won convincingly .
[ John McCain is in the fight of his political life in the age of Donald Trump ]
In Arizona , Kelli Ward , 47 , presented quite a contrast to McCain , 80 . She is young but has experience in the state Senate and is a conservative who likes Trump and Cruz . Those two , who have both feuded publicly with McCain , combined for more than 70 percent of Arizona 's votes in its March presidential primary .
But McCain and his allies went to work early on Ward 's positions , trying to define her as a nonconservative with strange views . They highlighted her town hall on ‚Äú chemtrails , ‚Äù a conspiracy theory that airplanes spray the skies to manipulate weather and even control human minds .
McCain 's team used Internet searches to distract from Ward 's message . Anyone in Arizona who searched ‚Äú Kelli Ward ‚Äù on Google or Bing found a website called ‚Äú What Kelli Ward Says ‚Äù as the first click . It was filled with negative items paid for by McCain 's campaign .
‚Äú The establishment has won this battle by spending untold millions to call me liberal , dangerous and weak , ‚Äù Ward said Tuesday night in her concession speech , adding , ‚Äú I hope the senator can rest comfortably with his conscience . ‚Äù
It was n't pretty , but McCain won and Republicans have their best chance at keeping the seat in the red column in November . It is a different story at the top of the ticket , and many establishment Republicans look at these Senate races as the petri dish for how to get a more palatable candidate in the next presidential primary .
Correction : An earlier version of this post misidentified the Republican who won the Colorado primary .

The New York City Council is considering creating a task force to address the impacts of shadows from megatowers over Central Park .
The Committee on Parks and Recreation held a hearing on the issue Thursday .
Super tall residential towers near the south side of Central Park are topping out at over 1,000 feet , and more are in the works .
Kate Slevin of the Municipal Arts Society said each additional super tall skyscraper will cast a shadow that could reach a half a mile long at certain times of the day and year .
‚Äú Most of them are being constructed as of right ( now ) without any public or environmental review , ‚Äù Slevin said .
Kate Wood of the group Landmark West said the buildings could have a negative impact on the fauna of the park .
‚Äú The feeding frenzy of real estate developers must not be allowed to damage the jewel of New York City , ‚Äù Wood said .
But Luke Wilson of the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox , which works on the high-rises , said people are n't looking at the cumulative effect of these shadows , 1010 WINS ' Steve Kastenbaum reported .
‚Äú Tall , skinny buildings have a much smaller new shadow duration impact as compared to the short wide buildings , ‚Äù Wilson said .
Under a bill sponsored by Councilman Mark Levine , the task force would study the issue and report back at the end of every year .
It turns out you might work harder if you think you 'll be fired than if you 're expecting a raise .
Researchers at the University of Nottingham 's School of Psychology published a study in the Journal of Neuroscience demonstrating that punishment can be an effective performance enhancer .
‚Äú This work reveals important new information about how the brain functions that could lead to new methods of diagnosing neural development disorders , such as autism , ADHD , and personality disorders , where decision making processes have been shown to be compromised , ‚Äù study leader Dr. Marios Philiastides said in a press release .
Philiastides ' team sought to test how well humans make decisions based on vague information , such as sights and sounds , and how the idea of punishment affects that decision making .
How Punishment Helps Us Perform
To see what happens in a person 's brain when he or she makes a decision , researchers used an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) : essentially a rubber swimmer 's cap fitted with electrodes that measure electrical activity in the brain .
Study participants were hooked up to the EEG and given a simple task : determine whether a blurred shape behind a rainy window is a human or something else . If a participant guessed incorrectly , he or she was fined .
Researchers found that participants gave more correct answers as the fine amount increased . To the researchers , this suggested that punishment increases a person 's performance in much the way a reward does .
The EEG machine revealed that distinct parts of the brain became active when the punishment was applied . Researchers said the timing of this activation showed that the punishment does n't influence how the brain processes evidence , but it does impact how the brain decodes information at a later stage in the decision making process .
The study subjects who improved the accuracy of their guesses the most also showed the greatest changes in brain activity . Further research may reveal precisely why some people respond better to rewards for good behavior while others respond more strongly to punishment for bad behavior .
Autism , ADHD , and Decision-Making
Scientists are continually exploring how the human brain works and how to make it work better . There 's been extensive research into behavioral disorders , including autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
The current understanding is that people with these disorders have problems with information processing in their brains . This is why children with autism and ADHD may exhibit social and developmental delays .
Just as Philiastides said , future research into how the brain reacts to rewards and punishments could help experts get a better handle on these conditions and make everyday life decisions easier for patients in need .

Amarinder Singh said that Punjab was heading towards a financial emergency
Congress Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday reminded Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the promise the PM made to Punjabi farmers in Gujarat during a public rally in Jagraon about a year ago .
He also condemned Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal for his silence and for forgetting the plight of the Punjabi farmers who are being hounded out of Gujarat by force and intimidation .
In a statement issued on Friday , Amarinder said : ‚Äú What to speak of the Gujarat government withdrawing the appeal from the Supreme Court of India against the Gujarat High Court order that was in favour of the Punjabi farmers , they are now being hounded out through force and intimidation . ‚Äù
The former chief minister referred to the January 25 incident in the Bhuj area of Gujarat , where Punjabi farmers was attacked by locals and the land mafia .
Moreover , the police booked the victim for the incident instead of taking action against the attackers .
Amarinder said that Modi , during his Jagraon rally , had promised that his government will not press on with the appeal in the Supreme Court .
The Captain disclosed that not only has the appeal not been withdrawn , but the farmers ' accounts also remain frozen .
He said the Gujarat government had already created conditions to compel the farmers to flee . When the Punjabi farmers tried to stand their ground , locals with the backing of mafia , goons and police are physically intimidating them to ensure that they leave .
Fiscal emergency
Reacting to Amarinder Singh 's statement made on Thursday regarding fiscal emergency in the state , Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Friday said that the Lok Sabha MP from Amritsar must first try to set his party in order rather than worrying about issues of governance .
Singh condemned Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal ( pictured ) for his silence
Badal said : ‚Äú Before issuing such baseless statements , Amarinder and state Congress chief Partap Singh Bajwa must try and stop the ongoing infighting in their party . Healthy criticism by the Opposition is always welcome but criticising just for the sake of it is undesirable and unwarranted . ‚Äù
He also called upon the entire Opposition to play a constructive role in making Punjab a frontrunner state in the country .
He said : ‚Äú Congress has always adopted an anti-Punjab stance due to which its development has suffered . Punjab 's economy was adversely affected due to Partition of the country and prolonged militancy . However , industries shifted out of the state after the Congress granted incentives to neighbouring states that hurt the state economy . ‚Äù
Badal said that he will soon meet Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for release of the pending Rs 400 crore , sanctioned by the 13th Finance Commission .
Saying that diversification of agriculture was the need of the hour , Badal said that the funds were needed for bailing out the farmers from the current agrarian crisis .
Morgan Freeman is hopeful about a Donald Trump presidency .
Though the 79-year-old actor endorsed and voted for Hillary Clinton in the election , he hopes that Trump 's winning attitude will make him ‚Äú a good president . ‚Äù
‚Äú As for politics today , I supported Hillary in the election , and now it feels like we are jumping off a cliff , ‚Äù Freeman said during an interview with AARP The Magazine . ‚Äú We just have to find out how we land . I 'm not scared though . ‚Äù
‚Äú I 'm holding out hope that Donald Trump has to be a good president . He ca n't be . What I see is a guy who will not lose . ‚Äù
During the campaign , Freeman narrated advertisements for Clinton , who he believed had ‚Äú proven abilities. ‚Äù ( RELATED : Morgan Freeman Narrates New Ad For Hillary Clinton )
WATCH :
The Obama administration blocked Texas 's new law requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification at the polls , escalating a partisan dispute over voting restrictions .
The U.S. Justice Department is using its power under the Voting Rights Act to halt the Texas law , saying in a letter to the state today that the measure may disproportionately harm Hispanics . The department in December blocked a similar law in South Carolina .
Voter identification laws were passed last year in eight states . Whether the requirements are inconveniences or barriers to voting is at the core of a debate between Republican supporters who say the laws will protect election integrity , and Democrats who oppose the statutes as attempts to disenfranchise minorities and the poor .
‚Äú Even using the data most favorable to the state , Hispanics disproportionately lack either a driver 's license or a personal identification card , ‚Äù Thomas Perez , head of the Justice Department 's civil rights division , wrote in the letter to Keith Ingram , the director of elections for the Texas Secretary of State .
The Justice Department 's decision is n't final . Texas and South Carolina have filed suit in federal court in Washington seeking permission to enforce their photo ID requirements .
The law 's requirements ‚Äú entail minor inconveniences on exercising the right to vote , ‚Äù Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said in his court filing on Jan. 24 .
Obtaining Permission
Texas and South Carolina are among 16 states or portions of states that must obtain permission from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before redrawing their district lines or changing election procedures because of a history of voting rights violations .
‚Äú It 's a good sign that the Department of Justice is stepping into the jurisdictions where it can to stop these laws in their tracks , ‚Äù said Nancy Abudu , a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union 's Voting Rights Project in Atlanta .
Under the Texas law signed last year by Governor Rick Perry , voters who arrive at the polls without one of seven acceptable forms of photo IDs issued by the state or federal government , including concealed carry handgun permits , would be given a provisional ballot , according to the Texas Secretary of State 's website .
Those ballots would count only if voters bring an approved ID to the registrar 's office within six days of the election .
Disabled Voters
The law exempts mail-in ballots and voters with significant disabilities or religious objections to being photographed .
The photo ID law would disproportionately affect poor and minority voters , who are least likely to have any of the required forms of identification or the documentation needed to obtain one , said Luis Figueroa , a San Antonio , Texas-based legislative staff attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund . It also would hurt students because college or university IDs would not be accepted , Figueroa said .
The photo ID requirement could suppress minority turnout by three percent to five percent in Harris County , where Houston is located , and give Republicans an edge in local elections , said Carroll Robinson , a professor at Texas Southern University in Houston and a former city council member .
‚Äú We 're going to disenfranchise significant numbers of minority voters as they become more and more the majority in Texas , ‚Äù Robinson said .
Election ‚Äò Integrity '
Patricia Harless , a Republican state representative , said concerns among constituents about ‚Äú the integrity of elections ‚Äù rather than possible partisan advantage explains why she sponsored the voter ID measure last year . The law reduces the possibility of fraud , she said .
Lawmakers excluded student IDs because ‚Äú we wanted a form of identification that was easily recognized by the poll workers at the election site , ‚Äù Harless said .
Voters 65 and older automatically qualify to cast ballots by mail , which requires no ID , and the state will provide free voter identification cards .
‚Äú We worked really hard to make sure we met the constitutional requirements , ‚Äù Harless said .
The Voting Rights Act puts the burden on Texas to prove its law would n't interfere with minorities ' ability to vote .
The Obama administration blocked South Carolina 's law in December after concluding minorities in the state are almost 20 percent more likely to lack state-issued identification than white registered voters .
Driver 's License Data
The Justice Department asked for similar statistics from Texas , which said it does n't collect the kind of racial data needed to accurately determine how many of the state 's registered voters do n't have a driver 's license or state ID card are black or Hispanic . Texas provided data based on Hispanic surnames and no data on the impact on black voters , according to the Justice Department .
Hispanic registered voters in Texas are 47 percent to 120 percent more likely to lack the required identification than non-Hispanic voters , the Justice Department said in its letter .
Jasmine Price , a sophomore at Prairie View A & M University , a historically black college 30 miles from Houston , said the law would make it harder for her to vote in person in Texas , as she 'd prefer , rather than by absentee ballot in her home state , Arkansas .
Literacy Tests
Price , 19 , said if the law takes effect , she 'll try to find the time in between a full course load and three shifts a week as a manager at a Houston sporting goods store to drive seven miles from campus to the nearest state Department of Public Safety office that issues IDs .
‚Äú My forefathers had it even harder to vote -- they had to pass literacy tests -- but they made sure they did what they had to do so that their vote could count , ‚Äù said Price , who is black . ‚Äú So if they say I have to go to the DPS office , as much as an inconvenience as it is to go there , that 's what I 'm going to do . ‚Äù
Alabama , where the voter ID law is not scheduled to go into effect until 2014 , and Mississippi , where lawmakers have n't adopted legislation to implement a citizen initiative approving a similar requirement , would also have to obtain Justice Department or federal court approval .
In Wisconsin , which does n't need to obtain the same kind of advance approval under federal law as Texas does , a state judge temporarily blocked a voter ID requirement on March 6 . The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had sued Governor Scott Walker over the measure .
David Mitchell says series nine will definitely be the last series of sitcom Peep Show ‚Äì but he wants to leave open the option to do a geriatric special when he 's older .

Mitchell and Robert Webb will be filming the final run of the Channel 4 sitcom this summer , ready for a transmission before the end of the year .
The comedian and columnist is keeping tight-lipped about how the series will end ‚Äì although given the fact he wants to leave open the chance to do a special , it 's probably safe to assume Mark and Jeremy wo n't die .
‚Äú I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you anything about the plot , but it is definitely the last series , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú Rob , [ writers ] Sam and Jesse and I have always said , ‚Äò Who knows , when we 're all sixty , we might do a Whatever Happened to Mark and Jeremy series ' , so we 're still reserving the right to do that .
‚Äú But in terms of the show as it currently is , it 's definitely the last . I 'll be very sad to say goodbye to it , ‚Äù Mitchell said .
Peep Show , written by Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong , first aired in 2003 . 2015 will see the ninth and final series , and Channel 4 comedy boss Phil Clarke admitted last year it would leave a ‚Äú gap ‚Äù in the channel 's comedy output .
Mitchell will next be appearing on BBC1 's The Great Comic Relief Bake Off for Red Nose Day , before getting ready to film Peep Show in the summer .
‚Äú I 'm excited to be doing one last run . I 'm glad we know it 's the last one going into it , because we can make a bit of a fuss about it as we do it , and not take it for granted , ‚Äù he said .

On October 22 , 2015 , the European Court of Justice ruled that Bitcoin is a means of payment and its exchange is exempt from VAT in a landmark ruling . But a few people understand the implications of this decision . That 's why Cointelegraph decided to ask for comment an experienced bitcoin lawyer . Our expert is Stefano Capaccioli .
Stefano Capaccioli is CPA , Auditor , Tax litigator , Tax Advisor , Business Consultant , Specialized in Law & Tax on Gold , Precious Metals and Cryptocurrencies gives a professional Comment to Court Of Justice Judgement C-264/14 on bitcoin VAT exemption .
A Comment to Court Of Justice Judgment C-264/14 on bitcoin VAT exemption
The European Court of Justice gave Judgment C-264/14 on the VAT treatment of bitcoin and virtual currencies , interpreting Article 135 ( 1 ) of Directive 112/2006/EC , and in particular the letters d ) , e ) and f ) . The Judgment C-264/14 declared that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are VAT exempt as currency , although not legal tender .
This Judgment constitutes an authentic interpretation of the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC and it is applicable in all 28 Member States , harmonizing the VAT treatment of bitcoin and constitutes the first official legal document in the European Union .
The Decision is of historic importance : it clarifies all doubts and removes the confusion on the applicability of consumption taxes to bitcoin , considering cryptocurrencies as a simple means of payment and , under a VAT perspective , similar to a foreign currency .
Some of the European Union Member States ' Tax Authorities issued their own ruling : the resulting situation was quite confusing because of the dissimilar interpretations , and in particular :
Sweden : the promoter of the preliminary ruling ( Case No . 7101-13 ) , had their Tax Authority indicate that bitcoin was exempt as other currencies under Article 135 ( 1 ) letter e ) .
United Kingdom : the Tax Agency of the United Kingdom ( Her Majesty 's Revenue & Customs ) , published on March 3 , 2014 the Revenue & Customs Brief 09/14 stating that bitcoin was VAT exempt as `` other negotiable instruments '' ( Article 135 , paragraph 1 , letter d ) .
Estonia : the Estonian Tax Authority ( Maksu- Tolliamet ) published in March 2014 an interpretation of the taxation of bitcoin , ruling that bitcoin was subject to VAT ( also supported by the Court of Justice ) .
Poland : the directors of the local tax units of the Polish Tax Authority made various interpretations on bitcoin and concluded it was a taxable service .
Germany : the German Ministry of Finance , in response to the questions of the deputy Frank Shaffler ( no . 409 , July 2013 and no . 226 , September 2013 ) , ruled that bitcoin is `` private money '' denying the exemption ( also supported by the Court of Justice ) .
Belgium : the Tax Administration of Belgium with a ruling ( GTVA20141533 / TL / MP of 05/09/2014 ) considered bitcoin as a `` virtual payment system '' and that it was VAT exempt as ‚Äú other effects '' , ( Article 135 , paragraph 1 , letter d ) .
France : The Commission of the French Senate presented a Report indicating that France will support VAT exemption to avoid a repeat of the VAT frauds in emissions trading system ( carbon credits ) .
Finland : the Keskusverolautakunnan ( LKT ) - Central Committee of the taxes - issued a Ruling on VAT on commissions earned by the intermediary of virtual currency , considering bitcoin similar to a means of payment under VAT Directive and consequently VAT exempt ( Article 135 , paragraph 1 , letter d ) .
Spain : the Direccion General De Tributos ( DGT ) - Secretaria de Estado de Hacienda , ruled on March 30 , 2015 with Consulta Vinculante n. V1029-15 that bitcoin is `` other negotiable '' and VAT exempt in accordance with art . 135.1 d ) .
The opinion of Advocate General Kokott , delivered on July 16 2015 , stressed :
‚Äú currencies currently used as legal tender ( ... ) have no other practical use than as a means of payment . Their function in a transaction is simply to facilitate trade in goods in an economy ; as such , however , they are not consumed or used as goods ‚Äù .
Therefore , for VAT purposes , the pure means of payment perform the same function as legal tender and as such must , in accordance with the principle of fiscal neutrality in the form of the principle of equal treatment , be treated the same way .
The Court of Justice adheres to this innovative principle and , considering applicable the principles of the First National Bank of Chicago ( Judgment C-172/96 ) , declares certain types of transactions VAT exempt under Article 135 ( 1 ) letter e ) . This ECJ never interpreted this letter .
The Judgment considered irrelevant the presence of `` legal tender '' for currencies , if the means of payment has no other purpose other than a means of payment , although on a contractual or voluntary basis .
The Member States VAT laws must take into consideration this interpretation and particularly paragraph 51 of the Judgment :
‚Äú It therefore follows from the context and the aims of Article 135 ( 1 ) ( e ) that to interpret that provision as including only transactions involving traditional currencies would deprive it of part of its effect . ‚Äù
So possible reference to legal tender or to traditional value shall not be compliant with VAT directive .
This Judgment will certainly have a significant impact on the cryptocurrencies ecosystem geopolitical scenario , as it is the first step in creating a stable and reliable legal framework , at least on VAT .
In the European Union consumers will buy bitcoins without any taxation and will be treated as means of payment until they can not be used for other purposes . Other countries have different approaches because of existing rules : they run the risk to depress innovation ( in Norway , Singapore and Australia the purchase of bitcoin is subject to indirect taxes ) .
The Judgment is the practical demonstration that bitcoin needs no specific regulation , but only the interpretation of existing legislation because bitcoin does not fall in any legal vacuum .
This position could also have an impact on future technological developments such as smart contracts ( computer protocols that facilitate , verify , or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract , or that obviate the need for a contractual clause ) , blockchain technology-based systems , integration with banking , insurance systems , and the Internet-of-Things .
Many of these protocols will be based on units of account ( tokens ) similar to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies . The Judgment will allow VAT exempt movement of units of account for the payment of goods and/or services or for Internet-of-Things ( IoT ) connected devices . In any case , the products/services provided will follow the normal VAT rules . These scenarios are subject to growing challenges for the interpreter in an interconnected world where regulatory barriers and borders are becoming ever so thinner . However it is great for bitcoin and its future that the EU is taking a stance on VAT , this should at least allow for other countries and regions to have a precedent to consider when making their own interpretations and conclusions .

A beach safety official for Camber Sands has been accused of blaming the deaths of seven people who drowned there last summer on their race .
At an inquest into the deaths of five young men of Tamil origin who drowned at the popular beach near Rye in East Sussex last August , Robert Cass , a coastal officer employed by Rother district council to supervise the beach , was asked about his emphasis on the race of those who drowned .
Five men dead after being pulled from the sea at Camber Sands Read more
Last July just weeks before the drownings of the five young Tamil men , Mohit Dupar , 36 , from Hayes , west London , tried to reach Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz , 19 , as he got into difficulty but both men died
An incident log written by Cass after last July 's drownings stated : ‚Äú We are again faced with incidents of non-swimming persons of a certain culture that enter the water in great numbers with deadly results . The combination of a beach as shallow as Camber attracting predominantly non-British visitors has been an increasing issue over the last 10 years and the risks that these people create upon their lack of ability in being ‚Äò tempted in ' to such a shallow bay are becoming unsustainable and unfair for us to deal with or carry the burden of responding to . ‚Äù
Cass described the changing demographics of beach visitors . He said that when he first began working for Rother district council in 2004 the demographic was mostly white British , with many visitors staying in the nearby Pontins holiday park . He said that more European migrants had come into our society and the beach reflected that .
He said : ‚Äú There are also London communities , specifically Asian communities , coming down to enjoy a nice day on our beach . That progressively has been for those of us who work on the beach , a significant change . Unfortunately the observations of all of us are that specifically , for whatever reason , Asian communities are far more vulnerable in terms of water safety . ‚Äù
The five men who died last August were Kenugen Saththiyanathan , 18 , known as Ken ; his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan , 22 , known as Kobi , both from Erith , south-east London ; and their friends Nitharsan Ravi , 22 , of Plumstead , south-east London ; Inthushan Sriskantharasa , 23 , of Grays , Essex ; and Gurushanth Srithavarajah , 27 , of Welling , south-east London .
Patrick Roche , the barrister representing the relatives of the five men , asked Cass : ‚Äú Are you going to stop attributing the deaths to the race of those who died ? ‚Äù
Cass said : ‚Äú My job is to tell it as it is . I put that message to everyone in good faith . ‚Äù
Cass said a similar tragedy to the drownings could happen again despite the introduction of lifeguards to the beach for the first time this summer . Cass was asked what the council had learned from the tragedies . He said : ‚Äú I do n't think Rother can learn anything per se about the incidents of last summer . Unfortunately the sad thing is I fear it can happen again . ‚Äù
He said he did not feel that the introduction of lifeguards would necessarily increase protection . ‚Äú My personal view is that even with lifeguards the same thing would have happened because of the density of numbers in the water , ‚Äù he said .
When coroner Alan Craze asked why Rother district council did not accept a recommendation by Royal National Lifeboat Institute in 2013 and an earlier recommendation in 2009 to introduce lifeguards to the beach , Cass said : ‚Äú That 's a decision that was taken over my head . In an ideal world it would have been a luxury I would like to have had . ‚Äù
‚Äú I slightly wonder if the eye was taken off the ball , ‚Äù said Craze .
Before the seven deaths last summer ‚Äì two in July and five in August - there had been two previous drownings at Camber Sands ‚Äì Tanzeela Ajmal , 31 , in July 2012 and Thatchayiny Segar , 30 , in July 2015 .
Asked if there was a review of the need for lifeguards after Segar died three years after Ajmal 's drowning , Cass said : ‚Äú Not that I 'm aware . ‚Äù
When asked by Roche about what lessons could be learned after nine deaths over a four-year period at Camber Sands , Cass said : ‚Äú There 's a massive need for pre-arrival education . ‚Äù
The coroner is planning to make recommendations to government at the conclusion of the inquest to improve beach safety and prevent future similar deaths .
‚Äú The only comfort the families can take away with them is that steps have been taken to stop someone else in the future going through the appalling things they have gone through , ‚Äù he said .
Rother district council agreed in February to allocate ¬£51,000 in its 2017-18 budget to bring in seasonal lifeguard cover following demands for safety to be increased at Camber , which can attract up to 25,000 visitors during peak holiday season .
Pathologist Brett Lockyer concluded that all five men had died as a result of drowning .
The hearing continues .

Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans knelt during the playing of the national anthem on Sunday before the Bucs took on the Chicago Bears .
Evans had not previously appeared among the NFL players taking part in Colin Kaepernick 's protest .
# Bucs WR Mike Evans explains why he will sit during the National Anthem . Protest started today during ‚Äú Salute to Service ‚Äù . # anthemprotest pic.twitter.com/0ZZ1diz4CE ‚Äî Kevin ODonnell Fox13 ( @ ODonnellFox13 ) November 14 , 2016
Unlike the others who labeled their gestures a response to police violence or racism , Evans protests Donald Trump . ‚Äú I do n't want to , you know , disrespect the veterans or anything , ‚Äù he explained after the game . ‚Äú The men and women who serve this country , I 'm forever indebted to them . But the things that 's been going on in America lately , I 'm not going to stand for that . When Ashton Kutcher comes out and says we 've been punked , then I 'll stand again . But I wo n't stand anymore .
‚Äú I said this a long time ago . When [ Trump ] ran , I thought it was a joke , and the joke continues . I 'm not a political person that much , but I got common sense . And I know when something 's not right . ‚Äù
Evans also said that his protest drew opposition from the crowd . He claimed , ‚Äú I heard it a little bit and it was from the people that I expected it to be from . ‚Äù
Who exactly did he expect it from ?
Evans made sure to point out that the aim of his protest did not pertain to the military . His method of protest did not pertain to the presidency , either . Since when did ‚Äú The Star Spangled Banner ‚Äù replace ‚Äú Hail to the Chief ‚Äù as a symbol of the American presidency ?

Mark Winterbottom has criticised Supercars rookie Alex Rullo after claiming a late incident ruined his race at the Winton Super Sprint .
The 2015 champion appeared to be on course for sixth position before losing several spots while trying to lap Rullo following a Safety Car restart with 13 laps remaining .
Rullo was third in the queue of cars when the race resumed behind the Red Bulls of Shane van Gisbergen and Jamie Whincup .
The 16-year-old quickly let Fabian Coulthard , Scott McLaughlin and Cameron Waters through .
Having been on the outside of Turn 1 , Rullo emerged on the apex of Turn 2 just when Winterbottom caught up to the rear of the # 62 Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport Commodore .
Winterbottom lost several positions trying to pass Rullo before eventually coming home in 13th position .
The criticism of Rullo , who is the youngest driver in the series ' history , follows similar complaints about backmarkers from the The Bottle-O Racing driver involving Aaren Russell and Kurt Kostecki in 2016 .
Stewards elected against conducting an investigation into the incident for a breach of rules .
Winterbottom also criticised the Supercars Suprlicence system , with Rullo awarded a special dispensation to compete this year .
‚Äú We were going alright in that race . We were P6 on the road or whatever but it 's just frustrating , ‚Äù said Winterbottom .
‚Äú They 've got this licence criteria and it 's just stupid , parking up on an apex with 20 cars coming at you .
‚Äú It ruined my race . He 's still a lap down , finishes last , it does n't affect his day .
‚Äú We would have finished fifth or sixth where we were and then I got damage when I had to go around him on the marbles .
‚Äú In the race we were doing the quickest first and last sector so we were quite quick until the incident . ‚Äù
In response to Winterbottom 's comments Rullo felt he had acted accordingly in the situation , claiming he ‚Äò could n't have done batter job ' with the fast approaching traffic .
‚Äú It 's one of those things that happened . He ( Mark Winterbottom ) can blame it on whatever he wants , but you have good races and you have bad races , ‚Äù Rullo told Speedcafe.com .
‚Äú I did n't have a particularly good race either , but I 'm not going to throw the blame on Simona for turning me around at the start . I just had a bad race .
‚Äú He called me out about it , but I 'm not too fussed about it . I 'm switched on enough to know what 's right and what 's wrong .
‚Äú From my point of view , with the restart I was just behind the two Triple Eight cars . I did n't get my lap back , so it put me a lap down and put me in the position of restarting the race from third ,
‚Äú I had the two Penske guys behind me , and I did n't want to potentially wreck the finish of the race between the Penske and the Triple Eight guys .
‚Äú Frosty tried to go around the outside , and I think he got on the marbles and ran wide .
‚Äú There was nothing else I could have done at that point , given the position I was put in , I do n't think I could have done a better job .
‚Äú I had to wait for most of the guys , and obviously some of them do get upset when things do n't go their way .
‚Äú The stewards and the officials did n't seem to see any problems , so that says a lot . ‚Äù
Rullo finished a lap down in 27th position .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) - The days of buying pornographic videos with names based on Ben & Jerry 's ice cream flavors are over .
Caballero Video has agreed to stop marketing `` Boston Cream Thigh , '' `` Peanut Butter D-Cup '' and other films spoofing the names of the venerable Vermont ice cream maker 's products .
The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the agreement settles a lawsuit Ben & Jerry 's brought against Caballero last year .
According to the suit , 10 titles in Caballero 's `` Ben & Cherry 's '' series besmirched the ice cream maker 's name and infringed its trademark .
Not only were the names similar to real Ben & Jerry 's products , but the films ' packaging also mimicked Ben & Jerry 's clouds-and-cows logo .
The Los Angeles-based video company previously agreed to pull the titles until the suit was resolved .
Reverse chronology is a method of story-telling whereby the plot is revealed in reverse order .
In a story employing this technique , the first scene shown is actually the conclusion to the plot . Once that scene ends , the penultimate scene is shown , and so on , so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically .
Many stories employ flashback , showing prior events , but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc. , a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc .
As a hypothetical example , if the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk was told using reverse chronology , the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant . The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life . Later , we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans , then , at the end of the film , being sent off by his mother to sell the cow .
Purpose [ edit ]
The unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature . For example , Memento features a man with anterograde amnesia , meaning he is unable to form new memories . The film parallels the protagonist 's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order , leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene ( which , played in reverse chronological order , will not be revealed until later ) as the protagonist is .
In the film Irr√©versible , an act of homicidal violence takes place at the start of the movie ( i. e. , it is the final event to take place ) . During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance , but what exactly is being avenged . The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature ; had the scenes been shown in chronological order , this violent content would make it a simple , and pointlessly brutal , revenge movie . However , as it is , told in reverse , the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action , and there is often `` more than meets the eye . ''
Examples of use [ edit ]
Literature [ edit ]
The epic poem Aeneid , written by Virgil in the 1st century BC , uses reverse chronology within scenes . [ 1 ] In `` The Three Apples '' , a murder mystery in the One Thousand and One Nights , the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story . [ 2 ] The action of W. R. Burnett 's novel , Goodbye to the Past ( 1934 ) , moves continually from 1929 to 1873 . [ 3 ] The Long View ( 1956 ) by Elizabeth Jane Howard describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926 . [ 4 ] Edward Lewis Wallant uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in The Human Season ( 1960 ) . [ 5 ] The novel Christopher Homm ( 1965 ) , by C. H. Sisson , is also told in reverse chronology . [ 6 ]
Philip K. Dick , in his 1967 novel Counter-Clock World , describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse , resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves ( `` old-birth '' ) , living their lives in reverse , eventually ending in returning to the womb , and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man . The novel was expanded from Dick 's short story `` Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday '' , first published in the August 1966 edition of Amazing Stories .
Martin Amis 's 1991 novel Time 's Arrow tells the story of a man who , it seems , brings dead people to life . Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards , and he was a doctor at Auschwitz who brought death to live people . He escaped to the United States , and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth . Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a `` certain paragraph '' from Kurt Vonnegut 's Slaughterhouse Five ( 1969 ) in mind . As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore , the protagonist , Billy Pilgrim , watches a war movie backwards . American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them ; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States , reduced to ore and buried . The American fliers became high school kids again , and , Billy guesses , Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood .
Iain Banks 's novel Use of Weapons interweaves two parallel stories , one told in standard chronology and one in reverse , both concluding at a critical moment in the main character 's life .
Julia Alvarez 's novel How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic . The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order , with the last events happening in 1956 . [ 7 ]
Theatre [ edit ]
A number of plays have employed this technique . George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart 's 1934 play , Merrily We Roll Along , is told in reverse order , as is the Harold Pinter play Betrayal ( 1978 ) . Kaufman and Hart 's play was adapted as a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim in 1981 , and Pinter 's play was made into a film in 1983 .
Film [ edit ]
In 1927 , Jean Epstein 's La glace √† trois faces ( The Three Sided Mirror ) features a sequence where the events happen in reverse , beginning with the protagonist 's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance . The Czech comedy Happy End ( 1966 ) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother 's womb . [ 8 ] Atom Egoyan , influenced by Pinter 's plays , tells the story of The Sweet Hereafter ( 1997 ) in reverse chronology , with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968 . [ 9 ] The technique was later employed in Peppermint Candy ( 2000 ) , by South Korean director Lee Chang-dong ; in Memento ( 2000 ) , a mystery directed by Christopher Nolan about short term memory loss ; and in Jean-Luc Godard 's short film De l'origine du XXIe si√®cle pour moi ( 2000 ) . [ 10 ] In Irr√©versible ( 2002 ) , the technique is used so thoroughly that the end credits are not only shown at the beginning of the movie , but they roll down the screen , rather than upwards as is familiar .
The first several scenes in 2003 's film Identity , starring John Cusack , occur in reverse order .
The 2004 film 5x2 , directed by Fran√ßois Ozon , tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology . [ 11 ]
In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( 2004 ) , a main substory is told in reverse .
Coup de Sang , a French film by Jean Marboeuf ( 2006 ) , uses limited reverse chronology . The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene , although it is not revealed who will be killed or why .
In the 2007 movie P.S . I Love You , the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy ( Gerard Butler ) meets and courts Holly ( Hilary Swank ) are shown in reverse . [ 12 ]
In the 2010 Tamil movie , Manmadan Ambu , the song `` Neela Vaanam '' ( visuals inspired by Coldplay 's `` The Scientist '' ) is shown in a reverse sequence .

The made-for-television drama Two Friends ( 1986 ) , by Jane Campion , and the 1997 episode , `` The Betrayal '' , of the hit sitcom Seinfeld , employs the technique . The Seinfeld episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play Betrayal and has a character named `` Pinter . `` [ 10 ] `` Redrum '' , a 2000 episode of The X-Files , uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience . The 2002 ER episode `` Hindsight '' uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident . A 1997-Star Trek : Voyager episode , `` Before and After '' , which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a Martin Amis novel Time 's Arrow , also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience . The Sealab 2021 episode `` Shrabster '' is also in reverse order . For a few seasons , the revived Doctor Who had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions ' daughter ( River Song ) from the future based on `` opposite timelines '' ( i.e. , as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path , River was travelling on an opposite path ) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order . In 2017 , the British tv mini-series Rellik ( Killer backwards ) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order . In 2018 , the episode `` Once Removed '' , from the series Inside No . 9 uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house , and the murder that subsequently begins . Also from 2018 , the second installment of the FX anthology series American Crime Story focuses on the assassination of designer Gianni Versace , employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace 's killer Andrew Cunanan .
Comics [ edit ]
The story `` The Time Eater '' from issue 40 of the comic `` Vampirella '' , scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975 , included the concept of human lives running backwards . People were shown to be exhumed , reunited with families , separated from their spouses in order to attend school , and finally returned to the womb . Dialogue was reversed also . Alan Moore 's 1983 short story `` The Reversible Man '' from issue 308 of the comic `` 2000AD '' told an ordinary man 's life backwards , using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative . Brian K. Vaughan wrote an issue of the ongoing Midnighter series told in reverse chronology . The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation . The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order , but rather the individual pages run backwards .
Issue 43 of Bongo 's `` Simpsons Comics '' is told in reverse order : the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake ; each subsequent scene ( which lasts for one page ) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place , for instance , `` 20 minutes earlier '' . The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows Homer Simpson as a child
Anime [ edit ]
The 2007 anime television series Touka Gettan employed entirely this narrative method . All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order , with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning .
Music [ edit ]
The lyrics to `` All Along the Watchtower '' , written by Bob Dylan , are , he says , `` in a rather reverse order '' ; indeed , the final verse begins with the words `` All along the watchtower '' , and if reversed , the verses would tell the story in the correct order . [ citation needed ]
The lyrics to `` Apparition . Apparitions . '' by Trophy Scars describe the events leading up to a woman 's suicide in reverse order , beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend .
The song `` One Thing Leads to Another '' by the Pet Shop Boys ( on a limited release of their 1993 album Very ) describes the events leading up to a man 's death in reverse order .
Multiple music videos , including Coldplay 's `` The Scientist '' use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally . This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards . The music video for Enigma 's `` Return to Innocence '' uses reverse chronology showing a man 's life , beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant . The music video for Linkin Park 's `` Bleed It Out '' also uses the same method , whereas the band performs normally , but everything else is reversed . In 2016 , Malaysian singer-songwriter Yuna used reverse chronology in her music video `` Lanes '' .
The events of the song `` Reverse '' by SomeKindaWonderful , as said in the title itself , are told in reverse chronology .
The lyrics in `` Rewind '' by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology , with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order .
`` Good Mistake '' Album by Bahram Nouraei is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method . [ 13 ]
There have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam `` Manmadan Ambu '' ( sung by Kamal Haasan himself ) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay 's The Scientist . The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar 's ( Kamal 's character ) French wife Juliet , in reverse .
Video games [ edit ]
The announcement trailer of 2011 video game , Dead Island , also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video . [ 14 ]

With less than a week to go before the start of India 's first Test against England , the BCCI and ECB have not signed the Memorandum of Understanding , a standard agreement that details various aspects of bilateral series .
The main reason for the delay in signing the MoU is that the BCCI is awaiting directions from the Lodha Committee . A big part of the MoU says the BCCI will bear all the costs pertaining to the England team during the tour . Normally the BCCI would directly approve such expenses , but because of the order passed by the Supreme Court on October 21 , the board has to get approval from the Lodha Committee , which has been appointed to oversee all financial transactions of the BCCI .
In its response to the BCCI , however , the Lodha Committee said forming cricket policy was not part of its remit , but that directions regarding payments could only be given after the BCCI provided more information about the transactions . The committee has given the BCCI five days to respond with details of various contracts the board said it needed to finalise in the next year to avoid disruption of daily business .
But before proceeding with the matter of existing and future BCCI contracts , including the MoU with the ECB , the Lodha Committee reminded the board that an unequivocal undertaking was required from the president Anurag Thakur that the BCCI would implement the court order of October 21.The court had asked Thakur and board secretary Ajay Shirke to file affidavits in two weeks from October 21 and appear before the committee . As of November 3 , Thakur had not given such an undertaking and he and Shirke had not met the committee either .
BCCI and ECB officials were not available for comment about whether an unsigned MoU could jeopardise England 's tour of India , but an official from another board said an international tour could still proceed without it . An MoU is only used in case of a dispute between the two boards involved in a bilateral series .
In an email on Thursday to BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke , the Lodha Committee asked the board to obey the three orders the Supreme Court passed on July 18 , October 7 and 21 . `` To avoid any hindrance to the cricketing calendar and to ensure the continued enjoyment of the sport by its aficionados , the BCCI would be well advised to comply with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its orders dated 18th July 2016 , 7th October 2016 and 21st October 2016 , '' the committee e-mail said .
On October 21 , the Supreme Court had directed the BCCI not to distribute funds to state associations until they agreed to comply with the Lodha Committee 's recommendations , which the court had approved in an order on July 18 . The court also asked Shirke and Thakur to meet the Lodha Committee by November 3 and placed several restrictions on the board 's ability to enter into contracts .
The committee had already sent Thakur an email reminder earlier this week and it told Shirke on Thursday : `` The requirement for such an undertaking is not a mere formality . In the absence of the undertaking , the Committee finds it difficult to implement the order of the Supreme Court by issuing necessary directions to BCCI . ''
On October 28 , Shirke had sent an email to the committee , asking for intervention on a `` priority basis '' because failing to do so would `` severely prejudice '' cricket operations . Shirke told the committee that decisions concerning a lot of important contracts had been left pending .
Among the contracts mentioned was the postponed IPL tender , finalising vendors for the IPL and international and domestic cricket , and title and shirt sponsorships for the India men 's team . Shirke also said the BCCI needed clarity regarding the `` threshold value '' , above which the contracts needed to go through the Lodha Committee as mandated by the Supreme Court order . The court also asked the committee to appoint an independent auditor to oversee the BCCI 's transactions .
Shirke said that since the court had appointed the Committee as the `` custodian of revenue and finances '' of the BCCI , it should act immediately . The board , Shirke said , feared that the `` uncertainty '' might have already `` devalued '' the size of the bids expected for the IPL television and digital rights .
In its response today , the committee told Shirke that finalising vendors was not its job . `` Please note that neither identification nor appointment of vendors or contractors is the task or function of the Committee . The Committee is only required to fix a threshold value and approving awards of contracts above such threshold value . ''
In order to `` fix '' the threshold value and appoint an auditor , the committee asked Shirke to provide details of the contracts such as the value , term , expiry date of existing contract , the nature of the tender process and so on . `` It is only on examining the above that the Committee would be able to fix a threshold value and also assess the nature of work involved for appointing the independent auditor and formulating his terms of engagement , '' the committee said .
In another email , Shirke told the committee the BCCI had to give a commitment to the ECB regarding incurring expenses for England 's tour of India . He asked the committee to set the terms and conditions and the `` manner in which '' the agreement should be executed . Shirke had also written to the five state associations hosting the England Tests , asking if they had enough funds to stage the matches .
The Committee , however , said that framing the MoU was not part of the court 's order . `` The proposed MoU between BCCI and ECB concerns bilateral cricketing policy , the formulation of which is not a part of the mandate of the Committee . As far as payments are concerned , if they are to be made directly by the BCCI , no directions can be given by this Committee until relevant details are furnished by the BCCI . ''
It is understood that Shirke sent the committee the unsigned MoU via email late on November 3 evening , but despite being asked for details the email did not contain what the Lodha Committee wanted .
Chappy says goodbye to the Geelong Cats .
PAUL Chapman 's departure from Geelong came after the 31-year-old was told he would play just a handful of games next season if he stayed on .
Chapman parted ways with the Cats on Thursday afternoon , but he fronted up at the club 's best and fairest count that night and received a standing ovation after addressing the 1500-strong crowd .
Prior to the function , the three-time premiership player gave some insights into the talks he had with Geelong after coming out of contract at the end of the season .
`` If I happened to get a contract for next year , they could n't guarantee any more than eight games or anything like that , because they want to play young kids and get them a taste of AFL footy , '' Chapman explained .
`` I totally understand what they 're talking about , and a 10-game thing or anything like that is not something that I 'm up for .
`` Playing VFL footy is not how I want to end it either . I 'm just looking forward and hopefully I can keep playing footy . ''
Cats coach Chris Scott confirmed that the negotiations between the club and Chapman centred around the 2009 Norm Smith medallist becoming a fringe player .
`` It was n't really a matter of us offering him a role , necessarily , '' Scott said .
`` It was a conversation he and I in particular had , along with the list management committee , about what that role would probably look like and whether he could accept that .
`` My view was that it was a little bit disrespectful for us to ask him to play a bit-part role , which was possible , and he agreed with that .
`` So , at the end of the day , while Chappy would like to play on under perfect circumstances with us , it really was a mutual decision . ''
Chapman was interviewed by Geelong great Bill Brownless at the best and fairest function , and he made a special effort to thank the Cats ' supporters .
`` I 'm disappointed and I 'm glad they 're a little bit disappointed too , '' Chapman said .
`` Their support that they 've given me ‚Äì I think there was a petition or something that went out on Facebook or something like that . I 've loved their support .
`` I love that they love me , and the support that they 've given me has been great .
`` I just need to thank them for what they 've done . If they could 've made a different I 'm sure that they would 've . ''
Chapman also praised the way Scott handled the talks that led to his departure .
`` You realise that clubs need to move on and keep developing young players , and we 've got a lot of good young players at Geelong and they deserve their opportunity , '' he said .
`` If I was in their shoes I 'd be expecting a chance myself . ''
Although he turns 32 next month , Chapman is adamant he would be good value for another club .
While being interviewed by Brownless he chuckled when a Geelong fan yelled out : `` Do n't go to Collingwood ! ''
But he acknowledged that if things go his way he will be playing against the Cats next season .
`` It will be hard to run out against my ex-teammates , the blokes that I 've loved playing footy with , the blokes that I love more than anything , '' Chapman said .
`` That 'll be hard , but you 've got to do what you 've got to do . And we 'll be mates forever . We 've done some incredible things together .
`` No matter if I hit you cheaply , I still love you . ''

A startup with a secret recipe for printing cheap solar cells on aluminum foil debuted today , in what could end up a milestone for the industry .
Nanosolar 's technology consists of sandwiches of copper , indium , gallium and selenide ( CIGS ) that are 100 times thinner than the silicon solar cells that dominate the solar photovoltaics market . Its potential convinced Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to back the company as angel investors in its early days .
Two big announcements marked its coming out party : The company has $ 4 billion in contracts and can make money selling its products for $ 1 per watt of a panel 's capacity . That 's cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels in markets across the world .
Specifically , the company 's management thinks it can help utilities avoid the difficulties of getting big coal and nuclear power plants built by offering the option to build small solar farms they can set up close to cities .
`` Cost-efficient solar panels such as ours can be deployed in 2- to 20-megawatt municipal solar power plants that feed peak power directly into the local distribution without requiring the expense of transmission and with a plant deployment time as short as six months , '' said Nanosolar CEO Martin Roscheisen in an e-mail to Wired.com . `` Coal or nuclear ca n't do that , ca n't do it as cost efficient and ca n't do it as rapidly deployable . ''
Thin-film solar has been a major focus of U.S. alternative energy research and development efforts since the early 1980s because it was seen as a true `` breakthrough '' solar technology . Silicon cells are easy to manufacture , dependable and efficient , but some researchers viewed them as inherently limited . As they are currently produced , they require a lot more silicon than thin-film solar cells . They might reach efficiency levels of over 40 percent , but they 'd never compete with fossil fuel energy sources , even with carbon taxes .
Thin-film solar was different . On the one hand , it was definitely harder to make efficient cells . However , it allowed researchers to dream of printing semiconducting chemicals onto a metal sheet and having it convert photons into electricity . Thin-film cells seemed like they 'd be perfect for the applications researchers imagined like `` solar shingles '' for building-integrated solar installations .
Thin film was promoted as the technology that would bring photovoltaics to the masses at prices competitive with fossil fuels .
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory worked steadily on thin films throughout the 1990s , but no technology seemed to work well outside the lab . It turned out to be really difficult to actually manufacture thin-film solar cells .
Then First Solar exploded onto the solar scene in 2005 with a cadmium-telluride thin-film cell . Their manufacturing costs dropped rapidly and soon they had billions of dollars in contracts , largely with utilities . Yesterday , they signed a two-gigawatt deal with Chinese officials . Now , investors value the company higher than American , Delta , and United Airlines combined . First Solar has become the bar and the target for Nanosolar , and the dozens of other thin-film market hopefuls .
What could set Nanosolar apart is the way the company actually gets its semiconductors to stick to the metal foil . Most companies use various techniques executed under vacuum conditions ; Nanosolar prints its solar cells .
`` What separates them from the rest of the companies is that they have developed a process to make CIGS cells which involves non-vacuum technology , '' said Miguel Contreras , a thin-film solar researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory . `` This is a very generic description , but what I 'm pointing out is that by having a wet chemistry process , they are able to save quite a bit of money in terms of capital equipment . ''
The base for their cells ‚Äî the aluminum foil ‚Äî is plentiful and cheap , which the company says has cost and manufacturing advantages .
Earlier this year , First Solar claimed it started manufacturing solar cells for less than $ 1 per watt . Nanosolar says it can go cheaper . They also took aim at First Solar in a recent whitepaper ( .pdf ) for utilities , claiming their `` balance-of-system costs '' ( all the other stuff beyond the solar cells themselves ) will be lowed .
It 's big talk for a company that has n't really entered commercial production , but Nanosolar has a half a billion dollars in venture funding and some bleeding-edge technology . Beyond the contracts they 've won , they announced that NREL testing found their cells to be the most efficient printed solar cell on record at 16.4 percent .
Even though the competition among solar companies is heating up , there is plenty of room for multiple players in the expanding renewable energy markets . Competition can drive innovation and cost reductions , too , which would be good news for solar energy advocates . After major cost drops in the early '90s , the average solar module 's cost has n't been declining very quickly .
If companies like First Solar and Nanosolar continue to grow , they will drive that average price closer to competing with fossil fuels . First Solar will be producing about a gigawatt of panels this year . Nanosolar 's production is tiny , by comparison . They have a 640-megawatt facility , and are ramping up production from their current megawatt per month of production . Scaling up can be difficult with PV technologies , but Roscheisen was confident .
`` There are manufacturability issues with CIGS but you would n't hit a million cells a month unless you have worked out these , '' he said . `` This is why our manufacturing people have considered going from 0 output to 1 megawatt a month in output as more challenging than scaling from 1 megawatt to 100 megawatts or more . ''

Lonely outpost marks US-Dakota War 's start
Anthony Morse Caroline Yang for MPR
A single building remains of the Lower Sioux Agency , once a government outpost and the hub of a small community on the Minnesota River near here .
Built to administer treaty obligations to the Dakota Indians , the place featured a doctor 's office , an Indian agent 's office , housing , a boarding house and a school . But 150 years ago today it became the focus of resentment that boiled into a war unprecedented in U.S. history .
Today marks the start of the US-Dakota War , which began with an attack , after a quarrel , by four Dakota Indians who killed several settlers near the tiny town of Acton , about 40 miles away .
ATTACKS GREW OUT OF LONGSTANDING RESENTMENT
The killings were the impulsive act of four young men , but they followed years of growing resentment among the Dakota towards white settlers . By evening , all along the Minnesota River , Dakota leaders were weighing their choices .
The next day , on Aug. 18 , 1862 , the Lower Sioux Agency , the U.S. government 's major presence in the area , felt the brunt of that resentment .
When word of the Acton killings reached Dakota leaders late on Aug. 17 , they knew they had to act , said Anthony Morse , director of the Lower Sioux historic site .
Fort Ridgely Alex Kolyer for MPR
`` They felt that the only two ways that they could get out of that situation were to either give up the four boys to the United States government , or to protect the four boys and go to war , '' said Morse .
Even though their principal leader , Little Crow , said the Dakota would lose , the tribe chose war . On Aug. 18 , the Dakota burned most of the buildings on the Lower Sioux Agency .
One of the first whites killed that day was a trading post owner , Andrew Myrick . In 1976 , Mary LaCroix , Myrick 's granddaughter , recounted the events in a recording housed at the South Dakota Oral History Center . LaCroix said she heard the story from her grandmother , Myrick 's wife , who was hiding nearby and witnessed his killing .
`` He went up through a trap door in the top of the building and then he jumped off the building . And as he jumped he sprained his ankle , '' said LaCroix . `` My grandmother said one of these Indians stepped in the door , the other went around the part of the building and saw my grandfather there , so he shot him . ''
CORRUPT TRADERS CHEATED INDIANS
It was no accident that Myrick was one of the first targets of the exploding violence . When desperate Dakota tried to buy food on credit , the story goes that Myrick told them they could eat grass .

Traders were a focus of hard feelings because they dealt badly with Indians , said Sheldon Wolfchild , who is making a film about the causes of the 1862 war , based partly on David Nichols ' authoritative book `` Lincoln and the Indians . ''
The book documents a corrupt system of government aid that mainly benefited ambitious whites . Wolfchild , whose great-great-great grandfather , Medicine Bottle , was hanged after the war for his involvement , said that when the Dakota sold huge tracts of land to the government , they were promised payments of gold . But the traders ended up taking most of it .
`` They would take the money off the top of the treaty money once a year when it came to the Dakota people , '' said Wolfchild .
Wolfchild said the government allowed the traders first claim on the funds to satisfy past Dakota business debts . The Dakota alleged those claims were fraudulently inflated . Government Indian agents often took kickbacks to overlook the corruption . In some years the traders took nearly all the Dakota treaty money .
Birch Coulee today Alex Kolyer for MPR
President Abraham Lincoln 's administration investigated the fraud allegations less than a year before the war started , Wolfchild said . The investigator , George Day , wrote Lincoln on Jan. 1 , 1862 , to say war tensions were building in Minnesota .
`` Mr. President , I have discovered numerous violations of law and many frauds committed by past agents and a superintendent , '' Day wrote . `` The Indians whom I have visited in this state and Wisconsin have been defrauded of more than $ 100,000 in or during the four years past . The whole system is defective . ''
In 1862 , the year 's treaty payments , including food , were two months overdue , and some Dakota were starving . So when the Acton killings occured , the Dakota went to war to erase white people from their lands .
`` There 's nothing comparable to it in American history , nothing , '' said Gary Clayton Anderson , a University of Oklahoma historian who has written several books about the war .
DAKOTA PEOPLE FELT 'UNDER SEIGE '
More people on both sides likely died in the 1862 Minnesota war than in any other government-Indian war .
‚Äú There 's nothing comparable to it in American history , nothing. ‚Äù Gary Clayton Anderson , historian
The government was pushing the Dakota to adopt farming and live like white people . Missionaries also pushed for changes , including a ban on traditional Dakota dances . At the war council just after the Acton killings , Anderson said , it is likely the Dakota leaders felt under siege .
`` These white people are trying to destroy our culture , they 're trying to destroy us as a people , they 're trying to destroy our religion , they 're trying to destroy the way we live , our economy , '' said Anderson .
After leveling the government agency on the Lower Sioux , the Dakota warriors unsuccessfully attacked New Ulm . They also failed to take the principal government institution in that area , Fort Ridgely , about 15 miles southeast of the Lower Sioux Agency . On Sept. 2 , a battle took place at Birch Coulee , near Morton , on the open prairie . About 150 U.S. soldiers found themselves surrounded , Morse of the Lower Sioux historic site , said .
`` You can tell that it would have been a very difficult battle for them , '' said Morse . `` Fire from all sides . Many of the horses were killed . I think some were even killed by the soldiers to be used as cover . ''
After a day and a half , the siege ended with the arrival of relief troops , who drove the Dakota away . Three weeks later , the war was over and the tribe was exiled from the state , its members deported mainly to South Dakota and Nebraska .
MASS EXECUTION
In December 1862 , U.S. soldiers hanged 38 Dakota at Mankato for war crimes , most notably the killing of hundreds of settlers . To this day it remains the single largest mass execution in U.S. history .

New Ulm resident Alice Henle said some of her settler ancestors were driven from their farms by the war . Looking back , she said the 1862 war is understandable . When people are pushed , they 'll eventually push back , she said .
`` It 's really a terrible thing what they did to the Indians , '' said Henle . `` That they did n't have any food or anything . It 's no wonder they got angry . ''
Upper Sioux tribal member Walter LaBatte said when he studied the war , the more he read the angrier he got , until one night he had a dream . His grandmother was a young girl in 1862 and saw the horrors of the war . In the dream , she scolded LaBatte for his anger .
`` I remember her saying , 'That was my pain , that was my experience , not yours , ' '' said LaBatte . `` I realized that she was right , that I should n't take on the pain of her and her contemporaries . ''
But for many Dakota the anger remains , as well as a desire to commemorate the war and its aftermath . That 's evident in several events the Dakota have scheduled in connection with the 150th anniversary .
One is scheduled for today , when a group of Dakota will stage a symbolic return to Minnesota from exile , at the Pipestone National Monument in the southwest part of the state .
Is there anything more American than Christmas dinner at McDonald 's ?
Is there anything more American than Christmas dinner at McDonald 's ?
In November McDonald 's saw a 2.5 percent increase in November sales . This is after the fast food giant saw a decrease in sales of 2.2 percent in October . So why was there increase in sales ? Was the pork-like substitute McRib back ? Was there a shortage of Ore-Ida french fries in your local grocer 's freezer causing a run on McDonald 's across the country ?
Nope , none of the above ; the corporate overlords at McDonald 's urged franchisees to be open on Thanksgiving day , a day that most franchise stores are closed . A Nov. 8 memo from McDonald 's USA Chief Operating Officer Jim Johannesen stated ,
`` Starting with Thanksgiving , ensure your restaurants are open throughout the holidays . Our largest holiday opportunity as a system is Christmas Day . Last year , [ company-operated ] restaurants that opened on Christmas averaged $ 5,500 in sales . ''
On Dec. 12 Mr. Johannesen doubled down and sent out another memo to franchise owners stating that average sales for company-owned restaurants , which compose about 10 percent of its system , were `` more than $ 6,000 '' this Thanksgiving . That adds up to be about $ 36 million in extra sales .
So with all those extra sales one must ask if employees are reaping any benefits from being open on the holidays . The answer is dependent on the franchise owner ; however , in the case of company owned stores the answer is a big fat no . According to McDonald 's spokesperson Heather Oldani , `` when our company-owned restaurants are open on the holidays , the staff voluntarily sign up to work . There is no regular overtime pay . ''
It is bad enough that McDonald 's pays crap wages but then they turn around and refuse to pay overtime for employees who volunteer to give up their holidays so that McDonald 's can make several million dollars . I am also willing to bet that most staff members does not readily volunteer to work on Christmas day . This just gives me one more reason to not eat at the Golden Arches .

April , Deadpool # 45 & Howard the Duck # 2 will feature variant covers inspired by Run The Jewels
New York , NY‚ÄîJanuary , 16th‚ÄîMarvel , in collaboration with the rap group , Run The Jewels , will be release two unique variant covers to celebrate the one of the currently most distinctive and celebrated names in rap . Deadpool # 250 , by Skottie Young , and Howard the Duck # 2 , by Mahmud Asrar , will feature Deadpool , Howard the Duck and Rocket Raccoon , as they display their love for this rap group by replicating their socially iconic logo on these variant covers .
First debuting on RollingStone.com , Axel Alonso talks about his awareness of the ‚Äú tag the jewels ‚Äù movement and how he was first introduced to its cultural significance by one of his son 's football games . `` He caught a touchdown pass that won the game . And on the sidelines , he took off his glove and he pointed at it and his friends were going `` Run them jewels fast , '' Alonso tells RS , quoting the chorus to RTJ 's ‚Äò Close Your Eyes . '
`` Seeing the way that my 11-year-old son and his friends were improv-ing off of this really vibrant , iconic image‚Ä¶It got me thinking . If you 've got this movement around the world from Bangladesh to Taiwan , people are doing their interpretations of this logo , and I got these roughnecks doing it on the sideline of a football game‚Ä¶maybe Marvel could weight in on this and have some fun . ''
Run The Jewels , featuring El-P and Killer Mike , two of the most distinctive and celebrated names in rap , might have seemed like an unlikely pairing on paper , but the duo subverted and pulverized all expectations with their critically lauded Run The Jewels 2 collaborative LP last year . Tapping into the creative synergy they 'd discovered on their 2013 debut , Run The Jewels cemented their musical alliance with a set of uncompromisingly raw , forward thinking hip-hop , garnering limitless critical accolades including album of the year nods from Rolling Stone , Pitchfork , Newsweek , SPIN , Complex , and more .
Fans can get their hands on these two variant covers exclusively in comic shops this April !

Householders who fail to pay new water charges face having their water pressure reduced , under new measures approved by the Government .
The cost of water charges has yet to be formally agreed , but informed sources indicate the cost to an average household will be in the region of between ‚Ç¨100 and ‚Ç¨300 a year .
In addition , new legislation will provide that unpaid water charges may be made against a householder 's property .
The measures are contained in new legislation , the Water Services ( No 2 ) Bill , approved by the Cabinet last week . It is due to be published over the coming months .
While householders who fail to pay will not be disconnected , Irish Water ‚Äì the new body responsible for water supply ‚Äì will have the power to reduce the water pressure of any customer who consistently refuses to pay .
Officials say the move would be targeted at those who opt not to pay , rather than those who can not afford to pay , and would only occur after customers have refused all options available to pay their bills .
‚Äú In practice it would involve limiting the water a household consumes , but providing enough to cover basic needs , ‚Äù said a water industry source , who declined to be named .
Householders will receive their first water bills in the early months of 2015 , covering the last quarter of 2014 .
Water meters
The charges will be based on usage measured by water meters , which will be installed in one million homes connected to public water supplies .
The meter installation project is due to begin later this month . It will employ an estimated 1,600 people over the next three years .
Householders will not pay fees upfront for the installation of meters , but are likely to end up paying over the longer term in the form of standing charges . While hundreds of thousands of water meters will be installed over the coming months , many will not have them in place by the time charges come into force at the end of next year .
In addition , meter installation may not be possible in as many as 300,000 homes , such as apartments .
Assessed charge
These homes face paying what officials call an ‚Äú assessed charge ‚Äù . This will likely be based on a number of factors such as the type of property , the number of people living in the house and average metered bills in the area .
Officials are considering a rebate system for homes whose metered charges turn out to be significantly lower than their assessed charges .
There will also be free allowances for groups who are likely to face real difficulties in paying the charges and for those whose medical needs mean they have to consume large quantities of water .
No formal decisions have yet been made on fees . A framework for water charges will be drawn up following a public consultation by the Commission for Energy Regulation , which will be responsible for regulating the sector .
The new legislation also provides for the transition of responsibility for water services away from local authorities to Irish Water over a three-year period beginning next year .
During this time local authorities will operate as agents of Irish Water to deliver a range of services under service-level agreements .
If a service-level agreement is terminated or is not renewed , local authority staff will move to Irish Water with their terms , conditions and pensions protected .
The metering programme , meanwhile , will begin to be rolled out later this month .

If you 're up for a visit to the beautiful Italian region of Umbria , better make sure your laptop is running some open source software ‚Äî chances are you 'll feel more at home there .
This small area in the middle of the Boot , known for its centuries-old monasteries and for being the birthplace of St Francis of Assisi , is in fact quickly becoming a mecca of free software .
Thanks to a project called LibreUmbria , the biggest local government bodies are migrating to LibreOffice in what 's thought to be the most carefully-designed transition away from proprietary software ever undertaken . Though not as big as other international migration initiatives , the Umbrian project has been praised for its attention it pays to every aspect of the transition , not just the technical ones .
St Francis was all for giving things away and held frugality in high regard ‚Äî as do his fellow countrymen of LibreUmbria , whose primary goal is to bring savings to the government bodies involved .
The cost of the migration is calculated to be around ‚Ç¨56,000 per thousand workstations while the price of the same number of Microsoft Office licences would amount to ‚Ç¨284,490 . `` That 's what we would have to have paid had we decided to upgrade our licences which , for budget reasons , were stuck on the 2010 version of Office : so it 's roughly a saving of ‚Ç¨228,000 , '' said Sonia Montegiove , who works in the IT department of the province of Perugia and is one of the coordinators of the project .
Though important , spending is n't the whole story ‚Äî the drive for efficiency was also a priority . `` We found out that most of our users exploit just 15 percent of their productivity suite , but you 're paying for the other 85 percent as well . It 's just like if you owned a Ferrari and only used it to drive at 30km per hour through the middle of town , '' Alfiero Ortali , head of IT at the province of Perugia , added .
Cultural and ethical considerations also play a prominent role in the migration . `` Right now , along with Munich , I 'd call LibreUmbria the most advanced experience of migration in the world , '' said Italo Vignoli , who sits in the board of directors of the Document Foundation , the entity that supports the development of LibreOffice . `` It refined the models of previous projects and put them together in a process that is easily reproducible with all the documentation available for sharing in Creative Commons . ''
A complex job
The reach of the project also sets it apart from similar switches . It encompasses the migration of different organisations such as the provinces of Perugia and Terni , the region of Umbria and several regional health districts . In total , more than 7,000 PCs are expected to shift to LibreOffice , 2,000 of them by 2014 . The target seems well within reach since around 1,000 PCs of the province of Perugia and 500 belonging to USL Umbria 1 , the public health organisation involved in the project , have already installed the open source suite .
The participation of many local government bodies makes the initiative more complex but at the same time more effective , since the public sector is a diverse system and needs coordination when it comes to formats and standards .
`` We routinely have exchanges of documents with other public bodies , so you ca n't go to a different suite all by yourself , particularly for the most complex files , such as the financial ones . The large participation in LibreUmbria helps in this regard , '' said Barbara Gamboni , who leads the IT department of USL Umbria 1 , a local public health organisation that reports to the region of Umbria .
So far employees are reportedly happy with the change , a fact that , according to the people managing the project , is due to the emphasis the initiative puts on listening and training .
`` We used to say : 'first train , then install ' . It means that we try to start from the needs of the users which is not to have an open source software but a software they know how to use and are comfortable with , '' Perugia 's Montegiove said .
Communication too plays an important part in the process . From the very beginning a concerted effort was made to explain the rationale behind the change to users , with different messages crafted for different categories of people in order to suit their different needs . `` We targeted both employees and supervisors , putting together two lists of five reasons each for the migration . We called it five plus five , '' said Montegiove , who also pushed for the launch of a blog dedicated to the project . Arguments about savings , she said , might appeal supervisors or politicians , while employees might be more tickled by the opportunities of training .
For love of the open
In the last few years , free software seems to have gained momentum in the Italian public sector as the economic situation in the country got worse . The austerity measures imposed by the central government are hitting local organisations hard , forcing them to find every possible way to tighten their belt , with IT doing its part . Ambitious migrations like LibreUmbria 's or the one underway in the northern Province of South Tyrol could then be seen as a way to respond to this new financial context . But here , in the middle of Italy , it 's more than just that .
Umbria 's passion for open source has solid roots going back to the pre-financial crisis era as in 2006 it became the first Italian region to pass local legislation explicitly favouring non-proprietary software . `` The region , '' the legislation says , `` promotes the spread and the development of open source software , particularly in Umbria 's public sector , because it has a positive effect on scientific and technological research and it reduces the cost of licences . '' Among the legacies of that legislation is a competence centre on open source that is now playing a big role in supporting the Umbria migration .
Such a long-standing interest in free software has also given birth to a passionate community of 'believers ' within the public sector which thinks that non-proprietary software is not only economically efficient but also ethically right . As evangelists , they 're ready to offer some free time in order to share the idea and are happy to think long-term . As a way of spreading the open source philosophy in the area , for instance , LibreUmbria 's people will soon begin training sessions on free software and IT security for teachers and parents in one of Perugia 's school districts .
The hope is that , besides helping preparedness for a possible transition to LibreOffice in their organisations , participants will pass their knowledge onto pupils and children ‚Äî the younger , the better : `` We will start with primary schools because , you know , we think the use of free software is an habit that should grow into the kids very early , '' said Montegiove .
As St Francis might have put it , `` Let the little children come to me '' ...

A Tunisian man who allegedly met one of the men suspected of plotting to bomb a Canadian train was charged with visa fraud in New York , prosecutors say .
Ahmed Abassi allegedly met Chiheb Esseghaier and attempted to radicalise him , New York prosecutors said .
He came to the US in March and kept contact with an undercover FBI agent before his 22 April arrest , they said .
Mr Esseghaier , 30 , and Raed Jaser , 35 , are charged with conspiracy to carry out an attack and kill people .
An indictment against Mr Abassi , unsealed on Thursday , alleged he came from Canada and was fraudulently seeking a US work visa in order to `` facilitate an act of international terrorism '' .
US Attorney for Manhattan Preet Bharara said : `` As alleged , Ahmed Abassi had an evil purpose for seeking to remain in the United States - to commit acts of terror and develop a network of terrorists here , and to use this country as a base to support the efforts of terrorists internationally . ''
In recorded conversations between the two men , Mr Abassi expressed his desire to `` engage in terrorist acts against targets in the United States and other countries '' , the justice department said in a statement .
He was arrested at John F Kennedy International Airport , authorities said .
Mr Abassi was also recorded talking about his desire to aid militant groups , including the al-Nusra Front .
That group has been described by the US as a front for al-Qaeda in Iraq , and has gained support in rebel-held parts of Syria .
Canadian media have reported the investigation into Mr Esseghaier and Mr Jaser was launched after a tip-off by a concerned imam in the Toronto Muslim community .
Authorities had been tracking Mr Esseghaier for two years before beginning to investigate the alleged plot in August 2012 .
The game play on this was much different than any other game I 've played . The time-controlling aspects of the game made it a lot of fun . The storyline was long enough to keep me interested , and it was intricate enough that I did n't get bored for at least a few weeks of playing . I also enjoyed that you got to have different cut scenes and aspects with different decisions you made ... Definitely gave it an extremely unique feel .
Something that I can see a lot of people NOT liking is the cut scenes can be long enough to make your XBox controller go to sleep ... What I 'm trying to say is that there are some that are 20 - 30 minutes . It adds interesting dynamics , and the cinematography was actually surprisingly well thought out and done . The acting was OK - it 's kind of Fringe-esque . All in all great game , good replayability , and if you 're a person that likes to collect all collectables , there are plenty of them to go around !
There are two things that I did n't like ( one may be something that I just missed them explain , but ... ) there is a piece of the game where you can scan for danger/collectibles in the near viscinity . There are power up collectibles that they call `` Chronon particles '' that are not visible unless you activate this scanner and are essentially looking directly at the location of the powerup . The way that you know you 're close to a powerup is that there is an overlaid circle with a smaller inner circle , and a blip somewhere flashing in there . This is where the Chronon particle is located in respect to your current location . This said , it does NOT display height , only horizontal location . The game does not do a good job of explaining this `` heads up '' kind of display .
Also this is probably one of the more beautifully done and intricate games I 've played ... but to a fault . There were multiple times where the game just absolutely froze and had to be force quit and restarted . It kept the last save , which is good , but that 's annoying . The graphics were sometimes very choppy , and if you were resuming the game after not playing it for a while ( say you were watching Netflix and then loading back into the game ) , the sound was almost 100 % of the time permanently muted . You have to force close the game to get it to play again . Other than the random freezes in the game ( it did it a small handful of times , was n't constant ) , I still rate this 5/5 * b/c it was that good .
An artist 's rendering of the interior of a planned Purple Line train in Maryland . ( Purple Line Transit Partners )
A federal judge on Monday ordered Maryland officials to further scrutinize the potential impact of Metro 's declining ridership on the future Purple Line , further delaying construction of the light-rail project in the Washington suburbs and jeopardizing its chances to secure critical federal funding .
[ Md . transit official says Purple Line still on time , but big questions remain ] .
The ruling means major construction on the 16-mile line connecting Montgomery and Prince George 's counties remains on hold until a federal lawsuit filed by Purple Line opponents is resolved . Construction already has been delayed seven months because of the lawsuit .
The decision by U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon also greatly jeopardizes the project 's chances at $ 900 million in federal con struction grants and threatens a $ 5.6 billion public-private partnership .
Maryland officials have said that if by June 1 they have ‚Äú no foreseeable path ‚Äù to resolve the lawsuit , they would have to suspend much or all of the rail line 's planning and design work because state money would run out . The state would then have about 60 days before it would have to cancel the project and back out of the public-private partnership ‚Äî a move that could cost it more than $ 800 million in sunk costs and contract termination fees , Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn said in a recent court filing .
Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) called the ruling ‚Äú incredibly disappointing , but not entirely surprising. ‚Äù Hogan has criticized Leon , saying the judge was delaying the case because of a conflict of interest that biased him against the light-rail project .
[ Hogan accuses Purple Line judge of conflict of interest ]
‚Äú The fact that it took a federal judge this long to reach the conclusion that more study is needed is completely baffling and , if allowed to stand , will cause irreparable harm to this vital project and cost the state hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars , ‚Äù Hogan said in a statement .
The statement did not address a June 1 deadline , saying only , ‚Äú The state will continue to pursue any and all legal action to ensure that the Purple Line will move forward . ‚Äù
Asked whether they would appeal the decision , representatives of the Maryland attorney general 's office and the Justice Department said only that they were reviewing the ruling . The Federal Transit Administration referred all questions to the Justice Department .
Purple Line Transit Partners ‚Äî the team of private companies contracted to help finance the line , build it and operate it over 36 years ‚Äî did not respond to emails seeking comment .
Leon said Maryland and federal transit officials must redo the Purple Line 's ridership forecasts because they had n't taken ‚Äú the requisite ‚Äò hard look ' at the potential impact that [ Metro 's ] ridership and safety issues could have on the Purple Line project . ‚Äù
Leon said the government 's dismissive treatment of Metro 's potential effects was ‚Äú arbitrary and capricious ‚Äù and ordered the agencies to update the ridership study ‚Äú as expeditiously as possible . ‚Äù
[ Read the judge 's ruling ]
Maryland officials have said reopening the study could take months , and every month of delay costs the state more than $ 13 million .
The decision is a major victory for Purple Line opponents , including two Chevy Chase residents and a trail advocacy group that filed the federal lawsuit in 2014 seeking to block the project on environmental grounds .
John M. Fitzgerald , an environmental lawyer and plaintiff in the case , called the ruling ‚Äú a victory of substantive analysis over agency arrogance . ‚Äù
He said further study might find an east-west transportation project that is ‚Äú more effective , less expensive and less harmful ‚Äù or perhaps persuade Maryland officials to spend more to rehabilitate Metro rather than build the Purple Line .
The ruling comes at a precarious time for the rail project because Maryland officials have said they need the federal grants to cover nearly half of the line 's $ 2 billion construction cost .
Congress has appropriated $ 325 million toward the Purple Line . However , Maryland officials ca n't access that money unless Leon or another judge reinstates the project 's federal environmental approval , which Leon revoked in August .
The project also would need a federal funding agreement , and it 's unclear whether the Trump administration will sign new ones . The Purple Line was five days away from securing such an agreement when Leon 's earlier ruling made it ineligible .
The White House has said new transit projects should be ‚Äú funded by the localities that use and benefit from these localized projects. ‚Äù Maryland officials have said the state ca n't afford to build the line without federal aid .
Ralph Bennett , president of the advocacy group Purple Line Now , said he hopes the Maryland Attorney General 's Office appeals Leon 's ruling quickly .
‚Äú Obviously , it 's a danger to the project , ‚Äù Bennett said . ‚Äú The judge is behaving in a way consistent with wanting to kill the project by delay . ‚Äù
[ How a court ruling put $ 900 million in federal money off limits ] In his latest ruling , Leon said he still thinks the government has n't adequately considered the potential impact of Metro 's ridership woes .
While the Purple Line would n't be part of the Metro system , more than a quarter of its passengers are expected to come from people riding Metro .
Leon acknowledged that after his earlier ruling , state and federal transit officials had submitted a previous study that found Metro would not have a significant impact on the Purple Line , even if under the most dire of five scenarios , Metro contributed no passengers to the light-rail line .
In his 12-page decision , Leon said the government had n't done enough to ‚Äú critically assess ‚Äù which of the five scenarios was most likely to occur . He called it ‚Äú curious ‚Äù that the government had argued that further study of Metro 's potential effects was unnecessary , especially when ‚Äú providing better connections to Metrorail services ‚Äù was one of the state 's three justifications for the project .
He said state and federal transit agencies also had n't addressed ‚Äú serious questions ‚Äù that the plaintiffs ' experts had raised about the Purple Line 's ridership forecasts . Those included an economist who said the Purple Line estimates were based on unrealistically rosy assumptions about how quickly Metro 's ridership would recover .
Leon said he will rule in a few weeks on a couple of dozen other legal arguments that the plaintiffs made criticizing the Purple Line 's environmental impact .
The Maryland Transit Administration relied on the Purple Line 's ridership forecasts in the project 's federal environmental review to help justify building light rail instead of a less expensive rapid-bus option , saying light rail would attract and carry more passengers .
The Purple Line is designed to better connect suburban Maryland neighborhoods inside the Capital Beltway with Metro stations and Amtrak and MARC commuter rail stations . State officials say the 21 stations will attract redevelopment , particularly in economically struggling older communities in Prince George 's County . The line also is designed to provide faster , more reliable transit service than buses .
Metro became an issue in the lawsuit last spring , when Purple Line opponents argued that the project 's environmental approval was n't valid because the ridership projections in it presumed a ‚Äú robust ‚Äù Metro system .
Metro 's ridership has fallen 12 percent since 2010 , with 100,000 fewer trips daily , and the aging system continues to suffer from chronic breakdowns and safety lapses . The system 's ongoing SafeTrack maintenance program has caused ridership to further decline .
In court filings , the FTA argued that Metro 's safety and reliability problems are being addressed through SafeTrack and that ridership will rebound after the program is completed , particularly as the region continues to grow .
Even under the ‚Äú most extreme ‚Äù scenario ‚Äî removing Metro completely from the Purple Line ridership analysis ‚Äî the Purple Line would still have about 50,000 weekday trips in 2040 , making it ‚Äú one of the most robust light-rail systems funded by the FTA in recent years , ‚Äù the FTA said .
The FTA also said that any change in ridership would n't affect the light-rail line 's environmental impact because it would n't change the project 's construction footprint .
The plaintiffs ‚Äî Fitzgerald , Chevy Chase resident Christine Real de Azua , and the Friends of the Capital Crescent Trail ‚Äî said the FTA had n't considered the number of Metro riders who have lost faith in the system or that Metro 's ‚Äú ongoing extreme problems with safety , service and reliability are continuing unabated with no end in sight . ‚Äù
Something is going on at NeoGAF . This weekend the popular gaming forum has seen a number of moderators step down from their positions at the site . The exact reasons are unknown at the moment , but it appears that it is because of a post on the site that 's been censored which implicates that the owner had sexually harassed a woman .
The original post stems from the # MeToo campaign . The hashtag recently popped up with women and men sharing their stories of sexual harassment via social media . The accusations claim that the owner of NeoGAF , Tyler Malka , hopped into a shower uninvited with a woman he was travelling with . Out of fear the woman says that she 'd kept quiet about the act .
While it 's unclear whether the accusations are true or not , they appear to be real enough for the moderator team of the forum to step away from their positions this weekend . Numerous threads on the topic have been deleted . NeoGAF users are making account suicide threads in protest , asking for their accounts to be banned .
Being that this is the internet , there are numerous stories going around at the moment as to what has caused the mass exodus in terms of the moderation team for the forum . That said , it 's pretty obvious that there is no moderation on NeoGAF at the moment and those with accounts are taking advantage of it by posting whatever they want . Some are protest posts , some are completely made up posts about video game news , others are just taking a time out to speak their mind to Malka .
There are rumblings that an official statement is being prepared by the owner regarding the accusations . Currently the site is experiencing intermittent outages with rampant speculation from both members of the forum and outsiders wondering if this is the end for NeoGAF ?
Following the release of photos suggesting that Justin Bieber was smoking marijuana at a party , the hashtag # cuttingforbieber -- a supposed protest against the star 's alleged drug use by way of self-injury -- started showing up all over Twitter on Monday , Complex Music reports .
Initially , it appeared as if teens were cutting themselves as a way to voice their disproval of Bieber 's supposed actions . ( As Complex Music notes , a few Twitter users appeared to use the hashtag alongside pictures of arms with cuts . ) But later the news outlet announced it tracked the hashtag 's origins to 4Chan and suggested the posts -- and the photos -- were all a hoax .
Still , as Gawker notes , the hashtag began trending nationally within just a few hours , and the response was fierce . Some users clearly believed the trend was real and made jokes about people who cut , while others admonished the practice and called the notion of fans cutting to protest Bieber 's supposed actions disturbing .
The hoax draws attention to an issue that was affecting as much as 15 percent of the adolescent population in 2008 , according to the New York Times .
Insensitivity aside , there are bigger problems with such a prank .
Janis Whitlock , a Cornell University professor who has studied teens and self-injury , told The Huffington Post that images of cutting can potentially serve as triggers for those who are already vulnerable or prone to self-injury .
`` In the 1990s , there were 14 pop icons that came out and talked about cutting , '' Whitlock said . `` They were n't necessarily advocating it , but they talked about it as part of their history and that really did make a difference in terms of getting it out there into the world as an idea that was then available to young people . ''
While the hashtag is not likely to attract a new wave of people to the practice , Whitlock said it reinforces the idea of self-injury as a method of expression .
`` Ideas are as contagious as germs , '' she said .
After news of the hashtag spread , both teens and celebrities spoke out against making light of people who struggle with self-injury . On Monday , Miley Cyrus retweeted a post stating that cutting is not something to joke about :
# cutforbieber ? Cutting is NOT something to joke about . There are people who are actually suffering from self-harm , this is so disrespectful . ‚Äî Official CANCER ( @ OfficialCANCER ) January 7 , 2013
The hashtag # SelfHarmIsNotAJoke started popping up as well , with some teens omitting the # cuttingforbieber tag , presumably to not draw more attention to it .
`` It REALLY makes me mad when people joke about self harm , eating disorders or suicide ... You have NO idea what someone may be going through ... , '' Twitter user @ lovatic4lovato wrote .
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the cutting hoax , or whether the company has a policy in regard to regulating material of this nature . This post will be updated if more information becomes available .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , 4Chan has messed with Bieber fans in the past . In October , users put out information suggesting the pop star had cancer so that fans would shave their heads in support .
Barack Obama and John McCain have hatched a secret plot to undermine President Donald Trump during his August vacation away from the White House . Obama and Valerie Jarrett put the plot in motion right before Barack left for Martha 's Vineyard on August 5th so he could deny that he had anything to do with it . Those patriots who support Trump are on high alert , and this is something every American needs to know .
Barack Obama is currently vacationing at Martha 's Vineyard , and John McCain is back in Arizona as their secret plot for the next two weeks gets underway . Everyone remembers the leftist nutjobs showing up at town hall 's across the country after Trump got elected . They targeted Republican congressmen and disrupted the events with bull horns and plants in the audience giving bogus ‚Äú testimonies ‚Äù about how a repeal of Obamacare was going to kill them .
Well , it seems we are about to witness something much worse than that , and it 's Obama 's army , otherwise known as Organizing for Action ( OFA ) , that have their paid rioters and plants lined up to cause problems for Trump across the country . McCain is being protected by OFA as Politico reports , ‚Äú OFA will spend Congress ' August recess sending organizers to town halls and district offices based on senators ' votes on repealing Obamacare . They 're showing up to cheer for John McCain‚Ä¶ ‚Äù But , that 's not all .
McCain started rumors that the GOP wo n't nominate Trump as their 2020 candidate , saying , ‚Äú They see weakness in this president . Look , it 's not a nice business we 're in. ‚Äù McCain is using his status as the liberals ' new best friend to double down on opposing Trump 's immigration plan , and he 's colluding with Obama 's OFA .
Trump laid out an immigration plan based on merit , a plan that was used back in the beginning of the 20th century , which saw America grow to become the world 's superpower . ‚Äú For conservatives who believe in the preservation of U.S. jobs and ‚Äò America first , ' President Trump 's announcement this week that he backs a plan to cut green-card issuances in half and make them based on an applicant 's merit rather than family ties was music to their ears , ‚Äù reported WND .
For Obama and McCain who back the Soros globalist agenda , this is a catastrophe if it gets through . Obama 's been told by his globalist masters to put McCain out front and center since they love how he screwed Trump with his last minute vote to keep Obamacare , and now , it 's on to stop Trump on immigration reform and keep those illegal aliens inside the U.S .
So , it 's no coincidence that McCain , fresh off of brain cancer treatment , came out gunning for Trump 's green-card reforms . Reforming the system to drastically rein in the number of green cards issued would strike the globalist agenda at its heart , dealing them a much more significant blow than even building a wall to keep out illegal migrants .
McCain thinks he can force Trump to sign a bipartisan immigration bill https : //t.co/2QC4Q4D1zN Has this jackass ever represented Americans ? ‚Äî fretsward ( @ fretsward ) August 6 , 2017
McCain says he is going to collaborate with that rat , Chuck Schumer . ‚Äú Immigration reform is one of the issues I 'd like to see resolved , ‚Äù McCain told The Arizona Republic in a Thursday interview . ‚Äú I 've got to talk to him ( Schumer ) about when would be the best time . I think there are all kinds of deals to be made out there . I really do . ‚Äù
So , why can McCain collude with Obama 's OFA to thwart everything Trump is doing and not get run out of town by the GOP ? The town is Washington , D.C. , and by now , you must have guessed the gravity of what Trump is up against . He 's fighting the Democrats and the Republicans , the deep state which is in the FBI , CIA , and the DOJ . There are a few Trump loyalists in the GOP and in his cabinet , but the reality is that he is fighting the swamp and the swamp has thousands of tentacles trying to take him out .
The end game is to remove Trump from office . There is a coordinated effort between the elites , which include Barack Obama , Robert Mueller , James Comey , John McCain , Lindsay Graham , Kamala Harris , Maxine Waters , Chuck Schumer , and , of course , Hillary Clinton to remove Trump anyway they can .
Trump has the American people who elected him on his side , and patriots who want to continue to help him need to show up at these town halls that Obama 's OFA army is targeting and fight back , exposing them as puppets who are paid protesters and kick them out of those town halls . August is going to be a pivotal month for the swamp creatures and their minions like OFA . We the People crushed them in November , it 's time to stand up and crush them one more time .
Behind-the-scenes of The Burial of Kojo ‚Äî a dazzling new film shot in Ghana Musician and filmmaker Blitz the Ambassador talks music , Mexican telenovelas and the future of film in his home country Ghana . Patrick D'Arcy Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 25 , 2017 Guilt and betrayal , brothers and brides , exploding cars and mine shafts ‚Äî the upcoming feature film from Blitz the Ambassador , The Burial of Kojo , seems to have it all . But what the film does n't have is a Hollywood budget or seasoned cast or crew . Shot entirely in his home country of Ghana on a micro-budget with local crew and many first-time actors , the film is , by Blitz 's estimation , the ‚Äú first non-foreign film of this magnitude and scale to be produced in Ghana. ‚Äù After a grueling 23-day shoot in Tarkwa , a mining town in Western Ghana , and Nzulezu , a stilt village on the Gulf of Guinea , the film is now in post-production . Blitz is raising money on Kickstarter for editing , music and marketing ; he hopes that if he can raise enough to properly release The Burial of Kojo , the film will be a catalyst for more homegrown filmmaking in Ghana . Here , Blitz , a TED Fellow , talks us through his creative process , what is been like turning Accra into Miami for a telenovela embedded in the film and his hopes for the future of film in Ghana .

Tell us about the origins of the new film . The film first came to me when I was visiting family in Ghana . There 's recently been a big conversation about mining in Ghana ‚Äî specifically illegal mining ‚Äî and it 's dominated the tabloids , the newspapers , the radio and TV . It 's really dangerous work ‚Äî you have to work really deep underground ‚Äî and I happened to chance on a story about a group of young miners that had been buried alive . And right there and then , I was like , ‚Äú Wow , this is crazy , there 's something to this , ‚Äù because I felt like I was n't getting the full story . So I just started digging . I went to some of the towns where illegal mining is done , and that 's where I found the idea for the film . The story that we get in the media about illegal mining , who controls it and who does n't , was n't quite accurate . I wanted to tell the story with that as the backdrop . After I started to work on the film , I discovered a story that was more about family , more about betrayal , more about guilt .

I wanted to make a film that accurately represents the environments in Ghana . Once I got my locations and was clear about the story I wanted to tell , the question became , how do I communicate this to the rest of my team ? If I had infinite resources , it would n't matter ‚Äî we could show up , shoot for as many days as we wanted , try and test several different ideas . But I was working with a very limited budget , and so the clearer I was in communicating what I wanted , the closer to my goal and vision I knew I would get . So storyboarding was my go-to . I was very specific about what I wanted : each frame , every shot . That meant drawing 600 frames . The storyboard was 200 pages . Literally every frame was accounted for . It was a good process , because it helped me self-edit . It 's one thing to type words , and another thing to draw frames . Storyboarding helped me take out the stuff that I would have just typed because it was easy , and it made me focus on just the shots that I thought would help communicate the story . It really helped focus things , not just for the crew and cast , but for myself as well , as a director .

What was it like to film in Ghana ? It was challenging . It 's always a challenging process , but what makes it extra challenging here is that film infrastructure is very limited , so most of the things that you need , you have to fly in . Not that many productions of this calibre happen here , so cast and crew are n't easy to come by . One of my biggest jobs was to cast new faces in this film . Some of them were first-time actors , but fantastic actors . But because I 'm from Ghana , it was easy for me to communicate with the people in several local languages ‚Äî that enabled us to gain certain access that most productions would n't have . We also shot in Twi , a language which is spoken by most people here in Ghana . That was also a huge help , because we could cast people off the street , and they would be comfortable in the space .

What role will music play in the film ? Obviously it 's huge . Way before I was done with the script , I 'd already started composing the music because I could see the scenes , and I could get an idea of the sounds . I 'm an audiophile , so there 's always been music that I 've heard growing up that I 've always thought , ‚Äú It 'll be perfect in a film. ‚Äù And so I wrote certain scenes to music , and I 'm hoping I 'll get clearance and rights to use them . Filmmaking , at least from my perspective , is something that has to be fluid , and has to have harmony . I took a lot of my musical ideology into making this film ‚Äî not to mistake it as a music film , but to say that I want the film to move and be fluid like music .

Tell us about ‚Äú Puebla mi Amor , ‚Äù the soap opera embedded within the film . Why is that in there ? Initially , I was thinking of just licensing a telenovela for this film , and then I realized that if I shot my own , I would have more control as to what the characters did and said , and how directly they could impact my characters in the actual film . I wanted to show these parallels between what we watch and how they sometimes influence our lives . ‚Äú Puebla mi Amor ‚Äù is a completely fictitious telenovela I created just out of knowing how much telenovela culture really has played an impact on Ghanaian ideology ‚Äî ideas of love , ideas of family . I think we 're really fascinated by foreign culture as Ghanaians . We 're constantly absorbing it and inevitably it influences us . I initially was planning to shoot the telenovela in Miami , which is where most telenovelas are shot , but I just could n't afford it on our micro budget . And so I ended up casting everybody in Ghana , and pretty much faking Miami , faking Mexico , in Accra with some expats living here . It was really exciting to create that world right here , and show that it 's all fluid ‚Äî that we live in a polycultural society and nothing is an island and everything 's borrowed from the next . I ca n't wait for people to fall in love with those characters as well . Blitz the Ambassador on the set of The Burial of Kojo in Western Region of Ghana with local crew members . Photo : Ofoe Amegavie . What does it mean to you to have produced and filmed a feature film in you home country ? It 's huge . I daresay that this is the first non-foreign film of this magnitude and scale to be produced in Ghana . I 'm pretty certain of that . We 're burning cars , digging mine shafts and doing crazy stuff that 's mostly done when big-budget Hollywood films are shot here . Recently Beasts of No Nation was shot here for Netflix , but those are operations that pretty much move in and move out . They literally bring everything and take everything out , from manpower to equipment to staff to crew . Before this project even began , I launched the Africa Film Society here in Ghana , and we created a film screening called Classics in the Park , which has grown considerably . The idea was to reboot cinema . We 've had cinema culture in Ghana for several years , but it 's been dormant for a while . And so for me , this film was an opportunity to not just create a film , but to create the environment , and help inspire the audience and rekindle that love for cinema . Because you ca n't make a film that ends up playing all over the world but never at home , which is mostly what happens . ‚Äú Cinema is n't just a form of entertainment . It 's something that I truly believe helps one see oneself in the world. ‚Äù The other thing that 's exciting about this film is infrastructure : being able to build a network of competent crew . This is something that will benefit not just my films , but other productions that will come to Ghana ‚Äî and other productions will be started by Ghanaians here . You 'll have a cadre of well-trained and very inspired crew and cast . For me , cinema is n't just a form of entertainment . It 's something that I truly believe helps one see oneself in the world . It helps you see a reflection of yourself in the narratives , and feel a part of a global narrative . For a long time , African filmmakers and African narrators did not have that opportunity . The rest of the world has very little knowledge , understanding , or appreciation of African stories by African filmmakers . I hope this film can set a precedent that films can be made on a low budget , can be shot on location , authentically , by directors who are familiar with the local environment . They do n't have to be foreign productions that come to tell the story . When that happens , the story is often told wrong . It will enable us as Ghanaians , as Africans , to understand ourselves better ‚Äî and hopefully the world will too . Support The Burial of Kojo on Kickstarter now !

This Father 's Day , join HuffPost in New York 's Madison Square Park and record your own parent-child interview live in a beautiful Facebook Live studio booth . Not in NYC ? No problem ! You can make your own video from home .
Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz had big dreams for building a coffee company , and he came this close to dropping them .
For The Huffington Post 's parent-child interview series Talk To Me , Howard opened up to his son , HuffPost Sports writer Jordan Schultz , about his childhood and the motivation behind his work .
He also recalled a moment years ago , when his wife Sheri Schultz was the sole breadwinner and seven months pregnant , while he worked without a salary on his small coffee business . Howard 's father-in-law asked for a private conversation to tell him , respectfully but seriously , `` It 's time that you give up this [ coffee ] hobby and get a job . ''
Howard started to cry , and said the conversation left him embarrassed . But when he brought it up to his wife , she had a different reaction .
`` She said , 'We 're going to follow these dreams that you have . We 're going to see this through , ' '' he remembered . `` And here we are . ''
Howard said his wife 's reaction was critical . `` If she was n't as supportive as as she was , I do n't think we would be here today . '' That moment also partly inspired him to encourage his kids to follow their own passions outside of the family business .
`` I felt very strongly that I had seen too many kids of successful parents go into their respective business , and I thought the pressure on you or [ your sister ] would have been too great to work at Starbucks , '' Howard told his son , adding later , `` We 'll help you in some way if you need it , but you should follow your own dreams , your own passions , and it 's worked out beautifully . ''
To close the interview , the proud dad offered his son some other important advice : `` Do n't be a bystander , be involved , be engaged , be curious , make a difference . ''

The libertarian view of ‚Äú voluntary slavery ‚Äù or ‚Äú slave contracts ‚Äù is mixed . There seems to be a great divide among the academics , such as Walter Block on one side and Murray Rothbard , et al . on the other .
Involuntary slavery is defined as the non-consensual servitude to a dominating influence , by threat or use of force . Voluntary slavery is defined as the agreement of servitude to a dominating influence , entered into at a point of consent .
For various reasons , an individual might want to sign his or her rights away into the custody of another party . According to some political theorists , voluntary slavery is a contradiction ; to others , it is perfectly acceptable .
Throughout human history , numerous declarations of independence have stated that the people have ‚Äú inalienable rights ‚Äù not contingent to any institution ( i.e. , natural rights , that can not be sold , transferred , or removed ) . According to the U.S . Declaration of Independence , as written by Thomas Jefferson , among those inalienable rights are ‚Äú life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ‚Äù .
Side note : Jefferson initially included ‚Äú property ‚Äù in lieu of said pursuit but the committee in charge of stylizing the document opted to omit that word . Does this mean that one can not sell or transfer his or her liberty to another party ?
In The Ethics of Liberty , economist and historian Murray Rothbard opines that ‚Äú [ t ] he concept of ‚Äò voluntary slavery ' is indeed a contradictory one , for so long as a laborer remains totally subservient to his master 's will voluntarily , he is not yet a slave since his submission is voluntary ; whereas , if he later changed his mind and the master enforced his slavery by violence , the slavery would not then be voluntary . ‚Äù
Rothbard 's assertion assumes no contract is involved , in which there would be a lot of incentive to have one . In addition , several forms of voluntary slavery counter this , even if in principle only .
An indentured servant is virtually a contracted slave ‚Äì an individual who agrees , per contract , for a price , to be in custody of another party . If contracts are to be enforced in a free society , then so should voluntary slave contracts .
Wage labor under a planned economy forces workers under duress to depend on an employer ‚Äì the employer is renting out the worker for an agreed-upon period of time . Often times wage labor results in the employment being the sole provider of livelihood for the worker . In the BDSM alternative lifestyle , a submissive might choose to be under contract , as a slave , to his or her Dominant , as his or her Master .
Or , as the rhetorical question goes , if slavery is taking 100 % of the fruits of someone else 's labor , at what percentage does it cease to be slavery ?
Rothbard 's contention is that if an individual volunteers to be in servitude , it is not slavery ; and if the same individual is being prevented from leaving , it is not voluntary . This is true if slavery were to be defined as inherently involuntary , but it is not .
U.S. slavery of ‚Äú undesirable ‚Äù whites , blacks , and Asians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was not voluntary . However , there were whites , blacks , and Asians who voluntarily signed contracts of servitude to find passage to and stay in the U.S. during that time . The voluntary slavery contracts made this arrangement . Therefore , by abandoning the contract after getting what the voluntary slave wanted , he or she would be stealing from the master . In contract law , this is legally unacceptable .
In The Structure of Liberty , lawyer and legal theorist Randy Barnett asserts that a ‚Äú claim that a right is inalienable must be distinguished from a claim that it is nonforfeitable. ‚Äù In other words , to be a [ socially-accepted ] slave , one must have committed a wrongdoing that resulted in someone taking away his or her freedom as punishment .
This is circular reasoning , since the possibility of someone ‚Äú removing ‚Äù the right to liberty of a wrongdoer would be forfeiture , as the latter knew of the consequences . If the wrongdoer can forfeit their right to liberty , so could an individual who wanted to be under a slave contract .
Barnett 's concern is largely about liability . In his book , and various essays , he argues that under a slave contract , the master could order the slave to violate the rights of a different individual . This argument ignores the fact that if slavery contracts were to be admissible under contract law , then the agreement shall not conflict with existing law .
Meaning , the slave would not be in breach of a contract by refusing to obey an illegal order . In constitutional law , it is lawful for military servicemen to disobey illegal orders given by superior officers . In BDSM , slavery contracts often come with licit clauses codifying stipulations , specifically that Master can order the slave to do anything , except where the latter would be in conflict with the law .
In ‚Äú Private Property 's Philosopher , ‚Äù intellectual historian and philosopher David Gordon says , ‚Äú only what fits together with self ownership can be enforced . You can only give away your property , not yourself . ‚Äù
His implication is that private property precedes contracts . Though he is correct in style , in substance he is assuming that an individual 's person is not their own property . Self-ownership is the owning of self , and if you own yourself , you can , in fact , sell or transfer that title . By the same token , it would be a violation of one 's self-ownership to initiate force to prevent him or her from voluntarily participating in a slavery contract .
The inalienability theory , in regards to voluntary slavery , creates a paradox . When the pursuit of happiness , and the sale or transfer of property , could be the ultimate goal of voluntary slavery among individuals . Either under the eyes of contract law or the parties of a slave contract , there is no issue about free will .
While Rothbard , Barnett , and Gordon are correct about the inability to sell or transfer one 's thoughts , they are wrong about the body . Sure the master can not control bodily functions , like hiccups or urination , but neither can an individual , even as a slave . And chances are , a contract will not have such stipulations , and even if it did , it would not be enforceable under the law .
So , when the definitions of voluntary and involuntary slavery are taken into consideration , it is clear to see the former does not violate anyone 's rights or consent . The view of a loud voice in defense of voluntary slavery , economist and professor Walter Block , can be summed up as , ‚Äú No law should be enacted prohibiting or even limiting in any way people 's rights to alienate those things they own . ‚Äù
While inalienable rights are objective , the self-selling of those rights are subjective under the principle of self-ownership . It would violate an individual 's rights and consent to force them to not participate in voluntary slavery . Especially if under a [ licit ] contract .
How does it feel that through two weeks of the season , the Browns are one of the most efficient offenses in the NFL ?
Pending the MNF game , who would 've thought that the # Browns would be the AFC 's 2nd highest scoring team ( 53 points for CLE , 55 for DEN ) ? ‚Äî Dawgs By Nature ( @ DawgsByNature ) September 15 , 2014
Looking thru some status this morning , and what team is the highest rated squad on offense per @ PFF ? The Cleveland Browns by +8.2 ‚Äî Brent Sobleski ( @ brentsobleski ) September 15 , 2014
Check out the snap distributions below for the offense , and let us know what your reactions are in the comments section .

Thoughts : All five members of the Browns ' starting offensive line played the entire game . The unit as a whole yielded one sack to the Saints .
Running Back / Fullback

47/75 plays 37 %

Terrance West : 19 carries , 68 yards , 3.6 YPC , 1 touchdown . 2 catches , 22 yards ( 2 targets ) .
Isaiah Crowell : 11 carries , 54 yards , 4.9 YPC . 1 catch , 3 yards ( 1 target ) .
Ray Agnew : 0 catches ( 2 targets ) .
Thoughts : Overall , it was another solid day for the Browns running backs . They ran with power , moved the chains when they needed to , and even caught a couple of passes this week . West 's best run came on his touchdown run when he saw the cutback lane to pay dirt . Agnew dropped one pass from Manziel , but it was lofted a bit and he took a shot as the ball was coming .

Miles Austin : 6 catches , 44 yards , 1 touchdown ( 10 targets ) .
Taylor Gabriel : 3 catches , 13 yards ( 4 targets ) .
Travis Benjamin : 1 catch , 6 yards ( 4 targets ) .
Thoughts : What a day for Andrew Hawkins ; it had to be a pretty special day for him too , because this is a guy who has been overlooked for most of his NFL career , and the Browns were the team to really put him in the spotlight . Now , he 's catching passes with the game on the line . Miles Austin performed exactly like the player one could hope for , so it 's a welcome surprise to see him actually pan out . Taylor Gabriel and Travis Benjamin were n't big factors as receivers , but I still support the even distribution of reps .
Tight End

1/75 plays
Gary Barnidge : 4 catches , 41 yards ( 4 targets ) .
Jim Dray : 1 catch , 5 yards ( 2 targets ) .
Gerrell Robinson : No stats registered .
Thoughts : When Rob Chudzinski brought Gary Barnidge to Cleveland in 2013 , and before Jordan Cameron broke out , we wondered if Barnidge could end up being the starting tight end . Because of how poor the pass protection was in 2013 , Barnidge was forced to be a blocker more times than not . This year , he 's getting a chance to contribute as a receiver , and he came up with the catch of the game on fourth down on Cleveland 's game-winning drive . Gerrell Robinson had a stray snap somewhere .
Quarterback
Brian Hoyer
Johnny Manziel
96 %
72/75 plays 4 %
3/75 plays
Brian Hoyer : 24-of-40 ( 60.0 % ) for 204 yards , 1 touchdown .
Johnny Manziel : 0-of-1 ( 0.0 % ) .
Thoughts : The `` Johnny '' package would have seemed stupid had we lost . Because we won , though , it works out great -- the seed is planted so that defenses have to waste time game-planning for it , and that could allow Kyle Shanahan to sneak some new wrinkles in to future offensive gameplans . Brian Hoyer remains turnover free and is such a good leader for this team -- well done to both guys for how they conducted themselves .

A new cache of diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shows how big pharmaceutical companies ' lobbying efforts threaten `` to taint US diplomatic relations in emerging nations , '' The Fix 's Jed Bickman and Walter Armstrong write . Big Pharma pushes American diplomats to pressure host countries -- the Philippines , Turkey , and India , for example -- to help them make more money , often by limiting the country from making its own generic version of the drugs and extending the length of patents so the companies can charge a premium price for longer .
The Fix writes that the memos `` by no means paint a uniform portrait of government lackeys doing industry 's bidding . '' But few weigh in on the moral problems with keeping drug prices high in poor countries with a lot of people who need them . `` Only a single cable -- from the outgoing US ambassador to Poland in 2009 -- lays bare the vast greed that drives these complex , highly technical negotiations . '' That ambassador 's case study is quite interesting :
When George W. Bush appointed his former Yale roommate , Victor Ashe , as ambassador to Poland , this issue became a constant demand on his time . Almost as soon as he arrived in Warsaw , the former Knoxville , Tennessee , mayor became the obedient mouthpiece of American drug companies ' interests , writing a letter urging the Ministry of Health not to lower the prices of the drugs on that list . Each year of his tenure , his office would obsess over the announcement of that list , sending detailed cables to Washington about which companies and products had gained access to the Polish market . ( ‚Äú None of Eli Lilly 's products were added , a blow to the company . Eli Lilly 's officials observed that the Ministry has offered no explanation . '' )
Once President Obama was sworn in and Ashe was sent packing , he apparently felt free to say what he 'd been thinking . Too bad he had to wait till he was leaving office to say it .

Left ; Fernando Bengoechea / Beateworks / Corbis : Reuters British primary school teacher Gillian Gibbons has been arrested in Sudan , accused of insulting Islam 's Prophet by letting her class of 7-year-olds name a teddy bear Mohammed .
It probably seemed like the most innocent of ideas to the newly arrived teacher from England , still settling into life in the Sudanese capital Khartoum . She asked her class of six- and seven-year-olds to dress up and name a teddy bear , and keep a diary of his outings . She hoped it would provide material for projects for the rest of the year . And it might have , except for the name the children chose for their bear : Muhammad .
Now Gillian Gibbons , 54 , is spending her second night in a Sudanese prison , accused of insulting Islam 's Prophet . She faces a public lashing or up to six months in prison if found guilty on charges of blasphemy . And Unity High School ¬ó one of a number of exclusive British-run schools in the Sudanese capital ¬ó has been closed as staff fear reprisals from Islamic extremists . Robert Boulos , the school 's director , said the incident had been blown out of all proportion , but added that the school would remain closed until January to let ill feelings blow over .
`` This was a completely innocent mistake , '' he said in an office decorated with sepia photographs dating back to the school 's colonial heyday . `` Miss Gibbons would have never wanted to insult Islam . ''
Police raided the school , where Gibbons also lives , on Sunday .
`` We tried to reason with them but we felt they were coming under strong pressure from Islamic courts , '' said Boulos . `` There were men with big beards asking where she was and saying they wanted to kill her . ''
A similar angry crowd had gathered by the time she arrived at the Khartoum police station where she is being held .
Unity , founded early in the last century , is one of several British schools run along Christian lines in an overwhelmingly Muslim country . Its high brick walls shut out the dust of everyday Sudanese life , transporting the visitor into the shady courtyard of an Oxbridge college or English private school . Many of its pupils come from well-to-do Sudanese families keen for their children to get the best education that money can buy . But Sudan is ruled by religious conservatives . Sharia law was introduced in 1991 ; alcohol is banned and women must wear headscarves . Convicted criminals are routinely flogged or executed .
The bizarre turn of events that led to the teacher 's arrest began in September , soon after she arrived in the country , according to colleagues who have rallied in her support . Her young class was due to study the behavior and habitat of bears , so she suggested that pupils bring in a teddy bear to serve as a case study . A seven-year-old girl brought in her favorite cuddly toy and the rest of the class was invited to name him . After considering the names Hassan and Abdullah , they voted overwhelmingly in favor of Muhammad ¬ó the first name of the most popular boy in the class .
`` No parents or teachers complained because they knew she had no bad intention , '' said Boulos . Until last week . Parents from another class raised concerns with the school . Then Sudan 's feared police came calling at the weekend . Gibbons ' colleagues said they feared a disgruntled member of staff may be using the issue to cause trouble .
Bishop Ezikiel Kondo , chairman of the school council , said : `` The thing may be very simple , but they just may make it bigger . It 's a kind of blackmail . '' Khartoum has exploded with anger at accusations of blasphemy in the past . Last year angry demonstrators denounced cartoons of the Prophet that appeared in Danish newspapers . And there have been protests at the actions of Zoe 's Ark , a French charity accused of trying to smuggle children out of neighboring Chad .
Now everyone is waiting to see whether religious leaders or politicians will take their supporters onto the streets this time . Most parents arriving at the school gates were supportive of the British teacher . One mother , whose seven-year-old son was in Gibbons ' class , said her family had not been offended by the name . `` Our Prophet Muhammad tells us to be forgiving , '' she said . `` So she should be released . She did n't mean any of this at all . ''
When the European Parliament 's Constitutional Affairs committee voted on changes to the EU lobby register ( 18 March ) , it explicitly noted its support for transparency NGOs .
`` The European Parliament ‚Ä¶ welcomes and encourages the role played by non-institutional watchdogs in monitoring the transparency of the EU Institutions , ‚Äù it said .
Noble sentiments indeed and there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the committee 's members , or the hundreds of MEPs who will most likely endorse this report when the plenary vote takes place in Strasbourg on Tuesday ( 15 April ) .
Sadly , these sentiments are not universally shared within the parliament , or , at least , not by those MEPs who are responsible for organising its internal affairs .
Last summer , Transparency International ( TI ) EU started the research for its study of the EU integrity system , which assesses the transparency , accountability and integrity of 10 EU institutions .
The study looks at the rules in place , but also how those rules are observed in practice . To do it properly it meant interviewing those people responsible for enforcing these rules in each institution .
All the institutions responded positively , with one striking exception ‚Äì the European Parliament .
Delays , prevarications , silences
The initial request for interviews was directed to the secretary general of the parliament , Klaus Welle , back in July 2013 . It was met with a series of delays , prevarications and long silences .
Last December , with time running out , we took the step of writing directly to the parliament 's governing body , the Bureau , pleading with them to look again at our request .
The parliament was even offered the opportunity to review the research findings before publication , in view of the short amount of time left .
A response from the President 's office finally came in February . It was a resounding No . The reasoning behind that refusal is so curious that it is worth reprinting in its entirety here .
There are a number of points worth noting in this short letter .
Firstly , look at the delay between the first request ( as acknowledged in the text ) and the date marked on the letterhead ‚Äì a full seven months . Not a great result for an institution that aspires to be responsive to EU citizens ' concerns .
Secondly , and peculiarly , the word integrity is placed in scare quotes , as if the authors of the letter were unsure what this means .
Thirdly , the claim that ‚Äú comprehensive information and documentation has been sent to you ‚Äù is slightly misleading . Transparency International received the information following access to document requests made through formal channels .
Fourthly , it cites a long list of committees and institutions that monitor the parliament 's affairs , but fails to acknowledge that the same is true of the other EU institutions that did acquiesce to interviews .
Finally , there is a rather baffling passage which appears to suggest that as the parliament 's internal bureaucracy is purely at the service of the political arm , that is a good reason why it should not talk to an NGO concerned with transparency and accountability .
It is possible to accept that this is parliament 's final word on the matter .
What is not possible to accept is that this is a full account of the reasons why the parliament refused to cooperate .
This is not merely speculation . A preparatory note for the meeting where the Bureau made its decision is worth quoting in full :
Too ‚Äò political ' and too close to EU elections
`` The request for co-operation and holding of interviews goes beyond normal administrative proceedings of the secretariat-general and the study could be considered as an audit of parliament , comparing it to other institutions ( instead of comparing the parliament with national parliaments ) .
`` The main focus is on members and the institutions ' approach to 'integrity ' . The objective of the study is political in nature and is likely to have a political impact on the Institution , taking into account past studies by TI in relation to members states and the chosen date of publication just before the European elections .
`` The institutions approached by TI have all reacted differently . Documentation sent by arliament to TI so far does not seem to satisfy TI 's purposes . It should also be pointed out that co-operating with TI should not create a precedent which could be invoked by other NGOs in order to carry out similar exercises . The president has been informed of the matter in November and has decided to put the issue to the Bureau . ''
Translation : This is not in our job description . We disagree with the approach taken by the study . We are unsure what `` integrity '' means .
What can one say about this unfortunate state of affairs ?
Fortunately , it is not representative of the vast majority of MEPs , assistant and officials we work with on a day-to-day basis .
And over the last five years the parliament has helped to push major anti-corruption and transparency reforms in the oil and gas sector and in anti-money laundering legislation .
As an anti-corruption organisation , we talk a lot about 'tone from the top ' and how that impacts on the values and behaviour of an organisation , making it clear that the rules apply to everyone with no exceptions . In this case , the tone is decidedly off-key .
We can only hope that the next parliament changes its tune .

ST. LOUIS , June 12 ( Thomson Reuters Accelus ) - Federal prosecutors are targeting medical marijuana shops in California , seeking forfeiture of the properties in which they do business .
The authorities are pressuring landlords to shut down the shops or face possible loss of the real estate through the unconventional and low-key use of a civil statute designed primarily to seize the assets of drug-trafficking organizations .
While some states , including California , have legalized medical marijuana businesses , the federal government does not recognize their authority to do so and has targeted the shops for violations of the 40-year-old Controlled Substances Act .
The goal of the Justice Department 's effort , part of a crackdown announced last October , is to fight the medical marijuana industry , estimated at $ 1.7 billion annually , without confronting it head-on with costly and potentially embarrassing criminal prosecutions , industry sources and legal experts said .
This indirect strategy is reminiscent of the department 's attempts , which have met with only limited success , to sever the medical pot industry 's access to banking services . Many businesses have found ways around those restrictions , experts said .
`` Filing asset-forfeiture lawsuits against these commercial properties is a very clever way to handle an otherwise horribly difficult and controversial situation , '' said Greg Baldwin , a partner at the Miami law firm Holland & Knight and a former federal prosecutor .
`` If you bring criminal charges against these medical marijuana businesses , the federal government gets pilloried in the press for attacking California law and sick people . ''
Baldwin , who specializes in complex commercial litigation and white-collar criminal defense , added that with all four U.S. attorneys in California employing the same strategy , it is clearly official Justice Department policy rather than an anomaly involving rogue prosecutors .
The new approach stems from Justice 's difficult position under President Barack Obama , said Allen St. Pierre , the executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
The department can not rely on heavy-handed criminal prosecutions to combat medical marijuana , St. Pierre said . But it also can not ignore the issue and risk being labeled soft on drug crime .
`` It 's being done softly , because if they tried to go the harsh criminal route there is a very good chance they would not only fail but become even more unpopular , something you tend to not want to do going into your last election , '' he said .
LAWSUITS AND LETTERS
Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles last week filed two asset-forfeiture lawsuits against buildings housing three marijuana stores in Santa Fe Springs . They also sent so-called warning letters to dozens of area property owners threatening similar legal action .
The letters - only the latest of hundreds mailed to property owners in recent months - gave the owners two weeks to comply with federal law , which prohibits involvement in marijuana distribution .
The civil-forfeiture statute allows the government to seize any real estate used to commit or facilitate drug trafficking .
The provision has traditionally been applied to residential properties used by drug traffickers to grow , store or distribute marijuana . Legal experts say there is no reason it can not be used against properties that house medical marijuana shops .
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the federal government 's authority to enforce the national ban on medical marijuana . Still , such enforcement remains unpopular . A Gallup survey last October found that 50 percent of Americans favored full legalization of marijuana and 70 percent favored allowing its medical use to alleviate pain and suffering .
Colorado , a key state in Obama 's reelection effort this year , has a medical marijuana law . In November voters will decide on a ballot measure aimed at all-out legalization .
As the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 , California has been a bellwether for the industry and federal law enforcement efforts to combat it .
If the move against commercial property owners succeeds in California , it could spread to other states with medical marijuana laws , legal experts said .
For-profit storefront marijuana shops , especially those opposed by the cities where they operate or located near schools or playgrounds , are the Justice Department 's favored targets .
Federal prosecutors across California launched a coordinated enforcement campaign in October 2011 , stating that California is the top marijuana-producing state in the country and that it exports the drug to other states .
Under the leadership of U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr , the Central District of California , based in Los Angeles , has been particularly aggressive . Federal prosecutors there said last week they have brought a dozen civil lawsuits seeking to forfeit properties housing marijuana businesses .
`` Three of those actions have been resolved with the closure of the marijuana stores and court-approved consent decrees in which property owners agreed that they would no longer rent to people associated with illegal marijuana operations , or the property would be subject to an immediate forfeiture to the government , '' the U.S. Attorney 's office said .
LESS MANPOWER REQUIRED
The Justice Department 's Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Central District of California , told Reuters that it requires less manpower to combat marijuana businesses by mail and civil actions than it does to bring criminal prosecutions .
`` We can get on the Internet , identify a store and have someone drive by and find out if it is operating . That is a whole lot different from conducting a criminal investigation , going out and making buys and conducting surveillance . These are two very different balls of wax , '' he said .
The letters and lawsuits have `` so far been extremely effective in securing the closure of about 200 illegal marijuana storefronts in our district , '' Mrozek said .
Baldwin , the Miami lawyer , was not surprised . Few property owners are going to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend against a government lawsuit to keep a tenant , let alone risk losing their investments , he predicted .
`` Most of these things are going to end up with the landlord kicking out the offending enterprise , '' he said . `` It 's like a flank attack against these stores that leaves them in the most disadvantageous position possible . ''
NORML 's St. Pierre said the federal government `` has not sufficiently broadcast this threat ( of eviction ) as a deterrent , '' so a lack of widespread awareness among landlords in California and other states may soften its impact on the industry . He said that when marijuana businesses are kicked out of one property , `` they will simply move next door and the whole process , as we 've seen time and time again , simply starts over . ''
Although authorities have made public the strategy of targeting landlords , they have not made a national campaign of it , and so far only landlords who rent to marijuana shops have received warning letters .
CHALLENGING EVICTIONS
The letters ' prospects might also be affected by the weak real estate market , actions by the municipalities where the properties are located , and California 's strict eviction laws .
Ken Carter , a property owner who rented commercial space in Murrieta to the Greenhouse Cannabis Club , which opened for business in January , said he soon received a warning letter from the U.S. Attorney 's office in Los Angeles .
Carter said that although he was intimidated by it he was not about to panic , because the value of the property had fallen to roughly half the $ 1 million he owed on it . Although authorities summoned Carter to the property during a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) raid this year , federal prosecutors never took legal action against him . He said he could not explain the lack of action .
However , he said the city of Murrieta , which banned medical marijuana shops in 2005 , began issuing a $ 2,500 fine for every day Greenhouse remained on the property . He said that persuaded him to begin an eviction process , but it took several months to complete . The city has sued Carter and wants him to pay $ 150,000 in fines , he said .
Eric Safire , a San Francisco lawyer , is representing the owner of commercial property in the Mission District of San Francisco where an existing tenant opened the Shambhala Healing Center , a medical marijuana business that began operating in January 2011 .
In late February of this year , the property owner received a warning letter from the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Northern District of California , Safire said . He eventually had to file suit to evict his tenant . The matter was complicated by the fact that the tenant had made substantial improvements to the property before opening Shambhala , Safire added .
Safire said the tenant agreed to end the marijuana business by this July 1 . Reuters left a telephone message seeking comment from Shambhala 's owner but did not receive a response .
SCARING BANKS
St. Pierre likened the campaign to the Justice Department 's effort to scare banks away from doing business with medical marijuana outfits .
`` There will still be landlords leasing to these businesses , so I do n't think it 's ultimately going to be successful , just like the effort to thwart the banking , '' he said .
The DEA began warning banks and credit-card companies away from medical marijuana businesses in late 2007 or early 2008 .
Some marijuana outfits have been forced to operate as cash-only businesses , but by and large the industry has survived and , by some expert accounts , thrived by operating through front companies or personal accounts .
HIGH RISK , HIGH REWARD
St. Pierre said the federal ban has made medical marijuana a `` high risk , high reward '' business . Entrepreneurs willing to flout the federal ban can earn hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars each year , and may be willing to face the challenge of eviction , he said .
Those who fail to heed these measures may face greater sanctions , however . The Justice Department 's Mrozek said property owners or marijuana sellers who are not persuaded by warnings and civil action could find themselves in the dock on criminal charges , a fact he said was spelled out in the 220 warning letters dispatched by prosecutors in Los Angeles thus far .

SHARMINI PERIES : It 's The Real News Network . I 'm Sharmini Peries , coming to you from Baltimore . Former Blackwater CEO , Erik Prince , is making waves after penning an op-ed in the New York Times on Wednesday . He was calling on Donald Trump to adopt using private mercenaries to lead the war in Afghanistan . This is the second such major op-ed that Prince has penned in the last month or so . The last one was in the Financial Times . And of course , one in Fox News as well . I would say that Prince has a pretty good PR firm behind him given the mainstream newspapers that he 's getting a chance to pen op-eds in . And of course this allows him to revive his charred reputation . Prince previously headed the infamous Blackwater company that was mired in controversy . Most notably , was responsible for a massacre of civilians in Iraq in Nisour Square .
Joining us now to discuss this is Larry Wilkerson . Larry , as you know , was former chief of staff to the Secretary of State Colin Powell . Thank you so much for joining us today , Larry .
And I know you have a very short window with us , so let me jump right to the question and ask you : What do you make of this op-ed that 's been penned by Erik Prince in the New York Times ? And what do you make of the advice he 's giving Trump as well as the space that Prince has been given in the Times that there is a lot of controversy around right now ?
LARRY WILKERSON : I think , as I 've said many times before , that this is privatizing the ultimate public function , which is to kill people for state purposes‚Äìwar . I think this is a dangerous , if not the most dangerous , path we 've contemplated in a long time to go down . It 's incredible that the London Financial Times some months ago gave Erik Prince editorial space to talk about doing this for Europe 's problem with regard to Libyan refugees . One can only imagine what Erik Prince was going to do in order to stop those refugees . And now , the New York Times giving him space . It 's incredible that this man , who is worse than the British East India Company 's worst dreams and nightmares , is allowed to write in what are supposed to be the prestigious newspapers in the English-speaking world .
SHARMINI PERIES : Larry , let me read what Erik Prince had actually penned in this editorial in the New York Times , a section of it . He writes :
‚Äú The ‚Äò new ' strategy that the president adopted last week would reportedly increase authorized troop levels from 8,400 to around 12,400 . This will merely continue the conflict . And no one can seriously argue that this strategy wo n't inevitably require more spending , more troops and more casualties . In a war that has already lasted twice as long as Vietnam , is this the ‚Äò new ' strategy we want ? ‚Äù He says .
Give us your response to that .
LARRY WILKERSON : Well , we ca n't fight wars anymore without contractors . That 's the sad state of the all-volunteer force and the number of people we actually have in the land forces , in particular , of the military . But I recall what Colin Powell told me a few years ago when one of the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had just called him and asked him , what would be the first couple of things he would do were he chairman again ? And Colin did n't hesitate and said , ‚Äú I 'd see how many people I have on private contract , and I 'd fire half of them . And then I 'd look at the other half for potential firing of them . ‚Äù
In other words , DOD has no idea where billions , perhaps even larger than that , dollars are going in terms of private contractors , what they 're paying them , what they 're doing , where they 're operating , and so forth . But the bottom line is , because of the size of the military today , you ca n't do war without contractors in the war zone . But that certainly does n't mean you need to go the next step and turn the war over to them exclusively .
SHARMINI PERIES : All right . Now , you teach in this area at the university , and also you 've taught at the military academy . What is the take on the part of the military in terms of using contractors ? Or is this a false dichotomy ? Are they all merged at this point when the U.S. considers war in countries like Afghanistan ?
LRRY WILKERSON : Oh , I think the professional military looks at contractors as a necessary evil in terms of the size of the military and its need to free up troops , therefore , to be able to shoulder the burden of the military , fighting , in other words . And that 's cooking , that 's washing clothes , that 's doing the kinds of things that the military is relieved of having to do by having these contractors . But that 's not out there fighting for them . That 's not out there killing for them .
There are a lot of problems in that with the professional military , which you just suggested . There 's jealousy , for example , in the fact that maybe that private 's getting paid $ 30,000 a year , and that private contractor 's getting paid upwards of $ 120,000 , $ 130,000 a year . There 's also the difference in law prevailing over contractors at war , as it were , and military at war . There 's also the difference in jobs that are handled by the military as opposed to jobs that are handled by the contractors .
And I find it really ‚Ä¶ I was almost laughing reading Erik Prince 's supposed excursion into history , talking about Claire Chennault and the Flying Tigers and so forth . That is an utterly ridiculous comparison . It shows Erik Prince up for what he is .
Claire Chennault and the Flying Tigers and those brave young men who flew war planes over to Britain in the beginning of World War II , and who actually went over and flew in the Royal Air Force for Britain in the Battle of Britain , they were defending the United States of America against a heinous enemy that threatened to topple us all . And they were the leading element of Franklin Roosevelt 's ability to try and understand and get the American people to understand that we might be fighting a two-front war . We did n't want China to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japan , and we certainly did n't want Britain to collapse . That was an utterly ridiculous historical analogy that Erik Prince tried to draw . His people are no Claire Chennaults , and they 're not the boys that flew those airplanes for the British in the Battle of Britain .
SHARMINI PERIES : Right . Now , Larry , since President Trump made the speech last week , there 's been a lot of talk about the increase of troops from what it is reported now , from 8,400 to around 12,400 troops . And also the fact that he did n't put an end date . I know you talked to Paul Jay about this when you guys went live last week on this . But give us a sense of what this kind of troop increment as well as this not putting a deadline on ending this war means for us .
LARRY WILKERSON : Well , it 's all political for President Trump , of course . It 's to differentiate him from President Obama , and to demonstrate to the American people , such as those that are still on his side . I saw the polls yesterday , they 're getting even lower and lower . He 's gon na rival the congress pretty soon with single-digit poll ratings .
But what it is , it 's to say : I 'm smarter than President Obama 'cause I do n't give timelines and I do n't give dates certain and I do n't give numbers out , and so forth and so on . That might be smart in an operational professional military sense . Sometimes in a political sense it makes no rhyme or reason at all , though . In this case I think we 're talking about , is we 're talking about a tactical situation where the United States wants to look , and President Trump in particular wants to look because he now owns Afghanistan , he now owns this war , he wants to look like he knows what he 's doing .
So on the tactical side of the coin , he wants enough troops over there to make it look as if the Taliban are losing territory , maybe they 're being compelled to political talks and so forth . I mean , after all Donald Trump 's got is about three-and-some-change years left in the White House by anyone 's sane reasoning . So that 's all he 's got ta do is survive that time , and he can leave the White House and he wo n't have owned the war to an extent that it looks really bad for him .
The bigger strategic situation , which you just suggested , I discussed with Paul Jay , does I do n't think we 're gon na leave Afghanistan anytime soon . And this is just the camel 's nose under the tent , so to speak ; although , we 've been doing that for 16 years . We 're gon na stay there for 50 years or longer .
SHARMINI PERIES : All right . Larry , I thank you so much for joining us today . And I know you have to leave us , you 're on your way elsewhere . So I thank you so much for joining us with such short notice today .
LARRY WILKERSON : Thanks for having me , Sharmini .
SHARMINI PERIES : And thank you for joining us here on The Real News Network .
A massive iceberg that broke off from Antarctica 's Pine Island glacier last November is drifting out into the open ocean , according to NASA scientists .
The ice massif , known as B31 , will be swept up in the currents of the Southern Ocean soon ; however , tracking the iceberg will be difficult as winter descends on Antarctic leaving little daylight for scientists to work with .

According to NASA scientists , iceberg calving is routine , but the breaking off of B31 has raised new questions about the speed at which the process occurs .
‚Äú Iceberg calving is a very normal process , ‚Äù said NASA 's Kelly Brunt , a glaciologist at Goddard Space Flight Center . ‚Äú However , the detachment rift , or crack , that created this iceberg was well upstream of the 30-year average calving front of Pine Island Glacier ( PIG ) , so this is a region that warrants monitoring . ‚Äù
Scientists are reportedly much more interested in the fate of the Pine Island glacier , which is ‚Äú thinning and draining rapidly ‚Äù and could lead to a significant increase in sea levels if the process continues .

While fans of the North American Soccer League and the New York Cosmos learned about the team 's plans to host a final at Belson Stadium three days ago , the venue has been in place for well over a month .
But even after weeks to prepare themselves for the announcement , no one is happy about the situation . Not the Cosmos . Not the league . Not the fans .
No one .
So how did New York end up settling on the 2,600 seat Belson Stadia ? Well , that is a complicated story ‚Äî one that begins before the season even started .
As it goes , NASL teams are required to submit blackout and open dates well before the start of any campaign . That includes dates for regular season games and potential playoff matches .
In their due diligence , the Cosmos approached Hofstra about potential dates . Hofstra promptly told the Cosmos before the start of the season that Shuart Stadium would not be available for the dates requested . That put New York on a year-long search for a venue ‚Äî a search that eventually ended in Jamaica , Queens .
Initially , the biggest issue the Cosmos faced was securing a facility on the chance that they would make the final . Unlike past seasons , getting to the final was no foregone conclusion . For starters , they lost star players like Marcos Senna and Raul . At the same time , the Cosmos front office enacted major budget cuts for the season which prohibited New York to pursue the kinds of talents they acquired in years past .
In short , there was no guarantee of a Final appearance , so securing a venue month in advance was both potentially costly ( cancellation fees ) and unrealistic .
That 's not to say they did n't try . New York explored several options in the months that followed , including venues like Mitchel Field , MCU Park , Fordham 's Coffey Field and Columbia University 's Rocco Commisso Stadium .
Some locations were not available due to other events . In other cases , there were extenuating circumstances limiting their choices .
MCU Park is a prime example . The home of the Cyclones is still the leading venue to host Cosmos home matches next season , making it an ideal location for the Final . Players raved about the turf last year , with several Cosmos members , including the aforementioned Raul and Senna , telling EoS that the field played better than their home park at Shuart .
However , the optics were not right for the Final ‚Äî a sentiment shared by both the club and the league . MCU Park 's artificial surface is adorned with an irreplaceable baseball diamond . The only solution to cover it up would be to a ) hire expensive labor and material to lay down and cure sod on the field , or b ) invest thousands in labor and transport for the Nexxfield turf ‚Äî used by Rayo OKC in their home stadium .
With no guarantee that either would take , venues like MCU or similar parks with permanent sporting lines were eschewed .
Another popular option would have been Red Bull Arena . However , there is no indication that the Cosmos ever reached out to Red Bull for the potential site ‚Äî a decision likely driven by the optics of renting an MLS arena for the NASL final .
The Cosmos then explored the idea of hosting the match in a neutral venue . Those talks were quickly quelled in deference to the club 's sporting side . As Cosmos COO Erik Stover has said since , it would do the club a disservice to play away after the players and staff worked so hard to get to the final .
Selling the hosting rights to the final was brought up , but not pursued . As one source explained , it puts the club at a competitive disadvantage . As an example , the most ideal location for an NASL final is Indy Eleven 's Carroll Stadium . Few , if any , NASL venues match the environment and fanfare of The Mike .
However , that location would never be ideal for New York . The Mike has been a nightmare for the Cosmos , who have never achieved a victory at Indy in over two seasons of play .
In short , a sale to a playoff competitor would put the team in a massive hole ‚Äî an undesirable outcome after such a successful season . Likewise , a neutral location , like WakeMed Park , would lessen the home support the Cosmos so rightfully earned .
Options were dwindling and the Cosmos needed answers . As EoS reported weeks ago , the club tried to circle with Hofstra again , going so far as to suggest weekday dates for the Final . The university , however , would not budge .
Once the turf issues , scheduling conflicts , and baseball and football lines cleared , there remained one option standing : Belson Stadium .
While Belson is n't the ideal setting for any professional final , it does help the Cosmos . The 2,600 seat stadia holds the potential for a rather raucous and intimate environment , pitting the potential 300+ Indy Eleven traveling fans against the Cosmos ' casuals and hardcore supporters . Add to that equation New York 's dwindling attendance numbers and the allure of playing within New York City proper , and Belson just fit .
But that is about as positive as it gets .
For better or worse , this will be the destiny of the 2016 NASL Championship match .
That is , if Rayo OKC does n't have something to say about it .
A Ferguson , Missouri , police officer was shot recently while he was investigating a break-in .
From the stories I have read on the Internet about the shooting , the media have made it a point not to describe the suspect or suspects the police are searching for . I do n't know about you , but I find this rather fascinating .
You may recall how our national propaganda ministry reported ad nauseum the detailed description and race of Michael Brown and that of the police officer who killed him .
Based on crime stats in Ferguson and elsewhere , it would be a safe bet to assume the two thugs the police are looking for are black males between the age of 15 and 25 .
It would also be a safe bet the two thugs being searched for were raised by a single parent , have criminal records , are high school dropouts , do n't have jobs and are very likely to be members of a gang . Just a random Nuge hunch .
The Ferguson thugs are n't alone . The overwhelming majority of violent crime across America is conducted by young , black males who , sadly , are on the self-inflicted expressway to prison or an early grave ‚Äì or more often than not , both .
A plague of black violence has infested our inner cities , yet our national propaganda ministry has chosen to ignore the gory details of this plague , as do so many of our politicians . Instead , they focus on ‚Äú gun-related ‚Äù violence , supposed lax gun laws and their redundant litany of mindless excuse-making instead of the raw data . They seldom if ever cut to heart of the matter .
Liberalism and their insane cult of denial is the root cause of this plague of violence .
It is liberalism that engineered and created the very conditions that have decimated and destroyed black American families and their communities . Astonishingly and regretfully , the overwhelming majority of black Americans continue to vote for the very political party that has destroyed them .
It is the big lie of liberalism that has enslaved and destroyed so many black families and their communities .
Experience more of Ted Nugent 's no-holds-barred passion and patriotism in his books and WND 's ‚Äú Ted Nugent for President ! ‚Äù bumper sticker
It is deaf , dumb and blind liberalism that has shoveled over $ 20 trillion into Fedzilla 's welfare crack programs over the past 50 years . Their big lie is that this was all done to eliminate poverty . What it really has done is waste this gargantuan pile of money while doing nothing to eliminate poverty , but in fact , increase it .
The bullet-proof truth is that our hard-earned tax dollars were torched by Democrats to create a permanent voting block out of black Americans . Money is the bait , and they took it , hook , line and sinker . Now President Obama has proposed shoveling another $ 10 trillion over the next 10 years for more Fedzilla welfare crack .
Project 21 spokesman Christopher Arps stated , ‚Äú The War on Poverty has arguably destroyed the black nuclear family . Roughly 75 percent of black children were born to a married two-parent family when the ‚Äò war ' began in 1964 . By 2008 , the percentage of black babies born out of wedlock numbered over 72 percent . Today , the rate of unwed motherhood in the black community is more than twice as high as among whites ‚Äì and almost three times higher than before big government 's grand intervention . And all this comes at a steep financial cost . The federal government has spent an estimated $ 15 trillion to end poverty . Government reportedly spent $ 20,610 on every poor individual and $ 61,830 per poor family in 2012 . ‚Äù
You might want to take note that President Obama , Attorney General Holder , Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton refuse to state the irrefutable truth of Mr. Arps ' statement of fact .
Burn this into your cerebral cortex : The two greatest sins a government can impose on its citizens are to 1 ) provide for them , because it destroys their souls by creating dependency instead of self-reliance , and 2 ) take the sweat , hard work and equity of one man and give it to another ( e.g. , spread the wealth around ) .
The road to peace and prosperity in America is to reject the big liberal lie and all those who endorse it .
Liberalism is a lie . Liberalism is a scam . Liberalism is a killer .

JAKARTA , Indonesia ( AP ) ‚Äî U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says the Pentagon will sell eight Apache attack helicopters to Indonesia for $ 500 million .
The deal includes high-tech Longbow radars .
At a news conference Monday in the Indonesian capital , Hagel also said Indonesia has agreed to discuss allowing U.S. recovery teams to search for the remains of U.S. troops lost on Indonesian soil or in its territorial waters during World War II . The work will be done by the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command .
Hagel is in Jakarta to meet with top government officials before attending an Asian defense ministers meeting in Brunei .
Kathy Griffin Apologizes For Falsely Depicting Herself As Socially Relevant
LOS ANGELES , CA‚ÄîKathy Griffin , who sources describe as a comedian , apologized Tuesday for publishing a gruesome photo to social media which falsely depicts herself as someone with current political and social relevance .
The image of Ms. Griffin holding a bloodied , severed head in the likeness of President Donald Trump stirred immediate controversy , as Americans were violently subjected to the distressing notion that the self-proclaimed D-list actress ' opinion about the President carried with it some sort of societal clout , or even mattered at all to anyone .
The blowback was swift and loud , and Griffin quickly went into damage control mode .
‚Äú I sincerely apologize . . . I went way too far , ‚Äù she said in a video posted to Twitter . ‚Äú The image is too disturbing . I understand how it offends people . It was n't funny‚ÄîI get it . ‚Äù
‚Äú I beg for your forgiveness . I went too far . I made a mistake , and I was wrong . ‚Äù
Rancher Cliven Bundy looks like he could still be in a heap of trouble for having thoroughly ticked off Fedzilla and the Keebler elf himself , Harry Reid .
Being the peacemaking Christian that I am , herewith are ten ways Cliven Bundy could get the Feds off his backside and actually ingratiate himself to the big government droogies of the Left .
1 . Bundy should fire his ranch foreman and hire Jay Carney who could effectively lie his butt off about Cliven 's cows . ‚Äú Eating grass ? His cows are n't eating grass . What are you talking about ? These are the most transparent , grass adverse , cows ever . ‚Äù
2 . Bundy should rename his ranch ‚Äú Benghazi ‚Äù , then the Feds would never show up . Ever .
3 . Staying with the Benghazi motif , Bundy could also blame his cows ' raid upon the BLM 's grass flats the result of an anti-Muslim YouTube video . Case closed .
4 . Bundy should start boldly smoking and selling grass versus having his cows eat the grass .
5 . Bundy should become , for the remainder of his life , a vile race-baiter . If he sold nothing but hate towards whites and conservatives , he could owe the IRS two million in back-taxes and they 'd include him during White House fundraisers and MSNBC would give him his own talk show . Problem solved .
6 . Staying in the racist vein , Bundy could join the New Black Panthers Party , change his name to Shabrique Shazamm and intimidate all the white devils when they show up to vote during the upcoming midterms . Can you say , ‚Äú Instant protection by the DOJ ? ‚Äù
7 . Bundy should get gold-capped teeth , trade his cowboy hat in for a hoodie , walk around holding his crotch and say ‚Äú mother- % & # $ @ ‚Äù every other word . He 'd be hailed as a victim and a poet . A victim poet , I tell you .
8 . Bundy should build a mosque on Ground Zero . If he did that he 'd own half of Nevada .
9 . Bundy should start hanging out with Latin dictators and expand his enterprise from cattle ranching to a gun running operation for drug cartels south of the border . Do it , Cliven . Like , muy pronto .
10 . Finally , and especially , Bundy should claim that he was the inspiration for Brokeback Mountain . If CB played the gay card they 'd throw him a party at the White House and the BLM goons , wearing Daisy Dukes , would serve him and his posse a desert tortoise consomm√© .

New Video : John C. Goodman on Obamacare and Curing the Healthcare Crisis
1 ) Obamacare after the Election
Tuesday¬ís election means that the Affordable Care Act won¬ít be repealed by a hostile Congress . But Obama¬ís signature initiative will undergo major changes . That¬ís because it¬ís rife with serious flaws that congressional Democrats will want to fix even if the House Republicans sit on their hands . In a recent op-ed for Townhall , healthcare economist and Independent Institute Research Fellow John C. Goodman looks at six flaws of Obamacare that lawmakers won¬ít be able to ignore . The first is that Obamacare is not paid for¬ónot in any politically realistic way , that is .
Two Medicare Trustees reports , for example , predict that 14 percent of hospitals would be forced out of the Medicare system in the next eight years , due to Obamacare¬ís $ 716 billion cuts in Medicare spending . President Obama claimed to have found $ 716 billion in savings to cover the shortfall , but that was campaign rhetoric , according to Goodman . And because politicians are unlikely to reduce coverage for seniors , expect deficit spending to make up the difference .
Nor can Obamacare deliver what it promises¬óespecially for our most vulnerable populations . One reason is that there simply aren¬ít enough doctors to see all of the formerly uninsured plus the existing patients who are supposed to have access to greater preventive care . ¬ìThose in plans that pay below market will be pushed to the rear of the lines , ¬î Goodman writes . ¬ìThese will be the elderly and the disabled on Medicare , poor people on Medicaid and ( if the Massachusetts model is followed ) the newly insured in subsidized plans in the health insurance exchanges.¬î Goodman also faults the healthcare law for the likely reduction of full-time employment in the restaurant and hotel industries and for creating perverse incentives that will lower the quality of care . ¬ìAgain , these problems have nothing to do with Republican opposition , ¬î he writes . ¬ìThey are inherent in the legislation itself . Democrats will be forced to face them whether they want to or not.¬î

2 ) Violent Crime May Fall with Pot Liberalization
Many national pundits view last week¬ís election results as more of the same . But this perception isn¬ít accurate . One change¬óa significant one¬ótook place in Colorado and Washington : Voters passed statewide measures to decriminalize marijuana for adults¬í recreational use . Since drug prohibition is a textbook example of policies with harmful unintended consequences , Independent Institute Research Fellow Art Carden predicts that last week¬ís repeal of the pot bans will¬óunless the federal government interferes¬óyield some significant benefits . In a recent piece on the Forbes magazine website , he makes three specific predictions ( in no particular order ) .
First , crime in Colorado and Washington will fall . Violence between drug dealers will fall¬óas will the marijuana revenues collected by violent gangs . Second , the demand for hard drugs like crack cocaine and crystal meth will fall . That¬ís because in the long run some drug users will consume less of these hard drugs and more marijuana , as the supply of pot increases and its price falls . ( Carden claims that consumption will not increase enough to push prices up . ) Third , Colorado and Washington residents will enjoy a ¬ìpeace dividend¬î from scaling back the war on drugs . For example , the police will direct more of their efforts toward fighting violent crime and fraud .
Perhaps the biggest consequence will occur as politicians pay closer attention to the electoral victories and improved social outcomes in Colorado and Washington . ¬ìIf we¬íre lucky , ¬î Carden concludes , ¬ìour children will inherit a world in which the disastrous effects of drug prohibition are nothing but a sad chapter in a history book.¬î And in a separate article in Forbes , Independent Institute Research Fellow Jeffrey A. Miron , director of undergraduate economic studies at Harvard University , hails the state marijuana initiatives as a victory for liberty . ¬ìThe burden of proof should rest on those who would ban marijuana , not those who want it legal , ¬î he says . ¬ìThat burden has never been met.¬î

3 ) How Much Gold Would Retire the National Debt ?
On the first day of November the U.S. government was in debt to the tune of $ 16.222 trillion¬ó $ 5.595 trillion more than it owed on the day that Barack Obama moved into the White House . How much gold would it take to retire the national debt ? Independent Institute Research Fellow Craig Eyermann has made the calculation .
It¬ís a lot of gold¬ó¬ìthe equivalent of a solid gold cube that is nearly 80 feet tall by 80 feet long by 80 feet wide , ¬î Eyermann writes on the MyGovCost blog . It would take more than 431 standard-sized shipping containers to haul them . But don¬ít expect to see this feat in real life . The reason isn¬ít simply one of logistics . It¬ís one of scarcity . The U.S. government owes more money than the value of all the gold ever mined on Planet Earth . Even if Uncle Sam were to draw down all of the gold reserves from Fort Knox , at today¬ís spot price an additional 182 twenty-foot-long shipping containers of gold would be needed to get the federal government out of the red .
It would be a formidable task to pay off even the amount of U.S. debt that was accumulated under Obama¬ís watch . The gold needed to retire the increase from the President¬ís inauguration until Nov. 1 would fill 149 regular corrugated boxes . ¬ìLaid out end to end , those 149 standard shipping containers would be almost six-tenths of a mile in length , ¬î Eyermann writes . ¬ìThat¬ís just over one-third of the length of the 431.5 shipping containers that would hold all the gold representing the United States¬í entire public debt outstanding.¬î

4 ) U.S. Seeks Misguided Proxy War in Mali
The Obama administration seeks to open up another front on the war against Islamic militants . This one is in Mali . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met recently with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to urge him to help invade his southwestern neighbor¬óand reportedly encountered indifference . It seems that the Algerians don¬ít worry much about Mali¬ís Islamists¬óthat is , not unless Algeria is promised special inducements from foreign governments . So , why should the United States worry ?
According to Ivan Eland , senior fellow at the Independent Institute , U.S. policymakers are guilty of making the same mistake about Islamist insurgents that they made about foreign Communists before Nixon¬ís trip to China : they are failing to draw crucial distinctions between ideologically similar groups . Looking beneath the label , Mali¬ís Islamists have different goals than the western-targeting jihadists of al-Qaeda . Invading Mali in an effort to counter growing Islamist power would do little to end al-Qaeda¬ís war against the United States .
Mali¬ís Islamists focus on local matters , not on taking jihad to the West . But they may begin to target western assets if the United States and its allies stir up hornet¬ís nest . ¬ìWhy create more anti-U.S. terrorists in a part of the world that is hardly strategic to U.S. vital interests ? ¬î Eland writes . If Mali¬ís Islamists eventually decide to allow anti-U.S. terror groups to train there , the United States has the means of taking them out . ¬ìBut at a time of war weariness and budget and economic crises at home , the U.S. can not afford to keep making new and unnecessary enemies by promoting an invasion of Mali , ¬î Eland concludes .

Most of the finest matcha in the world , comes from Japan . There are approximately three seasons for harvesting matcha tea leaves , May , August and sometimes in November depending on weather and growing patterns . The spring season during May is often considered the best season for picking tea .
Photo : Rocket news , shading the tea leaves
The highest quality Ceremonial matchas are shaded for 3-4 weeks and then hand picked . Only the outermost top leaves are picked containing the highest levels of anti-oxidants , catechins , chlorophyll , and l-theanine . Shading the tea plants not only forces the chlorophyll to reach up through the leaves to the sun , but also limits the bitterness of tea that grows a long time in the sun , in this way , the shaded hand-picked tea leaves remain sweet with a delicious gentle ‚Äò unami ' flavor .
The beautiful green leaves are stone ground and fresh packed in tins for shipping around the world .
Fresh hand-picked tea leaves shaded before picking . They contain the highest levels of chlorophyll , anti-oxidants and nutrients to make ceremonial matchas . Tencha are leaves that are de-stemmed and de-veined , lightly steamed and dried . It 's when the tencha leaves are stone-ground into a very fine powder , that the tea becomes ‚Äò matcha , ' literally meaning ground tea .
An old tea field still beautiful and yielding tea leaves , has an exquisite bamboo forest behind it . You will often find tea fields surrounded by exotic stands of forests in Japan , it 's a beautiful environment .

The vast majority of Canadians ( 84 % ) say President Donald Trump made the wrong call in exiting the Paris Climate Change Accord , and exactly the same number say Canada should remain committed to the deal .
Unusually , these views cross partisan lines .
Even a majority of Canadian Conservative voters , who have generally been opposed to measures to fight climate change , are convinced that Trump 's decision was unwise ( 61 % ) and that Canada should stay in the deal ( 62 % ) .
A large part of the reason why people support climate action is to prevent environmental calamities and to do the right thing by future generations . But increasingly , our research is revealing that more and more people see a shift from non-renewable fossil fuel energy as part of a sound economic strategy for the future .
In this survey , by a margin of 3 to 1 Canadians say they think the economies in the world that do the best in the future will be those that shift to renewable or cleaner energy , rather than those who use lower-cost fossil fuels for as long as possible .
This view is even held by a small majority ( 53 % ) of Conservative voters and a substantial majority of people living in Alberta and Saskatchewan .
UPSHOT
According to Bruce Anderson : ‚Äú Donald Trump , while intending to do the opposite , has possibly done more to galvanize support for climate action than his predecessors in the White House .
Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular in Canada ( we 'll have a release on this later this week ) and his arguments against the Paris Accord ( it 's too costly for America , we need to use more coal , etc . ) are probably helping clarify for people what side of this argument they do n't want to be on .
This week in Parliament , only days after Mr. Trump 's announcement , Canada 's Conservative Party reversed field and voted in support of the Paris Accord , for the first time . As incoming leader Andrew Scheer had previously voted against the Accord , it 's not a stretch to believe that the fact and the tone of Mr. Trump 's leadership made it even more uncomfortable for the Conservatives to stand outside the global mood in support of the Accord .
But possibly the most important finding in this survey is the growing feeling among Canadians , including many Conservatives and Albertans , that an energy transition is not only good for the environment but probably sensible economic strategy too .
According to David Coletto : ‚Äú There are few Donald Trump fans in Canada and his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Accord on climate change did very little to gain new ones . The overwhelming majority in Canada think it was a bad decision and a similar number think Canada to should press ahead and remain committed to the Accord .
As Bruce said , Trump probably did more to mobilize action for action on climate change in opposing the Accord than any international leader could have done arguing in favour of it .
In Canada , support for our government to press ahead is broad and deep . The audience for political leaders who doubt climate change is happening is small ( and shrinking ) .
Trump fashions himself a master of deal making , but there 's little evidence that his idea of renegotiation with the rest of the world is taking root . ‚Äù
Listen to a quick audio briefing on the results here :
METHODOLOGY
Our survey was conducted online with 1,518 Canadians aged 18 and over from June 2 to 5 , 2017 . A random sample of panelists was invited to complete the survey from a large representative panel of over 500,000 Canadians .
The Marketing Research and Intelligence Association policy limits statements about margins of sampling error for most online surveys . The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 1,518 is +/- 2.6 % , 19 times out of 20 .
The data were weighted according to census data to ensure that the sample matched Canada 's population according to age , gender , educational attainment , and region . Totals may not add up to 100 due to rounding .

Americans For Prosperity is struggling to find a way to attack Obamacare that fits the facts .
The Koch-funded conservative activist group is spending millions of dollars on TV ads aimed at undermining the Affordable Care Act and unseating Democratic senators who voted for it in their 2014 reelection fights .
But the ads keep falling flat upon examination of their claims .
One ad features a horror story from Julie Boonstra , a 49-year-old cancer patient who says her plan was canceled by Obamacare and that her new one was too expensive . ‚Äú If I do not receive my medication , I will die , ‚Äù she says . But as TPM and others reported , it turns out Boonstra would actually save money under Obamacare , although she would n't admit it .
Another features a man who says he 's ‚Äú scared to death ‚Äù because Obamacare would lead to ‚Äú bureaucrats telling me what kind of services I am going to qualify for. ‚Äù The Washington Post 's fact-checker took it apart . Yet another features a woman who laments that her plan was canceled , but omits the rest of the story .
In response , AFP shifted course and decided to strike an emotional chord against Obamacare without claiming people were worse off as a result of it . That tactic was employed in its latest ad , which features a woman speaking to the camera .
‚Äú People do n't like political ads . I do n't like them either . But health care is n't about politics , ‚Äù the woman says . ‚Äú It 's about people . And millions of people have lost their health insurance , millions of people ca n't see their own doctors , and millions are paying more and getting less . ‚Äù
It turns out even that ad was a swing and a miss . PolitiFact looked into the claim that people were ‚Äú paying more and getting less ‚Äù under Obamacare . Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation reveals that insurance premiums have increased at a slower rate since Obamacare passed than was the case before it became law .
The ‚Äú getting less ‚Äù claim is even more curious because Obamacare imposes minimum standards for insurance policies and beefs up regulations to guarantee coverage for people with preexisting conditions , cap annual out-of-pocket costs and prevent people from being thrown off their plan .
‚Äú At worst , they 're paying more to get more , though in many cases they 're actually paying less , ‚Äù PolitiFact concluded . ‚Äú We rate this claim False . ‚Äù
No , a different rabid anti-gay group . No , not that one either ... the Texas one ...
No , a different rabid anti-gay group . No , not that one either ... the Texas one ...
Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at an anti-gay marriage rally on Thursday hosted by Steven Hotze , a controversial doctor who has told women that birth control would make them unappealing to men and has warned that equality for gays would be a stepping stone to child molestation . Hotze , who runs an alternative medicine practice in suburban Houston and is suing the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act , organized the event through his political action committee , Conservative Republicans of Texas .
Hey look , it 's Ted Cruz Wow . There is no part of that paragraph that is n't appalling , and that includes `` Houston '' and `` Thursday . ''
The event 's head , a Dr. ( yes , Dr. ) Steven F. Hotze , is a longtime anti-gay activist big on the theory that gays propagate by recruiting children to be gay . He 's really , really anti-gay . It may not be possible to describe how fully anti-gay he is .
Hotze told a local newspaper reporter that he cased out restaurants before making reservations to make sure they did n't have any gay employees and became such a divisive figure in local politics that for a brief period the Harris County Republican Party cleaved in two .
So he 's so batshit insane that he `` cases out '' restaurants to make sure that gay people wo n't come in contact with his food , but in the current Texas political climate he 's no longer so `` divisive '' that the current crop of Republican Party bigwigs like Ted Cruz wo n't come polish his shoes . And Cruz is only one among many : the `` sponsor committee '' for the event is pretty much a list of every Republican politician in Texas
Oh , Texas Republican Party . If there 's a lower bound , please let us know . The suspense is killing us .

The folks at Moneysavingexpert.com were the first to notice this unexpected `` upgrade '' to the latest version of the Facebook app for iPhone . By default , Facebook has decided to turn on their autoplay feature . This means that any video you happen to stumble across in your newsfeed will automatically start playing , using up tons of data if you 're not on wi-fi . Luckily , there 's an easy fix .

Moneysavingexpert.com suggests that those who think they were tricked into using excessive data should contact their mobile provider and request a refund . Facebook declined to comment on why they turned on the feature knowing that it uses so much expensive data .
The UK website quoted Pat Waterton , manager at Langley Travel , who said she was unaware of the ban until her nephew , James , paid a ¬£125 ( Bt5,400 ) ‚Äú fine ‚Äù after being threatened with jail for having an e-cigarette in Bangkok ,
Travelweekly said advice on the UK Foreign Office website includes a paragraph stating : ‚Äú These items are likely to be confiscated and you could be fined or sent to prison for up to 10 years if convicted . ‚Äù
Waterton told the UK website : ‚Äú I got a message from my sister saying James had been arrested in Thailand because he had an e-cigarette . He managed to pay the policeman , who had told him he could go to jail . Ten years seem a long time to go to prison for smoking an e-cigarette . ‚Äù
A spokesman for the Tourism Authority of Thailand reiterated the UK government 's advice , warning tourists not to bring e-cigarettes into the country .
Waterton told Travelweekly : ‚Äú If I 'm selling [ travel to ] Thailand , I will definitely mention it now . All agents should . Thailand is very popular so we should make sure we are telling people about things that could ruin a holiday . ‚Äù
Other travel agents also told the UK website that they would advise customers of the Thai law . Aspen Travel sales consultant Yvonne Montgomery said : ‚Äú The last thing we want is our customers getting locked up . ‚Äù

Hello and welcome to the 230th installment of the SWD .
Military events/news are listed below by the governorates :
Idlib :
Hayat Tahrir al-Sham 's commander Abu Ali Dumar was assassinated on the road between Idlib and Maarrat Misrin . Unverified , unconfirmed statement from the Free Syrian Army 's Tajmae Nasrat al-Mazlu claimed responsibility for the assassination , saying they 've monitored Dumar for a long time . The statement also said that the group will continue to clean the northern area from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham .

Major Bassil al-Mawas ( Abu Arab ) was appointed as the deputy chief of staff for operations and Obida Khalaf ( Abu Islam ) was appointed as the deputy chief of staff for administrative affairs .
Hama :
It appears that yesterday 's reports about Syrian Arab Army capturing several localities from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in the eastern Hama were false . Hayat Tahrir al-Sham 's director of media relations , Imad Eddin Mujahid , denied any SAA ‚Äò s advances in the eastern Hama countryside and said that the fighting between the two is still ongoing . Mujahid also stated that the SAA is in control of Jub al-Abyad and the eastern farms of Abu Lfa , from where they launched failed attacks .
Syrian Arab Army-held part of Abu Lfa was hit by an SVBIED , driven by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham 's Abu Ali al-Jazrawi . According to the reports , several soldiers were killed and a tank and a BMP immobilized by the explosion .
On Abu Dali front , Hayat Tahrir al-Sham backed by Jaysh al-Izza recaptured Tall Syriatel from the Syrian Arab Army , which the latter briefly captured yesterday . HTS & allies reportedly seized a T-55 tank and captured two soldiers after heavy clashes for the locality .

Damascus :
Joint UN-Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid convoy entered besieged East Ghouta through Al-Wafideen crossing . Aid convoy consisting of 49 trucks was destined for Kafr Batna and Saqba , but was reportedly stopped due to disagreement on who will be distributing the aid . Leadership of Faylaq al-Rahman demanded the aid be distributed by ‚Äú The Revolutionary Leadership of Damascus and its Countryside ‚Äù , while the UN rejected such notion and insisted the aid be distributed by the local councils . The convoy was reportedly parked at the checkpoint for hours , while the two disputed sides negotiated . In the end , convoy was allowed to distribute aid to the besieged civilians .
Syrian Arab Army 's artillery targeted Mesraba , Harasta , Kafr Batna , and Saqba , wounding several civilians in the latter two localities .
Last night , sporadic clashes occurred between Faylaq al-Rahman and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in Kafr Batna , after both groups arrested fighters belonging to the rival group , the former committed the act first , to which the latter responded by arresting several figures of Faylaq al-Rahman mentioned yesterday .

In the popular imagination , live action role play looks like a bunch of under- and over-weight men hacking sloppily at each other with foam swords while sporting Middle Age streetwear . On occasion , this stereotype is accurate , but the scenarios played out in Role Models and Knights of Badassdom do n't do justice to LARPing 's many intricacies , specifically the porous wall that exists between reality and the scenarios LARPers construct .
LARPers build out their own analog alternative realities and apply distinct social norms to interactions within them . As virtual realities proliferate , LARPers are in a unique position to serve as guides for those crossing the borders of irreality . They know that area well . And , more specifically , they are intimately familiar with how sex and violence can blur boundaries between worlds .
LARPers have created a lexicon of terms to describe what they grapple with when they occupy more than one reality . A ‚Äú time bubble , ‚Äù for instance , encapsulates two characters when their interaction needs to be explored at a different speed than the action occurring around them . ‚Äú Physreps , ‚Äù short for physical representations , are used in play if an actual object ( or weapon ) ca n't be procured . ‚Äú Bleed ‚Äù describes the memories or leftover emotions that flow from LARPing reality into the real world . ‚Äú Bleed ‚Äù often affects players ' emotional well-being after they role-play a traumatic scenario in an alternate reality . Every LARPer has a story .
Do n't mess with this dude and he wo n't mess with you .
Mike and Mae Linh Fatum tell Inverse that one particular storyline demanded a lot of them . Because the event took place at New World Magischola , a four-day event set in a wizarding school , the LARPers were immersed in their fictional world for days . ‚Äú In one scene during the game , a character 's sickness got too bad and that character died in the middle of the game . All of these young characters were trying to save him. ‚Äù The LARPers , suddenly confronted with a surprise situation , attempted to solve the problem the way their characters would . The experience , Fatum says , became suddenly harrowing .
‚Äú This one guy who was playing an older healer , his whole purpose was to save people and yet , he could n't help the guy in front of him , ‚Äù Fatum remembers . ‚Äú It was this big emotional mess for everyone involved . Did everyone come out of that scene thinking it was a good thing ? Yes and no . ‚Äù
There was ‚Äú bleed ‚Äù and that means there was also full immersion , for better or worse . Fortunately , there is a cure for the melancholia LARPers take with them . Mae Linh Fatum describes a ritual used at New World Magischola that 's meant to center players in their real lives before and after an extended LARP . ‚Äú We leave behind objects that mean something to us as humans , and during the debrief [ session after a long LARP ] , we reconnect with the object to bring ourselves back in. ‚Äù The debriefing , of course , sounds a lot like the totems used between the dream state and reality in the 2010 's Inception .
Mae Linh says the debriefing process is important , and that it 's become ubiquitous in LARPing circles , because allowing oneself the time to process events in one reality before moving into the next can be disorienting . It 's a common concern among LARPers ; one , an anonymous woman , says , ‚Äú I do n't want anything from LARP to carry over into the real world and visa versa , for the sake of it can probably cause a huge headache. ‚Äù She went on to add , ‚Äú about 40 minutes after [ a LARP , once ] , I had to sit out for a small period of time to get my head back in the game and keep myself calm. ‚Äù Though not every LARP group uses totems , many require post-event letters ( PELs ) from players exiting LARP sessions . These letters , several LARPers tell Inverse , serve multiple purposes . They 're intended both to help players process their emotions and minimize ‚Äú bleed , ‚Äù and to make a collective record of what events transpired in-universe .
The two primary concepts LARPers cite when describing ‚Äú bleed ‚Äù include violence and physical intimacy . Each LARPer can negotiate for themselves how they want to address violence in their play , but the simulation of love and sex is another , trickier , subject . As Mike Fatum puts it , ‚Äú If another player is playing their villain too well , and getting in your face , you can say , ‚Äò Hey , break , let 's talk about what happens in this scene , but I ca n't role-play this particular thing . ' ‚Äù
Conversations around sex in-world are a little different for many players . An anonymous LARPer , when asked about role-playing sex or romance , says , ‚Äú Giving all other massages is a typical way to ‚Äò play sex ' in German LARP [ ing ] , and places where players can relax and get massages by professionals or semi-professionals tend to be brothels or bath-houses [ while ] in-game . ‚Äù

Since most LARPers are loosely scripted ahead of time , the subject of sex can be addressed by LARPing couples before anything in-world begins ‚Ä¶ usually . Sometimes , as the Fatums can attest to , plotlines undulate in unexpected ways , and organic ‚Äú attractions ‚Äù between two characters can emerge . For a couple like the Fatums , the possibility of alternate-reality flirtations merits a lot of discussion .
‚Äú We have n't figured the rules out yet , [ but before one LARP ] , we decided in advance that our characters would fall for each other . However , our characters did n't really have any interactions , so it was difficult to make that happen . My character definitely would have started a relationship with a character who was being played IRL by another married LARPer . [ ‚Ä¶ ] It 's a little weird. ‚Äù The Fatums , like all the other LARPers Inverse spoke to , value open communication before and after their play . Otherwise , the shifting realities they 're grappling with make boundaries too complex to assume anything .
Another female LARPer , who asked not to be identified , told Inverse that having conversations out-of-universe , before play begins , is paramount . ‚Äú Always ask permission before roleplaying that your character can become suddenly smitten , ‚Äù she said . ‚Äú It might make the role play a bit less organic , but it also allows you to discuss comfort parameters. ‚Äù This statement was in keeping with a trend : LARPers who play for longer periods of time more seriously are the people who value open , honest conversations the most .
But no amount of conversation can make the transition between worlds totally smooth .
LARPer George Porter says he notices the LARP-specific connotation linked to ‚Äú certain smells and sounds ‚Äù follows him from one reality into the next . ‚Äú Even now , ‚Äù Porter describes , ‚Äú the smell of one character 's leather jacket , which I spent a lot of time being pressed up against during fighting , still brings back evocative memories. ‚Äù Because LARPing engages players ' senses the way virtual reality currently ca n't , memories get tied up with senses in the same way memories of the real world do . The two types of memories intermingle , a form of self-deception that can not be avoided .
In a sense , marathon LARPers ‚Äî some sources told us they had role-played up to 18 hours without sleeping ‚Äî have already taken steps as a subculture to grapple with the difficulties many of us will experience , if virtual reality becomes as popular a form of entertainment as we 're told to expect .

Soccer is thriving in North America . As Canadian youth participation rates steadily rise , Major League Soccer continues to bring in legitimate stars from established soccer nations , bolstering respect for the game on a continent already enthralled with a long list of other sports .
Calgary is hoping to join that wave of success , as the city 's new semi-professional team , Calgary Foothills F.C. , continues to make progress on their path to joining the MLS .
The team is fresh off their first season in the Premier Development League , which feeds the third-tier United Soccer League . Since 2013 , the USL and MLS have partnered to allow the former to serve as developmental grounds for the latter , with various teams sending players down to the USL for further training .
While it 's only a small step forward for Foothills F.C. , the club 's Technical Director and head coach Tommy Wheeldon Jr. believes there is ample room for growth .
‚Äú I think the MLS could come here in the next 5 to 10 years , ‚Äù Wheeldon Jr. said in an interview with The Globe & Mail earlier this year . ‚Äú I always thought Calgary could host and handle a professional franchise . It just has to be done in a different way . ‚Äù
There is certainly a precedent for success when it comes to Canadian professional soccer . All three Canadian MLS teams ‚Äî the Vancouver Whitecaps , Montreal Impact and Toronto F.C . ‚Äî have been able to thrive in the 20-team league , making the playoffs and drawing over 20,000 fans per game .
Wheeldon Jr. hopes to draw increased support for the new Calgary team , allowing them to eventually make the jump to the USL , and perhaps MLS after that . Aiding the potential success of the Foothills franchise is the overall expansion trend taking hold of North American soccer . In the last three years , MLS added three franchises ‚Äî including Montreal 's club , which joined in 2012 ‚Äî and has four more teams slated to join in the next few years .
But Foothills F.C . 's goals are n't as farfetched as they would be for a new franchise trying to join other established leagues like the NHL or NBA . They do n't need to try to bring significant change to a league that has long existed as is . They simply need to gain enough support to get picked up in the rush of MLS ' upward momentum .
The new Calgary soccer club is making great strides in that regard . They 're already seeing their name align with national successes ‚Äî three Foothills alums joined the Canadian national men 's team for a friendly against Ghana in October . As well , 13-year-old phenom Joey Cowlishaw ‚Äî a product of Foothills F.C . 's development program ‚Äî signed a deal with English powerhouse Chelseas F.C . 's academy just last year .
Another of the team 's mainstays made a name for himself closer to home . Foothills F.C . 's Dominic Russo put forth an exceptional performance for the University of Calgary this season , finishing with the most goals in the Canada West division and the most points of any CIS men 's player .
While Foothills F.C . 's inaugural semi-professional season saw them go through some growing pains , resulting in a 3‚Äì2‚Äì7 record , the club is just proud to have their foot in the door and the opportunity to climb the PDL ladder .
If they can tap into the undeniable local interest in the sport and find a way to navigate a city that already has two successful sports franchises in the Calgary Flames and Stampeders , continued growth certainly seems attainable for the fledgling soccer team .
But young Americans also want government to guarantee health insurance and living wages ; plan to vote for Democrats in 2014 and 2016
A Reason-Rupe survey of 2,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 finds 66 percent of millennials believe government is inefficient and wasteful ‚Äî a substantial increase since 2009 , when just 42 percent of millennials said government was inefficient and wasteful .
Nearly two-thirds of millennials , 63 percent , think government regulators favor special interests , whereas just 18 percent feel regulators act in the public 's interest . Similarly , 58 percent of 18-to-29 year-olds are convinced government agencies abuse their powers , while merely 25 percent trust government agencies to do the right thing .
The Reason-Rupe report finds this skepticism of government has millennials favoring general reductions to government spending and regulations :
73 percent of millennials favor allowing private accounts for Social Security ; 51 percent favor private accounts even it means cutting Social Security benefits for current and future retirees because 53 percent of millennials say Social Security is unlikely to exist when they retire
64 percent of millennials say cutting government spending by 5 percent would help the economy
59 percent say cutting taxes would help the economy
57 percent prefer a smaller government providing fewer services with low taxes , while 41 percent prefer a larger government providing more services with high taxes
57 percent want a society where wealth is distributed according to achievement
55 percent say reducing regulations would help the economy
53 percent say reducing the size of government would help the economy
74 percent of millennials say government has a responsibility to guarantee every citizen has a place to sleep and enough to eat
However , millennials also support more government action and higher spending in a number of key areas :
71 percent favor raising the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour
69 percent say it is government 's responsibility to guarantee everyone access to health care and 51 percent have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act
68 percent say government should ensure everyone makes a living wage
66 percent say raising taxes on the wealthy would help the economy
63 percent say spending more on job training would help the economy
58 percent say the government should spend more on assistance to the poor even it means higher taxes
57 percent favor spending more money on infrastructure
54 percent favor a larger government that provides more services , when taxes are not mentioned
54 percent want government to guarantee everyone a college education
Sixty-two percent of millennials describe themselves as socially liberal , while 27 percent say they are socially conservative . The gap is much narrower on economic issues , with 49 percent of millennials identifying themselves as economic liberals and 36 percent labeling themselves as economic conservatives .
Millennials ' social liberalism is mixed with strong opposition to many nanny state regulations :
72 percent of millennials say large sugary sodas and drinks should be allowed to be sold
67 percent of millennials favor legalizing same-sex marriage
61 percent say abortion should be legal in all or most cases
61 percent say people should be able to buy foods containing trans fats
60 percent want to allow e-cigarette use in public places
59 percent say the government should allow online gambling
57 percent say marijuana should be legal , although just 22 percent say cocaine should be legal
52 percent say either the government should not set a legal drinking age or that the legal drinking age should be lower than 21
2014 and 2016 Elections
Of those registered to vote , 76 percent of millennials say they plan to vote in the 2014 midterm elections . Fifty-three percent of registered millennials tell Reason-Rupe they plan to vote for the Democratic congressional candidate in their district this November , while 29 percent intend to vote for the Republican . For Democrats that 's a sharp decline from the 64 percent of millennials who say they voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 .
Things look better for Democrats in 2016 , however . When asked to select their top choice for president in 2016 , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the top choice of 39 percent of registered millennial voters , followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( 8 percent ) , Vice President Joe Biden ( 6 percent ) and the top Republican , Rep. Paul Ryan ( 6 percent ) . Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee and Sen. Rand Paul were each the top choice of 5 percent of registered millennial voters .
A majority of millennials , 52 percent , identify themselves as independents when first asked . Just 16 percent self-identify as Republicans , while 32 percent say they 're Democrats . Including those leaning towards a party , 43 percent of millennials identify as Democrats , 35 percent as independents , and only 23 percent classify themselves as Republicans .
Millennials do n't identify with the political parties and do n't have much confidence in them . When asked who they trust most to handle a series of policy issues , young Americans say they trust ‚Äú neither ‚Äù party to handle 12 of 15 issues surveyed . Millennials do trust Democrats the most on gay marriage , the environment , and poverty , while only trusting Republicans the most on promoting entrepreneurship .

We have no problem with the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center housing unaccompanied minors who risked their lives to cross our southern border .
Some of these children are literally running for their lives from poverty and violence in their home country . Others are seeking family members already in this country .
And , yes , some may carry disease and have a criminal background . Sadly , the latter is true at almost every public high school in the country .
Regardless of these children 's individual situations , in America we have a legal system that allows them due process before they are deported and the capacity to care for them in the meantime .
This is , after all , America . They are , after all , children .
To quote Ken Shetter , the mayor of Burleson , Texas : `` If you have at any time said you live in the greatest state in the greatest nation in the world , but are now crouching in fear , because you think we do n't have the capacity to care for refugee children , then you did n't really believe what you said about us being the greatest state in the greatest nation in the world . ''
We believe America is the greatest nation in the world .
We are not afraid of these children and do not see them as a danger or as an undue burden on our nation 's vast resources .
If any of them are a danger , we remind readers that these immigrants are locked in the detention center and will not be attending public schools .
Because our local juvenile center had room to house these children , our localities sharing in the center 's operations were by all means right to help our overwhelmed border states and take them in .
The bigger threat to our country comes not from these kids but from people who demonize them , whether out of ignorance , bigotry or paranoia .
Our immigration system is broken and has been for years . We are long overdue for an intelligent , civil conversation that leads to real reform .
But none of that is possible , so long as we allow our political dialogue to be dominated by people who insist that this tragic influx of unaccompanied minors is part of President Obama 's `` grand plan to destroy the country . ''
These days , the shrill voices often drown out more thoughtful ones . At The News Leader , we get the phone calls and emails insisting that this country must throw these children ‚Äî some of them younger than 10 ‚Äî back across the border immediately .
Our local boards of supervisors and city council members certainly receive the same messages .
If you are of a cooler head and a warmer heart , we hope you will offset the anger and the scare tactics .
Speak out , as protesters on both sides did Saturday in Verona .
Because this is , after all , America . And they are , after all , children .

Tuesday on MSNBC 's ‚Äú Andrea Mitchell Reports , ‚Äù President Barack Obama 's national security adviser Susan Rice addressed reports she was responsible for the unmasking of names of Trump associates after the election during the transition period .
Rice said unmaking names in intelligence reports she received is standard procedure insisting , ‚Äú I leaked nothing to nobody , ‚Äù adding there is ‚Äú no equivalence ‚Äù between unmasking and leaking .
Rice said , ‚Äú The allegation is that somehow Obama Administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes . That is absolutely false . I was the national security advisor . My job is to protect the American people and the security of our country . That 's the same as the secretary of state , the secretary of defense , the CIA director , and every morning to enable us to do that , we receive , from the intelligence community , a compilation of intelligence reports that the intelligence community selected for us on a daily basis to give us the best information as to what is going on around the world . I received those reports as did each of the other officials , and there were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U.S. person was referred to . Name not provided , just U.S. person . And sometimes in that context , in order to understand the importance of the report , and assess it 's significance , it was necessary to find out , or request the information as to who the U.S. official was . ‚Äù
She continued , ‚Äú I leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would . Let me explain this . First , to talk about the contents of a classified report ‚Äî to talk about the individuals on the foreign side , who were the targets of the report itself , or any Americans that may have collected upon incidentally is to disclose classified information I 'm not going to do that . Those people putting these stories out are doing just that . I ca n't describe any particular report , and I have no idea what re reports ‚Äî I do n't know the time frame , the subject matter , and I do n't know who they think was collected upon . ‚Äù
She added , ‚Äú When the intelligence community would respond to a request to identify an American , that would come back only to the person requested it , brought back to them directly . To me , or to whoever might have requested it , on occasion , and this is important . It was not then typically broadly disseminated throughout the nation security community or the government . So the notion that some people are trying to suggest that by asking for the identity of an American person , that is the same as leaking it is completely false . There is no equivalence between so-called unmasking and leaking . ‚Äù

Mango Fruit Facts Page Information Availability by variety
The mango is native to southern Asia , especially Burma and eastern India . It spread early on to Malaya , eastern Asia and eastern Africa . Mangos were introduced to California ( Santa Barbara ) in 1880 .
The mango exists in two races , one from India and the other from the Philippines and Southeast Asia . The Indian race is intolerant of humidity , has flushes of bright red new growth that are subject to mildew , and bears monoembryonic fruit of high color and regular form . The Philippine race tolerates excess moisture , has pale green or red new growth and resists mildew . Its polyembryonic fruit is pale green and elongated kidney-shaped . Philippines types from Mexico have proven to be the hardiest mangos in California .
The mango must have warm , dry weather to set fruit . In southern California the best locations are in the foothills , away from immediate marine influence or in the warmest cove locations in the California Central Valley .
The fruits are 2 to 9 inches long and may be kidney shaped , ovate or ( rarely ) round . They range in size from 8 ounces to around 24 ounces . The leathery skin is waxy and smooth , and when ripe entirely pale green or yellow marked with red . The skin is not edible .
The flesh of a mango is peachlike and juicy with a hint of pineapple flavor . The flavor is pleasant and rich and high in sugars and acid . The mango is the apple ( or peach ) of the tropics , and one of the most commonly eaten fruits in tropical countries around the world . The fruit is grown commercially on a small scale in Florida . In California a large planting in the Coachella Valley has now reached production stage .
Nutrition and consumption : Mangoes are high in vitamin A , and contain beta carotene . The darker orange flesh has the most vitamin A , but without a doubt all mangoes have a lot of vitamins and minerals . Mangoes are a good source of vitamin C too !

With the holiday season in full swing , a new image from an assembly of telescopes has revealed an unusual cosmic ornament . Data from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA 's XMM-Newton have been combined to discover a young pulsar in the remains of a supernova located in the Small Magellanic Cloud , or SMC . This would be the first definite time a pulsar , a spinning , ultra-dense star , has been found in a supernova remnant in the SMC , a small satellite galaxy to the Milky Way .
In this composite image , X-rays from Chandra and XMM-Newton have been colored blue and optical data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile are colored red and green . The pulsar , known as SXP 1062 , is the bright white source located on the right-hand side of the image ( roll your mouse over the image above ) in the middle of the diffuse blue emission inside a red shell . The diffuse X-rays and optical shell are both evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the pulsar . The optical data also displays spectacular formations of gas and dust in a star-forming region on the left side of the image . A comparison of the Chandra image with optical images shows that the pulsar has a hot , massive companion .
Astronomers are interested in SXP 1062 because the Chandra and XMM-Newton data show that it is rotating unusually slowly ‚Äî about once every 18 minutes . ( In contrast , some pulsars are found to revolve multiple times per second , including most newly born pulsars . ) This relatively leisurely pace of SXP 1062 makes it one of the slowest rotating X-ray pulsars in the SMC .
Two different teams of scientists have estimated that the supernova remnant around SXP 1062 is between 10,000 and 40,000 years old , as it appears in the image . This means that the pulsar is very young , from an astronomical perspective , since it was presumably formed in the same explosion that produced the supernova remnant . Therefore , assuming that it was born with rapid spin , it is a mystery why SXP 1062 has been able to slow down by so much , so quickly . Work has already begun on theoretical models to understand the evolution of this unusual object .
Palestinian Authority security forces detained two men on Thursday suspected of involvement in a deadly shooting attack in which four Israelis were killed on Tuesday .
Scene of a deadly terror attack in the West Bank on August 31 , 2010 Tomer Appelbaum
The four victims were residents of the Beit Hagai settlement in the West Bank . They were traveling in a car on route 60 late Tuesday when assailants opened fire at them , killing all four .
Following the incident , Palestinian security forces in the West Bank carried out one of the largest arrest sweeps in history , bringing in over 300 suspects in efforts to locate the culprits .
The vehicle from which the attack was carried out was located on Wednesday , and the evidence had apparently led the authorities to the suspects apprehended on Wednesday .
The suspects are two Hamas-affiliated residents of Hebron .
On Wednesday , one day after the deadly shooting attack , assailants once again opened fire at an Israeli vehicle at Rimonim Junction , east of Ramallah . Two people were wounded in the attack .
The spate of shootings coincided with the launch of U.S.-backed direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in Washington . The Islamist Palestinian faction Hamas have come out vocally against the talks , claiming responsibility for the shooting attacks and warning of further attacks .

CLOSE NASA will conduct supersonic testing just off the Space Coast in August . Wochit

A NASA aircraft darting over the edge of the Space Coast at supersonic speeds in August is expected to create window-rattling sonic booms for aeronautical research , according to the agency .
Teams from NASA 's Armstrong Flight Research Center in California and Langley Research Center in Virginia are expected to converge on Kennedy Space Center to better understand how low-altitude atmospheric turbulence affects sonic booms .
Beginning August 21 , a NASA-operated F/A-18 Hornet will take off from KSC 's Shuttle Landing Facility and vault to an altitude of 32,000 feet just off the coast of Cape Canaveral before racing to Mach 1 , the speed of sound , to produce sonic booms .
A TG-14 motorized glider equipped with dozens of microphones will deploy to a lower altitude , cut its engines to reduce ambient noise , and record the sonic booms for review by researchers .
[ SpaceX 's pivot : Elon Musk downsizes some of his ambitious goals ]
[ Target , CASIS team up for sustainable cotton research on ISS ]
`` Our goal is to get data on 33 sonic booms , '' said Matt Kamlet , a public affairs officer with the Armstrong Flight Research Center , also noting that testing should end on August 31 depending on weather conditions . That likely means two to three flights per day .
While sonic booms generate immense amounts of energy , residents in the north part of Brevard County need not worry ‚Äì the shockwaves associated with breaking the sound barrier are n't dangerous .
`` We have carefully planned our flights so that there is little chance that people in larger communities such as Titusville to the west , or Cocoa Beach to the south , will be disturbed , '' said Ed Haering , SonicBAT 's principal investigator , in a news release . `` Residents might hear a distant sound similar to a rumble of thunder . If the actual winds at the time of our tests are much different from predicted , they might hear a boom sound like those heard when the space shuttle landed . ''
`` At the altitudes we are flying , sonic booms from aircraft have never been dangerous to people , animals or buildings , but they can be startling , '' he said .
The experiment , named Sonic Booms in Atmospheric Turbulence , or SonicBAT , will collect data for researchers to understand and develop future quiet supersonic aircraft , `` which will produce a soft thump in place of the louder sonic boom , '' NASA said .

[ Investigation : SpaceX fire at Port Canaveral caused by building maintenance ]
The first SonicBAT tests were conducted in dry climates , but the upcoming flights at KSC will collect data over the Space Coast 's more humid airspace .
`` We know that humidity can make sonic booms louder , so we need to test some place wetter , and Kennedy fits that bill , '' Haering said .
Sonic booms are aptly named ‚Äì the sound energy generated by aircraft crossing the speed-of-sound threshold is much like an explosion . Space Coast residents who have been around for returning space shuttles , or more recently , landings of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stages at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , are familiar with the experience .
The Federal Aviation Administration currently prohibits supersonic flight over land , but the research could help change that if crossing the threshold becomes a quieter experience . If so , supersonic flight over the United States could some day make its way to the commercial sector .

PoliZette Trump : ‚Äò It Is Time to Drain the Swamp in Washington ' GOP nominee unveils ethics reform plan , says corruption will face 'the righteous verdict of the American voter '
Donald Trump unveiled a detailed ethics reform plan to help ‚Äú drain the swamp in Washington , D.C. ‚Äù and redeem the corrupt political arena during a rally Monday evening in Green Bay , Wisconsin .
The GOP nominee took the stage at the KI Convention Center to discuss his plan to ‚Äú end government corruption ‚Äù and the ‚Äú economic stagnation ‚Äù the United States currently faces . Trump used the rally , which at times turned raucous as a smattering of protesters caused continual disruptions , to hammer Hillary Clinton , the media , and the political Establishment .
‚Äú If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government , history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence . ‚Äù

‚Äú If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government , history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence , ‚Äù Trump told the rally attendees . ‚Äú We will not let that happen . It is time to drain the swamp in Washington , D.C . ‚Äù
Trump 's plan for ethics reform included five main tenets : reinstating the five-year ban on all executive branch officials who lobby the government after they leave service ; instituting a five-year lobbying ban for former members of Congress and their staff ; expanding the definition of a lobbyist to close loopholes ; issuing a lifetime ban for senior executive branch officials against lobbying for foreign governments ; and asking Congress to pass campaign finance reform that prevents foreign lobbyists from influencing American elections through fundraising .
‚Äú When Bill Clinton came into office , he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency , you ca n't lobby the government for five years after you leave , ‚Äù Trump said . ‚Äú But then , President Clinton did what the Clintons always do ‚Äî he rigged the system on his way out . Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash . ‚Äù
[ lz_third_party align=center includes=https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xGYKDqqOwG0 ]
The GOP nominee proceeded to bash Hillary Clinton and her political accomplices for their corruption , particularly capitalizing on the rapid-fire sequence of WikiLeaks dumps implicating Clinton and her staff in shady dealings .

Railing against the ‚Äú rigged election ‚Äù that seeks to ‚Äú poison the minds of the American voters , ‚Äù Trump called the media ‚Äú an extension of the Clinton campaign. ‚Äù Trump also pointed to a recent report from the Center for Public Integrity that showed that 96 percent of journalists who donated to political candidates this election season donated to Clinton .
‚Äú Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security , your family 's safety , and your country 's safety as though it meant nothing at all . This is magnitudes worse than Watergate . And we 're going to put an end to it on Nov. 8 , ‚Äù Trump said . ‚Äú That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again . ‚Äù
‚Äú On Nov. 8 , the arrogance of Washington , D.C. , will come face-to-face with the righteous verdict of the American voter , ‚Äù Trump continued . ‚Äú I 'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people ‚Äî not the donors ‚Ä¶ Once again , we are going to have a government of , by , and for the people . ‚Äù
A pagan priest in Maine has won the right to wear goat horns on his state identification card .
Phelan Moonsong , of Millinocket , Maine , persuaded the state 's bureau of motor vehicles that his goat horns should be treated in the same way as a Sikh 's turban or nun 's habit .
The horns have been part of Mr Moonsong 's life since 2009 when they were offered to members attending a pagan gathering .
Drilling a hole into the horns , he then attached them to his head using a fishing line and has refused to take them off apart from when he soaks them in patchouli and cedar hill to keep them in peak condition .
The first amendment of the United States constitution guarantees freedom of religion . However , officials in Maine initially refused his plea to update his licence photo .

The final seven episodes of Mad Men will begin to unspool on April 5 , and with them , Vulture 's annual tradition of decoding Vincent Kartheiser . We gleaned everything we could about Pete Campbell and the rest of the gang walking off into the sunset . Kartheiser was sporting a beard , and he brought up the Illuminati and the Alamo on his own .
Hi , I 'm with Vulture .
Vulture . I should be careful .
Why ? Is there a history ?
Because vultures pick dead flesh off bones .
Well ‚Ä¶ some times more than others . So ‚Ä¶
Turkey vulture ? What kind of vulture ? Go ahead .
I guess the New York kind . Like a smaller one .
Copy .
Like a pigeon .
Ooh . Yes .
I 'm sure you get the same questions over and over again . In terms of the series ending , what was the most emotional moment for you ? Wrapping ? Watching people peel off ?
It 's right now ‚Äî talking about it .
Is it ?
Yes .
Because you put it away and now it 's coming back up ?
Yeah .
I was reading that one of the producers said that every actor wanted a certain ending for their character , and not everyone got what they wanted .
Who said that ?
I think it was Scott Hornbacher ?
Oh , yeah . He did n't know . I did n't want any ending . No , I never had any wants for this character . I never had anything that I came down and said , ‚Äú I 'd really love to do this . ‚Äù
Really ?
Never . I trusted them . They had great ideas , so I figured whatever they 'd come up with would be better than what I 'd come up with .
Were you satisfied with the ending Pete got ?
Yes , I think the audience will be as well .
Interesting . I read that one of the producers had made a faux yearbook for you guys , and it had pictures and superlatives .
Yeah ‚Ä¶ yeah . It was really nice !
What was the superlative that you got ?
I do n't think I got any . Everyone else got a lot . I do n't think I got any , no .
So some people got more than one ?
Yes , some people got a few . [ Pause . ] I think ! Some people ‚Ä¶ yes , definitely , some people got a few .
I think Slattery said he got the biggest flirt .
Oh , yeah ! I could see that . He can be flirty . He certainly was the belle of the ball . The ladies love him .
Sure , going back to Sex and the City .
Oh , going back to his charming wit . They 're texting each other . [ He 's talking about his management and the AMC rep sitting in the room with us , watching . ]
When this is all over , what question are you going to be happiest not to have to answer anymore ?
Oh , um . I do n't know . I never thought of that . You know , we only do this once or twice a year ; it 's not so bad . It 's not something that I really dislike , answering questions . But you know , I 'm glad there are a lot of questions . Shoot , I 've done projects where no one has any questions . So the fact that there are a bunch of journalists that want to ask things , even if it 's repetitive , it 's cool . It 's great to be part of something that garners interest .
Have you paid any attention to the conspiracy theories out there ?
We 're aware . We 're aware of them . But no , we do n't , we know the truth , so ‚Ä¶ [ laughing ] it 's like if the Illuminati was watching videos on the Illuminati . It just would n't make sense .
I 've read before that you wish people would n't mistake you for Pete in real life . Does that still happen ?
I do n't think so . I do n't think that happens anymore . I think that just happened the day that I was doing that interview . Maybe that just happened that one time . Because that does n't usually happen .
When you do a show like this , over something that is ‚Äú period ‚Äù because it was so realistic , was there anything that was super shocking about that time period , about that lifestyle ?
Oh , everything was shocking . What was most shocking is how we all kind of got used to it at a certain point . I mean , every season you kind of have to get back into it . Then , by the end of the season , you 'd be like , ‚Äú Oh , yeah , this is the way things were. ‚Äù But it is shocking . And it 's shocking that it was so recent ago . That was n't that long ago . Fifty years ago , 60 years ago . It 's kind of crazy , huh ?
Well , now it 's like ‚Ä¶ The Americans is shocking . It 's funny that that 's period ‚Äî the '80s .
Oh , wow . I have n't seen it . What 's it about ?
You have n't seen it ? It 's on FX , it 's based on real events : Russian spies who live among us as Americans .
Oh , fun !
And on this show , they happen to live next door to the FBI 's counterintelligence guy , who is investigating the illegals .
That 's a clever story .
Yeah . It 's very well-written if you have time . Do you watch much TV ?
Oh , sure . I like television .
Do you have any favorite shows ?
Sure . I like House of Cards . And , uh , what else have we been watching recently ? Game of Thrones , when it comes back . Silicon Valley .
So can we talk about the work you 've done since you wrapped Mad Men ‚Äî you were Off Broadway , the movie [ The Blunderer with Jessica Biel and Patrick Wilson ] ‚Ä¶ was it different ?
Oh , sure , it 's different . Well , the movie I shot was actually in the '60s . It took place in 1962 . So some of the things were close , but a different kind of world . Um , and theater 's always much different from film . All my friends came to see it , all the people from the show , so it was fun .
Did Matt Weiner give notes ?
No . The play [ Billy & Ray ] was about Billy Wilder writing a movie , Double Indemnity with Raymond Chandler , and it all took place in his office . Writing , how to write , basically coming up with the ideas for the movie , and writing scenes for the movie , so Matt came up to me afterwards and said , ‚Äú This is just want I need to see . I want to get back to work now. ‚Äù So it was in his ballpark , and I think it sang to him for that reason .
Was it ‚Ä¶ everything people say about the theater versus television ‚Ä¶
Well , I was raised on the stage , and I had done a play every year for the past three or four years . So , yes , it is more nervous and all those things , but you know , that 's part of the thrill of it . Facing that fear , you know ?
And you still do n't have a car ?
Season one I did . I got rid of my car . It flooded and then I went without a car for four and a half years .
And do you have a car now ?
I do have a car .
It changes the way you experience the city [ Los Angeles ] .
It does . It changes the way you experience life . But ‚Ä¶ I miss it sometimes . And sometimes I still take the bus .
You know , I was reading a lot of clips about people who said their agent told them not to do Mad Men ‚Ä¶
Interesting .
Do you still have the same team as when you started the show ?
I do n't . I have some changes , but they all thought I should do it . Oh , yeah , yeah . We thought it was great , and I did n't have other opportunities anyway , so . I do n't know who said they should n't do it , but ‚Ä¶
Christina 's agents said she should n't , so she said she dropped them .
Oh , cool . I think most of us , I 'll speak for myself , you know , when the phone rings , my process is generally to pick it up and say , ‚Äú Yes. ‚Äù So that 's how I work . I like to work , and this was work , so I took it .
Do you still feel that way now ?
Oh , absolutely .
What do you think the show says about good versus bad people ?
I do n't know . I 'm glad that we have a show where there 's a lot of grey area for everyone to play in . I think the audience chose who the good guys were and the bad guys were for themselves . Everybody had their own ‚Ä¶ we did n't do it for them . We allowed each individual out there to have their own opinion about it , and we just gave them , or at least the writers gave them , the most truthful version of each person that they could . And the person that nobody sees , even in that world . We gave them the behind-the-scenes look at each character , and they chose to individually despise or adore us . I think it says a lot about each individual who watches and says , ‚Äú I really like Roger Sterling. ‚Äù Or , ‚Äú I 'm a Peggy girl , ‚Äù or , ‚Äú Joan 's the one for me. ‚Äù Or , ‚Äú I despise Don Draper. ‚Äù You know ? It 's saying a lot about who we are and what we value and who we think we are .
Did you like playing Pete ?
Oh , yeah . Pete was great . Pete was fun . I mean , the dialogue that they wrote was amazing . For all of us . All of us had amazing dialogue ! And really unique voices , and it was on the page . It was right there . And that 's really not the case with most things . Most things you 're doing a lot of , ‚Äú Okay , how do I create something here ? ‚Äù and build it , and , ‚Äú How do I make this unique from all the other characters ? ‚Äù And with Mad Men , every character is right there . It 's just so plain to see it .
If not Pete , if you could 've played anyone else ?
Chauncey the dog . I would 've been good at that .
Is the beard ‚Ä¶
It 's just laziness .
So it 's not part of the show ?
Well ‚Ä¶ maybe . But right now it 's just laziness .
Thank you .
Remember the Alamo .
Roastom constructed the Kudankulam nuclear power plant , which is now being operated by NPCIL .
The Russian company is ready to offer technical support and finance .
Russia hopes that a new site for a nuclear power plant in India will be chosen in the near future , Evgeny Pakermanov , President of Rusatom Overseas ( a unit of Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom ) , told RIR on Feb. 6 . Contracts for the new units will be signed soon , he added .
‚Äú In order to build on the successful cooperation achieved at the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project ( KNPP ) , our countries plan to build at least six power units at the new site in India in accordance with intergovernmental agreements ‚Äù , Pakermanov told RIR .
He added that Rosatom was ready to offer technical assistance and special credit terms for the project .
‚Äú Rosatom is ready for various formats of project implementation , ‚Äù Pakermanov said . ‚Äú We have signed an action program for providing gradual localization of production facilities for our nuclear power projects in India . ‚Äù
Last week Indian Minister of State for Atomic Energy Jitendra Singh told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply that India was ‚Äú exploring the possibility of identifying a suitable coastal site in Andhra Pradesh for locating nuclear power plants with Russian cooperation . ‚Äù
He added that the Andhra Pradesh government had given its consent to carry out technical studies required to identify potential coastal sites for locating nuclear power plants in the state .
Singh told the parliament that the Government of India was instituting an extensive public outreach programme near Kavali ( including public hearings and consultations ) to spread awareness about nuclear power and all its related aspects based on a multipronged approach .
Rosatom constructed the KNPP , which is now being operated by The Nuclear Power Corporation of India ( NPCIL ) .
The second unit at Kudankulam has already reached 100 percent capacity ( 1000 megawatts ) .
In December 2014 , Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed the ‚Äò Strategic Vision ' document , which envisages the construction of at least 12 more Russian-designed nuclear power units in India .

Our team at Bugsnag thinks about error monitoring every day . We even use Bugsnag to monitor Bugsnag ‚Äî everything from our Rails API to our React Dashboard . Since we 're constantly working to make error monitoring easier and more powerful for engineering teams , we 're surprised when we meet some who are n't actively monitoring their JavaScript applications .
Even with tests , the broad range of browsers and versions means your users are likely running into bugs you could easily fix for them . What we hear though is that monitoring JavaScript seems like the wild west where anything goes , and so it 's easier to avoid the noise . But without it , you wo n't know about the errors your users encounter , or be able to fix them to improve their experience with your product .
The good news is you can get started monitoring errors in your JavaScript applications with a few best practices in mind . We sat down with Emily Nakashima from our team to get some insights and tips for getting setup with the best possible JavaScript error monitoring . Her six suggestions will have you up and running with reliable frontend error monitoring so you can take a proactive approach to code quality .
1 . Domain whitelisting
Domain whitelisting is a powerful way to eliminate many of the noisy JavaScript errors you do n't care about . Bugsnag allows you to whitelist your domain so you can automatically ignore errors that happen on other domains , even if they 're using your API key . This way you can focus solely on the errors you know are coming from your JavaScript code .
As an example , if you load some debugging scripts or third-party scripts from another domain , whitelisting lets you automatically ignore errors from those scripts . It also saves you trouble in the case where someone copy-pastes all your JavaScript onto another website or a local file and starts doing weird stuff with it that throws errors , which is actually oddly common for large sites .
2 . Strip out exceptions from browser extensions
Browser extensions can be a challenge for implementing good frontend monitoring . Beyond the multitude of browsers to choose from , each is also unique because of the great variety of browser extensions your users can install . It 's likely that some will cause your JavaScript to crash , creating noise you 'll want to ignore . Since these crashes will mostly be unrelated to your code , stripping them out is a good strategy for configuring your frontend error monitoring .
In Bugsnag , we automatically ignore errors with browser extension files in the stack trace , so there 's zero configuration needed to deal with browser extensions in most cases .
3 . Ignore old browsers
Older versions of browsers are much harder to deal with since they 're more prone to crashing , and many do n't even give you stacktraces with error reports . Since fewer users still run these older versions they may be less important to support . By silencing notifications about crashes in older versions of browsers , you can focus on fixing the errors that impact the majority of your users .
4 . Use sourcemaps
One of the most powerful tools you can use to debug in JavaScript , and any language for that matter , is to see the line of code that crashed . If you minify your JavaScript code , you 'll need to setup sourcemaps to make this work , but it 'll be worth your time in terms of the effort and hassle you 'll avoid down the line . Sourcemaps will map your minified code to your actual lines of code , so that Bugsnag can show you your code in the stacktrace .
5 . Correlate errors to user or IP address
Because JavaScript monitoring can be noisy , looking at raw error counts alone can make it difficult to understand what 's happening . A serious spike in errors could be caused by only one user , in which case it is n't as serious as you thought . But you could waste a lot of time investigating along the way , only to discover it is n't something worth spending your time fixing . If you correlate errors to users or IP address , you 'll be able to map errors to the number of users affected .
You can sort errors by event and user counts in Bugsnag which is really helpful for understanding the overall impact of an error . You can even save these filter settings as a default to see user counts automatically every time you look at your Dashboard .
6 . Assign version numbers to your JS to track with each error
People can keep a single browser window open for days without refreshing it , and so there 's no guarantee that your current deployment includes the code that caused the error . In Bugsnag , we allow you to easily track JavaScript deployments . Assigning your JavaScript a unique version number lets you know whether you truly fixed a bug with the latest deploy ( and you 're just seeing a final few errors trickling in from older versions of your JS ) , or if you 're still seeing the same bug hanging around in your new code .
These six steps from Emily should help get your JavaScript error monitoring production-ready . There 's no reason it ca n't be as informative and actionable as your backend monitoring ‚Äî it just takes a little more configuration to get there .

Journalist Joy Reid placed a Donald Trump supporter in her cross hairs when he claimed underprivileged Americans are unproductive .
The back-and-forth occurred on Twitter Sunday , Feb. 19 when the MSNBC correspondent discussed what Jesus meant when he called for society to be compassionate .
Jesus talks about the poor ( and sick , widow & orphan ) as a collective , not as individual characters . Why address their helpers differently ? ‚Äî Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) February 19 , 2017
One user responded to Reid by blaming conservatives for the idea that Jesus called out non-white , unwealthy individuals rather than society as a whole .
@ JoyAnnReid the conservative coopted Jesus is an angry vengeful gun toter itching to attack difference and the poor because they are lazy . ‚Äî MMcConnell ( @ mattlogical ) February 19 , 2017
The reply led a Trump backer named Sam to say Jesus urged individuals to work hard for their earnings .
@ mattlogical @ JoyAnnReid the biblical Jesus did teach a man should work for his keep and not to be idle ‚Äî Sam ( @ marino2duper ) February 19 , 2017
Reid questioned Sam 's thought process ‚Ä¶
And who among the poor are idle ? They stand on their feet all day , picking your food , cleaning our hotels , shoveling our crap . Get real . https : //t.co/y5Ut1wbiPb ‚Äî Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) February 19 , 2017
‚Ä¶ and he retorted with a welfare queen excuse , which is a myth stating Black women defraud the government to gain income .
@ JoyAnnReid I have no problem with those poor it 's the ones that have 5 kids from different dads and Welch off govt ‚Äî Sam ( @ marino2duper ) February 19 , 2017
Reid pointed out Trump 's so-called welfare queen-like behaviors , showing that he fits the stereotype of a financially unstable parent with several children .
Your president has kids from three different moms , took five bankruptcies and has n't paid taxes in approximately 19 years . Thoughts ? https : //t.co/O9pDCWMA1h ‚Äî Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) February 19 , 2017
The tweet set off a chain of replies discussing Trump 's money woes and the negative way he treated employees .
@ JoyAnnReid @ SalMasekela And how many people has he cheated ? Look at all the lawsuits filed against him for that . ‚Äî KarenLMcHalePhoto ( @ KarenLMcHale ) February 20 , 2017
@ KarenLMcHale @ JoyAnnReid @ SalMasekela just paid out $ 26 million for defrauding American citizens via Trump University ‚Äî Tony Laughlin ( @ efi2nr ) February 20 , 2017
@ JoyAnnReid @ marino2duper AND many who worked for dT ‚Äì needing jobs to feed families were never paid . Hence hundreds of lawsuits . ‚Äî Wendy ( @ perfectrose2011 ) February 19 , 2017
One responder referred to the thousands of lawsuits Trump faced during his campaign , likely referring to a USA Today report in June about the 3,500 legal actions taken by and against the now-president .
BEAVER ( KDKA ) ‚Äî People at a WesBanco in Beaver were given quite a scare Thursday .
It happened around 10:30 at the business on Corporation Street .
According to the Beaver County Times , a woman called police when she found an eight-foot snake snuggling up to her SUV in the parking lot .
‚Äú I 'm deathly afraid of snakes , ‚Äù said Patricia Russell of Pulaski Township .
Luckily , officers were able to wrap up the situation quickly .

‚Äú It had to be someone 's pet , ‚Äù said Jeff Wijnen-Riems , a Beaver police officer . ‚Äú I grabbed it with a noose . ‚Äù
The snake was taken to Aquatic Gardens in Beaver Falls . Pet shop owner Rick Glitsch said the carpet python is harmless to humans , but may not survive because it appeared to be run over by a lawn mower .
Glitsch said he would attempt to nurse the creature back to health .
Donald Trump , ‚Äú President of the United States . ‚Äù
President Trump brought the United States and North Korea to the precipice of war by warning that any further threats would be met with a nuclear attack . ( ‚Äú North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States . They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. ‚Äù ) North Korea proceeded to test this warning by immediately issuing a new threat , to attack Guam . This forced the United States into the unenviable position of either instigating a massive war with horrific casualties or surrendering its credibility . The administration has wisely chosen Option B .
‚Äú Do n't read too much into it , ‚Äù sources tell Politico 's Josh Dawsey . The New York Times has much more detail . Trump improvised his threat without advance consultation with his advisers , none of whom support it . The paper he was holding when he made the statement was about the opioid crisis . Trump ‚Äú was in a bellicose mood ‚Äù when he made the statement , due to a Washington Post report that morning about North Korea having miniaturized a nuclear warhead .
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have issued more normal-sounding statements intended to supersede the president 's improvised one . ( Mattis 's statement redraws the red line , threatening reprisal in return for North Korean actions , rather than threats . ) The message of this cleanup is that Trump 's statements do not necessarily represent the position of the U.S. government ‚Äì a reality most American political elites in both parties already recognize , but which needs to be made clear to other countries that are unaccustomed to treating their head of state like a random Twitter troll .
It is humiliating for the world 's greatest superpower to disregard its president as a weird old man who wanders in front of microphones spouting off unpredictably and without consequence . But at this point , respect for Trump 's capabilities is a horse that 's already fled the barn . New chief of staff John Kelly has supposedly instilled military-style order and message discipline into the administration , but Trump is unteachable . Minimizing the havoc means getting everybody to pretend Trump is n't really president .
I was up at 8 a.m. this morning ( a fact I will address with my two year old later ) , and saw people on Twitter discussing something about a ‚Äú New Constitution. ‚Äù My search led me to Donna Brazile tweeting out a link from Salon entitled ‚Äú We need a new constitution : Here 's how we save American democracy from charlatans , loudmouths and the 1 percent. ‚Äù As an aside , while I was on her page , I noticed she also retweeted something by known Twitter troll and genuinely awful sharer of thoughts , LOLGOP , and account whose profile picture is of an elephant performing a sexual act on itself .
All that aside , I found it interesting that the beginning of the Salon piece is actually not wholly incorrect . People are tired of Congress and tired of the same old politics-as-usual shenanigans that go on in Washington D.C. We here at RedState have expressed similar issues and have often come under criticism for speaking out ( loudly , I might add ) against our own party at times . Where the Salon piece goes off the rails , however ( aside from the ‚Äú Tea Party obstructionists ‚Äù comment in the third paragraph , which is to be expected when Salon writes about politics ) , is with the idea that we need a new Constitution to make things better .
The Constitution worked exceedingly well for a couple hundred years before now . It did n't change . It did n't become worse . Instead , what happened was the people in charge of upholding and maintaining the Constitution became drunk with power and craved to keep it , rather than protect the document that allows them to hold the jobs they have . Such is the nature of granting power to anyone . Even in anarchy , someone is in charge , and in anarchy , there is unbridled chaos . In a nation upheld by a Constitution , but run by people bought and paid for rather than outright elected , the chaos is more controlled . Our system is being corrupted .
The idea that we need a new Constitution is not a new idea . Democrats have been trying to dismantle it piece-by-piece ( or , at the very least , trying to get new and unrelated definitions of the ‚Äú freedoms ‚Äù the document provides us ) for a very long time . However , it is an incorrect instinct based on the idea that it is the document that has failed us and that we need a newer , more restrictive document that does n't tell us what the government ca n't do ‚Äì it should tell us what the government can do .
Of the entire Salon piece , this is a line that is perhaps the best summary of the level of historical understanding within the liberal movement :
Nothing was so fundamental to the Revolutionary generation as character
If we are being historically honest , it should be
Nothing was so fundamental to the Revolutionary generation as the idea of freedom
because of the fact that that 's what the entire damn thing was about . Yes , men of good character were necessary for the Revolution to happen , and men of strong intellect and moral guidance were necessary for the construction of our fledgling nation , but the overall idea that people are the biggest part of what made us as a nation what we are is exactly what makes the Progressive Left 's arguments on government so laughable . ‚Äú If we could just have the right leaders running the show , everything would be fine. ‚Äù That 's what they think , whether it 's the U.S. or whether it was Soviet Russia or any communist nation in South America .
Salon is right to say that the system is broken , but it has reached the wrong conclusion . The system is not broken because it is a bad system . The system is broken because we have allowed leaders to break it while wielding unchecked power . It is time for us not to write a new Constitution , but find the right representatives to maintain and protect the system that was put in place and worked quite well until now .
We do n't need ‚Äú leaders. ‚Äù We need people who truly represent us , and that 's not a partisan statement . Both sides of the aisle feel powerless to stop what is happening , but we blame the other side without looking often enough at our own . The idea that power corrupts , and that power has corrupted the politicians , lobbyists , and elite of Washington D.C. , is something we all know to be true . And we have to address the people who have succumbed to that power , not the document that gives us the ability to get rid of them .
Roaming a bit outside Texas today to indulge the

I 've

police
snitches
, since most examples
Grits
has looked at involved drug cases . Even seamier relations , it seems , crop up in the sex trade .
Confidential informant relationships with police officers `` are what keep escort services in business , '' according to rogue Seattle sheriff 's deputy Dan Ring . That 's logical , but when you think about it , kind of gross . It gives officers all sorts of leverage that could
easily
be abused to extort sex . Plus in the end , the practice actually promotes crime . Ring would inform the hookers when they were about to be raided , and gave them advice on how to avoid detection or arrest . According to the
Seattle Post Intelligencer
:
The PI interviewed ... [ the ] operator of Executive Privileges and Roxanne 's Adult Entertainment , who said , `` He would do what I asked him to do . '' She added that it was a two-way street . She once gave him information on a cop suspected of raping one of her girls .
`` He made me his bitch . If a cop calls me and says , 'You 're going to do this and do that , ' what choice do you have in this business ? '' she asked . `` I heard him loud and clear . ''
Wallace added , `` He 'd let me know when there was a sting coming up , stuff like that . Whatever legal stuff we could circumvent . ''
She said Ring would call and tell her to `` go on vacation , '' their code for an upcoming sting . Ring warned her , she said , against hiring two escorts who had turned informants after a bust known as Garden of Eden . She said he told her `` not to touch 'em , '' that they were a `` train wreck . '' ...
She said Ring gave her advice aimed at keeping her out of jail and in business . She said he told her : Do n't advertise that women will travel out of state for appointments , because that 's a federal crime . Do n't use credit cards , which create a paper trail , and do n't use the word `` escorts '' in advertising because under state law that is synonymous with prostitute .
She said it was helpful when he checked the backgrounds of customers and potential employees , like the time he warned her away from a woman known to use drugs .
That 's pretty typical of how confidential informant relationships go bad . In theory , the informant is providing information for the government 's benefit . But too often , cops wind up essentially in the service of the crooks they 're investigating , actually promoting criminality instead of thwarting it . In this officer 's case , while providing plenty of tips and business advice to madams and titty-bar owners , he 'd not made a single case from his sex-industry investigations in at least five years !
Criminal charges against 26-year veteran have been dropped and Ring retired recently on a $ 3,500 per month pension .
EDITORS NOTE : Who in their right mind cares about catching prostitutes ? Why is consensual prostitution wrong ? It upsets me to know that my tax dollars are being spent on stings to arrest two consenting adults agreeing to have sex .

‚Äú The Orlando area is the most gay-friendly place in the entire world , ‚Äù ¬ù Celso Olaguibel , from Miami , yelled out while perched on the balcony of the train station overlooking a red-shirt-dominated Main Street at the Magic Kingdom .
On June 1 , the Magic Kingdom and its sister parks saw thousands of people sporting red and all shades and hues thereof in support of LGBT pride , and a large contingent of straight people and families donned red in unity . Orlando City Commissioner Patty Sheehan explained that while she walked around the park hand in hand with her girlfriend , ‚Äú straight families actually approached us and said they were disappointed they did not know to wear red. ‚Äù ¬ù
As society often does , we have changed as a people since the first gay days of 1991 , which saw protest and inspired an unsuccessful boycott of Walt Disney World . It seems the time has come for the LGBT community and Central Florida is right out in front .
See all Watermark ‚Äò s comprehensive 2013 Gay Days weekend coverage here !
That 's not to say that there were n't anti-gay forces at work during Gay Days weekend . The Florida Family Association once again ‚Äú warned ‚Äù families about Gay Day by advertising it on a banner pulled by a biplane near Walt Disney World . The simple banner declared : ‚Äú Warning : Gay Day at Disney 6/1 ‚Äù and cost the conservative group $ 16,400 , according to an invoice obtained by Watermark .
How else would a so-called Christian organization spend its money ? Feeding the homeless ? Clothing children ? Nah-expressing concern over a gathering of gay people at a theme park seemed the best use of resources for the organization .
The FFA is claiming victory in their ‚Äú Warning ‚Äù on its website .
But our eyes on the ground June 1 at the Magic Kingdom saw a large contingent of gay families , both gay and lesbian couples with children and a few single gay parents and supportive allies . The Garrell moms , Candy and Angela , from Arkansas , flew to Orlando for the weekend with their two children , Riley and Connor , to take advantage of Orlando 's openness and acceptance and to help the children understand their family was just like everyone else 's . Becoming somewhat emotional , Candy Garrell asked to speak off to the side and explained that ‚Äú this is the first time we have all been here as a family and we have felt so welcome and accepted that it 's incredible. ‚Äù ¬ù Their two children smiled wide and waved when asked how they liked Walt Disney World .
Josh Wright , 20 , from Scottsboro , Ala. , a rural town of under 15,000 people , was amazed at the sheer number of LGBT people in one place .
‚Äú This is the first time I 've ever seen this amount of gay people in one place and I can actually be myself , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú I feel like I belong. ‚Äù ¬ù
While his family in Alabama is accepting of his sexuality , Wright appreciated being released from the chains of a false public identity . Wright 's experience reflects the original intent in 1991 for Gay Day that has now progressed to allowing the same for visiting gay families and their children .
International flavor
Orlando , while being the top tourist destination in the country according to Forbes.com , saw an increase in international gay guests as well at this year 's event . Christian Smith , from London , explained that the area 's known attitude for open acceptance prompted his visit .
‚Äú It 's my first time here and I 'm definitely coming back , ‚Äù ¬ù Smith said , a statement that can only please area businesses as international travelers spend on average five times as much as their domestic counterparts , according to the U.S. Travel Association .
It was also no surprise to many of the park visitors that Orlando passed domestic spouse protections by a unanimous vote last year and has a planned rally for marriage equality in anticipation of the pending United States Supreme Court decisions .
While Gay Day has always seen a large contingent of LGBT individuals and couples , 2013 saw a large and growing appearance of our heterosexual counterparts coming out in support . Mike Czech , of Orlando , wore a red shirt saying
‚Äú Straight but not narrow , ‚Äù ¬ù and explained , ‚Äú We do n't care around here if you 're gay or straight , what difference does it make ? ‚Äù ¬ù
Czech 's friend , Kirk Endemann , said he attends every Gay Day because it 's his family reunion with the national and international LGBT visitors who flock to the area .
A fizzled Lesbian Express
The only bit of negative news from June 1 's Gay Day fizzled its way onto the tracks at the Lesbian Express , the yearly 1 p.m. tradition for the lesbian community to ride around the park aboard a Disney locomotive . For an unknown reason , the tradition has either died out or took the year off . Crystal Bard , Janine Rocca , and Samantha Linder , all of Sarasota , were among the 10 people to board the Lesbian Express , but the low numbers on the train did n't dampen their spirits .
‚Äú The reason we came over here was because this area is so free and accepting , and we 're having a great time , ‚Äù ¬ù Rocca said .
The same sentiment rippled from other Florida residents from Tallahassee to Miami , such as Jacksonville partners Kathy Korpics and Charlene Liberty .
‚Äú It 's way more open and accepting here than Jacksonville , ‚Äù Korpics said . ‚Äú And it 's a really fun place to be ! ‚Äù ¬ù
Annetta LaPointe , who moved to the area with her partner eight years ago from New England , said , ‚Äú Orlando is by far the most gay-friendly place we 've ever lived. ‚Äù ¬ù
Waves of success
While Gay Day is the focus of many families who come to Orlando in June , there is much more to the weekend . Gay Days has extended the tradition into several days , and other groups have also made the first weekend in June the place to be .
Larger-than-usual crowds attended the Saturday afternoon pool party at the Parliament House , and the evening pool party hosted by Chi Chi LaRue at the Gay Days host hotel . Despite the overwhelming attendance , virtually no one was actually in the pool .
The same thing could be said of the May 31 late-evening/post-Tidal Wave party at the Tidal Wave host hotel , but considering the majority of those attendees had spent the previous few hours in the slides and pools of Wet ‚Äò N ' Wild , it was understandable .
Speaking of Tidal Wave , the event 's new hotel , Holiday Inn , welcomed the men with open arms and it was announced it would be the host hotel of Tidal Wave 2014 .
Approximately 1,000 attended the actual Tidal Wave party at Wet ‚Äò N ' Wild Friday night and plans for next year reportedly include increased marketing on the West Coast ( of the U.S. ) .
Headliners
Former Go-Go 's Lead Singer Belinda Carlisle entertained the masses at the Parliament House early Sunday morning , June 2 , with some of her chart-topping hits . Carlisle revisited the 1980s with ‚Äú Our Lips Are Sealed , ‚Äù ‚Äú We Got the Beat ‚Äù and gold record ‚Äú Vacation ‚Äù from her days with the all-female band .
Comedienne Judy Tenuta burst onstage at the Doubletree by Hilton on the night of June 1 wearing a silver glitter , animal print pantsuit , white boa , red rose in her hair and carrying her signature accordion . She told One Million Moms ( another anti-gay protest group ) to ‚Äú Deal with it , bitches ! ‚Äù ¬ù and shrieked her way through an interactive show , pulling people on stage to dance and even marrying two gay men with a ‚Äú Certificate of Marriage in Judyism. ‚Äù ¬ù
Girl power
Hundreds of women donned green , yellow and red glow necklaces and packed Ember in Downtown Orlando for the annual ‚Äú Traffic Jam ‚Äù ¬ù party hosted by Phish Phest on May 30 . Named for the signal lights each woman wears ( green for available , yellow for proceed with caution and red for taken ) , the event was moved from Funky Monkey at Pointe Orlando in 2012 . The decision was a good one , said Phish Phest co-founder Sue-Bee Laginess , who estimates more than 600 people attended the event including ‚Äú LezBros , ‚Äù ¬ù the name given to the men who partied with them .
‚Äú This event was bigger and better than last year , ‚Äù ¬ù Laginess said . ‚Äú We were 100 % pleased. ‚Äù ¬ù
DJ Pat Pat headlined ‚Äú Boogie in Wonderland , ‚Äù ¬ù a party produced by Girls in Wonderland at the House of Blues on June 1 . VIPs sipped drinks at an open bar and watched a live auction that featured a $ 5,000 cruise . Beforehand , Fortune Feimster of Chelsea Lately had people laughing out loud during Laugh Out Loud , her 90-minute show in the ballroom of the Sheraton Lake Buena Visit Resort that night . The next morning , June 2 , women lined up for a bikini contest for the Pumps versus Pants Pool Party at the Sheraton .
A packed house
The Doubletree by Hilton once again served as the host hotel for GayDayS.com , with overflow guests staying at the Best Western across the street .
Many attending the Gay Days pool party at the Double Tree were impressed by the wrist bands that allowed guests to purchase drinks and food poolside without digging for cash or credit cards . The bands could be pre-loaded with funds and simply scanned when a purchase was made .
Record-setting year
Preliminary reports from Gay Days Inc. indicate that 2013 offered a growth spurt to the annual event . One press release reported a 6 % increase in the number of attendees at all venues in central Florida that hosted Gay Days events . The same release said an estimated 170,000 people participated in Gay Days activities , which is 10,000 more than the previous record .
Organizers are already making promises for next year . They 've promised to bring back an option that had sailed away : a GayDayS.com-hosted cruise ahead of Gay Days 2014 .

The phone line opened at 6 p.m. on Thursday for the first time in six months . At 5:58 , Ida Gordon of Nashville picked up her cordless phone and started dialing . Ms. Gordon , 63 , had qualified for TennCare until her grandson , who had been in her custody , graduated from high school last spring . Now she is uninsured , with crippling arthritis and a few recent trips to the emergency room haunting her .
‚Äú I do n't ask for that much , ‚Äù Ms. Gordon said as she got her first busy signal , hanging up and fruitlessly trying again , and then again . ‚Äú I just want some insurance . ‚Äù
Gov . Bill Haslam , a Republican , has indicated that he will decide this week whether to support an expansion of Medicaid to cover more low-income adults , as called for in the federal health care law . Doing so would add more than 180,000 people to the TennCare rolls by 2019 , according to the state , most of them adults like Ms. Gordon whose incomes are within 138 percent of the federal poverty level .
Ms. Gordon said she and her husband , who was injured on the job decades ago and is on Medicare , live mostly on his disability check of about $ 780 a month .
TennCare already provides health coverage to 1.2 million people , more than half of whom are children , at a combined state and federal cost of about $ 9 billion a year . Many in the Republican-controlled legislature , which includes a strong Tea Party element , opposes its expansion even though the federal government has promised to pay the full cost for the first three years and 90 percent after that .

When producer Christopher Nolan and director Zach Snyder set about to find the man who would be their Superman , they cast a wide net , reeling in `` Immortals '' actor Henry Cavill all the way from England .
Herbert Chavez , a 35-year old Filipino pageant trainer , has since 1995 undergone a whole host of surgeries to make him more closely resemble the Man of Steel . According to a RealSelf.com translation of a news report out of the Philippines , he has admitted to a nose job , chin augmentation -- for that iconic cleft , silicone lip injections and , of course , thigh implants .
The news report speculates that he has Body Dysmorphic Disorder , which makes him compulsively undergo plastic surgery . Whether or not that 's true , he is clearly obsessed with the man of steel ; a peek inside his home reveals a shrine to the hero , with everything from bedding to wall decorations to actual , larger than life statues of the hero taking up an entire room .

HRVATSKA pojaƒçava svoj advokatski tim koji ƒáe poku≈°ati da doka≈æe da je Srbija nad njom izvr≈°ila genocid , uprkos pomirljivim porukama iz Beograda . Srpski istoriƒçari ka≈æu da ovo nije prvi put da Zagreb dugotrajnim parniƒçenjem poku≈°ava da sakrije odgovornost za najsistematiƒçnije etniƒçko ƒçi≈°ƒáenje u 20. veku , u kome su Srbi potpuno izbrisani sa teritorija na kojima su vekovima ≈æiveli kao autohtono stanovni≈°tvo .
- Srbi jo≈° nisu svesni da su do≈æiveli genocid , jer su skrivali zloƒçine nad samima sobom zbog Jugoslavije . Moramo veƒá jednom da deidelogizujemo istoriju i prestanemo da predstavljamo stvari s pozicije komunistiƒçke jugoslovenske ideologije , koja je bila pobedniƒçka , ali posle Drugog svetskog rata . Inaƒçe ƒáemo ponoviti katastrofalnu gre≈°ku koja je uƒçinjena tada prikrivanjem zloƒçina genocida u NDH da bi se ponovo stvorila ‚Äû bratska zajednica ‚Äú - upozorava akademik prof. dr Vasilije Krestiƒá .
On podseƒáa da je prvi izve≈°taj o genocidu nad Srbima u Nezavisnoj Dr≈æavi Hrvatskoj saƒçinila Srpska pravoslavna crkva , prikupljajuƒái izjave od izbeglica koje su se od aprila 1941. kao reka slivale u Srbiju . Prognanici su svedoƒçili o naju≈æasnijim ubistvima , prekr≈°tavanjima u katoliƒçanstvo pod pretnjom smrƒáu , progonima i pljaƒçkama .
- Ta svedoƒçanstva su ne samo rasturana po raznim arhivima po nareƒëenju komunistiƒçke vlasti , veƒá su bacana u smeƒáe . Ja sam za Arhiv SANU kupio gomilu tih potresnih ispovesti od ljudi koji prekopavaju otpade - otkriva Krestiƒá .
KONTRAMEMORANDUM - Ima indicija da su dolazak Dr Sekuliƒáa u London spreƒçavale britanske obave≈°tajne slu≈æbe povezane s Vatikanom . Kao i da su neki nemaƒçki oficiri o memorandumu javili svojim poverljivim ljudima koji su bili naklonjeni Vatikanu . Ove indicije idu u prilog tvrdnji da su iz Vatikana naruƒçili kontramemorandum - smatra istoriƒçar dr Mihailo Stani≈°iƒá .
Sinod SPC je jezive podatke o stradanju Srba u NDH sa≈æeo u memorandum koji je veƒá u julu 1941. predao nemaƒçkom vojnom komandantu Srbije . Uprkos oƒçajniƒçkim molbama da se srpski civili za≈°tite , odziva nije bilo , iako su nemaƒçki obave≈°tajci potvrƒëivali zloƒçine .
- Usta≈°e su primorale desetine hiljada Srba da preƒëu u katoliƒçku veru . Onim pravoslavcima koji su se tome protivili masovno je prerezano grlo - ovo treba shvatiti doslovno - ili im je sva imovina oduzeta i onda su bez iƒçega proterani iz zemlje - napisao je dr Eugen Gerstenmajer 24. septembra 1941. u izve≈°taju nemaƒçkom ministru spoljnih poslova Ribentropu .
Ugledni beogradski lekar dr Milo≈° Sekuliƒá je zato 28. septembra 1941 , rizikujuƒái ≈æivot , u jugoslovensku ambasadu u Carigradu doneo svedoƒçanstva zloƒçina u NDH . Memorandum SPC je telegrafski prosleƒëen u London .
- U depe≈°ama iz Carigrada grozote pogroma u Hrvatskoj i Bosni prevazilaze sve ≈°to se mo≈æe zamisliti . Raƒçunaju broj ≈ærtava na 300.000 . Simoviƒá umesto u≈æasavanja primeƒáuje : ‚Äû Ko je brojao ? ‚Äú . Ali i da je triput manje , to je strahota . Krnjeviƒáu ( hrvatski ministar , prvi zamenik premijera ) se u diskusiji otela i odbrana hrvatskih vojnika - zabele≈æio je zgro≈æeni ministar Milan Grol .
Hrvatski ministri jednoglasno su tvrdili da su podaci o srpskim stradanjima netaƒçni i zlonamerni , a da bude jo≈° gore , pridru≈æuje im se i deo Srba u vladi . Na primer , dr Branko ƒåubriloviƒá zapisuje : ‚Äû ≈†to se vi≈°e studirao izve≈°taj SPC o pokoljima Srba , uviƒëalo se da u njemu ima pored taƒçnosti i izvesne zlonamerne tendencije ‚Äú . Oni tra≈æe da dr Sekuliƒá doƒëe u London i liƒçno svedoƒçi o stanju u zemlji .
- Danas je poznato da su srpski ministri koji su bili protiv memoranduma bili na vezi sa slu≈æbama Velike Britanije i SSSR . Njihova ideolo≈°ka ubeƒëenja bila su jaƒça i od zdravog razuma . Nisu ih menjali ni kada su stradali ƒçlanovi njihovih porodica - ka≈æe prof. dr Veljko ƒêuriƒá Mi≈°ina .
On nagla≈°ava da je istog trenutka kad je Memorandum SPC stigao u London zapoƒçela perfidna igra zata≈°kavanja i diskreditovanja podataka o genocidu nad Srbima .
- U tom ≈°pijunskom trileru uƒçestvuju i Britanci , Sovjeti i Nemci , u potpuno neoƒçekivanim ulogama . Postoje indicije da je ƒçasni oficir Vermahta pukovnik Fon Rajsvic dostavio predstavnicima SPC fotografije usta≈°kih zloƒçina , jer nije ≈æeleo da na Nemaƒçku padne ljaga za takve neƒçoveƒçnosti . Istovremeno , saveznici , Britanci i Sovjeti , savetuju kraljevskoj vladi da se o zloƒçinima nad Srbima ƒáuti jer ‚Äû Jugoslavija mora da opstane po svaku cenu ‚Äú - ka≈æe dr ƒêuriƒá .
Istoriƒçari podseƒáaju da je dr Sekuliƒá od Carigrada do Londona , zbog neuobiƒçajene sporosti britanske birokratije , putovao skoro mesec dana iako je imao status savezniƒçkog diplomatskog kurira sa va≈ænim dokumentima .
PAPA PIJE XII : PAVELIƒÜ DOBRONAMERAN Saveznici su znali istinu o genocidu nad Srbima , napominje akademik Dragoljub ≈Ωivojinoviƒá . - Amerika je bila neutralna sve do decembra 1941. i preko svojih konzularnih predstavni≈°tava i biznismena dobijala je podatke o zloƒçinima u Hrvatskoj . Ruzvelt je verovatno pod utiskom tih izve≈°taja jednom prilikom javno rekao da Jugoslavija ne treba da se obnavlja i da Srbija treba ponovo da bude samostalna . Meƒëutim , kasnije je promenio stav . Britanski otpravnik poslova u Vatikanu jednom prilikom upitao je papu Pija XII za≈°to ne osudi zloƒçine u NDH , a ovaj je odbio optu≈æbe protiv Paveliƒáa reƒçima da je on ‚Äû dobronameran ƒçovek ‚Äú - ka≈æe akademik ≈Ωivojinoviƒá .
Dok je dr Sekuliƒá ƒçekao britanske vize u Africi , hrvatski politiƒçari napisali su pamflet kao odgovor na memorandum SPC .
- Rudolf Biƒáaniƒá , ministar u kraljevskoj vladi , pripremio je kontramemorandum po nalogu Vatikana , otkrio je kasnije hrvatski ministar Ilija Jukiƒá . Biƒáaniƒá je poslao svoje tumaƒçenje srpskih podataka i Amerikancima . Za zverstva je okrivljivao Nemce , Italijane i usta≈°e i pravdao nezavisnu Hrvatsku kao izraz te≈ænji hrvatskog naroda potlaƒçenog pod ‚Äû batina≈°kim ‚Äú srpskim re≈æimom . Tvrdio je da je memorandum SPC iznesen iz Srbije uz pomoƒá Nemaca , koji ≈æele da izazovu razdor u izbegliƒçkoj vladi . Tu tezu su prihvatili i neki srpski politiƒçari , kao ministar Sava Kosanoviƒá , koji ka≈æe : ‚Äû Ovaj memorandum je jedan od najuspelijih akata Gebelsove propagande ‚Äú - navodi ƒêuriƒá .
Zahvaljujuƒái Arhivu SANU , ‚Äû Novosti ‚Äú su imale uvid u izve≈°taj o putovanju koji je napisao dr Sekuliƒá .
- Stigao sam u Bristol 1. novembra ujutro . Na moje veliko iznenaƒëenje nisam odveden predsedniku vlade veƒá u neku zgradu opkoljenu ≈æicom i ƒçuvanu od naoru≈æanih vojnika . Odveli su me kod jednog mladog gospodina koji je dobro govorio srpski . On mi je izjavio da je Englez i da je dugo ≈æiveo u Zagrebu i radio u engleskom konzulatu - zabele≈æio je dr Sekuliƒá .
Beogradski lekar uzaludno je protestovao zato ≈°to ga saslu≈°avaju i ≈°to mu je oduzeta diplomatska po≈°ta koju je nosio .
- Po≈°to sam prenoƒáio u toj zgradi , kojom prilikom mi nisu dali ni najosnovnije stvari , onaj isti ‚Äû Zagrepƒçanin ‚Äú pozvao me je i rekao da sama slobodan i da mogu da idem u Kingston haus gde se nalazi predsednik Kraljevske vlade - pi≈°e dr Sekuliƒá .
Srpski ministri u vladi bili su u≈æasnuti Sekuliƒáavim svedoƒçenjem , ali su ƒáutali jer je general Simoviƒá pretio da neƒáe dozvoliti da mu ‚Äû velikosrbi ‚Äú rasturaju Jugoslaviju . Krajem novembra na konferenciji za ≈°tampu Simoviƒá pred vi≈°e od 200 novinara zabranjuje dr Sekuliƒáu da govori o sadr≈æaju memoranduma tvrdeƒái da ‚Äû to mo≈æe da rasturi Jugoslaviju ‚Äú .
- Ipak , zahvaljujuƒái Mihailu Pupinu i Jovanu Duƒçiƒáu , podaci o masovnim ubistvima , progonima i nasilnom pokatoliƒçavanju iz Memoraduma SPC ugledali su svetlo dana u SAD , u listu ‚Äû Amerikanski Srbobran ‚Äú . Meƒëutim , odmah je usledio kontranapad od strane bana ≈†uba≈°iƒáa , hrvatske emigrantske ≈°tampe , ali i od srpskih leviƒçarskih listova . Njima je koordinirao Stevan Dedijer , visoki funkcioner Komunistiƒçke partije Amerike , brat Titovog biografa Vladimira Dedijera - obja≈°njava dr ƒêuriƒá .
On navodi da je originalni memorandum navodno nestao 1944 , kad su komunisti uzeli vlast u Beogradu .
- Dokumentacija koju su pravili Komesarijat za izbeglice Tome Maksimoviƒáa i Srpska pravoslavna crkva , gde je najva≈æniji posao obavljao akademik Radoslav Grujiƒá , posle rata je rasparƒçana u arhive Jugoslavije , Srbije , Udbe , Mar≈°alata , a ne≈°to je ostalo i u Sinodu , ali nikada nije publikovano . Grujiƒá i Maksimoviƒá , najzaslu≈æniji za spasavanje izbeglica i dokumentovanje zloƒçina , progla≈°ni su saradniciima neprijatelja i oduzeta su im sva graƒëanska prava - ka≈æe dr ƒêuriƒá .
Za razliku od njih , ljudi koji su se borili protiv memoranduma , Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá , Rudolf Biƒáaniƒá , Branko ƒåubriloviƒá , Savo Kosanoviƒá , Du≈°an Simoviƒá u Brozovoj Jugoslaviji ostaju uzorni graƒëani koji obavljaju znaƒçajne politiƒçke i akademske funkcije .
POP DRAGANIƒÜ PRIZNAO ZLOƒåINE
MASOVNE zloƒçine u NDH , koje su demantovali hrvatski ministri u kraljevskoj vladi u egzilu , potvrdio je viskopozicionirani katoliƒçki sve≈°tenik dr Krunoslav Draganoviƒá , organizator ‚Äû pacovskih kanala ‚Äú kojima je hiljade usta≈°kih i nacistiƒçkih zloƒçinaca pobeglo u ju≈ænu Ameriku .
During CNN 's coverage of the RNC on Thursday , Commentator Van Jones slammed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 's convention speech as a ‚Äú schizophrenic psychopathic attempt to pull apart the Obama coalition , ‚Äù like a moment ‚Äú where there 's some big authoritarian movement , and some leader that 's rising up , ‚Äù and ‚Äú a disgrace . ‚Äù
Jones began by praising Ivanka Trump 's speech before stating , ‚Äú But what Donald Trump did tonight is a disgrace . That was a relentlessly , even for Donald Trump , who at least occasionally breaks up the fear-mongering with some jokes , some asides , some amusement , he had one funny line in an hour and 15 minutes , and the rest of it was just a relentlessly dark speech . He was describing some Mad Max America . I work in some of the toughest neighborhoods in some of the toughest communities in this country , and I do n't know what he 's talking about when he describes the country he 's talking about . And there was some schizophrenic psychopathic attempt to pull apart the Obama coalition , but from a political point of view , he even botched that .

A school district in New Jersey is having its computer network held hostage for a 500 bitcoin ransom ( worth roughly $ 125,000 ) , according to the South Jersey Times .
The Swedesboro-Woolwich School District discovered on Saturday morning that communications , online resources , and documents created by staff members were made inaccessible . The district , which is home to almost 2,000 students , was even forced to cancel its computerized PARCC exam .
The local and state police , the FBI , Homeland Security , and the Gloucester County Prosecutor 's Office 's High Tech Crimes Unit are all looking into the matter .
‚Äú Certainly any breach of any public computer system , especially a school , is extremely serious and we 're doing everything we can to assist the school district and identify the person or persons responsible , ‚Äù said ‚ÄéGloucester County prosecutor Sean Dalton .
He said that although the prosecutor 's office has seen incidents of school districts being hacked before , this is the first time that it has been involved in a case involving ransomware .
The school district is receiving volunteer assistance from the Educational Information Resource Center ( EIRC ) to bring the network back online . It is attempting to restore files which have been encrypted by the ransomware infection .
However , it is unknown when exactly the school district 's computer network will be restored .
Superintendent Terry Van Zoeren said , ‚Äú There 's basically no tech service happening in Swedesboro-Woolwich right now . Essentially our network has been taken over and has been made non-operational . ‚Äù
‚Äú We are operating as if it 's about 1981 again , ‚Äù he added .
While it may be difficult to identify the individuals behind the attack , Van Zoeren reassured the press that they will be pursued to the ‚Äú greatest extent possible ‚Äù . The investigation is still underway so it is unclear what charges will be pressed .
This is not the first time the FBI has investigated a bitcoin extortion attempt . In June 2014 , the FBI busted a ‚Äú highly sophisticated ‚Äù botnet used to distribute Cryptolocker ransomware .
Geralt of Rivia has come a long way in eight years . Since his 2007 PC debut the professional monster slayer has returned from the dead , lost his memory , misplaced his beloved , witnessed the fall of a kingdom , been framed for regicide , and hunted a renegade member of his own order . He 's also found time to slay a great many beasts , bed almost as many women and to be presented as a gift by his home nation of Poland to the President of the United States of America . Such is the life of the legendary White Wolf .
Despite Geralt 's achievements to date there 's an undeniable feeling that it 's all been building to this . In a few short months , Geralt and his video game custodians at CD Projekt RED will face the biggest challenge of their respective careers when they present a rich , story-driven , open-world RPG to a global audience across PC , PS4 and Xbox One . The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt represents both the culmination of Geralt 's eight-year adventure and a huge standalone experience in its own right , weaving the tale of the Nilfgaardian invasion , Geralt 's search for his lost love , the mysterious white-haired Ciri and the titular Wild Hunt , an implacable force that wreaks havoc from atop spectral steeds and has designs on the White Wolf himself .
In preparation for the biggest day in the company 's history , CD Projekt RED threw open the first three hours of its world to us ; a world that will offer up to 40 times that duration to fully explore . As a seasoned Witcher 's apprentice I seized the opportunity to discover what 's new , what 's changed and to spend some quality time with its leading man , as I took a spoiler-free dive into the world of The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt .
A Savage Beauty
Given The Witcher 3 's appearance on both PS4 and Xbox One , not to mention its formidable PC system specs , it should come as no surprise to hear that The Witcher 3 is a beautiful game . An opening sequence set within the walls of the witcher 's stronghold of Kaer Morhen offers the chance for an optional tutorial and an opportunity to admire a stunning mountain view from numerous vantage points around the grounds .
However , it 's soon after , once the game begins proper with Geralt standing atop a hillside with the dawn at his back and his horse nickering nearby that its sheer aesthetic quality really slaps me in the face . The Witcher games have never shied away from depicting scenes of grand scope and detail but here it 's done with aptitude and aplomb that belies the studio 's lack of experience in making open-world games . Dense forests give way to verdant fields and in the distance a river shimmers in the early morning sun .
As Geralt engages in his first fight against snarling beasts , there 's a chance to experience the improved combat system in action , where the witcher is all fluid sword strokes and lethal grace as he dances from one foe to the next . Taking cues from the combat systems of both the previous games , The Witcher 3 employs a free-flowing system in which Geralt soft-locks on to the closest enemy but can switch at will to focus on those outside of his immediate strike zone . He can guard but with correct timing there 's also the opportunity to parry incoming attacks to throw an enemy off balance before launching an effective counterattack . Thus , fighting several foes at once is a more engaging and rewarding proposition than in The Witcher 2 , while the parry and riposte system that starts or continues a chain of attacks has its roots in the timing-based system of the original game and ensures things stay fast paced but deep enough to avoid hack and slash monotony .
Bolstering his weapon attacks , Geralt also has access to the witcher signs ‚Äì magical powers that can ensnare , burn , beguile or repel an enemy or be used as a temporary protective shield ‚Äì and a range of mutagenic potions , the ingredients for which can be gathered from the environment or bought from vendors . The overhauled skill trees see you unlocking abilities from three key disciplines : swordplay , alchemy and signs , with a fourth , smaller category reserved for general skills . These can be grouped together in four lots of three slots that become available as Geralt levels up and if three skills in any one group are of the same type , a bonus is conferred . There 's a slightly odd notion of having active and inactive skills but the focus here is on combining traits and abilities that complement one other and then swapping load-outs to suit a given situation .
I 'm on the hunt , I 'm after you
This focus on preparation for battle is part of CDPR 's drive to get closer to the roots of the Geralt from Andrzej Sapkowski 's novels , which feature a far greater emphasis on the hunting of monsters in the lead-up to their slaughter . As such , Geralt can employ his Witcher Senses to uncover tracks , spot clues and follow telltale signs to track down his prey . In the case of a griffon that 's terrorising a small village , that means studying it to determine its breed , sex and to understand its motivation for its unusual behaviour before using appropriate bait to lure it to a suitable location for a face-off .
It 's not just the weaknesses of beasts that can be discerned in this way , though , as a side quest unearthed along the road highlights . A merchant in apparent distress leads Geralt to investigate a crash site in a monster-infested swampland , where his keen perception turns up clues of foul play and present him with further options of how to resolve this interaction . CDPR has promised that these optional endeavours will be far from the standard fetch quests that we 're used to partaking in for a few miserly pieces of gold and XP . Many will have a decision point or a knock on effect that sends small ripples through to another part of the game . Certainly , of the several possible outcomes of my quest to recover a merchant 's goods it 's apparent that some courses of action will lead to a swift conclusion to the quest while others will open-up further possibilities down the line .
The notion of choice and consequence is one that the Witcher games have long championed . However , while the 2007 original allowed for a degree of neutrality , its 2011 sequel was far more black and white , forcing Geralt into political binds that the witcher had no business being roped into . Happily , The Witcher 3 offers a return of the notion that even when not making a decision you are still making a choice . A segment of game play concerning a family feud set several hours further into the game highlights how this can affect not only the story but also flavour the game play . Two very different segments play out ‚Äì one stealthier , the other more combat orientated ‚Äì depending on your action or inaction and the knock-on effects are both immediate and far reaching .
While you can bumble through dialogue and answer every dispute by taking a sword to that which displeases you , word of your deeds will carry far and wide . We 're used to the world revolving around us and our characters but here this effect makes narrative sense for Geralt is the embodiment of a living legend and most who meet him are keen to gossip , be it with him or behind his back . The local village inn is a fine example of this , serving as it does as a place to relax after some strenuous monster slaying but also a place to gather further work , overhear rumours of the mysterious white-haired Ciri ( the game 's second playable character ) , get into a fist fight with or indulge in a game of Gwent . This last is a card-based battle game that looks engaging enough to form the basis of its own standalone title . Clearly , there 's an awful lot going on and Geralt is often at its centre , with the decisions you take shaping his story and leading to any of the three dozen endings that CDPR has planned to reflect your own personal experience with the White Wolf .
The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt is , we 're told , feature complete and so the remaining few months of development time will be spent polishing everything to a fine sheen . This is welcome news , because there are a number of things that require that attention . Currently , horse riding feels skittish and imprecise , while screen tear and texture draw-in are particularly apparent on console . However , it 's precisely for such reasons that the difficult decision was taken to push back release , first from late 2014 to February this year and then again to May 19 . CDPR 's track record proves its willingness to work on releasing the best possible game that it can , as well as supporting its titles and its players with regular ( and free ) content updates .
It 's an ambitious undertaking that CDPR is attempting and Geralt has come far from his humble video game roots in the surprise cult hit of The Witcher to establish himself as one of gamings most recognisable icons and a bastion for dark , story-rich single-player RPGs . The long wait for his tale to be told in full will soon be at an end and we 'll finally be able to take up the mantle of the legend himself , Geralt of Rivia , the White Wolf , Witcher and professional monster slayer .

National Conference on Astrology and Palmistry concludes
‚Äú Nobody can destroy astrology which has a strong base , ‚Äù said Dr. Sri Shivananda Shivacharya Swamiji of Chikkapet Hiremutt , Tumkakuru .
He was speaking on the second and last day of the National Conference on Astrology and Palmistry organised jointly by Mayakara Gurukula and Karnataka Sanskrit University at Kalamandira here on Sunday .
The Swamiji said that he believed in astrology but not the future predictions . He added that astrology is a science but not the predictions . He pointed out that predictions were just speculations and advised astrologers to qualify themselves in that science and not through predictions .
On the lines of meteorological forecast , astrologers present a report based on movement of planets and positions of stars . The present should be loved and nurtured by everybody , suggested the Swamiji .
Former Minister S.A. Ramdas inaugurated the sessions on second day of Conference .
Speaking after receiving the felicitation , Suttur Shivarathreeshwara Panchanga writer K.G . Puttahonnaiah said that astrology has an ancient history of 21,000 years which should be preserved .
Three books Pranavam Panchaga , Jathaka Prathi mattu Jyothishya Pusthaka and Bhavath Bhavada Vismaya were released on the occasion .
Mayakara Gurukula founder Dr. Mugur Madhu Dikshit and senior astrologers participated in the conference .
`` I 'm sorry , I just got back from my Halloween party . How can I help you ? ''
Critical paths Every Saturday , Richard Cobbett digs into the story and writing of games - some old , some new ...
I never thought I 'd miss Sister Miriam , but it only took until my second rival made planetfall in Beyond Earth to start remembering her fondly . If you never played Alpha Centauri ... well , firstly , please rectify this situation at once ... she 's the faction leader everyone loved to hate , without the inherent awkwardness of classic Civilisation jokes about Gandhi getting the Bomb and so on . She heads up the religious faction in the game , the Believers , though that 's honestly not why she 's hated . It 's that she 's very strong in the early game , that her faction tends to be aggressive and problematic , that the only reason she 'll ever have your back is to stab it , and last but not least , because she has a really punchable face . Her scowl says it all ; eyes narrow , contemptuous , looking you in the eye only because she wants you to know the extent of her scorn .
How I wish Beyond Earth had half the personality of that one simple bitmap .
Wasted Halloween opportunity of the year - have Zombie Miriam make planetfall in BE
In a way , I feel bad about making the comparison , because Beyond Earth 's team has always been clear that they were making Civ In Space rather than Alpha Centauri 2 . It was also going to be nigh-impossible to recapture that lightning in a bottle without simply rehashing what came before . As is often the case , a modern game picking up where an older one left off does n't simply have to compete with the original , but potentially decades of carefully pruned and polished memories . In Alpha Centauri 's case for instance , it 's easy to forget that the dialogue was largely done in Mad Lib style - endless conversations along the lines of `` Greetings from the [ WHO HECK US ] , honored [ PERSON ] , I hope you are [ APPROPRIATE THING TO SAY ] ! '' Any memories of real diplomatic cut-and-thrust are entirely invented or very rose-tinted .
But damn , if it did n't do a great job at creating the illusion .
Alpha Centauri is hands down my favourite 4X game of all time , and it 's almost entirely down to its characters and story . The idea to split humanity on ideological rather than national boundaries was a great one , but it 's what happened next that marks AC 's true genius - the human faces put onto them to make them more than simply a philosophy , mixed with a game that made you feel you were seeing the expression of it . Regardless of the numbers and what specific tactics the AI was using , fighting the Hive felt different to fighting the Gaians ; the accumulated weight of the Morganite philosophies and their financial empire making allying with them a very different matter to , say , Chairman Yang , who would turtle up in his bases . It was a personal experience , helped by a thousand tiny little touches like the insults the faction leaders would sling at each other ( `` Lady Deidre dancing naked through the trees '' and so on ) that made it feel like they were engaged in the struggle instead of simply controlling their part , and the beautifully written slivers of philosophy that sat effortlessly next to words taken from some of the greatest minds in history .
`` Rude ? No , no ! Oh God , You 're Here Too is ... a compliment here ! Yes ! ''
Beyond Earth , its defenders say , goes to similar lengths . If you look in the Civpedia , you can find reams of background information on the difference between Franco-Iberia and Brazilia , information on the techs and wonders , where CEO Suzanne Fielding went to school , all of that . And that 's true , in much the same way that the plans for the bypass due to knock down Arthur Dent 's house were technically on display for him to see . The difference is that these never really feel part of the game . Even after several games , I do n't feel any innate sense of how the Slavic Federation rolls vs. the Pan-Asian Co-operative or whatever , nor that the developers even care that much beyond what was needed for balancing . By that , I 'm not calling laziness , but rather pointing to the fact that the sweep of the game is about everyone losing interest in all that stuff anyway in favour of the Harmony , Purity and Supremacy affinities that they all inevitably end up subscribing to .
A simpler way to put it is that Alpha Centauri has story , Beyond Earth has lore . The two are often confused , but serve very different purposes . Lore is background . Lore is additional information . All too often , lore is an excuse , seen in many a bullshit argument like `` But elves are nymphomaniac nudists in the lore ! '' Story is a core part of the experience , and in Alpha Centauri more than any other 4X game ever made . There 's the obvious stuff with the faction leaders and big text infodumps at regular intervals , but there 's also a lot of other important stuff going on that 's less front-of-house - not least the constant reinforcement of just how awful everything on the planet actually is . What starts as a mission of hope breaks up before it 's even really begun , and it 's not long after that that you 're nerve-stapling citizens and fighting wars where the losing immortal is thrown screaming into a pain booth . Alpha Centauri 's Planet is a terrible , terrible place where the best of intentions go to die .
But here 's the thing . It 's your terrible , terrible place . Chances are that at least initially you 'll take a faction that you feel comfortable with , that chimes at least somewhat with your moral compass or beliefs and set out to make Planet a better place ( This is admittedly much less the case in the gimmicker add-on Alien Crossfire ) . By the time you realise just how bad things really are , it 's too late . Dipping into the lore , it 's even worse than it may seem - at one point Lady Deidre of the Gaians manages to impress another faction by greeting them without her protective mask on , the mindworms cripple their victims with fear and give them one of the most horrible deaths this side of the Sarlaac pit , and the entire plot is rooted in extinction . But all of that is just trimming on a game that sells the effect with just what we see and what 's implied .
Aw , the University wants to wage war . Adorable .
The core difference between the two games though is that Beyond Earth is a game about humanity settling a new world , while Alpha Centauri was about humans doing so . That 's a bigger difference than it might initially seem , though one that shows itself again and again in execution details - in quests that honestly believe that a boost to production is the most important part of your choice , or in your first glimpse of your rival factions coming in the form of stock dialogue that sounds like it was written by a robot . `` I 'm sorry , but we have n't known one another for long enough for me to feel comfortable doing so . Perhaps we can revisit this subject in the future . '' Sigh . Boring !
This is all very Civilisation in style , of course . But in Civilisation , you do n't go in cold . There are expectations of the characters and nations , fair or otherwise , there 's ... well ... there 's history . In Beyond Earth , the artifice is gone . These people are simply statistics with a face , every stone left unturned to make them more . It comes from a design school that has stripped away personality with pretty much every sequel , from the first Civilisation where you got to see your cities and build a throne room , to the current one which is far more concerned with warfare and the numbers of production . Alpha Centauri meanwhile picked up where its creator Brian Reynolds left off with Colonisation , where the King was an active player and your direct relationship with home was a fundamental part of the experience - from initial settlement to finally declaring independence and having to hold the land that you 'd taken .
Of course , the real way to win the game was to lose . Traitor .
For me though , the wider scope does n't lead to a more interesting or even more freeform game . Technically , sure , you can argue it does . The Harmony/Supremacy/Purity split is a decent attempt at covering both philosophy and strategic considerations , and for the game , it makes sense . Clarity is important . On a narrative level though , I can never fight the feeling that I 'm less forging a path for my society as quietly signing it up to a space-cult . If your vision of the future does n't conform to one of them , complete with what goes with it , you 're left picking on either purely pragmatic reasons , killing the philosophy , or forced into the least personally objectionable . Alpha Centauri meanwhile only provided one real path ( multiple victories , yes , but that 's not the same thing ) , but a better illusion . It 's like dealing with a magician holding a pack of cards . You 're always going to get the Ace of Spades , or close enough . What matters is that you think you chose it .
What do you mean 'no map ' ? We 're from SPACE ! Was nobody looking out a window ?
I 'm certainly not saying Beyond Earth is a bad game here , just not what I was hoping for . It 's a solid strategy game about conquering a new world . It 's just not the story of the next big jump for humanity , not really , and while most of the other bits that people do n't like at the moment can be bulked up or patched with expansions it seems unlikely that any money or attention will go on that side of things , or into future revisions of the concept . It 's not that only Brian Reynolds could create something like Alpha Centauri , but that he increasingly feels like the only person who 's been high up on the Civ chain of command who appreciates what stepping away from the numbers can do - AC being less a designer 's new take on Civilisation as a Civilisation designer exploring philosophy through its lens . Next time , it would be good to see the skill and processing that goes into the mechanical side take a few cues from that , and show us just how much more a world can be than the sum of its strategies .
Just a day after Flipkart confirmed its $ 1 billion investment , Amazon has announced that it will invest an additional $ 2 billion in India to support its growth and improve the customer & seller experience in the country .
Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos mentions that India is on track to be their fastest country every to a billion dollars in gross sales at current scale & growth rates and this investment will enable their team to think ‚Äú big , innovate , and raise the bar for customers in India ‚Äù .
Earlier in the week , Amazon 's Indian subsidiary Amazon Seller Services India had opened its third fulfillment center in Chennai and had stated plans to open four more fulfillment centers in Delhi , Jaipur , Ahmedabad and Tauru ( outskirts of Gurgaon ) . With this , Amazon will have seven fulfillment centers across India including its existing Fulfillment Centers in Mumbai and Bangalore .
The company had claimed that this addition will enable them nearly double its total storage capacity to over half million square feet and provide existing and new retailers from both South & North India closer access to Amazon 's fulfillment capabilities .
Amazon had also extended its # AmazonCart service to India earlier in the month , enabling Indian users to tweet and add items to their Amazon shopping cart , which they can check out at a later time .
New Categories : The company has also been aggressively rolling out more categories to its site since its launch in June last year . It claims to currently offer over 17 million products from more than 20 categories like apparel , books , computers , mobiles , consumer electronics , baby products , health & personal care products , home & kitchen products and beauty products among others .
Logistics : On the logistics side , Amazon India had launched a pilot program to test in-store pick-up service in Delhi and Mumbai in association with BPCL 's In & Out stores . Shoppers were provided the option to select In & Out as the pick-up of point of their Amazon purchases during the checkout process .
This pilot was later extended to Bangalore in the following month , wherein it allowed customers to pick up their Amazon purchases from local kirana shops .
It had received government approval to set up a logistics business in February 2012 , following which Amazon had launched its third-party logistics service in November 2013 . A month later , Amazon India launched a pilot project to test India Post 's cash on delivery model .
The company had also launched assisted shipping in India , that lets sellers ship products from their own warehouses using Amazon 's logistics service and had introduced a self-registration feature that lets vendors register on the site and start selling within a day without intervention from any third-party .
FDI in E-commerce : Amazon had also been continuously lobbying with the Indian government to relax the regulations against foreign e-commerce companies and allow foreign direct investment in online retail . This will enable them to adopt a US-like hybrid model wherein Amazon will start retailing products along with the existing marketplace . Remember that Amazon marketplace accounts for only around 40 % of their business in the United States .
With Flipkart 's $ 1Bn fundraising and Amazon 's $ 2Bn investment , we wonder what eBay-backed Snapdeal is upto ?

Gooseman is embarrassed .
In 1999 , Minh `` Gooseman '' Le co-created the seminal modern combat shooter Counter-Strike as a free downloadable mod for Half-Life . A year later , both Counter-Strike and Le were acquired by Half-Life developer Valve , where Counter-Strike was repackaged and sold by the truckload , and Le was put to work creating the follow-up , Counter-Strike 2 .
That was then .
This is now : More than a decade has passed and to the outside observer , both Counter-Strike 2 and Le have been frozen in time . In theory , Valve officially ceased production on the game following Le 's departure from the studio in 2002 . In reality , it 's production had never really begun .
After a short and damaging stint at Valve , Le decided to strike out on his own , taking his ideas for the Counter-Strike sequel and eventually rolling them into his new game : Tactical Intervention . It is a free-to-play , multiplayer shooter , and is scheduled for release later this year .
The closed beta begins this month .
It has been in development for close to a decade .
`` My god , it 's embarrassing how long it 's been in development , '' Le told Polygon . `` But it 's almost there . ''
It 's a game , man IT 'S A GAME , MAN
Tactical Intervention will not be the sequel to Counter-Strike that many fans may be expecting . And with more than 25 million units sold ( not counting the versions distributed freely , legally or otherwise ) Counter-Strike is a game with many , many fans . Whether or not that surprise will morph into disappointment is a question that consumes a great many of Gooseman 's thoughts . `` When I developed Counter-Strike , it was just a game , '' Le told Vox Games . `` I did n't know that it was going to be great . It was just an idea that I had and I thought 'OK , these are the game features that I want to test out , and maybe they 'll work and maybe they wo n't . ' '' Turns out they did work ... on a massive scale . `` IT DOES N'T SOUND GOOD FOR MARKETING , BUT I DO N'T LIKE WORKING TO A STANDARD . '' Not only did CS go on to become one of the most-played online shooters of its time , but it rapidly became a staple of the growing competitive gaming scene . Its action - gritty , immediate and lethal -inspired much of what passes for innovation in today 's shooters such as limited , but high-powered weaponry , and the rapid-pace of online matches . Now the indie game Tactical Intervention will be competing against the triple-A games it inspired . `` I know people are going to benchmark us to Modern Warfare , '' Le said , `` but you know there 's not much I can say or do to prevent that from happening . I 'm just hopeful that people can see the game for what it is ... and try to take a chance on the game . ''
Le said it would be unrealistic to believe that with his small , Korea-based team , he would be able to develop a game that plays like Counter-Strike or that could compete with the production value of triple-A shooters . He said , instead , his goal is to take the fundamentals of Counter-Strike and improve on them . `` I wanted to expand on Counter-Strike , the things I learned inCounter-Strike , the problems that I saw in Counter-Strikegameplay , '' Le said . `` I wanted to focus more on basically offering gamers a gameplay that 's different than [ Battlefield andModern Warfare ] and that 's enjoyable . '' Unlike his triple-A competitors , Le is focusing on the ground war , leaving the players ' boots squarely on terra firma . There will be vehicles , although no aircraft . There will be civilians that can be used as human shields or thrown at enemies to knock them off balance . And there will be actual shields that will absorb damage , as well as other bells and whistles . `` It 's much more of a close-quarters [ game ] . The action takes place in a much smaller environment , '' Le said . `` I tried to implement a lot of features that you find in real life that really add to the gameplay , like the dogs , the vehicles . We have rappelling . We have charges where you can blow open doors . `` It 's a much more interactive environment , there 's so much you can do . We have a lot of little features that I find will alter the course of gameplay and it 's just a matter of tweaking them so that they are n't super annoying or super out of balance . I 'm really excited to see what players will come up with . ''
Le is also doing a lot of looking back at parts of Counter-Strike that players did n't enjoy , and seeing how he might be able to improve the experience . His first challenge : Make the VIP scenario fun . `` When I designed the VIP scenario I kind of gave up on it because a lot of people communicated that they were n't enjoying [ it ] and they wanted to play more of the bombing scenario , '' he said . `` So I tried to analyze what was wrong with the VIP scenario ... when you play TI and you see the videos of TI , you 'll see the changes that I tweaked ... and I think [ it 's ] much more engaging now . '' Yet in spite of Le 's interest in giving players what they want , he knows that at some level he 's not going to be able to do that . Because no matter how many cool features he 's able to pack into Tactical Intervention , how many Counter-Strikemodes he 's able to tweak and how much fun it is to play , it will not be Counter-Strike 2 . And Le does n't want it to be . `` I 'M AN INDIE GUY . '' `` I think that if I were to make Counter-Strike 2 , people [ would ] be expecting that this has got to be the next best thing since sliced bread , '' Le said . `` I hate that . I hate that whole standard thing . It 's a game , man . We 're going to play it , and tweak it with the players over the course of the cycle . `` It does n't sound good for marketing when I say that , that I like releasing a game that 's not triple-A , but I do n't like working under a burden , or under a certain standard that I have to fulfill . I like to have the freeness of being able to just experiment with new stuff . '' This reluctance to work to a triple-A standard may sound like sour grapes from a man who has n't shipped a game in 10 years , and from some indie developers , that 's just what it is . But hearing Gooseman say that he does n't want to work in triple-A , you sense that he 's speaking from a place of deep , hard-won wisdom : You know that Gooseman used to work in triple-A and walked away from it . You know that Gooseman used to work at Valve .
The valve years THE VALVE YEARS
Gooseman is hard on himself . The tortured path of Tactical Intervention began at the turn of the century , at Valve , the megalithic software company in Seattle . Le 's Counter-Strike had originally been designed as a multiplayer mod on top of Valve 's single player FPS Half-Life . The mod became an instant hit and was soon absorbed into the mother ship , giving Valve an instant boost in the online multiplayer shooter landscape . Yet in spite of propelling Le 's game to new heights , the move almost ended Le 's career , and he says he has only himself to blame . `` It put a big burden on my shoulders , '' Le said . `` When I was at Valve I wanted to just impress people . I just wanted to fit in . Everybody at Valve was so great . It felt like if I did n't present them with a great game design it would n't get accepted . There was a certain standard of quality that Valve expects and it 's not something [ where ] they say : 'You have to do this or else we 're going to fire you . ' I think it 's just something that I felt . '' AFTER TWO YEARS , HE HAD FAILED TO COME UP WITH SO MUCH AS A DESIGN DOCUMENT Apart from wanting to please his employers at Valve , Le says he also felt a great responsibility to please the Counter-Strike audience by giving them a game worthy of their expectations and their belief in him as the archetypical indie creator gone big time . `` I wanted to do something that would knock their socks off basically , '' he said . `` And that scared me . I was n't really comfortable with it , I guess , because my roots are in an indie background . '' In a way , it was Le 's indie roots that made working at Valve so difficult . The very innocence and inexperience prized by the company , and that led him to create one of its biggest-selling hits , made it hard for him to find a niche for himself in Valve 's more structured environment . `` I like to do everything , '' Le said . `` Modeling , animation , coding , and all this kind of things . I think that kind of made it hard for me to fit in at Valve . `` At Valve everybody has a very specific role , or at most two roles and they 're really good at that . So for me it kind of felt like I was a jack of all trades but not a master of any . '' Le struggled to find his place at the company . For a time he even worked as a low-level animator while Valve patiently waited for his muse to come calling with a concept forCounter-Strike 2 . It never did . `` I did n't have a clear idea of what I wanted [ Counter-Strike 2 ] to be , '' he said . `` I did n't have a clear game plan or a game design so it was very hard for me to convince anyone that this is a good idea for the new Counter-Strike . I was given a huge amount of freedom and they never really put any stress on me . There were never any deadlines for me . It was basically ... self-imposed . '' The pressure to perform , self-imposed though it may have been , ultimately prevented Le from being able to take advantage of the opportunity within Valve , and stalled the company 's progress with Counter-Strike 2 . After two years , he had failed to come up with so much as a design document for the sequel . `` I was n't able to do that as a designer , '' Le said . `` I was n't able to produce that document . So that 's why we broke up . We both felt mutually that I work better in an environment where I 'm not bound by certain standards . `` I 'm an indie guy . '' `` I DID N'T HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT I WANTED COUNTER-STRIKE 2 TO BE . ''
It became complicated IT BECAME COMPLICATED `` When I left Valve there was the understanding that I was going to be working on a game very similar to Counter-Strike , '' said Le , `` and at the time there was no idea forCounter-Strike 2 . There were no plans . '' That was then . Now , Le is closing in on the as-yet unannounced release date for his long-awaited spiritual successor to Counter-Strike , Tactical Intervention . Unfortunately , after 10 years , Valve is also closing in on a release date for their own spiritual successor to Counter-Strike : Counter-Strike : Global Offensive . Le says that the timing is unfortunate because he does n't want to - ca n't , really - compete with Valve , but there is n't anything he can do . `` I have friends there , '' he said , `` and some of them even asked me to come back and work on [ CS : GO ] ... I thought about it a lot , but this project is almost done so I ca n't really do that . '' According to Le , the mutual decision for him to depart Valve included an understanding that he would be working on another game and that that game would probably look a lot like Counter-Strike . `` Initially it was actually going to be a mod , '' he said . `` It was going to be another mod of the new Source engine basically and it was going to be released as a free mod and then it would be built from there . '' `` Two years after that , it became complicated . '' And that 's an understatement . `` BY THE TIME I REALIZED HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS , I WAS ALREADY THERE . ''

Le says much of the long development cycle was spent with him addressing the new and myriad ways in which multiplayer shooter technology has advanced since he got his start as a mod coder . For example , in those days , every aspect of an online match-up was handled by a single , dedicated server . Now it 's much more complex . `` When I developed Counter-Strike I only had to worry about the dedicated servers , '' Le said . `` So there was only one server that I really had to develop . With this game , technically , we had to develop several satellite servers like the login server and the database server , so in essence we were kind of developing our own Steam . Our own backend that the players would log into and it would keep track of their items and all their information . It was a really big task . '' Then there was the language barrier . Moving development on Tactical Intervention to Korea allowed Le to find the funding he needed to complete the game , but things that would have been minor headaches for a North American development team turned into major obstacles for Le in Korea , largely because he could n't speak the language . `` I was kind of naive thinking I could go there and just integrate in the culture , '' he says . `` I thought I would be with a lot of people who could speak English and I thought I could really communicate with the team there , but it 's been really difficult to find , for one thing , people who can speak English properly . Because most of the English speakers in Korea are already working at the bigger companies because they get attracted so easily . If you have that skill you can work at any big company easily . '' The language barrier was n't the only issue . `` In Korea very few people know the Source engine , '' he said . `` In fact in the world very few people use the Source engine . It 's just one of those engines that 's just not really well known and it 's really unfortunate because it made it really difficult for us to find good developers . '' In spite of the challenges , relocating to Korea was a sacrifice Le was willing to make in order to finish his game . He admits he 's not much of a businessman , and did n't know how to secure the funding he needed to complete the project on his own . So when a friend introduced him to a Korean investor , and the opportunity to join an existing Korean company to transform it into a development studio , Gooseman took the plunge . `` IN KOREA VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THE SOURCE ENGINE . '' In retrospect , he wonders if it was the right call . `` I 'm not sure I would have done it again if I knew how difficult it was , '' he says . `` But it 's just one of those things that once you start , it 's hard for you to just pick up and go 'OK , this is a bad idea , I have to leave . ' `` By the time I realized how difficult it was , I was already there and we had already established the company and hired a few people . So it was difficult to turn back and say 'this is too hard . ' ''

Anonymous sexism in paleoanthropology
John Hawks Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 28 , 2015
Seems like every week , someone writes an article drawing attention to a new episode of sexism in science . Today it 's my turn to shine a light on this issue .
Sunday , The Observer published an article by Robin McKie : ‚Äú Scientist who found new human species accused of playing fast and loose with the truth ‚Äù . McKie featured extensive quotes from paleoanthropologist Tim White , who believes that the 2-year-long analysis of Homo naledi was ‚Äú rushed ‚Äù . McKie included both negative and supportive quotes from a number of scientists , all of them men .
McKie used one particularly negative quote from a source who would not go on the record with his or her name . Steeped in sexism , it has been sparking outrage among anthropologists in social media since the story was published this weekend :
The fact that Berger used women cavers to retrieve Naledi bones ‚Äî on the grounds that they were the only ones small enough to get into the chamber ‚Äî has only irked his critics even more . One said : ‚Äú There are many male cavers who could get in there , but that would have spoiled the publicity stunt . ‚Äù
It 's a short paragraph in a long article . Some may wonder whether this kind of comment is worth protesting . It is , after all , the sort of thing that may be whispered in the hallway at any scientific conference .
That 's exactly the point .
Best candidates for the job
McKie 's article is sloppy journalism . He gets the basic facts wrong , even though the entire story of the Rising Star Expedition is easily accessible to anyone who bothers to check . Hundreds of thousands have read the expedition blog from the beginning , and more than 230,000 have read the open access paper in eLife . The search for our excavation team and the subsequent analysis of the fossils has been well-documented in many public sources . Lots of journalists have covered this story without making stupid errors as McKie has done here .
The original Facebook ad that Lee Berger posted to search for excavators is available to the public .
Dear Colleagues ‚Äî I need the help of the whole community and for you to reach out to as many related professional groups as possible . We need perhaps three or four individuals with excellent archaeological/palaeontological and excavation skills for a short term project that may kick off as early as November 1st 2013 and last the month if all logistics go as planned . The catch is this ‚Äî the person must be skinny and preferably small . They must not be claustrophobic , they must be fit , they should have some caving experience , climbing experience would be a bonus . They must be willing to work in cramped quarters , have a good attitude and be a team player . Given the highly specialized , and perhaps rare nature of what I am looking for , I would be willing to look at an experienced Ph.D. student or a very well trained Masters student , even though the more experience the better ( PH.D. 's and senior scientists most welcome ) . No age limit here either . I do not think we will have much money available for pay ‚Äî but we will cover flights , accommodation ( though much will be field accom. , food and of course there will be guaranteed collaboration further up the road ) . Anyone interested please contact me directly on lee.berger @ wits.ac.za copied to my assistant Wilma.lawrence @ wits.ac.za . My deadlines on this are extremely tight so as far as anyone can spread the word , among professional groups .
Not a word about women being the ‚Äú only ones small enough to get into the chamber , ‚Äù and no preference for women or men indicated . Obviously women are not the only ones who can fit in the Dinaledi Chamber ‚Äî the cavers who have supported the work of the excavators from the beginning of the expedition are mostly men .
This weekend , Lee added some context in a public Facebook post :
Finally , the idea that the six primary excavators , who just happen to be women , were chosen for their sex as some sort of publicity stunt is insulting . It 's insulting to our large team of scientists , it 's insulting to these extraordinary scientists who literally risked their lives daily to recover these fossils , and it 's insulting to female scientists in general . I led the selection panel its true . There were approximately 60 qualified applicants that responded to the Ad I and others circulated on various social media platforms . A significant majority of these applicants were women and that may reflect nothing more than the changing demographics of who is choosing to do a degree in this field , I do n't know ‚Äî they are who applied . We shortlisted that group to about ten candidates who we felt were the best qualified based on their skills and their skills alone , as long as they met the physical requirements the dangerous task demanded . We quite literally ranked them in order . It is a little known fact that from the shortlist , the first selection of six excavators included a male , but he , it turned out , did not actually meet the physical requirements to get into the chamber and so by that one chance the six scientists we chose were all women and all the best qualified to do the job meeting all the requirements we set out at the time . I hope that clears that issue up once and for all .
After an open process of application , the best candidates were women . Simple as that .
The demography of paleoanthropology
It is not news that most areas of science have seen a massive increase in the participation by women during the last 40 years . But some senior scientists are oblivious to reality .
They should know better . Women are not only the future of biological anthropology and archaeology , they are the present . Since 1990 , women have consistently been awarded more PhD degrees than men in anthropology in the U.S. , the proportion of PhDs going to women is now above 60 % . The proportion of women is even higher in graduate programs of anthropology , now above 65 % , it has been higher than men since the 1970s . In my undergraduate classes in biological anthropology , more than 70 % of students are women . Our current graduate students in biological anthropology at UW-Madison are all women , and this is not unusual for graduate programs in the U.S . There is absolutely nothing strange about the top candidates with archaeological experience being all women , because our students are mostly women .
How could a senior scientist be oblivious to this reality ? One reason is that some departments have such a history of sexism and harassment that other scientists advise women students to avoid them like the plague . Some scholars do n't have students who are women because they are driving women away .
Sexual harassment driving people from the field
The reality of sexual harassment in paleoanthropology was brought to public attention last year by the publication of the Survey of Academic Field Experiences ( SAFE ) study by Kathryn Clancy and colleagues . The study found that 71 % of women respondents had been targets of harassment at field sites , and 26 % of respondents had been targets of sexual assault . These incidences were much higher for women than for men , and most targets of harassment and assault had been students at the time they were victimized .
Harassment and assault in the field are not the only barriers to women in paleoanthropology . Pat Shipman this month has a harrowing article in American Scientist that recounts some of her experiences as a tenured woman in academia : ‚Äú Taking the Long View on Sexism in Science ‚Äù .
The culture of discrimination is far-reaching and ongoing . This year I learned of two public instances of overt sexual harassment directed at junior women that took place at a professional anthropology meeting in April . The accounts became a major topic of discussion in anthropology circles , so much so that I was able to check the stories with both subjects and with others who had witnessed the incidents . In one case , a senior male in the field apparently believed commenting on a junior colleague 's breasts was acceptable behavior and possibly even flattering . In the other , a senior male researcher invited a junior female colleague to sit on his lap .
These experiences , from harassment and sexual comments to assault during fieldwork , are connected in a broader pattern . One result is that many women leave field sciences . Paleoanthropology has a lower proportion of women in tenured and tenure-track faculty and research positions than in other areas of biological anthropology .
Our understanding of human origins is impoverished by the absence of creative voices who were excluded from research and fieldwork . Interested students find fewer women as research mentors , which impacts the next generation of science . It 's time to end this cycle .
We can demand better
The casual sexism reflected by the anonymous source in McKie 's article is part of this broader pattern . McKie himself has a record of reporting that shows he understands the fallout from reporting sexist comments from senior scientists . McKie this summer wrote about one of the most significant recent stories of sexism in science , with his sympathetic profile of Sir Tim Hunt ( ‚Äú Sir Tim Hunt : my gratitude to female scientists for their support ‚Äù ) .
The named critics in McKie 's story are among the most prominent scientists in the field . He was obviously interviewing some high-powered people . McKie surely knows that the anonymous source in this story would rightly be criticized for making such a baldfaced statement of sexism , and he kindly provided confidentiality to the source who made it , to cover the smear .
I ca n't know who was the anonymous ‚Äú one ‚Äù , but I plan to fight that attitude in every venue where I encounter it .

An 11-year-old boy has been given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order for stealing a bin during the recent riots .
The boy from Romford in north-east London is the youngest rioter in the capital to be prosecuted , according to Scotland Yard .
He committed the offence five days after being given a referral order for arson , criminal damage and carrying a pointed instrument in an unrelated incident .
The boy took the bin , worth ¬£50 , from Debenhams in Romford on 8 August .
Rioters had smashed the windows of the store , causing ¬£6,000 of damage , when the boy was seen by a police officer reaching in to take a bin from a display .
He was sentenced at Havering magistrates court in Essex on Wednesday after previously admitting burglary .
Passing sentence , district judge John Woollard said : `` You seem to think that nobody can stop the way you behave . ''
The boy was told that his local authority will dictate where he lives for the next six months . He was already under a referral order , imposed at the same court on 3 August , for an incident on 18 July when he cut the seats of a bus with a Stanley knife and tried to light the exposed foam .
When the driver refused to let him off the 174 bus , the boy threw a stone at its exit door then kicked a hole in the shattered glass and jumped out of the moving vehicle .
The judge said the boy , who sat in court with his mother , had been involved in `` major disorder '' .
He said : `` My view is that the offence is a very serious one . If you were a little older you would be ending up in prison , you would be looked after there rather than elsewhere .
`` You need to understand very clearly that you ca n't get away with committing offences of this nature . ''
After the sentencing , children 's charity Barnardo 's criticised courts for punishing children of this age for `` minor offences '' .
Chief executive Anne Marie Carrie said : `` It is both counterproductive and costly to hand out disproportionately punitive sentences for minor offences such as petty theft , particularly to younger children of 10 or 11 .
`` The evidence shows that after a year , half of boys and girls at this age who are sentenced in court will have reoffended and their experience within the criminal justice system increases the likelihood that they will go on to commit further crimes .
`` We are calling on the government to reconsider treatment of the youngest children in trouble within the criminal justice system .
`` We would urge them to spend money more wisely on more effective ways to stop youth crime , such as whole family approaches like family intervention projects .
`` This is not a soft option ‚Äì rather it challenges and supports parents and their children to face up to their actions and accept responsibility for them , helping to reduce antisocial behaviour , truancy and school exclusions . ''
Obama respects Emanuel 's knowledge of Washington , including the legislative process , and his reputation for getting things done . Obama wants Emanuel for chief of staff
In his first major move as president-elect , Barack Obama has asked Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D-Ill. ) , a tough-minded tactician with West Wing experience , to serve as his White House chief of staff , Democratic sources tell Politico .
Emanuel has said to friends that he wants and will take the job , but it was not a done deal as of early this morning . Obama plans to move swiftly with his transition announcement and could name Emanuel this week , the sources said . He then plans rapid-fire announcements on his economic and national security teams .
Story Continued Below
If Emanuel ‚Äî a member of the House Democratic leadership with ambitions to one day to be House speaker ‚Äî were to turn it down , former Sen. Tom Daschle ( D-S.D . ) would likely get the nod , the sources said .
Some Democrats have warned that Emanuel 's take-no-prisoners style could hurt Obama . But the president-elect wants to move fast to push his legislative agenda through the Democratic-controlled Congress ‚Äî and Emanuel knows the Hill and power politics as well as anyone in town .
‚Äú Obama wants a bad cop , so he can be good cop 90 percent of the time , ‚Äù an adviser said .
Emanuel , who at 49 is two years older than Obama , is the Democratic Caucus chairman , the fourth-highest-ranking member of the House Democratic leadership .
Emanuel was known for his hard-nosed tactics as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton . After leaving the White House , he returned to Chicago as an investment bank managing director .
Friends of both men say that Obama likes Emanuel , and that Emanuel would be totally loyal . And Obama respects Emanuel 's knowledge of Washington , including the legislative process , and his reputation for getting things done .
Emanuel 's first big assignment in Clinton 's White House was helping pass the North American Free Trade Agreement , which riled many Democrats . He was a consistent voice for anti-crime measures , welfare reform and other initiatives that pushed against liberal orthodoxy .
In his personal views , he 's a centrist , and despite a combative political style , he has good relations with many congressional Republicans , such as Rep. Adam Putnam ( R-Fla. ) .
West of Scotland Tory MSP Jamie Greene spoke exclusively to CommonSpace about the Tie campaign for inclusive education and the ‚Äò Turing Law ' to be introduced by the Scottish Government
SCHOOLS INSPECTORS should be allowed to ask schools what action they are taking in delivering inclusive education in classrooms across Scotland , according to Tory MSP Jamie Greene .
West of Scotland MSP Jamie Greene , who supports more inclusive education in schools , said it should be up to both national and local government to cooperate and use their resources efficiently to achieve specific targets in making sure that LGBT+ issues are being taught in the classroom .
The Greenock-born MSP said : ‚Äú We have a complex system of Scottish Government , health authorities , local government , schools themselves and individual teachers and school boards . Tie ( Time for Inclusive Education ) wants to see LGBTI education in schools , and no-one can deny that is a good thing .
‚Äú More importantly , though they are looking to help teachers , who ultimately have to deliver , monitor and keep their eyes open for problems in schools .
‚Äú For example , as a Scottish Conservative , I think school inspections should specifically ask about school action on LGBTI+ issues as opposed to simply broad equality matters . ‚Äù
The pledge on school inspections was a manifesto commitment for the Scottish Tories at this year 's Holyrood elections . It aimed to introduce a ‚Äú dedicated reporting of LGBT incidents through SEEMiS ‚Äù .
The Scottish Tories are also committed to developing a toolkit ‚Äì in cooperation with the third sector ‚Äì to help teachers who are unsure about how they would tackle homophobic and transphobic bullying within schools .
‚Äú Above all of this , I think people do n't care who is delivering the [ inclusive ] education , as long as it gets done. ‚Äù Jamie Greene MSP
Councillors in Glasgow recently passed a motion to support Tie 's campaign for more inclusive education in schools across the city . The motion was tabled by SNP councillor Angus Millar , who welcomed the decision by the council to work with the Tie campaign in dealing with homophobia in schools across the city
Millar added : ‚Äú We as a council must work with the Scottish Government , the Tie campaign and other partners to monitor homophobia in our schools , and ensure our teachers are supported to tackle this issue head on. ‚Äù .
The Tie campaign is calling for a legal requirement for all schools to deliver and inclusive education programme across Scotland .
Greene , who supports Tie , said that the third sector and local authorities should be cooperating in improving the education for the LGBT+ community as it should be more of a journey than a destination .
He said : ‚Äú What we have right now in Scotland is a patchwork of initiatives across sectors from healthcare to employment .
‚Äú What 's needed is a fundamental change in mindset . Instead of treating the LGBTI+ community as legal and cultural exceptions to the norm , we need to work towards systems of law , education and public services that work for everyone by default . ‚Äù
As an openly gay MSP , he said that he was surprised that there was not a cross-party group on LGBT+ in the Scottish Parliament . As a result , he has set up the group of which he is co-convening with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale , Scottish Green co-convenor Patrick Harvie and SNP MSP Ben Macpherson .
‚Äú Instead of treating the LGBTI+ community as legal and cultural exceptions to the norm , we need to work towards systems of law , education and public services that work for everyone by default. ‚Äù Jamie Greene MSP
With groups such as Stonewall Scotland , Equality Network , LGBT Youth Scotland , Pink Saltire and Fearless involved , the first meeting of the group will be on 14 December .
Greene said that the group would discuss a broad range of issues ‚Äú from geriatric care for LGBTI+ people to helping employers become more LGBTI+ friendly , to teacher training , to funding for public healthcare campaigns , to bullying in schools ‚Äù .
Meanwhile , Greene stated that he supports the recent announcement from Scottish Government Justice Secretary Michael Matherson to pardon gay and bisexual people historically convicted of offences .
He added that he welcomes moves ‚Äú by both the UK and Scottish Governments on this issue , it is another small step on the journey towards greater equality on our shores ‚Äù .
‚Äú The government disagreed with a private member 's bill introduced by John Nicolson because it could lead to some people being cleared of offences that are still crimes. ‚Äù Jamie Greene MSP
But he was critical of the SNP 's John Nicolson , who tabled a Westminister 's private members bill that would have pardoned all men living with UK convictions on same-sex offences committed before the law was changed .
The bill was known as ‚Äú Turing Bill ‚Äù , named after wartime codebreaker Alan Turning , who committed suicide after his gross indecency conviction .
With the UK government having its plans for posthumous pardons , the bill was ‚Äú talked out ‚Äù , with the result that it was dropped .
Greene said : ‚Äú The government disagreed with a private member 's bill introduced by John Nicolson because it could lead to some people being cleared of offences that are still crimes . ‚Äù

Ever since I shot the King Of The Hammers race , people have asked me why the sudden interest in off-road racing . My reply is simple : because it is awesome . Off-road racing is very visually appealing ‚Äì there is such a wide range of racecars and it 's very dynamic both in the appearance of the competitors and the terrain they are running on . There are so many variables , as the course is constantly changing over the duration of the race . What the drivers have to overcome just to cross the finish line is madness .
I was really looking forward to checking out the Mint 400 , as I had heard so much about it . It is known as the oldest off-road race in America as it started back in 1967 , and many racing legends including Al Unser , Mickey Thompson and Steve McQueen have graced this glamorous off-road test of endurance . It is held about an hour south of Las Vegas , near the Nevada and California border .
The race is relatively high speed compared to the King Of The Hammers as there was no rock crawling involved , but it is not any less challenging and fewer than 50 percent of the teams cross the finish line .
Much of the high speed sections are run on dry lake beds , where massive clouds of dust get kicked up by the hundreds of race cars . There was so much dust that it completely blanketed the valley , including the main highway going into Las Vegas .
There were massive elevation changes as well , which provided for some excellent views of the entire race course .
The course is a 92 mile circuit and the race comprises four consecutive laps for the Unlimited class teams . There are three pit areas spread out over the length of the circuit .
The race is just one day , but after a few laps the driving line got very rutted and caused many flips ‚Äì but it also made for some nice jumps .
The race officially ended at 10pm for the Unlimited class guys , so they race well into the night . It 's crazy as I had a hard enough time navigating the access roads at night with all the dust that was in the air . I could n't even imagine what it was like for the competitors .
In the Limited class there were some serious-looking rigs that still somewhat resembled street vehicles . In fact , some of these cars were driven to the event .
Also in the Limited class were these smaller all-terrain vehicles , some of which were running two-stroke motors .
The Unlimited class mostly consisted of these Trophy Trucks , but since the term ‚Äò Trophy Trucks ' is trademarked they call them ‚Äò Trick Trucks ' .
Also in the Unlimited class were four-wheel drive and two-wheel drive buggies .
The weekend had started in Hollywood , where I went to trade cars with my sister . My Nissan Titan did not have four-wheel drive , but my sister 's Nissan Pathfinder did . On the way to Vegas I picked up two hitchhikers of my shooting buddies , as they were also covering the Mint 400 .
Shooting off-road racing had so many challenges that I 've never faced before , one of which was having to four-wheel my way to shooting locations . A normal road vehicle just would n't do .
We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the driver-side mirror decided to quit . Nothing a little gaffer 's tape could n't fix .
There is nothing like the smell of the inside of a Vegas casino : cigarettes and buffet food . We picked up maps of the race course and attended a briefing that mentioned where we could go and what to watch out for .
That night we hit a local superstore for all the essentials , which includes high-visibility vests . The last thing we wanted was to get run over by a monster truck .
We crashed out for a few hours at Danny George 's house and at 4:30am packed up the trusty Pathfinder for an all-day Speedhunting adventure .
By the time we got to the start-line , the race was already under way . The Limited class guys started at 6am sharp .
The starter let the eager drivers go in pairs at 30 second intervals . At around 7am the sun peaked out over the mountain range .
Pretty soon all the cars were off and the starting grid was empty . It would take almost two hours for the lead guys to finish their first lap . It probably did n't help that they started in the dark to begin with .
The race was definitely underway . I had witnessed the start , I was sure of that much . But what now ?
The circuit was designed in a way where we could catch up to the pack of cars at key points of interest . So we headed out to our next spot , one of the many dry lake beds .
After some spirited off-roading we arrived at what was called ‚Äò Rockets ' . I am assuming it was because the cars look like tiny rockets shooting through the lake bed .
I loved it , because I noticed something that I have never seen before . The dust took the shape of the terrain . It was so clearly defined . It was beautiful .
Already this early in the race this team shredded a tire . Track marshals came by , but they could only offer to take the spare away ‚Äì they could n't help , or the team would be disqualified .
Soon the last car of the pack made its way through ‚Äò Rockets ' and we were off to our next spot .
We knew that we were literally in the middle of nowhere when we got to this shooting location , because that was exactly what it was for‚Ä¶ shooting .
There were certainly some interesting things people brought to shoot at . There were TVs and I even found a few printers .
Most of the vehicles who went through this section caught some serious air . I find shooting jumps is a whole new dimension of race photography that I have not really shot besides shooting rallycross .
Competitors were coming by less and less frequently , probably because we were near the finish line .
By 10am they were spread out all over the course . It was no longer a race , now it was an endurance contest . The idea of trying to ‚Äú cover this race ‚Äù in any conventional press sense was absurd .
But we had to go on . We needed total coverage . So we set off on a trail that took us to a rock quarry .
By now the Unlimited class guys had already started . They left the start line at 1pm and within moments they reached our location .
This was the tightest section of the course , but there were also a few jumps as well .
This was also the dustiest part of the course . It was hard to breath at times , let alone see where you were going . Luckily we had our high-visibility vests on to communicate to the drivers that we were friendlies . Hired geeks .
We escaped the dust and headed to the pits , but not before crossing this intersection where the race course met the access road . It was absolutely nuts how fast these guys went through this section : they barely touched the pavement at all , some guys just jumping from one side of the dirt to the other .
All of that jumping took a toll on the race rigs . This team was in the pits for emergency control arm repairs .
It was a very clean break , but it was nothing a little on-location welding could n't fix .
At this point the goal for these guys was to finish the race .
I 'm guessing these were the new type of spotlights that can grow a beard .
Nick Woodman , founder and president of GoPro , was racing in the Unlimited class . Although , before his stint the transmission decided to quit on his co-driver .
Nick waited patiently as the team sourced a new transmission so they could finish the race .
It was an interesting coincidence that as the Mint 400 was going on , right outside the circuit was a dirt oval where the TORC series was practicing .
As if there were not enough jumping trucks in the area already !
The amount of earth these guys move just amazes me . If you guys have not noticed , I did not have the chance to try different lenses as the dust forced me to shoot with just two lenses , one on each body .
The dust is like a part of the trucks . It 's almost like an organic living creature trailing behind these magnificent machines .
The sun started to set and the guys in the lead were on their last lap . It was the home stretch .
For the rest of the field , there was a long night ahead of them . The race ended at 10pm , but I heard that some guys did n't make it back till past 11pm as they are still very far from the finish line .
The mixture of dust and the sunset created these beautiful layers .
As the sun went down the temperatures dropped dramatically . The visibility also worsened ; it was hard enough to see in the daytime .
I noticed more and more guys going off course , but there was nothing stopping some of these guys from finishing this historic race .
Pretty soon it was pitch dark and our day of Speedhunting in the desert was over . We packed up and headed back to Hollywood that night .
I did n't even know who had won the race . Maybe nobody . All I know is , I hiked in the desert till my nose started to bleed and that I love off-road racing .

In this May 15 , 2014 file photo , protesters hold a rally to support `` net neutrality '' at the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) headquarters in Washington , D.C. ( Photo11 : Karen Bleier , AFP/Getty Images )
The net neutrality fight is not taking a summer break .
Several groups including CTIA ‚Äî The Wireless Association , the National Cable & Telecommunications Association and USTelecom , a trade association that counts among its members AT & T and Verizon ‚Äî have filed a petition asking for a rehearing of the Federal Communication Commission 's net neutrality rules .
The FCC approved the rules , officially called the Open Internet order , with the blessing of President Obama in February 2015 . The main purpose of the rules was to require Internet service providers ( ISPs ) , mainly large cable or telephone companies , to treat all net content equally and to not block or slow the transmission of content . The rules also prohibit content providers paying an ISP for faster content delivery .
A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 last month to uphold the rules and deny a court challenge by AT & T and several other companies and groups . In the latest challenge , filed Friday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , the petitioners say that a review by a full court is needed . `` The Order , and the panel decision approving it , are seriously wrong in authorizing this power grab , '' said the petition filed by CTIA .
ISPs are not against net neutrality rules , but oppose the FCC 's ability to regulate the net as a public utility , said USTelecom President Walter McCormick in a statement . `` Reclassifying broadband access as a public utility service reverses decades of established legal precedent which has been upheld by the Supreme Court , '' he said .
The FCC based its authority for net neutrality rules in Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 . However , the agency agreed to `` forbear '' ‚Äî or refrain ‚Äî from some provisions in the Act regarding pricing regulation , for instance .
Congress gave the FCC the power to proceed in that manner , says Chris Lewis , vice president of government affairs at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge . `` There is broad consensus support for strong net neutrality rules , making this just another doomed attempt for trade groups to ignore millions of Americans , '' he said in a statement . `` It 's time for these trade groups to move on ‚Äî net neutrality is here to stay . ‚Äù
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said he was not surprised at the challenge . `` We are confident that the full court will agree with the panel 's affirmation of the FCC 's clear authority to enact its strong Open Internet rules , the reasoned decision-making upon which they are based , and the adequacy of the record from which they were developed , ‚Äù he said in a statement .
The issue of net neutrality has an extensive legal history . The agency proposed the 2015 rules , a year after a federal court tossed out an earlier set of provisions that the FCC had passed in 2010 .

Stoudt believes he can be the quarterback to end the streak
Nikki Hood by Staff Writer -
CLEMSON ‚Äì Senior quarterback Cole Stoudt
Sr. Quarterback
# 18 6-4 , 231
Dublin , OH
View Full Profile acted and sounded like a player who fully expects to be a part of the action Saturday afternoon when Clemson hosts arch-rival South Carolina .
The Tigers and Gamecocks will kick off the festivities at noon Saturday in Death Valley , and the biggest question mark surrounding the contest is the health of freshman Deshaun Watson
Fr . Quarterback
# 4 6-3 , 204
Gainesville , GA
View Full Profile . Watson , who injured his left knee against Georgia Tech nine days ago , is day-to-day with an LCL sprain and Stoudt said he is looking forward to finally taking a snap in the rivalry game .
‚Äú I 've been on the sideline watching these games the last few years , so I 'm going to have a little bit of an edge about me to be even more ready and focus on what I 've got to do , ‚Äù Stoudt said Monday in the WestZone . ‚Äú It 's exciting that I finally have the chance to go out there and play .
‚Äú It 's a whole other season . It 's something that everyone looks forward to . Even in the off season , it 's something that everyone kind of focuses on and knows that this is one of the biggest games of the year . Personally , I think it 's one of the biggest rivalries out there in college football - just how the games have always been . It 's a huge deal and it 's something that a lot of people focus on every year . ‚Äù
Stoudt said the players understand that this is the one game the fans want to win , especially with Clemson on the wrong end of a five-game streak .
‚Äú It 's always the game that everyone wants to talk about . Everyone wants to end the streak , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú Everyone wants to focus on the rivalry game . Some people say that they do n't care how our record is , they just want to beat this one team . That 's what some fans say , but on the team we still have to focus on every single game and prepare like it 's the biggest game of the year every week . That 's what we 're going to do and we 're going to go into this week and try to be the best that we can be . ‚Äù
He then said he ca n't go anywhere without seeing a ‚Äú five ‚Äù or hearing about the streak , and it 's something the players are using as motivation .
‚Äú It 's one of those things that 's constantly in the back of your head and motivating you to do a little bit more - watch more film , prepare a little bit harder , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú We 're still going to go into each week like we prepare for every single game and just try to be the best that we can be . ‚Äù
Stoudt said that being the quarterback of the team that beats the streak is something he would take pride in .
‚Äú It would mean a ton to me , actually . Knowing that it would end the streak , ‚Äù Stoudt said . ‚Äú It would be a very high accomplishment and would be highly recognized . It 's just something that it 's more of a whole team effort . It 's not really on one guy . It would be a nice way to go out and end the season with all of the other seniors . It 's something that we 've all put hard work into .
‚Äú I said after the game that no one in that locker room has beaten South Carolina . For the seniors to go out with a win against South Carolina , that would be really big but it 's something that we have to prepare for and go out there and have some fun . We 've had a lot of achievements and broken a lot of records and it would be nice to finish out the season with a victory . ‚Äù
Does he feel like he can lead the Tigers to victory ?
‚Äú Well , yeah . Everyone has to have the confidence to do that . I think that I can , ‚Äù Stoudt said . ‚Äú I know I ca n't do it on my own and that it will take the entire team . I know that we are very capable of winning . ‚Äù
From the characters of Dickens to the fifth Duke of Portland , who was so fearful of being gawped at that he dug tunnels to carry him around his estate , David McKie chooses his top 10 eccentrics in books , both fictional and biographical
David McKie is a journalist and historian . His latest book , Bright Particular Stars : A Gallery of Glorious British Eccentrics , is published this month .
`` People tend to assume that eccentric means weird and wacky . Sometimes it does , sometimes it does n't . The first definition offered by my Chambers dictionary is 'departing from the centre ... out of the normal course ... not conforming to common rules ' - and the characters in my book conform to that test . Some are weird and wacky , others immensely serious - all are true originals . The collection that follows contains five fictional characters and five real ones . As in my book , it ignores those I think of as designer eccentrics : people who affect a wackiness that may be contrived , not simply spontaneous . They know who they are . ''
The fictional :
1 . Sairey Gamp , in Martin Chuzzlewit by Charles Dickens
In the novels of Dickens it 's the non-eccentrics who are in the minority , but Mrs Gamp is one of the richest among the majority with her unquenchable flow of proverbs , her inventive relationship with her friend Mrs Harris , and the fragrance she carries with her , as her creator says , `` borne upon the breeze , as if a passing fairy had hiccoughed and had previously been to a wine-vault . ''
The White Knight in Alice Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll
My favourite piece on Carroll 's chessboard since I first encountered him , with his songs , his uncertain seat in the saddle , and his talent for strange inventions . And , I guess , Carroll 's favourite too . The mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the knight , his armour agleam in the setting sun , his horse gently cropping the grass : `` of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey ... this was always the one she remembered most clearly . '' Me too .
Aunt Dot in The Towers of Trebizond by Rose Macaulay
Fiction is full of endearing eccentric aunts , though sometimes , as in Graham Greene 's Travels with My Aunt , these aunts are not what they seem . But Aunt Dot , immortally announced on page one ( `` 'Take my camel , dear , ' said my aunt Dot , climbing down from that animal on her return from high Mass . '' ) is all-aunt and all-eccentric .
Kenneth Widmerpool in Anthony Powell 's Dance to the Music of Time sequence
The most eccentric figure in Powell 's gallery might seem to be X Trapnel , the bearded , ex-service-greatcoated , swordstick-toting novelist , said to be loosely based on the writer Julian Maclaren-Ross . But in both cases here , affectation has been at work . A truer , much darker , eccentric - from his first appearance as an Eton schoolboy pounding heavily out of fog to his bizarre fatal collapse some fifty years on , still obsessively running - Widmerpool wholly and naturally meets the essential requirement of being `` out of the normal course‚Ä¶not conforming to common rules . ''
Pedro Camacho in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter by Mario Vargas Llosa
`` He 's not a man , he 's an industry '' a colleague at the radio station tells the narrator when Pedro arrives in Lima . `` He writes all the stage plays put on in Bolivia and acts in all of them . And he also writes all the radio serials , directs them , and plays the male lead in every one . '' Soon that will prove to be an understatement . To get the sense of his characters when writing , he dresses up to resemble them : `` he went over to his suitcase , opened it , and began to pull out of the depths of it , like a prestidigitator pulling rabbits or flags out of a hat , an incredible collection of objects : an English magistrate 's court wig , false mustaches of various sizes ... a surgeon 's white smock , false ears and noses ... `` This book is magic .
And the real :
William Beckford , in William Beckford by James Lees-Milne
Beckford was the only legitimate son of an immensely rich London alderman . He became a lavish but discriminating collector of pictures , books and furniture , and built an exotic palace at Fonthill in Wiltshire , topped off by a tower higher ( as he had stipulated ) than the spire of Salisbury cathedral . Of his books , the most famous was his wild Eastern fantasy Vathek which , for its colour , wit and invention , remains a ripely rewarding read . He was forced to live in exile for a time to escape scandal after falling in love with the 11-year-old son of an aristocratic household , and was at various points MP for Wells in Somerset and Hindon in Wiltshire , though he rarely appeared at Westminster . Saying he was sick of being harassed by sightseers , he sold Fonthill Abbey ( soon after , his great tower , the work of a jerrybuilder , collapsed ) and built himself another house and tower on the hills above Bath . Here he would hold dinner parties where , having welcomed his guests , he would take himself off to an upstairs room for the rest of the evening . `` How strange my make-up is , '' he once mused . Few can have ever been stranger .
`` Doctor '' Joseph Healey in Passages in the Life of a Radical , by Samuel Bamford
Bamford was a Lancashire radical at around the time of Peterloo . The cheerful , uncouth , chaotic Healey was a fellow agitator with a compelling taste for amateur dentistry . When fleeing the police , he heard the cries of a woman with vicious toothache and was unable to resist the chance of performing extractions . The bloody results more than confirmed the household 's initial suspicions that he was not a dentist at all .
William John Cavendish Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck , fifth Duke of Portland , in Amazing Grace : the Great Days of Dukes , by ES Turner
This character was always fearful of being gawped at - so he built a tunnel under his parkland at Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire to take him undercover to different destinations on the estate . If he travelled to London he would ride in his coach , blinds drawn , to Worksop station , where his coach would be loaded on to the train with him sitting in it . Servants and tenants who accidentally spotted him were told to pretend that they had n't . Sometimes he would go for a walk in the dark , preceded by a woman servant carrying a lantern no nearer than 40 yards from his presence . He was generous as an employer , though , rewarding his servants with donkeys and umbrellas .
Augusta , Lady Llanover , in a chapter by Prys Morgan in The Invention of Tradition edited by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger
Though born in Monmouthshire , which was not then in Wales , Augusta Waddington became the arch promulgator of ancient Welsh culture in language , literature and music . She performed at eisteddfods and took the bardic name Gweynen Gwent , and where traditional forms were elusive , she made them up ; she and friends invented a form of characteristic Welsh dress which was in fact an amalgamation of various peasant styles . The Dame Waleses one finds in gift shops are largely her creation . `` She invented '' , says Morgan , `` a costume for her male servants at Llanover Court , the harpist being in a weird raiment , half-minstrel Scottish Highlander . '' Lord Llanover ( her husband Benjamin Hall , the government minister after whom Big Ben is named ) `` was not interested in wearing fancy dress , so the men folk of Wales were spared . ''
Benjamin Jowett , Master of Balliol , in As We Were , by EF Benson ( and in Jowett , a Portrait , by GC Faber )
The most formidable figure in Oxford , Jowett , though often kindly , could be coldly forbidding . A young man with whom he had walked 15 miles without a word being exchanged said , as they entered Tewkesbury , `` I believe there are more dogs in the streets than people this morning ! `` , to which Jowett replied : `` If you have nothing more sensible to observe , you had better be silent . '' Yet the poet Swinburne , a wild , self-indulgent extrovert at the furthest end of the eccentric scale , had licence to say whatever he liked , however insulting . Jowett doted on Florence Nightingale , whom he vainly aspired to marry , but detested the French , asking students what legend was written over the entrance to Hell , telling them before they could answer that it was : `` Ici on parle Francais . ''
Ahead of transfer deadline day the rumours are coming in thick and fast , and after being linked to Tomi Juric earlier , reports suggest that Reading also want to bring in Reece Oxford on loan from West Ham .
The 18 year old has been looking for a temporary switch away from the London Stadium this month , with Rangers and Nottingham Forest ( who have today signed Aaron Tshibola on loan ) the two names supposedly fighting for his signature . However , it has emerged tonight that the Royals are also interested , according to this Mirror journalist .
Forest keens on a loan for @ WestHamUtd starlet Reece Oxford but facing late competition from @ ReadingFC ‚Äî James Nursey ( @ JamesNursey ) 30 January 2017
Oxford is yet to make a Premier League appearance this season , but did feature in seven top flight games in 2015-16 , including a high-profile debut in a 1-0 win over Arsenal on the opening day of the campaign , before he 'd even picked up his GCSE results . The youngster has also earned caps for England at Under-16 , U17 , U18 , U19 and U20 level .
He can play in the centre of defence or just in front of the back four , but you would think Stam would deploy him in the backline if he did arrive at the Madejski Stadium . New signing Tiago Ilori injured his ankle against Fulham , Joey van den Berg was forced off against Cardiff with a hamstring problem , whilst Jake Cooper has been loaned to Millwall , leaving Reading with little defensive cover behind Paul McShane and Liam Moore .
So could we go from chanting our hate for Oxford to chanting our love for Oxford ? Let us know your thoughts on the rumour in the comments and remember to keep up to date on deadline day by visiting The Tilehurst End .
To a growing clamour of critics , Coach Bryan MacKenzie is a crusty , bad-tempered relic from a less tolerant era , banning some poor kid from his baseball team all because the teen 's hair is too long .
MacKenzie sees it differently .
For the 45-year-old Pincher Creek man , this is n't about hair , long or short .
It 's about rules and respect , and more importantly , teaching young people to respect themselves .
‚Äú I have a rule on my baseball team , and I 've had the same rule for the past six or seven years ‚Äî I tell the kids , have your hair at respectable length , and look like ball players , ‚Äù said MacKenzie .
MacKenzie does n't have shares in the local barber shop , and the coach of the Pincher Creek Dust Devils is n't especially humourless ‚Äî in fact , he laughs about his newfound notoriety , via an online video secretly filmed by the kid 's outraged mom .
‚Äú I stick by my words , ‚Äù he said .
MacKenzie admits that he believes in a time when rules meant something , and kids were n't all treated as precious individuals with a right to question every order .
‚Äú I guess I 'm old school , you bet . Why does it matter ? Because I 'm trying to teach these kids about some character , and some life skills , ‚Äù said MacKenzie .
‚Äú This is n't about catching a ball ‚Äî it 's about getting along on a team , and about being respectable young people , and to be able to cope in life , because you 're always going to be dealing with rules and people . ‚Äù
He says for the past seven seasons , every kid on his team has agreed to a haircut , to show team spirt , and to look sharp on the field .
‚Äú Now , most of them just show up with their hair already cut , because they know what to expect , and no one has ever complained , ‚Äù said MacKenzie .
‚Äú It 's my team , and my rule . ‚Äù
Liam Nazarek wants to be the exception .
The 16-year-old high schooler with a mane of red hair says he 's growing his locks so he can eventually cut it all off and donate the tresses to cancer wigs . The coach claims Nazarek failed to mention that when first told to visit a barber .
The battle of the bouffant is quickly becoming the talk of southern Alberta , after Liam 's mom , Kimberley Jorgenson , recorded the debate between parent and coach , later posting it to social media .
‚Äú We have come to a decision Kim , that he is not going to be playing for me unless he cuts his hair , ‚Äù MacKenzie tells the mom , as the video begins .
When Jorgenson argues , saying hair length is ‚Äú not part of baseball , ‚Äù the coach counters , ‚Äú it 's part of my baseball , and if you want to coach , there 's the team . ‚Äù
The thing is , Jorgenson does run a team ‚Äî she 's president of the Dolphins Swim Club ‚Äî and in her organization , there are no such rules .
‚Äú I do accept children no matter what they are ‚Äî I 've been running a club for years , and you do n't put demands on you have to have a suit , you have to have a cap , ‚Äù mom tells the coach .
When the subject of the cancer charity comes up , MacKenzie still wo n't budge .
‚Äú I 've said it 's an admirable cause , okay ? You could have mentioned that to me last Thursday night , that it was the reason . I 'm not going to say that it was going to make any difference , but if that was the reason last night , it should have been then too , ‚Äù says the coach .
Jorgenson posted the encounter to Facebook , and from there , the video moved with home run speed , leaving outrage in its wake .
‚Äú That coach is a disgrace to coaching & sport , ‚Äù wrote one supporter , in a typical response .
Jorgenson further explained her position , via a Facebook post .
‚Äú What that coach did tonight and has been trying to this past week is discrimination , ‚Äù she wrote .
‚Äú This is youth baseball . We should be encouraging kids to participate not turning them away because they of how they look . I am proud of Liam for standing up for what he believes in . He is a great leader and role model . ‚Äù
* * *
Liam 's take
Liam Nazarek told The Echo his hair , currently 10 inches long , had to be 12 inches in length before he could donate it to an organization who will in turn make wigs for cancer patients .
`` I tried tying it back , or even putting it in a braid so it was out of the way , but it never really crossed my mind to actually cut it , '' he said .
Nazarek has already paid the league and equipment fees to play for the Dust Devils . He plans to still attend practices .
`` I 'm going to put in the effort and show him I want to play , '' he said .
Coach MacKenize realizes the Dust Devils are not the New York Yankees , but said kids have to learn to follow the rules sometime . . . why not start in little league ?
`` That was my argument , '' said Nazarek . `` This is a public league and anyone should be allowed to play regardless of their race or the length of their hair . ''
Files from Greg Cowan
Someone sent me some shit a couple days ago on Brianna Wu . I do n't mean that it was anything new . Nah , it was the same shit I had been seeing on Twitter that day . But , they suggested that this could make a good write-up for the site . I was thinking the same thing already , truth be told . It 's just that other shit got in my way . It 's 5AM on the East Coast , and I figured ‚Äú what the hell ? ‚Äù Let 's get the morning started off on the right foot by laughing at Brianna Wu 's crazy ass ( I started writing this before my nap . lol ) .
When I say Wu is a nutter , I mean that in the literal sense . John Flynt Brianna is a psychopath .
Let 's take a look back at Wu getting destroyed by 8chan 's Hotwheels , which is the first mention of that creepo I can find on my site‚Ä¶
Throughout her appearances in the stream , she violently swayed back and forth , gesticulated like a insane person , and repeatedly tried to interrupt and bully Mr. Brennan . Oh , did I mention he 's in a wheelchair , thus the name Hotwheels ? I 'm no media expert , but it 's not usually a good look to try to bully a disabled person into giving up his business live on the air . Perhaps Ms. Wu , who appears to have forgotten to take her meds before this appearance , did n't realize the optics of the situation . Conversely , Brennan kept his composure throughout the segment . He was calm , witty , and very funny . Rather than let Troll Queen Wu bait him , he countered her with facts , and hilarious comebacks . If you were a neutral watching this show , Based Hotwheels had to look pretty damn good . Did I mention he was in a hostile house , with no allies ? Yea , Kain was there , but he 's neutral , and barely got to talk anyway . The courage that the leader of 8chan showed was nothing short of inspiring .
More goodness keeps flowing from this time period‚Ä¶
But , as I said , the media wo n't let that happen . So , let 's take an unauthorized look into this craven character . According to reports , she 's a longtime loon ( UPDATE : YouTube has since removed that video , but it was put up again on DailyMotion ) . Keep in mind that these are unverified reports , but you can be the judge . They seem more than credible to me . This message board has some interesting tales to tell about Wu 's past . Again , more crazy :
‚Äú The first time I met him , I was the opinion editor at The DM [ EDITOR 'S NOTE : The Daily Mississippian ] , and I turned to see this creepy fuck standing behind me . I shook his hand , and he pulled it away , saying ‚Äú oowwww. ‚Äù He then explained that he 'd broken his wrist in a bicycle accident that had almost killed him and had given him amnesia . He explained that he wanted to be a columnist and that he had previously worked for George W. Bush in the White House but that he had since realized how retarded and evil all conservatives were . About this time my phone started ringing , and I politely ignored it while I talked to this guy . Then it rang again , and again until I answered . It was the managing editor , who had ducked behind the front desk and was whispering , ‚Äú stay calm , and do n't react to this , but this guy is n't supposed to be here . He has a restraining order . Get rid of him. ‚Äù By this point , I was concerned the guy might knife me at any moment ; so I told him to write me three columns and that I 'd evaluate them and get back to him on whether he could write for me . ( I 'm still proud of my ability to remain poised and convincingly pretend that the dm had any fucking standards . ) Turns out , a year prior , he 'd come in wanting the dm to run a comic strip that he was doing . When he was told they were n't interested , he flipped out . He called one of the workers a fat dyke , and when Dr. Husni came to her defense , he called him a ‚Äú raghead ‚Äù and a ‚Äú sand nigger. ‚Äù They got a restraining order to keep him away from Farley , but when they moved to Bishop , it no longer applied , and he was actually able to weasel back in to working for the SMC . ‚Äù
Take it how you want , but if true , it sure seems like Brianna Wu had quite an interesting undergraduate career . I managed to make it through college without the campus newspaper putting a restraining order out against me .
Yea , almost all the good Wu shit originated with this site and my researchers . That 's a fact . We were breaking stories left and right . This is from the very same day the previous story was posted :
Now , since we 've gotten that our of the way , let me just drop a little bit of knowledge . I 've come across an old LiveJournal of Ms. Wu 's , and I 'd like to share a little sampling with you all . I 've already posted a little bit on Twitter , but here 's a full section :
I do n't especially feel that gays are allies when it comes to women . I think that we usually get along well , but I have occasionally felt that gays see us primarily as competition for the penis . When I watch drag queens , I ca n't help but feel insulted ‚Äì as if that offensive cartoon is what they think feminine truth is there are so many issues women have that gay men never have to think about . Our increased health care costs , equal pay issues , access to reproductive health care and the threat of rape and violence . Concordantly , there are many gay issues that do n't affect me ‚Äì I 've never had to worry that society did n't approve of my sexuality or marriage rights . It does help that our enemies are the same , the fundamentalist conservatives that would deny us the right to make our own choices . The lunatic fringe would deny me the right to make choices about my body , and they 'd just as quickly send the gays off to sexual reeducation camp . We are united against the patriarchal oppressors that think they know what 's best for us .
Wait , there 's more !
Everyone makes fun of Christians , it seems . In fact , the only other group it 's acceptable to slander as much as Christians is fat people . My question to you is this : if we can all agree that it should be off-limits to slander niggers , broads , fags , chinks , wetbacks and nappy-headed hos , why should any of us feel so openly empowered to make fun of Christians ?
To be honest , I have n't had time to comb through this whole thing . If people have n't picked it clean by tomorrow , I may run another story . I just wanted to drop this short tidbit tonight , for those saying we never uncover anything here at TheRalphRetort.com . Of course , those people are full of shit . All you have to do is look at my history . But , keep up the good work , haters . You definitely keep me motivated .
So , after reacquainting yourself with Wu 's craziness from last fall , the question is , has anything at all changed ? I 'm here to tell you the answer : fuck no . Not a single thing has changed . Well , OK , there are a couple of things . Brianna is uglier than ever and appears to be on some heavy anti-psychotic medication . The other thing that strikes me as different ? Wu has clearly gotten accustomed to being an authoritarian mouthpiece . This is now the new career the sick fucker has in mind . Game design ? LOL , that 's for plebs . Plus , it 's so much work ! It 's much easier to just sit back and run your mouth . Hell , I should know .
Take a look at the latest from Wacky Wu , in case you have n't seen it until now . Let 's start with another flashback first , though‚Ä¶
If you 're so fucking scared , why do you keep tagging GamerGate into your crazy bullshit ? You would think that someone who is legitimately scared would stop provoking this supposedly violent mob . It 's almost like you do n't believe your own spin , Wu ! People who are legitimately afraid to do n't behave the way you do , freak . You 're a phony and a fraud , and I 've known that since you first came onto my radar . Anywhere there 's a camera or a sympathetic SJW scumbag reporter , you can be rest assured that the gangly and disgusting Brianna Wu will not be far behind . Nothing has truly changed . Back to the future , indeed . The only new wrinkle in this story is that the headcase has had a touch of fame and is now completely hooked . I do n't think things are going to end well , by the way . Overdose , self-harm‚Ä¶one of any number of things could happen when the attention dries up . I wo n't be shedding any tears , regardless of the outcome . Liars and propagandists hold no special place in my heart . Fuck their existence .
Check out the LIVE show , tonight at 6PM EST . I 'm going on with Co-Host Nora and friends . We 'll be talking about all this week 's news , as well as whatever else comes up during the broadcast . I look forward to it , as always .
Looking for something gourmet to make that not everybody knows how to make from scratch for company , your significant other , or just to brag that you can make it ? How about giving potstickers a try ? They look daunting ( at least they did to me ) but are almost laughingly easy , versatile , and very quick to make .
Here 's how I made them :
Drain the liquid from your firm tofu ( it 's suggested that you leave it for an hour with a plate on top of the tofu with something heavy on top of the plate . I only did this for 10 minutes , though )
heavy on top of the plate . I only did this for 10 minutes , though ) In 1 Tbsp of sesame oil , Fry up garlic , about 6 cloves , 1 Tbsp ginger , and half of an onion .
Add 2 Tbsp soy sauce , 6 small mushrooms and crumbled tofu .
Fry until there is no moisture .
Taste . Does it taste unbelievably yummy ? If not , add whatever you think it needs . Try cillantro , more of an ingredient above , pepper . . . etc .
Get out your wanton wrappers ( round or square ) and lay out .
Fill with about a teaspoon or filling
Brush sides of wanton with water and cornstarch mixture to seal it ( 3:1 ratio )
Close . Continue to do this with about 30 wantons . You can freeze them at this point .
Now here 's how to cook potstickers properly :
Heat up 1 tsp cooking oil in a pan . Drop in 8 wantons . Cook for about three minutes .
Turn and add about 2 Tbsp water . Cover pan to steam . Cook for another three minutes .
Et voila !
Want a sauce to accompany it ? Try mixing crushed garlic ( 1 tsp ) , sesame oil ( 1/2 tsp ) , rice vinegar ( 1/2 tsp ) , honey ( 1/2 tsp ) , lime ( 1/2 tsp ) , and soy sauce ( 2 Tbsp ) . Delicious !

The supply of military vehicles will be carried out as part of Atlantic Resolve operation in order to support American troops in Latvia and ensure rotation of military personnel , as reported by Latvian Defence Ministry .
Latvian Defence Minister Raimonds Vejonis , head of the U.S. embassy in Latvia Sharon Hudson-Dean and U.S. Army General John O'Connor will observe the offloading of military vehicles .
Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia last year and the military aggression in Ukraine , USA has launched the Atlantic Resolve training operation . The goal of the operation is to contribute to NATO member states ' collective security , maintain peace and stability in Baltic States and Poland .
February marked the beginning of a period of active military exercises in Latvia . Soldiers from the USA and other allied countries participate in many national and international military exercises . Bradley and Stryker armoured vehicles and other military vehicles are often seen travelling on Latvian roads to their destinations .

It has become clear that the social media data that I used in my previous forecast became antiquated quite quickly , due to the relatively large margin between the South Carolina estimate and actual result .
Thanks to a good friend 's tip , I began to utilize data from Google Trends to develop new estimates for Super Tuesday . Looking in retrospect , the correlation between the Google data and results in the first four states is striking once one has massaged the data set to produce usable measures ( I use relative search frequency averaged over the couple days prior to the election ) . Demographics are taken into account as well . The new estimates are as follows :
This produces an estimated delegate allocation as follows ( super-delegates are not included in this table ) :
Once we have the data from Super Tuesday , we will all be able to hone the accuracy of our models even further .

Rodrigo Duterte claims issue of thousands of drug war deaths was mentioned ‚Äò only in passing ' in meetings with Rex Tillerson and Julie Bishop
Philippines president says US , Australia have 'toned down ' human rights criticism
The US and Australia have ‚Äú considerably toned down ‚Äù criticism of a drug war in the Philippines in which thousands have been killed , according to the country 's president , Rodrigo Duterte .
During meetings at the presidential palace in Manila , US secretary of state Rex Tillerson and Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop raised the issue of human rights ‚Äú only in passing ‚Äù , Duterte said .
Thousands dead : the Philippine president , the death squad allegations and a brutal drugs war Read more
‚Äú Mostly they have considerably toned down in human rights , ‚Äù he was quoted as saying by the state news agency .
A bloody drug war in which Duterte has said he is ‚Äú happy to slaughter ‚Äù millions of addicts and dismissed the deaths of children as ‚Äú collateral damage ‚Äù has become the most high-profile rights issue in southeast Asia since his inauguration a year ago .
The Philippine state news agency said both diplomats were welcomed back-to-back at the presidential palace on Monday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean ) meeting .
Duterte , nicknamed ‚Äú the Punisher ‚Äù by his supporters for his lethal approach to policing , said his discussion with the officials ‚Äú focused mainly on terrorism ‚Äù , without providing details .
The former prosecutor ‚Äì known for his profanity-laced diatribes in response to criticism ‚Äì has labelled the United Nations ‚Äú stupid ‚Äù and called former US president Barack Obama a ‚Äú son of a whore ‚Äù .
Donald Trump , however , has forged a friendlier relationship , praising Duterte for an ‚Äú unbelievable job ‚Äù in his anti-narcotics campaign .

The US department of state referred the Guardian to Tillerson 's remarks before the meeting in which he told journalists that the US had ‚Äú human rights concerns ‚Ä¶ with respect to how they carry out their counternarcotics activities ‚Äù .
At Duterte 's meeting with Tillerson , the highest-level audience to date with a member of Trump 's administration , the two ignored shouted questions from reporters on human rights .
The Philippine president later said North Korea 's nuclear programme was high on the agenda but reacted angrily when a journalist asked if rights concerns had come up .
‚Äú Human rights , son of a bitch , ‚Äù Duterte said , switching the topic to the southern city of Marawi , where militants who claim allegiance to Isis have taken over neighbourhoods . ‚Äú Policemen and soldiers have died on me . The war now in Marawi , what caused it but drugs ? So human rights , do n't go there . ‚Äù
The US has provided Philippine forces with surveillance , training , planes and drones to help it fight the militants , gangs who have long fought the state and raised funds through kidnap for ransom . The government also accuses them of selling drugs .
A spokesperson for the Australian foreign ministry said human rights were one of many issues discussed . ‚Äú The main focus of the meeting was on the current situation in Marawi City and Australia 's efforts to support the Philippines counter-terrorism efforts , ‚Äù the spokesperson added .
Elaine Pearson , Australia director at Human Rights Watch , said Bishop ‚Äú should have raised her concerns about the drug killings publicly , so that Australia 's position is crystal clear to the people of the Philippines . ‚Äù
She added : ‚Äú It 's obvious that Australia 's ‚Äò quiet diplomacy ' strategy on human rights is failing if Duterte simply brushes aside limply raised concerns . ‚Äù
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Charles Krauthammer 's Washington Post column from this morning on immigration and Barack Obama put me in a bit of a bind . I read it and re-read it a few times to try and nail down the most dishonest passage , or the most glaring instance of political or policy ignorance , but the options were far too many for me to settle on a single one . So , rather than pursue this futile attempt at prioritization , I 'll just go paragraph by paragraph and point out the many , many things Krauthammer gets wrong .
President Obama is impatient . Congress wo n't act on immigration , he says , and therefore he will . The White House is coy as to exactly what the president will do . But the leaks point to an executive order essentially legalizing an enormous new class of illegal immigrants , perhaps up to 5 million people .
Actually , the president has been remarkably patient on immigration reform . He 's been talking up executive action on immigration for a long time now , but he delayed taking action in order to give the House Republicans more time to come up with their own legislation ( which they never did ) . As for the notion that Obama will sign ‚Äú an executive order essentially legalizing an enormous class of illegal immigrants , ‚Äù that 's not actually something he can do . The president can shift priorities for enforcement and shield certain groups from deportation , but he ca n't unilaterally grant anyone legal status , as Krauthammer 's weasel-wordy use of ‚Äú essentially legalizing ‚Äù suggests . That may seem like a distinction without a difference , but changes to the law are much more durable than orders issued by the White House .
Advertisement :
Moving on :
One does n't usually respond to rumors . But this is an idea so bad and so persistently peddled by the White House that it has already been preemptively criticized by such unusual suspects as ( liberal ) constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley , concerned about yet another usurpation of legislative power by the ‚Äú uber presidency , ‚Äù and The Post editorial page , which warned that such a move would ‚Äú tear up the Constitution . ‚Äù
There is no actual proposal from the White House yet . That 's a key point that Krauthammer , the Washington Post editorial board , and others seem determined to ignore when accusing the president of shredding the Constitution .
Continuing :
If this is just a trial balloon , the time to shoot it down is now . The administration claims such an executive order would simply be a corrective to GOP inaction on the current immigration crisis ‚Äî 57,000 unaccompanied minors , plus tens of thousands of families , crashing through and overwhelming the southern border .
No‚Ä¶ the executive action Krauthammer is talking about is , and always has been , a response to the House Republicans ' refusal to take up the Senate 's comprehensive immigration reform bill , or any other immigration reform legislation . The executive action that Obama said he 'd take on the border ‚Äì the actions John Boehner demanded he take ‚Äì pertain to the processing and deportations of those same unaccompanied minors .
This rationale is a fraud .
That 's true ! But only because Krauthammer literally just invented it .
Next :
First , the charge that Republicans have done nothing is plainly false . Last week , the House passed legislation that deals reasonably with this immigrant wave . It changes a 2008 sex-trafficking law never intended for ( and inadvertently inviting ) mass migration ‚Äî a change the president himself endorsed before caving to his left and flip-flopping . It also provides funds for emergency processing and assistance to the kids who are here .
Haha . Okay‚Ä¶ Krauthammer might be the only person on earth who could look at the embarrassing spectacle the House GOP put on last week as it shambled about trying to pass its own border bill and call it a good-faith effort undertaken in the spirit of ‚Äú reason. ‚Äù The House leadership only got the bill passed after caving to the demands of hardline anti-immigrant nativists like Rep. Steve King . The vast majority of funding authorized by the bill goes towards border security , not the processing of the immigrant minors . And it was paired with a bill to end Obama 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which would make hundreds of thousands of DREAMers newly eligible for deportation . It was legislation the Republicans passed simply so they could go back tell their constituents that they did something and not be complete liars .

Anyway , the point Krauthammer arrives at after all this dissembling and lying is that Obama is only taking action on immigration so that he can invite impeachment by the House GOP and thus energize the Democratic base headed into the midterms . Again , Obama 's been imploring House Republicans to pass an immigration bill for over a year now , but Krauthammer snips all that history off so that he can spin a political conspiracy . He also ignores the fact that vulnerable Democratic incumbents oppose executive action on immigration .
That 's a lot of garbage to cram into just one column .
It 's pretty clear by this point that J.K. Rowling just ca n't let Harry Potter go . In addition to frequently posting new material on her Pottermore site ( some of which has been quite badly received ) , she 's written a new play that promises to continue the story of the fateful trio . ‚Äú Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , ‚Äù which premiers July 30th in London , is set 19 years after the events of the last book . According to the New York Times , the play focuses not on Harry , now a Ministry of Magic employee , but on his son Albus Severus , supposedly the ‚Äú cursed child ‚Äù of the title .
So Pottermania is back . But is that such a bad thing ? Harry Potter was already known for reducing medical visits on the days the books came out and perhaps even more good can come out of its vast cultural reach . In an article for PS : Political Science and Politics , Stephen Deets describes how he used Harry Potter to teach politics to undergraduates at Middlebury , an experience that‚Äîif the books ' popularity endures‚Äîmight continue into the future .
Harry Potter can teach students about politics , institutional behavior , globalization , and identity .
Deet argues that Harry Potter , as a defining phenomenon for a generation , brings many advantages to teaching issues such as complex relationships and ethnic tension . He split his topics into three groups : institutional behavior , globalization , and identity . Assuming that everyone had read all the books , he did n't assign readings from Harry Potter itself ( surely a disappointment for students ) , but each week tied together theory readings , a real-world case , and a case from the novels .
The first topic‚Äîidentity‚Äîhad students reading theory about psychological and constructivist theories of identity and communal identity‚Äîand then tying it all back to blood purity , magical hierarchy , and house identity in the books . Students discussed the implications of people being ‚Äú sorted ‚Äù into different houses , and whether the houses caused people 's traits ( like intelligence for Ravenclaw ) to come out or whether ‚Äú naturally ‚Äù intelligent people were sorted into Ravenclaw . Deet notes that the students seemed to grasp these concepts more easily when tasked with discussing the Sorting than when discussing real-life ethnic division and conflict .
The identity segment was tied into the death eaters as well as Hermione 's crusade for house elf rights , while a discussion about the purpose of media in government looked at reporter Rita Skeeter 's role . The topic of globalization was tied into the way the books were translated and perceived differently worldwide as well as , in the book itself , the strange lack of international solidarity in the fight against Voldemort . More difficult to teach were the segments on government and terrorism , which had weaker tie-ins to the Harry Potter world .
Ultimately , while ‚Äú Harry Potter and politics ‚Äù may sound like a gimmick , by using the books as tools ended up in teaching subject topics , the students ended up with more nuanced understandings of the issues . Perhaps a resurgence in Pottermania would n't be so terrible after all .
George , from the Reddings , Cheltenham , was almost twice the weight of an average baby when he was born naturally at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital .
Because his shoulders were so wide he got stuck during delivery and worried doctors gave him just a 10 per cent chance of survival .
He is now 2ft 2in tall and has to wear baby clothes suitable for a six-month-old .
Jade and Ryan say they were left devastated after the traumatic birth because George had been unable to breathe for 20 minutes before he was resuscitated .
However , he beat the odds and made a full recovery after being taken to the special baby unit at St Michael 's Hospital in Bristol .
Five weeks later the couple and their son , who now weighs 16lb 9oz , are settling into family life .
His 21-year-old mother said : `` We were told everything was normal until he popped out . It was scary because his shoulders got stuck and the staff told us he probably would n't survive .
`` But now we are home , we are getting used to family life together . Everyone has said his size will level out and he will grow at a normal rate . ''
EXCLUSIVE : CBS Films has tapped a new scribe to spin its Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark . BAFTA-nominated John August ( Big Fish , Frankenweenie , GO ) will adapt the iconic book series by Alvin Schwartz that had children of the '80s and '90s hearing bumps in the night , penning a new script based on the best-selling spooky story collection .
The three-book children 's series that 's sold more than 7 million copies worldwide began with 1981 's Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark , continuing with More Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark ( 1984 ) and Scary Stories 3 : More Tales To Chill Your Bones ( 1991 ) . The collection of folk tales and urban legends also memorably haunted generations of youngsters with its surreal and nightmarish illustrations by award-winning artist Stephen Gammell .
Sean Daniel and Jason Brown of Sean Daniel Company and Elizabeth Grave of 1212 Entertainment are producing , while Roberto Grande and Joshua Long will executive produce . Mark Ross and Alex Ginno are overseeing for CBS Films .
An earlier iteration of the feature project had Saw 's Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton scripting before producers shifted gears . August is going back to the source material for his take and a director will be the next piece to fall into place . The frequent Tim Burton scribe most recently wrote 2012 's Frankenweenie , which earned an Oscar nom for Best Animated Feature ; he 's repped by UTA and attorney Ken Richman .
The Sean Daniel Company is currently in production on Richard Linklater 's That 's What I 'm Talking About and SyFy 's The Expanse starring Thomas Jane . They 're also in prep on MGM/Paramount 's historical epic Ben-Hur and readying Universal 's The Mummy reboot , which Alex Kurtzman is directing next year .
In the final minute of last Saturday 's UEFA Champions League final between Juventus and Barcelona , the Italian giants introduced 18-year-old Frenchman Kingsley Coman to give the teenager a taste of his first major cup final .
Almost 12 months ago , the versatile attacking talent had been warming the substitutes ' bench at the Parc des Princes . Many times he was not even included in Paris Saint-Germain 's match-day squads , yet last weekend he was featuring in European club football 's most prestigious cup game .
Coman 's debut season in Italy was not exactly a roaring success on paper ; he featured 16 times across all competitions , scored once and provided two assists . However , almost 500 minutes of first-team football in Turin is comfortably more than he was receiving in Paris before last summer 's move and -- realistically -- more than he probably would have got in the campaign just finished had he stayed .
However , a late cameo in the Champions League final alone does not justify Coman 's decision to leave the French capital for northern Italy . The fact that he has been involved in the starting XI on multiple occasions and got to feature -- albeit fleetingly -- in a game of such magnitude will surely give the Bianconeri man a sense of vindication over his decision to quit PSG .
Undoubtedly , a number of Coman 's former teammates and friends from the Ligue 1 giants ' youth academy were watching him attempt to help Juventus claw back a late equaliser . Some , if not most , of those current PSG youngsters were probably asking themselves the same question too ; whether they need to take a similar risk in the near future in order to make the breakthrough at a senior level , with chances at a premium in Paris .
Coman 's is a cautionary tale for Les Parisiens ; a reminder not to take their wonderfully talented youth academy starlets for granted . If this summer 's early action is anything to go by , the capital club 's ability to learn from their past mistakes is going to be tested sooner rather than later .
France is renowned for producing talented young footballers prodigiously and the country 's youth teams are regularly among the best in the world game . The proof of this particular pudding is in the eating too ; the French have taken part in two youth tournaments in the past six weeks and won both .
The under-17s secured their second UEFA European Championship crown and the under-20s bagged an impressive 12th Toulon tournament title as recently as last weekend , the day after Coman was trotting onto the Olympiastadion pitch in Berlin for Juventus .
Had he not been involved in the Champions League final , the Frenchman probably would have been a part of Ludovic Batelli 's triumphant side . Instead , it was some of Coman 's former teammates and fellow homegrown PSG gems that helped to secure both international successes .
Les Parisiens boasted four members of the French under-17 side that won the Euro title and Odsonne Edouard , a talented 17-year-old striker , scored eight goals en route to the title . Defenders Alec Georgen and Mamadou Doucoure , as well as versatile attacker Nanitamo Jonathan Ikone , were the other representatives . Doucoure scored once , while Ikone bagged three goals .
Kingsley Coman made just three Ligue 1 appearances with PSG before departing for Juventus .
Those PSG players scored all but just two of Les Bleuets ' 15 total goals . Although the Ligue 1 champions ' contribution towards Toulon success was not quite as telling as it was in the under-17 European Championship , the French capital outfit 's representatives still played a significant role .
Romain Habran caught the eye with a stunning long-range missile of a strike against the Netherlands in the final group stage match . He scored one more , assisted another and then got himself sent off in the space of 10 crazy second half minutes of a feisty 3-1 final win over Morocco .
The 20-year-old spent the recent season on loan at Ligue 2 side FC Sochaux-Montbeliard and featured regularly . Habran might not be far from being a realistic option for PSG coach Laurent Blanc , while Presnel Kimpembe -- who has already made his senior debut -- and Jordan Diakiese were also part of France 's Toulon squad .
On top of those in youth tournament action this summer , PSG already possess highly rated attacking talent Jean-Kevin Augustin -- who signed is first professional contract with the club through to 2018 back in February .
Another youth academy graduate , Jean-Christophe Bahebeck , was under-used last season , while excellent young goalkeeper Alphonse Areola spent a second season out on loan . The prodigiously gifted and frustratingly precocious 20-year-old midfielder , Adrien Rabiot , is the only youth academy graduate currently featuring on a regular basis in Blanc 's starting XI .
In the current situation under PSG 's ambitious Qatari owners though , it is not as easy for a coach to promote from within -- as it was when the likes of celebrated youth products Mamadou Sakho and Clement Chantome burst through the ranks . However , this summer has already proved that PSG are still creating plenty of fantastic young talent , even if it is more difficult for these gifted youngsters to work their way to the top . What the club must do now is recognise the achievements of some of these teenagers -- particularly the prolific Edouard -- and actively look to fast-track them into the first team squad .
It is unlikely that all of PSG 's young talents will make the grade , but the French champions wanted to keep hold of Coman and failed to convince him of their intentions to develop him into a future homegrown star .
Les Parisiens have a chance to atone for that error in judgement by identifying the top talents ahead of time and convincing the likes of Edouard , Augustin , Habran and Kimpembe that they can realise their potential at Parc des Princes -- and then help them accomplish that .

We 've seen a lot of clever responses to the spine-twisting , butt-baring poses so many female comic book characters are subjected to , but the Hawkeye Initiative is particularly fun . Their mission : to take those particularly awful poses and replace the female characters with Hawkeye .
Why Hawkeye ? It seems it all began when artist Blue decided to switch the poses and positions of Hawkeye and the Black Widow on one of their comic book covers :

Then Blue and Noelle Stevenson ( also known as Gingerhaze and creator of the fabulous webcomic Nimona threw a challenge out to Tumblr : fix those `` Strong Female Character '' poses by replacing them with Hawkeye doing the same thing . And the Hawkeye Initiative Tumblr was born . Granted , the poses are n't always exact copies ; the contributors are having a bit of silly fun and tend to give Hawkeye but sparkles or make him mug for the camera . But it 's always interesting to see artists recontextualize a female pose with a male character .
I posted a few of the entries below . You can see more at the Hawkeye Initiative .

The Limits of the CAP Theorem
The CAP theorem is a fundamental part of the theory of distributed systems . It states that in the presence of partitions ( i.e . network failures ) , a system can not be both consistent and available , and must choose one of the two .
CockroachDB chooses consistency , and is therefore a CP system in the terminology of the CAP theorem ( as opposed to an AP system , which favors availability over consistency ) . Both consistency and availability are crucial to any business , and you might wonder how you are expected to choose between such important goals .
In this post I 'll explain how CAP-Consistent systems can still be highly available , how the CAP theorem applies to CockroachDB , and why consistency is the better choice for most databases .
High Availability
The CAP theorem defines availability in strict binary terms : a system is either CAP-Available or it is not . However , in the language of high availability and service level agreements , the term ‚Äú availability ‚Äù is also used , but it describes a continuum instead of a binary condition .
A system might guarantee that it is available 99.99 % of the time ( ‚Äú four nines ‚Äù , allowing for less than an hour of downtime per year ) ; 100 % availability is generally regarded as unrealistic ; engineering for high availability requires estimating the likelihood and severity of different kinds of outages , and balancing that against the cost of mitigating them .
A CAP-Consistent system will sometimes be unavailable due to network partitions . But all systems , even CAP-Available ones , will sometimes be unavailable for all kinds of reasons . In a well-run network there is no reason to believe that the kind of partitions where CAP tradeoffs are relevant will be any more common than other kinds of outages .
Dr . Brewer has gone so far as to say that partitions in Google 's network are so rare that the Spanner database is ‚Äú technically CP ‚Äù but ‚Äú effectively CA ‚Äù . This claim muddies the waters around this already-confusing subject , but it does illustrate that the loss of availability implied by the CAP theorem matters only within a narrow margin .
Making the Right Tradeoffs
Distributed systems engineering is full of tradeoffs , with tensions between a variety of concerns including consistency , availability , performance , and flexibility . The CAP theorem focuses on a single narrow tradeoff between consistency and availability , but this does n't cover all the causes of or solutions to unavailability .
Outages can be caused by a variety of factors that the CAP theorem does n't consider , such as single-node hardware failure , application bugs , or operator error . And when the system is considered as a whole , even network partitions can be handled in ways that increase availability without sacrificing consistency . Choosing CAP-Availability buys very little in effective availability , but the loss of consistency pushes a significant amount of complexity into the application code and has a high price in engineering effort .
For example , consider an application deployed across three datacenters , with client traffic load balanced across all three . If one of those datacenters is knocked offline by a network failure , client traffic directed to the offline datacenter would experience an outage whether the underlying database is CAP-Consistent or CAP-Available . When the load balancer is updated to direct traffic to the live datacenters ( which can be based on automated health checks ) , service is restored , no matter how the underlying database handles the partition .
The only time that a CAP-Available system would be available when a CAP-Consistent one would not is when one of the datacenters ca n't talk to the other replicas , but can talk to clients , and the load balancer keeps sending it traffic . By considering the deployment as a whole , high availability can be achieved without the CAP theorem 's requirement of responses from a single partitioned node .
If the increase in availability in a CAP-Available system is small , then why choose one over a CAP-Consistent one ? One reason is write latency : consistent systems must coordinate between different nodes during writes to provide that consistency ( and depending on the system , consistent reads may also incur higher coordination costs ) . Since inconsistent systems allow for the possibility of missing data , they can return responses more quickly . This may be an appropriate choice for applications where speed is more important than robustness .
CAP in CockroachDB
CockroachDB is a CAP-Consistent ( CP ) system : each piece of data lives on at least three replicas , and writes require that a majority of those replicas are able to communicate with each other . For reads , one of those replicas is granted a lease , or temporary ownership of a range of data , that allows it to serve reads without communicating with the others for a few seconds . In the event that the leaseholder is partitioned away from the other replicas , it will be allowed to continue to serve reads ( but not writes ) until its lease expires ( leases currently last 9 seconds by default ) , and then one of the other two replicas will get a new lease ( after waiting for the first replica 's lease to expire ) . This ensures that the system recovers quickly from outages , maximizing availability even though it does not satisfy the CAP theorem 's all-or-nothing definition of availability .
CockroachDB 's foundation of strong consistency is what makes it possible to offer a distributed database with the expected guarantees of a traditional non-distributed SQL database while still being a highly available system . Without consistency , application developers would have to work around surprising behavior like secondary indexes that do n't have all the data ( or that have pointers to records that have n't been replicated yet ) , or deal with the potential loss of data when a node fails .
For most applications , a CAP-Consistent database like CockroachDB is often the better choice , despite potentially longer latencies , because it offers a simple contract to the application developer :
The most recent write is always visible to subsequent readers ( single register linearizability ) .
Other developers can not compromise an app 's consistency with optional write settings .
In the event of partitions , the system will block rather than return inconsistent data .
Movienomics : How do you know when a Jason Statham movie will be good 2.0 ?
A while back I was working on a post about explosions and movie posters and one person kept popping up . As I scoured through 266 action movie posters from 2000-2013 , I noticed that Jason Statham has had quite the poster personality evolution . Jason Statham has been kicking butt for well over a decade and his posters tell a story . For instance , he started off looking blue-collar and transformed into a suave man who wears a suit and shoots two guns whilst jumping in the air .
There is a pattern afoot and I 've figured out how to gauge whether a Stath film is going to be good or not . I 've compiled 34 of his posters ( the main theatrical posters ) and put them through the data wringer . I broke down the posters to various Stath coats/outfits and found a world-changing discovery ( not really ) .
Sidenote : The following research was done out of a love of randomness . The causation and correlation can not be proved but I found the results to be intriguing , cheeky and fun .
The Average Rotten Tomatoes score for all Stath films is 41.35 % and the Audience Score is 56.38 %
Overcoat posters = 70.25 % RT Score/78 % Audience Score . When Stath wears an overcoat on a poster the results are 28.9 % and 21.62 % higher than the average . The totals are understandable because three out of the four overcoat films are really good ( Mechanic is garbage ) . It also shows that critics and audiences enjoy Statham as an everyday bloke who speaks more than monosyllabic sentences . Lock Stock , Snatch , Mechanic , Bank Job .
Suit/Cardigan/Jacket posters = 41.275 % RT Score/52 % Audience Score . Crank and Transporter buoyed this score because they were solid films that were n't wrecked by the Statham suit persona . The rest of these films are a hodge podge of random action films . Crank , Safe , Redemption , Revolver , Chaos , Transporter 1-3 , 13 , Parker , Homefront , Cellular , Blitz , Italian Job , Crank 2 , London , Killer Elite , Wilcard
Military Garb = 40 % RT Score/51 % Audience Score The one thing I find interesting about this list is that Expendables 2 was certified fresh on RT ( 65 % ) . Nowadays people love to hate on the sequel . Expendables 1-3 , Ghost of Mars .
Not on Poster = 32.5 % RT Score . Pink Panther , The One , Collateral , Turn it Up
Medieval Garb = 4 % RT Score . Do not watch In the Name of the King . Listen to this podcast though .
One piece jumpsuits = 38.5 % RT Score Death Race , Mean Machine
Keep your eye out for overcoats because good things happen when he wears the long coats ! When Statham has a new movie coming out look at the posters and let me know on Twitter ( @ MoviesFilmsFlix ) , Facebook ( https : //www.facebook.com/moviesfilmsandflix ) or on this post . Will the upcoming movies Fast 7 or Spy lift his suit poster score ?
After a lower back strain kept him out of last weekend 's practices , New Orleans Saints tight end David Thomas returned to the field for Tuesday morning 's practice .
Thomas said he `` definitely '' feels 100 percent .
`` It was nice to get back out there , '' he said . `` It was kind of frustrating to not be out there the last few days , but I feel a lot better and I 'm excited to get back to work . ''
This injury was just one in a long line of issues that have derailed Thomas in recent years .
When he arrived in New Orleans in 2009 , Thomas had no problem staying healthy . He started 15 games during the regular season and three postseason games . In 2010 , he was out for a short time with a knee injury , but still started 13 times .
But in 2011 , he sat out for the majority of the season with two concussions , one that forced him to sit out five games and another that landed him on the injured reserve and caused him to miss the last eight games of the season .
Thomas played in five games and finished the season with five receptions for 16 yards . It was Thomas ' least productive season since 2007 , when he was placed on the injured reserve list in early October with a foot injury .
`` I would n't be out here if I was worried about it , '' he said . `` That was part of the reason I wanted to be so thorough with the decision . At this point , I 've moved on and I 'm just excited to get going . ''
Interim Saints coach Joe Vitt praised Thomas ' ability to block as well as catch the ball , saying Thomas is `` probably the most versatile offensive player that we have . ''
Vitt also lauded Thomas ' leadership skills during minicamp earlier this summer , saying younger players would be stupid not to look up to him . Thomas is n't the most vocal of players , though .
`` I 've always just been more of a lead by example kind of guy , '' he said . `` As I 've gotten older , I 've kind of realized that the young guys are always looking for help , they 're always looking for knowledge and I feel like I 've got a little bit . I do n't have all the answers , but I try to help out the guys with what I do know . It 's exciting to see so many guys making progress . ''
When he was a young player looking for advice , Thomas learned from tight ends Daniel Graham and Ben Watson while he was in New England .
`` Those guys never held back anything from me , even though the reality is that everybody is fighting for jobs , '' he said . `` I just try to take that approach to help him to be the best player he can be and for me to be my best and we can both help the team that way . ''
Thomas emphasized how important it is for each player on the team to know his role and execute it .
`` I think everybody 's just looking to do their job , '' he said . `` I 've never really thought about how I lead . Just try to do my job and if that means I 'm being a good leader , then so be it . ''
Dear Shohei ,
I am a Mariner fan and have been since I was born . Being a Mariner is in my blood . The moment that cemented my love for baseball - and the Mariners - was in the 1995 American League Division Series . My father tells me stories about how excited I was listening to the radio as Edgar Martinez hit `` The Double '' that drove in Ken Griffey Junior and sent us to the Division Championship . I was five years old .
I am 26 years old now . I have idolized many great Mariners in my short life ; Griffey . Martinez . Moyer . Sasaki . Ichiro . Hernandez . I have also seen my team achieve amazing things and go through significant struggles . I watched us win 116 games and tie the league record in 2001 , only to have our hearts broken when we were eliminated in the league championship . I will never forget watching Ichiro play that season , and going on to win the MVP , Rookie of the Year , Gold Glove , and Silver Slugger Awards . It was the greatest season in Mariners history , and we have not been to the postseason since then . Mariner fans maintain a hope that someday , a star will emerge and lead us to the end of our postseason drought , to a division championship , and to our first World Series trophy .
I , and many other Mariner fans , hoped you would be that player . To say you are exciting to baseball fans is an understatement ; you have quite literally captivated the baseball world in a way that has never happened before . Mariner fans have always felt connected in a special way to Japanese players , and you are no different ; we truly believed you would have led Seattle to great things . To find out that you have decided to join the Angels was heartbreaking .
I was once taught a Japanese word that I have found poignant throughout this whole process . The word is ikigai - a person 's `` reason for being '' . In America , we sometimes use the phrase `` the thing that wakes you up in the morning '' . For myself , and many Mariner fans , you have been our ikigai . I have woken many mornings , and before anything else , checked to see if there were any updates on your journey . Now , your journey is both complete , and just beginning .
As a Mariner fan ... I now have the solemn duty to hope that each day we meet , we are able to defeat you . I hope , for my team 's sake , that you encounter struggles and challenges . I hope the road is not easy for you .
But as a baseball fan and a lover of this great game ... I hope you are wildly successful . I hope you have many learning experiences , overcome many challenges , and develop many friendships . I hope you achieve the greatness we all know you are capable of . I look forward to watching you play this game , wherever it may lead you .
Thank you for being , for a time , our ikigai . I wish you all the worst ... and all the best .
Sincerely ,
Seth Morgan
Big Brother quizzes for new school parents : Officials launch 83-point probe into families ' lives
Parents of five-year-olds starting school have been sent an 83-point questionnaire that probes personal details of their lives .
It asks whether their children tell lies or bully others , and if they steal at home or from shops .
Parents are questioned over whether they have friends , if they can speak freely with others in their family and how well they did at school themselves .
Parents of five-year-olds starting school have been sent an 83-point questionnaire that probes personal details of their lives such as how well they did at school themselves ( file photo )
The form also delves into family routines , questioning whether they eat takeaways and if the children drink water with their meals .
Thousands of families in Lincolnshire were sent the forms as part of trials of a 'Healthy Child Programme ' being developed in Whitehall .
The Department of Health wants all families in England and Wales to fill in similar forms .
The information will be held indefinitely on NHS databases for the use of health workers . Planners want new forms submitted each year to build up a detailed picture of the family and their children 's development .
Children themselves will fill in questionnaires when they become old enough .
The aim is to 'enhance children 's life chances ' but critics warned of unprecedented intrusion into family life and the growth of a major new state database .
Parents have been told the information is 'confidential ' but it will be available to health workers who will decide whether families should be approached by health visitors offering 'support ' .
It will also be used to identify districts with widespread health and social problems so officials can plan and target health campaigns .
There is no legal compulsion to fill in the School Entry Wellbeing Review forms , but parents who do not are likely to be visited by community nurses charged with identifying vulnerable families .
Dylan Sharpe of the Big Brother Watch pressure group said : 'This is incredibly intrusive and asks questions which , quite frankly , Lincolnshire Community Health Services do not need to know and have no right knowing .
'Even worse , the NHS Trust has failed to make it clear that this is a voluntary questionnaire . I would advise any parent receiving this to stick it straight in the bin . '
Jill Kirby of the centre-right think tank Centre for Policy Studies said : 'This is badly wrong for a number of reasons .
'Parents are not told how the information will be used , nor that they can refuse to give it and it will create worry and suspicion among many families .
'It risks labelling children and families as problem cases when the aim should be to help children escape from difficult backgrounds . It will make families wary and those most in need of help are likely to retreat from it . '
Joy Wood , clinical team leader at Lincolnshire Community Health Services , said shorter questionnaires had been sent in previous years .
This year 's trial was intended to help identify vulnerable children .
She said : 'The intention is that the children that need our services will be supported . We are not keeping this information to be divulged to third parties . '
After a complaint from a parent , letters are being sent out making it clear that filling in the form is voluntary .
The Department of Health said last night : 'Many local areas currently administer a questionnaire to parents as the basis for a review at school entry .
'The Healthy Child Programme includes the commitment to build on good practice to make available a standardised , evaluated version .
'We will ensure this complies with legal requirements in relation to data handling and approaches to encourage take-up .
The Berlin Wall has now been 'down ' for longer than it was in place . Its failure at the end of the Eighties led to the reunification of Germany and a mass exodus of humanity into the West , but it was more than just people that crossed the border ‚Äì the cars of East Germany came too , spluttering and smoking through the rubble of the Iron Curtain .
During the Cold War the West became a symbol of freedom , the East a byword for repression . While US servicemen had the run of West Germany in whatever glitzy automotive product out of Detroit took their fancy , the delights of personal mobility in the East took the form of the Trabant , commonly nicknamed ‚Äú Trabbi ‚Äù . It was cheap to build and run , but invariably only available to favoured Party members rather than the populace at large .
We 've all heard the stories ‚Äì the long waiting list after ordering , a dipstick instead of a proper petrol gauge , extra heating provided by a rug under the back seat . The image that springs to mind is of East Berlin streets choking with fumes from the two-stroke engines of Trabants . No point taking colour photos , because everything was so grey . But is that really so ?

Review title of Morgan
This app is the best I 've come across for music . It will actually play music ( unlike the Music App for Windows Phones ) , and it allows you to skip around to whatever song you 'd like and see what songs ahead , along with the lyrics ( if they 're available , many foreign songs do n't have them if it 's not a well-known song ) . Though I only have a couple complaints : when I play it and lock my screen , the music turns off within an hour , sometimes the next song refuses to play , so I have to restart the app , but my biggest complaints are it drains battery life so much . Usually my phone would last from 9 am to about 7-8 pm , but with this app , I 'm lucky for it to last until 2-3 pm without needing to scramble for a charger . But it 's worth it if you 'd like an app that can play Pandora radio and not require you to listen to ads or limit your skips all the time .
Matt Lauer interviewing Hillary Clinton in September 2016 . Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images
Before Matt Lauer 's name was added to the ever-expanding list of powerful media men reported to be serial sexual harassers , his uneven treatment of the presidential candidates‚Äîone an alleged sexual harasser and the other the first female major party nominee‚Äîduring a September 2016 ‚Äú Commander in Chief Forum ‚Äù drew the ire of none other than Hillary Rodham Clinton . In her memoir What Happened , Clinton 's tone took on the type of scorn usually reserved for now-president Donald Trump as she described how the Today show host dogged her about her emails and then tossed Trump easy questions . ‚Äú Trump , ‚Äù the former Secretary of State wrote , ‚Äú should have reported [ Lauer 's ] performance as an in-kind contribution . ‚Äù
Remembering how severe matt lauer 's interview w/ H Clinton was , asking her questions and not letting her finish answers vs how chummy his was w/ Trump & you begin to realize why these men , of course , get along ‚Äî Marcia Belsky ( @ MarciaBelsky ) November 29 , 2017
The grievances with Lauer that Clinton aired‚Äîand several critics , from Trevor Noah to Siri Hustvedt , echoed last fall‚Äîinclude Lauer 's fixation on her emails at the price of asking substantial foreign policy questions and his failure to contest Trump 's lie about opposing the Iraq War . Clinton also called out a textbook case of casually sexist behavior : ‚Äú Lauer interrupted me before I began answering , ‚Äù she wrote , and called the entire interview a ‚Äú waste of time . ‚Äù
Just a reminder that Matt Lauer is one of many journalists whose terrible performance in 2016 enabled the rise of Donald Trump . https : //t.co/aNKZIIBi0S ‚Äî Ian Millhiser ( @ imillhiser ) November 29 , 2017
NBC News fired Lauer from Today after the network received a formal complaint of workplace harassment ; in a memo to employees , executive Andrew Lack said there was suspicion that ‚Äú this may not have been an isolated incident. ‚Äù But we ca n't retroactively go back and scrub Lauer 's influence from the past years of political coverage . He may have been a morning show host rather than a hardnosed investigative reporter , but like Mark Halperin or Glenn Thrush , he has still helped shaped the narrative . ‚Äú I was almost physically sick , ‚Äù wrote Clinton in What Happened , reflecting on the imbalanced interview ; her words feel even more apt now .
BuzzFeed may be the quintessential digital-media company , but it looks increasingly like it will wind up being a subsidiary of Comcast-owned media and entertainment behemoth NBCUniversal .
According to multiple reports , NBC is close to investing another $ 200 million in the company . Both the Wall Street Journal and Recode say the investment is being finalized now , and that it will value BuzzFeed at about $ 1.7 billion .
That number may seem large , and it is , especially for a company so reliant on advertising revenue . But it 's about the same size as the theoretical valuation BuzzFeed had a year ago , when NBCUniversal ( CMCSA ) originally invested $ 200 million .
The fact that BuzzFeed 's valuation has n't increased in a year suggests that the company has not grown enough to justify a higher number . And there were reports earlier this year that it missed its revenue targets for 2015 .
Get Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter .
Despite that alleged miss , if it in fact occurred ( the company has refused to confirm those reports ) , NBCUniversal is clearly still interested in owning more of BuzzFeed .
The reason for that is the same as the rationale behind NBCUniversal 's investment in Vox Media , which also got $ 200 million a year ago . NBC 's existing media business is based on traditional formats such as broadcast television , and it needs a hedge against the digital disruption of those markets and that business model .
Disney ( DIS ) is in much the same boat , which is why there are always rumors about the media and entertainment giant acquiring Twitter or some other digital media business .
Since the initial investment , NBCUniversal and BuzzFeed have embarked on a number of partnerships , including the latter producing video clips during the Summer Olympics .
Once this investment in BuzzFeed closes , assuming it does , NBCUniversal will own approximately $ 400 million worth of a company whose total value is in the $ 1.5-billion range . That gives the Comcast unit close to a third of BuzzFeed .
Although we do n't know what the specific terms of the investment are , or what rights they give NBC , owning that much of the digital-media outlet could give the Comcast subsidiary a significant amount of say in how BuzzFeed expands its business , or even if it expands .
It also raises the possibility that NBCUniversal could just acquire the entire thing . On the record , BuzzFeed says that it wants to remain independent . But every company says that until they get an acquisition offer .
Introducing Google 's Pixel phone . Watch :
If BuzzFeed is hitting the limits of growth for whatever reason , it will need to find some way of fixing that . Either it will have to acquire something itself , which is always a possibility , or it will have to find significant investment elsewhere , or it will have to be acquired by someone with the resources it needs .
BuzzFeed recently reorganized , splitting the company into a news unit and a video unit , which appeared to be another step in the site 's aggressive focus on video . In order to grow that business even further , it would need a substantial amount of capital .
Not only that , but BuzzFeed 's existing major investors ‚Äî RRE Ventures , Lerer Hippeau , General Atlantic‚Äîwill want a payday at some point . All investors do , and especially venture-capital investors .
That payday will either have to come via a funding round they can use to cash in ( which some may do with this latest investment ) , or they will need an initial public offering , or they will need an acquisition . And NBCUniversal is by far the most likely candidate .

This is a simple story , but one that illustrates cultural competency and respect by a LGBTQ organization .
Earlier this year , TransPride Pittsburgh announced plans for their annual TransPride Pride Week and weekend conference , set for the end of September . The weekend conference was scheduled to have a professional day on Friday September 29 , a community day of workshops on Saturday , September 30 and social activities on Sunday , October 1 .
The problem is that Yom Kippur , one of the holiest day of the year for the Jewish community , begins at sunset on Friday September 29 and continues through Saturday September 30 .
Yom Kippur ( ; [ 2 ] Hebrew : ◊ô◊ï÷π◊ù ◊õ÷¥÷º◊ô◊§÷º◊ï÷º◊®‚Äé , IPA : [ Ààjom kiÀàpu Å ] , or ◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊î◊õ◊ô◊§◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù‚Äé ) , also known as the Day of Atonement , is the holiest day of the year in Judaism . [ 3 ] Its central themes are atonement and repentance . Jewish people traditionally observe this holy day with an approximate 25-hour period of fasting and intensive prayer , often spending most of the day in synagogue services .
This has been a problem in other regions such as Charlotte , North Carolina which scheduled their LGBTQ Pridefest over this same weekend , the final weekend of September . Charlotte organizers made some accommodations to their schedule , but it took over a month to craft a solution of moving events to the evening which is imperfect at best . Some local Jewish LGBTQ folks in Charlotte have repeatedly asked for the event to be moved to Sunday October 1 , expressing frustration and dismay over the entire situation .
It took Pittsburgh TransPride organizers a few days after community members brought this to their attention . The Pittsburgh event schedule now wraps up the professional training on Friday before sunset and moved all of the Saturday activities to another date entirely , the previous weekend 's September 23 .
So now TransPride week starts with a community conference day and ends with the professional training day with weekday activities in-between . You can find the current schedule of events here . Co-chair Lyndsey Sickler told us :
It was an unintentional oversight that we had our original community conference date set on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar year , Yom Kippur . When a community member made us aware of this , we worked quickly to remedy it . It is important that these events be accessible to all members of our community . We will be more aware in the future to make sure we do not repeat the same mistake .
Scheduling conflicts are certainly a reality . Pittsburgh 's LGBTQ Film Festival has been running for over 30 years and has still run into other groups organizing competing events , most notably Highmark in 2014 and by Row House Cinema and the Feminist Zine Conference organizers in 2015 . No one intended any harm , but fast forward to 2017 and I do n't see Highmark , Row House Cinema or the Feminist Zine Conference investing in the film festival to offset the harm they caused or demonstrate good faith moving forward .
And there 's a world of difference between a scheduling conflict among similar events and a scheduling conflict with a significant religious holiday that will literally prevent people from attending or having to choose between aspects of their identity .
You can argue that scheduling conflicts are in large part due to Pittsburgh having no central calendar resource for event planners to consult . You ca n't argue that about Yom Kippur or other holy days that can be found on almost every calendar . Even Google calendars has a feature to see significant holidays . But even if the mistake is due to ignorance and a lack of malice , there 's a need for organizations to take responsibility for their mistakes ‚Äì even if that means a financial blow .
This year has been witness to several distressing incidents involving the LGBTQ community and Jewish folks , including a high-profile decision by the Chicago Dyke March . Recently in Pittsburgh , a white supremacist with a violent background was caught distributing anti-Semitic literature in Squirrel Hill , home to many Jewish people . This past February , a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia was vandalized , causing damage to dozens of headstones .
So it is refreshing to see a Pittsburgh organization hold themselves accountable for a mistake that was hurtful to members of our community , take steps to correct the error , and make a commitment to be more mindful moving forward .
Every group could benefit from a mindful planning process . Taking a look at calendars should be part of the accessible to all component of planning . A tool that could be a big help with this is a centralized community events calendar that is accessible online and well-maintained . It is a lot of work , but why not secure some funding to compensate someone for their time to do this work ? 5-10 hours a week at $ 15/hour ( fair wages matter ) is about $ 4,000/annually . Sounds like a good way for Highmark to step in with a multi-year grant that would have obvious health and wellness benefits for the entire community . If its hosted by Persad Center website or the Pgh Center for Equality , there would be minor webhosting fees . I 'd offer to host it , but that 's not a good idea in terms of my political bent .
Just a thought on how to invest in a tool to reduce mistakes based on the lack of information , a process that can help us get closer to wrestling with the very real impact of anti-Semitism and other erasures within the LGBTQ community .
If you live long enough , you 're liable to see anything . Today , we saw Sen. John McCain ( R ‚Äì AZ ) , who for the past 11 years has been the gold standard of hawkishness on the Afghan occupation , a tireless support of escalation upon escalation , finally raise the prospect of leaving .
‚Äú I think all options ought to be considered , including whether we have to just withdraw early , rather than have a continued bloodletting that wo n't succeed , ‚Äù McCain said in surprise comments today .
McCain 's comments reflect a growing weariness of the occupation , particularly as the growing number of green-on-blue attacks force the US to halt the training missions that for the past decade were supposed to be the ticket to victory .
Despite McCain 's shift , both President Barack Obama and his opponent in November , Mitt Romney , remain roughly identical in their positions on Afghanistan , which is to stay the course .

Michele Bachmann 's high-profile debate coach , Brett O'Donnell , developed an `` unnatural '' and `` Rasputin-like '' relationship with his candidate during her failed 2012 presidential campaign , another former aide told BuzzFeed , a charge O'Donnell denies .
Peter Waldron , an evangelical organizer who served as Iowa field coordinator for Bachmann and helped her win the Ames straw poll said O'Donnell exercised an `` unusual power over Mrs . Bachmann . '' Waldron and other former Bachmann staff also currently say the Congresswoman has yet to pay them for debts owned from her short-lived campaign .
`` He prohibited her husband , Dr. Marcus Bachmann , from sleeping in the same room with wife while on the campaign trail , '' Waldron said in an email to BuzzFeed . `` He prohibited legendary consultants Ed Rollins and Ed Goeas from attending debate prep sessions . He told her when she could get off the bus ( Waterloo event with Gov . Perry ) , he wrote most of the words that came out of her mouth , he wrote all of her speeches . ''
Waldron , who led Bachmann 's outreach to the religious groups that helped fuel an early surge in Iowa and bring voters to the Ames Straw Poll , is a veteran of Republican politics and a colorful character in his own right . An Army veteran who says he leads an organization called Christians Restoring America 's Greatness , he spent a month in jail in Uganda in 2002 , on terror charges that he denied .
`` Your source for your outrageous claim is a disgruntled campaign employee who has little knowledge of reality , '' O'Donnell said in an email . `` Why is this news now anyway ? ''
`` The story is completely false , '' he said .
Waldron , who was among a wave of staffers pushed to the sidelines as O'Donnell emerged as a central adviser , blamed him for her flagging campaign .
`` Frankly , Brett exercised 'Rasputin-like control over Michele . More than one staffer was grateful to God that she did n't win the nomination because of the influence that Brett had over her , '' Waldron said .
`` He attempted to re-shape Mrs. Bachmann 's personality from her popular 2010 to spring 2011 into his own image , '' he said . `` Pastors in IA and SC complained to me privately that Mrs. Bachmann spent too much time alone with Brett , they even criticized the times the two of them held hands to pray apart from others . Brett resented Mrs. Bachmann 's confidence in me . ''
Waldron said that at the time , Bachmann appeared to even be fearful of O'Donnell .
`` Once she asked me to ride on the bus with her to pray . Brett 's objection was so intense that for the good of the order , I followed the bus in my personal vehicle , '' said Waldron . `` On one occasion , she whispered to me , 'Peter , do n't get off the bus no matter who tells you to get off . ' Another time , her personal assistant told me , 'Peter , Michele does not want to you leave . Stay on the bus . Please pray for us . ' ''
Waldron described the last week of Bachmann 's failed campaign as `` the most painful days to imagine , '' saying Bachmann still has not recovered from her time with O'Donnell .
`` Brett held her captive day after day , speech after speech , etc . in the back of the bus during the 99-county tour . By the end , she was broken emotionally , mentally , and slept in her private cabin in the back of the bus . I do not know if she has ever recovered , '' Waldron said .
Waldron , a veteran of Republican Christian outreach , said O'Donnell 's control over Bachmann was like something he has `` never seen before in any campaign . ''
`` Most presidential candidates have strong personalities , not Mrs. Bachmann , she outsourced decision making to Brett . She was for all intents and purposes `` mesmerized '' by Brett O'Donnell . ''
Bachmann spokesman Dan Kotman and two former Bachmann campaign aides did not respond to emails seeking the former candidate 's version of the story .
[ Update ]
James Pollack , Michele Bachmann 's campaign finance chair emails : `` Mr. Waldron 's accusatory inferences regarding the Congresswoman are both inaccurate and meritless . His outrageous embellishments of the reality of what transpired are not deserving of further comment . Further defamations by Mr. Waldron will be dealt with accordingly . ''
I do n't know much about Mixed Martial Arts or UFC , but I do know a rough sport when I see one . And yet all I need to know is that when it 's a contest between consenting adults , we can leave the enthusiasts alone to enjoy it .
After the high profile UFC fight in Melbourne , when Holly Holm knocked out Ronda Rousey , there has been a predictable backlash from Australia 's public health wowsers . I say it is predictable , because some people can not walk past any event where people are having a good time without wanting to shut it down .
Perhaps UFC is a dangerous competition , but to date I understand there have been no fatalities . This is more than can be said for nearly any other sport you can think of . We regularly hear of people dying during fun runs , playing squash , cycling , yachting or even playing golf . And let 's not mention rugby scrums .
However , you 'll never hear doctors ' unions like the Australian Medical Association coming out against these sports , because they are also doctors ' pastimes . The doctors will tell you they object to boxing and mixed martial arts because hitting someone is the objective of these sports . But it seems the doctors ' objective is to prevent working class people from doing something of which they simply disapprove .
In the heart of every supporter of the nanny state is a belief that they know better , an affliction from which many doctors suffer . But as we are hearing in evidence in the Senate 's nanny state inquiry , regulations are just as often counter-productive . We have heard compelling evidence , for example , that making bicycle helmets compulsory has discouraged many Australians from riding bikes altogether , which ultimately has not been good for their health .
While we can all pack ourselves in cotton wool and live long , miserable lives , we can also choose to leave consenting participants alone , given that even in sports such as UFC they are no risk to anybody else .
The hypocritical oafs who say otherwise should be ignored . They merely prove that there is something far , far worse than being injured playing sport , and that is to become a bitter , sanctimonious bore who wants to tell others how to live their lives .

Palestinians know that if Cairo sneezes then Palestine , especially Gaza , is first to get the flu . Indeed , Gaza often serves as a tool of regime policy , as was the case during the Mubarak years and during the short-lived government led by the Muslim Brotherhood 's Freedom and Justice Party , and is still the case with the current regime since July 2013 .
The Mubarak regime 's policy towards Gaza was generally repressive . It participated in Israel 's draconian siege of the enclave , underway since 2006 , and was fully complicit in Israel 's brutal offensive against Gaza in 2008-9 . Former Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit was standing next to his Israeli counterpart Tzipi Livni when she declared war on Gaza during her visit to Cairo in 2008 .
Aboul Gheit went so far as to threaten to break the legs of the Palestinians of Gaza if they ‚Äú encroached on Egypt 's national security ‚Äù after they breached the border wall with Egypt , seeking to buy medicines and other necessary supplies in Al-Arish City . Naturally , such a repressive policy had to involve demonization of the Gaza Palestinians , painting them all as members of Hamas .
Hamas had great expectations of change after the downfall of the Mubarak regime , including the permanent opening of the Rafah Crossing and the free passage of people and goods , thus eliminating the need for the tunnels connecting Gaza to Egypt . Some optimists further hoped that the efforts for reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah would finally bear fruit , given that the Mubarak regime had been biased towards Fatah .
However , the transitional rule by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) that took power after Mubarak 's downfall did not lift the siege on Gaza or change the Egyptian political approach to Palestine . The tunnels continued to ply their trade to compensate for the massive shortage of supplies blocked by Israel . The Rafah Crossing was partially opened for very limited periods of time , depriving 1.7 million Palestinians of the basic right of freedom of movement .
The high hopes were therefore deferred until the Egyptian presidential elections . Palestinians believed that a democratically elected president would have the power to take sovereign decisions and implement the nationalist and Islamist position of ending the blockade on the Gaza Strip , revisiting the Camp David Accords , and responding to the Palestinian Call For Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions until Israel abided by international law . Some even believed that the newly elected president 's first trip abroad would be to Gaza . Ironically , the first visit Mohamed Morsi made after his election was to Saudi Arabia , which had been hostile to the Egyptian revolution ; a visit to Gaza was never in the cards .
In fact , the Muslim Brotherhood was unable to rise to the challenge of government . They came late to the January 25 revolution , seeking first to appease the Mubarak regime . They then forged a temporary alliance with the SCAF and endorsed some of its most violent actions , including the October 2011 assault on peaceful demonstrators , many of them Egyptian Copts , protesting the demolition of a church in Upper Egypt . Once in government , they lacked a clear political vision ; one could have easily mistaken the president 's speeches for a Friday sermon or an address by a tribal leader .
On the home front , the Brotherhood failed to make even limited progress in realizing the demands of the January 25 revolution for bread , freedom , social justice , and human dignity . The economy nearly collapsed and security worsened . Radical Islamist Takfiri groups increased their hold in the Sinai and Israel appears to freely wander through the area , to the extent of reportedly abducting a Palestinian there this June . Despite this reality , the Gaza Palestinians are forced to pay the price of any criminal act that takes place in Sinai .
The Brotherhood 's slogans against Israel ‚Äì such as ‚Äú we shall march to Jerusalem in our millions ‚Äù ‚Äì and the United States disappeared after they came to power . Instead , it adopted a pragmatic position well to the right of the political spectrum . Pragmatism meant a commitment to international agreements , a special relationship with the U.S. , loans from the International Monetary Fund , and diplomatic ties with Israel .
There was no attempt to abrogate the 1979 peace treaty nor even to put it to a popular referendum . On the contrary , a few months into his term , Morsi sent a very friendly letter to Israeli President Shimon Peres regarding the appointment of the new Egyptian ambassador to Tel Aviv . He described Peres as his ‚Äú great and good friend ‚Äù and expressed his ‚Äú strong desire to develop the cordial ties ‚Äù between the two countries . Meanwhile , the blockade against Gaza was tightened : Almost all the tunnels were shut down and the Rafah Crossing functioned at a snail 's pace .
The Morsi presidency took credit for brokering a ceasefire agreement between Palestinian factions and Israel in November 2012 but failed to intervene to hold Israel to its commitments , including lifting the blockade against Gaza . The fact that Morsi 's Egypt did not stand by Gaza during that short but ruthless war that killed more than 200 Palestinians , mostly civilians , was a bitter disappointment to the Palestinian leadership in Gaza , especially as Palestinian fighters had successfully stood their ground against the Israeli onslaught and had expected political gains as a result .
Instead , Morsi capitalized on his ‚Äú victorious ‚Äù mediator role to achieve his aims at home . Just three days after the war on Gaza ended he issued his notorious Constitutional Declaration giving himself powers unprecedented in Egypt 's modern history .
In short , Mubarak 's policy toward the Palestinian cause and especially toward Gaza was passed on to the Brotherhood , which did not dare challenge the crime against humanity taking place on Egypt 's border ‚Äì a crime that human rights organizations and the United Nations have condemned as collective punishment with some saying it amounted to slow genocide . The victimized Palestinians were asked to be ‚Äú understanding ‚Äù of the transitional period that the Brotherhood needed and not to demand the impossible , as if opening the Rafah Crossing for the passage of people and goods was an impossibly heroic act .
The Egyptian military regime in power since July 3 , 2013 is now demonizing everything Palestinian . The Gaza Strip is facing a far harsher blockade affecting all the crossings , including an almost complete closure of the Rafah Crossing and destruction of the tunnels . An unprecedented incitement campaign is underway in several Egyptian media outlets , especially those financed by businessmen affiliated to the Mubarak regime and some Gulf countries hostile to the January 25 revolution . Palestinians are regularly excoriated on Egyptian TV . Some commentators are gleeful over the fate awaiting Gaza 's Palestinians while others assert Hamas 's involvement in Egypt 's internal affairs and call on the Egyptian Army to launch a military attack against the Gaza Strip . Some even ‚Äú accuse ‚Äù Morsi of being of Palestinian origin .
Once again , the Palestinians have become the target of the Egyptian authorities ' security complex : They are the weakest link in the Arab chain and have no strong government to represent them . They are regularly harassed at and deported from Egyptian airports and crossings , even if they are simply transiting to and from Gaza . The Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) has issued no statement calling on the Egyptian government to alleviate the stifling blockade or ensure decent treatment of Palestinian passengers . On the contrary , the PLO and particularly Fatah are rejoicing over the Brotherhood 's downfall and the difficulties this will pose for Hamas . Meanwhile , the Gaza government now faces an impasse and has no idea how to respond .
There is no doubt that this chauvinistic campaign to hold Gaza responsible for all of Egypt 's ills ‚Äì from the fuel shortages to terrorism in Sinai ‚Äì serves the feloul ( remnants ) of Mubarak 's regime , who are now in full resurgence . It is very disturbing that Egypt 's progressive voices have been silent in this regard , with some notable exceptions , even though all Palestinians , at both the official and popular levels , have condemned the terrorist acts in Sinai .
Moreover , no evidence has been found of Palestinian involvement in Egypt , including Sinai . Even if there had been , the collective punishment the Egyptian authorities are applying against the Palestinians of Gaza violates international law . By contrast , Egypt did not cut diplomatic ties with Israel , threaten military intervention , nor impose any restraints on Israelis visiting Egypt despite the many Israeli crimes against Egypt since the Camp David Accords , including the killing of five Egyptian soldiers in an Israeli airstrike in 2011 .
Besides , is n't Sinai a problem of Egypt 's making ? Everyone knows that Mubarak 's regime neglected the Sinai , treating its population as second-class citizens and denying them essential services even though they are Egypt 's first line of defense . Gaza is a natural extension of the Sinai Peninsula and is therefore also part of Egypt 's national security . It is vital that the valiant Egyptian revolutionaries that brought down the Mubarak regime stand up to that regime 's feloul and their counter-revolution , which is using Palestine as a scapegoat .
There is no question that the Egyptian people as a whole remain passionately committed to Palestine and its people , despite the best efforts of the feloul . This spirit was captured in the statement issued by several intellectuals and politicians protesting the media campaign targeting the Palestinian people , demanding that the government clarify ‚Äú Egypt 's policy and commitments toward the Palestinian people , ‚Äù and calling on the government to preserve ‚Äú all the rights of Palestinians in Egypt . ‚Äù
The Egypt we want and the Egypt we need is a pluralistic , democratic and free Egypt with full sovereignty over its territory from its western border with Libya to its eastern border with Palestine , an Egypt that honors the principles for which so many laid down their lives in the January 25 revolution .
Such are the blows that Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull keep raining down on their rivals , it appears they have now bludgeoned them into submission even before they get into their racing cars .
In a frank admission that had his PR handler looking a little alarmed , Lewis Hamilton said that he was ‚Äú willing to bet ‚Äù on Vettel equalling one of the oldest records in the sport , Alberto Ascari 's run of nine successive victories , by winning each of the remaining four races this year .
Dismissing his own chances of another win this year , Hamilton predicted in the wake of his retirement in Sunday 's Japanese Grand Prix that only reliability issues could prevent the 26-year-old German completing a historic clean sweep from the August break all the way through to the final race in Brazil next month .
‚Äú We have stopped developing the [ 2013 ] car and Red Bull are a long way ahead , ‚Äù Hamilton said of his own prospects . ‚Äú It is not going to happen , but we can get some solid points and I think we can get back on the podium . I think we can recover second in the constructors ' championship [ Mercedes trail Ferrari by 10 points ] . ‚Äù
Then , in an admission that had his Mercedes communications manager mumbling about sporting codes of ethics and words that ought not to be taken literally , Hamilton added that he had no doubt whatsoever that Vettel would equal Ascari 's record , set across the 1952-53 seasons , as well as tie Michael Schumacher 's record of 13 victories in a single season .
‚Äú If he does n't have any reliability issues , I am willing to put money on it , ‚Äù the 2008 world champion said . It was as powerful a reminder as any of the power that Red Bull wield .
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner was hardly playing down ¬≠Vettel 's chances either , describing the 26-year-old 's form as ‚Äú supreme ‚Äù , although he said that it would be nice to see Mark Webber take one final victory before quitting F1 for sports cars next season . ‚Äú Sebastian has won every race since the summer break , ‚Äù Horner said .
‚Äú There are still four to go and we will try to cary this momentum into the last four . We could n't have imagined he would have this run of success but the way he is driving is quite supreme . Mark got pretty close [ in Japan ] and it would be great to see him win a race before the end of the year . ‚Äù
Speaking to The Telegraph , Horner added that running such a well-oiled race team would ‚Äú probably be easy ‚Äù compared with fatherhood , his biggest scare of last week coming in the shape of his first child , Olivia , who had to be delivered early while he was looking into making a 15,000-mile round trip back to the UK to be by his partner Beverley 's side .
‚Äú My plan was to get back on Monday morning at 8am and for the child to be delivered by midday , ‚Äù Horner said . ‚Äú But I spoke to Beverley on Tuesday and she did n't feel so good .
‚Äú She had an appointment with the doctor and they checked her blood pressure and said it was a bit high . They were a bit worried about pre-eclampsia . So she then rang me and said they are looking to do this on Thursday , you 'd better look at getting a flight back .
‚Äú So as I 'm looking at flights she then rang and said : ‚Äò Actually , they have just done another test and they want to do this in an hour ' . I spoke to the doctors and said ‚Äò Just get on with it ‚Äì make sure they are both safe . ' Olivia arrived about 3.30am Tokyo time .
`` We went out for some karaoke on Wednesday and wetted the baby 's head . It has been a busy week , that 's for sure , and it just shows that you ca n't plan everything in life . I think fatherhood will probably be my biggest challenge . Running a Formula One team will be easy by comparison . ‚Äù
It helps when your rivals have conceded defeat before they have stepped into their cars .

Gifting games to your fellow Xbox games may be something that you can do in the not-to-distant future . Although we do n't have any kind of confirmed date for its debut , Microsoft 's vice president of Xbox , Mike Ybarra , told one fan on Twitter that the feature is ‚Äú not far ‚Äù from being implemented .
Game gifting is something that has proved hugely successful on platforms like Steam and GoG , by giving gamers a chance to send games to friends on birthdays , during sales or other special events . But consoles like the Xbox One and PS4 do n't have that functionality , despite it being a major boon to sales . But that may soon be about to change .
When asked ‚Äú how far off are we from getting the ability to gift a new purchase for a friend ? ‚Äù Ybarra answered , ‚Äú not far. ‚Äù While that is n't exactly a detailed response , it does indicate that the feature is something Microsoft is planning to implement and has been working on .
While it might seem like something simple to add to a platform , it 's not necessarily a cake walk . As Engadget highlights , pricing differences between regions can lead to users gaming the system , with people buying games for one another when faced with better prices in their own locale . Microsoft will no doubt be looking to avoid that when launching its own gifting system .
The alternative while we wait for it to show up at some point in the future , is to use Xbox gift cards . While a little less direct than gifting the game to someone , they do at least let you send funds to another gamer , who can then use the money to buy whatever they like ‚Äî though you can prod them to buy a certain game .
Ybarra purportedly receives a lot of questions on his Twitter account , one common one recently having been ‚Äú when is PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds coming to Xbox ? ‚Äù Although he was n't able to answer that question himself , by addressing the many requests for comment , he did prompt the developer itself to step forward and confirm it will arrive on the console before the end of the year .
Alabama Power , Protective Life donate a combined $ 1 million to UAB football
BIRMINGHAM , Ala. ‚Äî The UAB football team is getting some major support from the Birmingham business community .
Alabama Power Company and Protective Life , both based in Birmingham , have each committed $ 500,000 to go toward the UAB Athletic Foundation 's $ 15 million goal for a proposed Football Operations Building . The facility will house offices , team meeting and film rooms , training facilities , locker rooms , and weight rooms .
The proposed Operations Building was given the green light by the UA System Board of Trustees in February . UAB Athletic Director Mark Ingram hopes to start building the facility this summer so that it will be completed by the time UAB football returns in the fall of 2017 .
Protective Life was the first major corporation to donate such a large sum to the facility , donating their $ 500,000 last month . The Birmingham business community has shown great solidarity toward UAB over the past year .
‚Äú When the future of UAB Football was in question , the Birmingham business community , recognizing the importance of UAB athletics to the renewal of Birmingham , stepped up and provided the funding needed to keep the program alive ‚Äù , said Protective Life CEO and University of Alabama System Trustee Johnny Johns . ‚Äú But the job is n't finished . UAB Football can not reach its potential without quality facilities for coaches and players . That is why community support for the Football Operations Building project is so important . We hope our gift will encourage others to do what is necessary to ensure that UAB football can be successful and sustainable in the future . ‚Äù
This week , the Alabama Power Foundation joined Protective Life in donating $ 500,000 of their own . Together , these two companies have knocked out $ 1 million of the facility 's $ 15 million goal . The UAB Athletic Foundation has lined up a few other major gifts that will make the football facility that much closer to reality .
‚Äú We join with the many organizations getting behind this project because it has broad implications in expanding UAB 's growing economic and cultural contributions to our region , ‚Äù said Myla Calhoun , Alabama Power 's vice president for Charitable Giving . ‚Äú UAB has been central to Birmingham 's resurgence , and UAB Athletics is seizing an opportunity to build excellence across its programs that will be felt in very positive ways across our city . ‚Äù
UAB has had a tumultuous year , but the Birmingham business community has rallied around the school and is now investing heavily in its future . Athletic Director Mark Ingram is grateful for the support the school has received and what it can mean for the future of UAB football .
‚Äú We are all very excited about the broad interest this project has generated in a relatively short time , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú And we will be announcing many other exciting gifts in the coming days and weeks . It is clear that leaders in Birmingham believe in the importance of UAB and UAB Football . ‚Äù
UAB 's football program was shut down at the beginning of December last year , making the university the first Division 1A athletics program since 1995 to abandon the sport . After six emotional months of anger , calling for Ray Watts ' removal , and # FreeUAB , the football program was reinstated .
The proposed Football Operations Building will help bring the UAB football program to greater heights when it returns in 2017 . Head coach Bill Clark , who recently signed a top Conference USA recruiting class , says the importance of this new facility can not be exaggerated .
‚Äú We already have excitement in and around the program and are working hard toward 2017 , ‚Äù Clark said . ‚Äú Watching shovels hit the dirt and steel come out of the ground will boost the energy even more ‚Äî in our recruiting , on the practice field , in the meeting room and in the weight room . Our return is very real , and this facility is a tangible symbol that we are coming back to be stronger than ever . ‚Äù
New York Times , By CHARLIE SAVAGE and NEIL A. LEWIS ‚Äì A day after releasing a set of Bush administration opinions that claimed sweeping presidential powers in fighting terrorism , the Obama administration faced new pressure on Tuesday to support a broad inquiry into interrogation , detention , surveillance and other practices under President George W. Bush .
Justice Department officials said they might soon release additional opinions on those subjects . But the disclosure of the nine formerly secret documents fueled calls by lawmakers for an independent commission to investigate and make public what the Bush administration did in the global campaign against terrorism .
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Representative John Conyers Jr. , Democrat of Michigan , said the revelations , together with the release of new information about the Central Intelligence Agency 's destruction of 92 interrogation videotapes , had underscored the need for a commission that would have the power to subpoena documents and testimony .
Officials who discussed the process spoke on the condition of anonymity because memorandums still under review might involve classified information . Among those that have not been disclosed but are believed to exist are a memorandum from the fall of 2001 justifying the National Security Agency 's program of domestic surveillance without warrants and one from the summer of 2002 that listed specific harsh interrogation techniques , including waterboarding , that the C.I.A . was authorized to use .
The Justice Department officials said the decision to release the nine memorandums on Monday came after some of the opinions were sought in a civil lawsuit in California . They said department lawyers had determined that the opinions did not contain classified information .
The lawsuit was filed by Jose Padilla , a United States citizen who was arrested in Chicago in 2002 and detained for years as an enemy combatant before eventually being tried and convicted in a civilian criminal procedure . Mr. Padilla is suing John C. Yoo , a former Bush administration lawyer who was the author of many of the opinions justifying detention and interrogation policies .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Wednesday on whether to create a commission to look into the Bush administration 's counterterrorism policy . The committee chairman , Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , has already called for a commission , and another Democrat on the panel said Tuesday that he would support such an approach .
But David B. Rivkin Jr. , an associate White House counsel under the first President Bush who is scheduled to testify at the hearing on Wednesday , said he planned to urge Congress not to move forward with that proposal , which he said would violate the rights of Bush administration officials and set them up for prosecutions by foreign courts .
‚Äú They want to pillory people , ‚Äù ¬ù Mr. Rivkin said . ‚Äú They want to destroy their reputation . They want to drag them through the mud and single them out for foreign prosecutions . And if you get someone in a perjury trap , so much the better. ‚Äù ¬ù
President Obama has signaled a reluctance to open a wide-ranging investigation into his predecessor 's policies , saying he preferred to fix the policies and move on . In his first days in office , he issued executive orders requiring strict adherence to rules against torture . As a senator , he voted for legislation that brought surveillance efforts into alignment with federal statutes .
The increased calls for a greater public accounting come as the Justice Department 's internal ethics office is preparing to release a report that is expected to criticize sharply members of the Bush legal team who wrote memorandums purporting to provide legal justification for the use of harsh interrogation methods on detainees despite anti-torture laws and treaties , according to department and Congressional officials .
The Office of Professional Responsibility at the Justice Department is examining whether certain political appointees in the department knowingly signed off on an unreasonable interpretation of the law to provide legal cover for a program sought by Bush White House officials .
The report is expected to focus on three former officials of the Office of Legal Counsel : Mr. Yoo , a Berkeley law professor , now on leave at Chapman University , who was the principal author of opinions on national security matters from 2001 to 2003 ; Jay S. Bybee , who oversaw the counsel 's office during that period and is now a federal appeals court judge ; and Steven G. Bradbury , who oversaw the counsel 's office in Mr. Bush 's second term .
Mr. Bradbury wrote two of the opinions released on Monday . Written last October and this January , they broadly repudiated the aggressive theory of virtually unlimited commander-in-chief power at the heart of Mr. Yoo 's memorandums .
Although he was a critic of Mr. Yoo 's work , Mr. Bradbury himself wrote three memorandums on the use of harsh interrogation techniques in 2005 . Those documents are believed to be part of the Office of Professional Responsibility 's investigation .
In a footnote to Mr. Bradbury 's January memorandum that sharply criticized Mr. Yoo 's work , Mr. Bradbury signaled that he did not want a repudiation of Mr. Yoo 's legal reasoning to be used against him as part of the ethics inquiry .
Mr. Bradbury wrote that his retractions were not ‚Äú intended to suggest in any way that the attorneys involved in the preparation of the opinions in question ‚Äù ¬ù violated any ‚Äú applicable standards of professional responsibility. ‚Äù ¬ù

We all knew that this was coming , did n't we ? Each year Black Friday violence just seems to get worse and worse . What does it say about American consumers when they are willing to fight like crazed animals just to save a few bucks on cheap plastic crap made in China ? Not that retailers are innocent in any of this . It certainly seems as though many of them purposely create wild situations on Black Friday where customers will rush like crazy people into their stores and nearly riot as they fight overdiscounted merchandise . The more Black Friday madness there is , the more of an ‚Äú event ‚Äù it becomes , and the higher the profits of the retailers go . This year there was more Black Friday hype than ever and there was also more Black Friday violence than ever . It is being projected that this year a record-setting 152 million Americans will go shopping between Thanksgiving and Sunday night . That may be good news for the big corporate retailers , but the shocking lack of character being displayed by American consumers all over the country this weekend is very bad news for the future of this nation .
Most Americans would agree that there is a tremendous amount of selfishness and greed on Wall Street , but as the videos posted below demonstrate , there is also a tremendous amount of selfishness and greed on ‚Äú Main Street ‚Äù as well .
This year , Black Friday violence included robberies , gunfire and shootings , but the most shocking incidents actually happened inside the big retail stores .
For example , as merchandise was being unveiled on Black Friday night at a Wal-Mart in the Los Angeles area , one woman actualy pulled out pepper spray and sprayed it at other customers that were gathered around her .
Did she do this because she felt threatened ?
No , according to the Los Angeles Times , authorities say that the woman was just seeking a ‚Äú competitive ‚Äù edge .
It is being reported that at least 20 people were affected by the pepper spray .
The pepper spray incident just added to the wild and frenzied atmosphere inside that Wal-Mart last night .
The following is how the Los Angeles Times described the scene‚Ä¶ .
Employees attempted to hold back the scrum of shoppers and pick up merchandise even as customers trampled the video games and DVDs strewn on the floor . ‚Äú It was absolutely crazy , ‚Äù he said . Another customer said screams erupted after about 100 people waiting in line to snag Xbox gaming consoles and Wii video games got into a shoving match . Alejandra Seminario , 24 , said she was waiting in line to grab some toys at the store around 9:55 p.m. when people the next aisle over started shouting and ripping at the plastic wrap encasing gaming consoles , which was supposed to be opened at 10 p.m. ‚Äú People started screaming , pulling and pushing each other , and then the whole area filled up with pepper spray , ‚Äù the Sylmar resident said .
Pepper spray was used at a Wal-Mart on the other side of the country as well . Over in Kinston , North Carolina an off-duty police officer used pepper spray as an unruly shopper was being subdued . Approximately 20 people ( including some children ) were affected by the pepper spray .
Most Americans are not really concerned over the fact that this country is rapidly heading into the toilet , but they sure will get worked up into a frenzy over some good deals . Just check out the following video that was filmed in California . In the video , a huge crowd can be seen storming the entrance of Urban Outfitters in the Thousand Oaks Mall on Black Friday night‚Ä¶ .
There are lots of other crazy videos of Black Friday madness on YouTube today as well . Just check out some of the following examples‚Ä¶ .
* In Fresno , California law enforcement authorities were barely able to keep a stampede at the entrance of one store from turning into a riot .
* In this next video , you can see people going absolutely crazy over memory cards at about the 1:20 mark .
* On Black Friday night , American consumers will riot over just about anything . For example , there was a huge panic over Tupperware at one Wall-Mart last night .
* Of course electronics is probably the hottest category in most stores on Black Friday night . In some areas , the fighting over video games became incredibly intense .
* Some of the worst Black Friday rioting goes on inside Wal-Marts . Just check out this shocking video of what happens inside a Wal-Mart on Black Friday night .
* Also , what happened last night at a Wal-mart Supercenter in Greenville , North Carolina , was nothing short of idiotic .
If this is how the American people will act just to save a few bucks on cheap plastic crap made in foreign countries , how are they going to act when the economy collapses ?
If Americans will literally fight each other over saving 20 bucks , what is going to happen someday when millions of them do n't know where their next meal is going to come from ?
Thankfully the economy is still in good enough shape that most Americans can participate in these orgies of consumerism . But the reality is that the global financial system is in a massive amount of trouble , and it looks like we could be on the verge of another global financial collapse .
Do the American people have enough character to be able to deal with a full-blown economic depression ?
In a recent article entitled ‚Äú 22 Signs That The Thin Veneer Of Civilization That We All Take For Granted Is Starting To Disappear ‚Äú , I commented on the declining character of the American people‚Ä¶ .
Instead of teaching our children to love and care for one another , we have taught them to be incredibly self-involved . Today , way too many Americans deeply love themselves , deeply love money and are deeply addicted to entertainment . Each new generation seems to be even more prideful , even more arrogant and even more violent . As a nation , we are losing our empathy for others , our compassion for the needy and our respect for the elderly . Our family units are breaking down and thousands of our communities are being transformed into hellholes .
Over the past several decades , the biggest debt bubble in the history of the world has enabled us to enjoy unprecedented prosperity . But it has been a ‚Äú false prosperity ‚Äù , and it is frightening to think about what America is going to look like when the good times finally end .
The other thing that is really disturbing about Black Friday is the fact that the vast majority of the products that Americans are fighting over are made overseas .
As I pointed out recently , 23 manufacturing facilities were shut down every single day in the United States last year .
Since 2001 , the U.S. has lost a total of more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities .
This country is bleeding jobs , bleeding businesses and bleeding wealth at a pace that is nearly impossible to fully grasp .
We are becoming poorer as a nation every single day , and yet Americans are seemingly more enamored with consumerism than ever before .
Most Americans could not care less about where something was made . The only thing that matters to them is how cheap it is .
It does n't matter to them that a record-setting 2.6 million Americans slipped into poverty last year or that there are 10 percent fewer middle class jobs in America today than there were a decade ago .
We have become a nation that is so self-centered that it is hard to find the words to describe it .
Rather than caring about what is good for America , most of us only care about what is good for ourselves .
The madness that we see every Black Friday is just one more sign that our society is coming apart at the seams .
America has become a nation that is absolutely saturated with greed . Unfortunately , all of that greed is going to make the hard economic times that are coming much , much more painful .
If there 's one thing about Texas ' play on offense in 2017 that met preseason expectations it was the prevalence of a season-long quarterback debate over whether Shane Buechele or Sam Ehlinger represented the brightest future for Texas football . There was n't much that was even bright about Texas ' play on offense in 2017 but major improvements in 2018 are going to need to come with one of these two young men at the helm .
It was n't terribly hard to suss out the story of 2017 just by watching the games . It was obvious enough in live viewings that Texas ' QBs spent most of the season under duress from shoddy OL play , Texas ' own struggles to execute routes , harsh penalization , and the lack of a go-to receiver .
In the assembly of a run-centric offense like Tom Herman brought to Texas the formula to success goes as follows :
Run the ball effectively against an honest front
Constrain the defense from sending extra defenders with QB options ( run or pass )
Develop a go-to receiver/plan for beating man coverage on passing downs
Use the QB as a trump card for converting short-yardage or turning broken plays into gains .
Texas could n't always do 1 and when they could , they could n't or did n't always execute 2 ( like in the Tech game ) . Number 3 was a real struggle as Texas had multiple WRs that flashed promise but lacked go-to route combos or targets for executing on third down . At the end of the day , number 4 was one of the only things that Texas had going for them .
Here 's how things looked with each QB at the helm in the option and direct snap run game :
There 's a lot to observe from those numbers but having watched every single one of these runs , save for four missing runs from Ehlinger that my breakdowns are missing ( which netted 10 positive yards ) , here 's some context and observation .
Ehlinger had a far greater volume of carries for a few different reasons . One was that he played a few more games than Buechele . Another was that the staff did n't utilize Buechele as much on direct snap QB runs ( split zone , power/counter , stretch ) . Durability is another factor , Ehlinger sustained two injuries this season during a stretch in which he had 58 carries in three weeks whereas Buechele missed the games that immediately followed from the weeks in which he had 10 carries or more save for the TCU game , where seven of his twelve ‚Äú carries ‚Äù were sacks . The 12 extra sacks that Buechele took were another factor as I think we can safely conclude some of those might have become scrambles had Ehlinger been under center .
The sack rate , higher yards per carry on scrambles , and higher volume of overall rushes for Ehlinger all tell the story of a player that was much more comfortable and capable avoiding pressure , avoiding negative plays ( save for turnovers on the goal line , perhaps ) , and did more damage on off-schedule plays .
The coaches did n't give Buechele downhill carries , the only time that he ran the ball between the tackles was on draws , scrambles , or zone-read plays where he was looking to find a crease when a defender unexpectedly showed up on the perimeter . Conversely , Ehlinger regularly ran downhill on power/counter runs . This is n't terribly surprising to anyone I 'm sure , and Ehlinger 's 230 pound frame and hard running undoubtedly has a lot to do with it .
The reason that the direct snap QB runs look inefficient for either QB is primarily that these were short-yardage calls . Ehlinger was something like 5-7 converting third or fourth down with the QB power/counter runs and the two failed runs ( fourth and two vs USC , third and two and against Tech ) resulted from missed blocking assignments . When the staff wanted to try and pick up a third or fourth down with a QB run when Buechele was in the game they turned to QB stretch or zone-read and Buechele was 4-5 converting short yardage on QB stretch .
Buechele 's greater effectiveness on zone-read keeper calls is a factor of a few different things . One is that opponents were much less likely to give Ehlinger a ‚Äú keep ‚Äù call on the zone-read , so he was normally handing off . Another was that Buechele was given a lead blocker on some of these zone-read calls and picked up a few chunk runs against Iowa State with it and then that nice TD run against Baylor from 28 out .
Whither power-read ? Texas rarely used that play this season even though it suits Ehlinger 's strengths and helps the backs run the ball on the perimeter rather than behind the OL . Ehlinger also ran it in high school and is well familiar with the reads involved . Perhaps they did n't want to base around a play that they did n't want to utilize with Buechele ? Either way this really stands out in review .
The numbers and the film make clear that quickness is not a sizable advantage that Ehlinger holds over Buechele and that was also evident from SPARQ numbers out of high school .
Executing perimeter constraint runs on the option is not an issue for Buechele , it 's simply holding up to the extra punishment that adds on top of eluding pressure and scrambling , like on this successful zone-read keeper :
via GIPHY
Six of Buechele 's rushes this season went for 10 yards or more and four of them were on zone-read keepers that allowed him to get loose on the edge . The other two came from a scramble and a draw . That 's a 16.2 % rate of explosive runs .
14 of Ehlinger 's runs went for 10 yards or more , which is a rate of 14.9 % . Seven of these were scrambles , two came on QB stretch runs , and five came on draws .
The draw was the best called running play for Texas this season , no matter the QB behind center although obviously Shane did n't get as many carries there . Ehlinger in particular was a very dangerous player for opponents to turn their backs on in coverage before trying to close and tackle him in space .

It 'd be interesting to learn why the staff did n't make the draw a bigger component of the offense , it might again have been due to the fact that they did n't zero in on a particular QB as the starter and did n't want to count on QB runs as a major part of the offense . You would hope that a Texas offense built specifically for Ehlinger would regularly feature the lead draw RPO play .
So who gets the nod for fitting together the best Texas offense ?
I think it 's obvious enough that this season the best QB to have under center was the one that could avoid sacks and disaster more easily , Ehlinger . That 's not the same question though as which QB is the better player to build the offense around in 2018 and an offense built around Ehlinger is going to look different than an offense built around Buechele .
So let 's review our four-step process to Texas building out a strong , Herman-style offense .
Run the ball effectively against an honest front
This depends on Texas fielding an OL that can reliably prevent penetration and execute assignments against a given defensive front . It also depends on Texas getting better blocking from the TE position next season so that they can block a six man , nickel front . The RBs matter as well , Texas ' young RBs need to up their game next season .
Constrain the defense from sending extra defenders with QB options ( run or pass )
Ideally this offense would thrive on both power and zone-read plays , which can allow an offense to get the featured runner on the perimeter or downhill whether he 's the QB or the RB and long-term the goal is for the featured runner to be the RB‚Ä¶at least until Roschon Johnson is around .

Both of these guys have the quickness to get to the edge and the ability to plant and cut up the field . Power-read is the bigger question since it 's less clear that Texas wants Buechele to potentially hit 10 carries a game as would be necessary if both power and zone read were big components to the offense .
The other question here is RPOs . I have n't broken down every RPO on the year but at least feel confident saying that Ehlinger is decent but growing in those concepts and Buechele is a well above average trigger-man . Texas could build a good , run-centric offense while continuing to ignore the potential lethality of power-read or draw by continuing to put emphasis on the RPO game .
Develop a go-to receiver/plan for beating man coverage on passing downs
If/when I try to break down every pass concept and result by Texas this season we 'll try to see where Texas is in regards to realizing this goal . Reggie Hemphill-Mapps is probably the best bet here , naturally he was injured this season because Herman ca n't have nice things , but RHM , Lil'Jordan Humphrey , and Collin Johnson all have obvious potential here .
Buechele can do damage with the scramble but you ca n't really plan on it , Ehlinger regularly converted passing downs with his feet either by scrambling or buying time to find a receiver and a lead draw concept would probably add a good arrow to the staff 's quiver for third and long .
Use the QB as a trump card for converting short-yardage or turning broken plays into gains .
For an offense seeking to control the ball in particular , this is a crucial component , but it 's not necessarily the most important . For instance , the last four years of Ohio State football have offered a fantastic window into the nature of this offense and how it works best .
With J.T . Barrett at the helm the Buckeyes have been able to make regular use of option football and direct snap QB runs to execute third and fourth down with high precision . The Buckeyes were fifth nationally in converting third downs this year at 48.6 % and having QB power or split zone in their back pocket for third and four or less has been free money for them for four years now . However , their greatest offensive performances came with Cardale Jones at the helm for the 2014 postseason run because Ezekiel Elliott , the OL , and their TEs did n't really need the QB helping with option reads and the vertical passing he brought to the table made them explosive .
Texas needed QB run game help this season in order to run the ball at all and even then it was dicey , but that may not be the case in 2018 with a better RB group and a deeper , older TE/OL depth chart . By 2019 they should be running the ball effectively in a variety of ways or this whole Tom Herman venture may be in trouble .
Here 's what the third/fourth down offense looked like with Buechele :
Third down : 35-95 , 36.8 % .
Fourth down : 6-17 , 25.3 % .
And when Ehlinger was at the helm :
Third down : 45-103 , 43.7 % .
Fourth down : 8-13 , 61.5 % .
For the season Texas finished at 38.5 % on third down , up considerably from their 31.8 % mark in 2016 . The 2016 Texas offense was devastating on first and 10 and then hot garbage on third and five , the 2017 Texas offense could flip those traits IF Sam Ehlinger was in the game .
The numbers from the 2017 season suggest that a great Shane Buechele offense is one in which Texas can run the ball with a feature back and has WRs that can consistently get open on passing downs and they 're just looking for a QB that can generate big gains throwing the ball down the field on play-action . A Sam Ehlinger offense could probably include that same dimension but would also likely incorporate the QB more heavily to help the RBs and make situational football an area where Texas could generate separation against opponents .
Right now the two young signal-callers are splitting reps in preparation for the Texas Bowl against Missouri . Looking back at this year and then moving ahead to the spring I think Herman is going to build around Ehlinger and hope to have Buechele around as an above average game manager in the event of an injury . The challenge for the spring will be executing steps 1 and 3 .
God 's Not Allowed In Our School
I was dropping my son off at Pre-School this morning and one of the other parents had a car with a bumper sticker that said something along the lines of , ‚Äú Dear God , why do you allow so much violence in schools ? I 'm not allowed in schools . ‚Äì God ‚Äù
This bothers me for many reasons . First of which is the fact that my son goes to a small Pre-School and shares the class with a kid whose parent thinks this is such an awesome bumper sticker that she had to put it on her car . Unfortunately , we live in a world filled with people who think schools deserve violence because people are tolerant of others . What a horrible message !
Second , it is factually not true . God is allowed in schools . His absence from schools is n't that administrators wo n't let him in ; it is because he does n't actually exist .
In all seriousness , the bumper sticker is trying to make the argument against the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case , Abington School District v. Schempp which held that public school sponsored Bible readings were unconstitutional under the First Amendment . The key word here is ‚Äú sponsored. ‚Äù Any child can pray to any deity they choose freely in a non-disruptive fashion .
No one is forbidding prayer in school . Only school sponsored prayer is forbidden . In other words , you can pray silently to Zeus , Allah , Jesus , or Thor before a test if you think it will help you ‚Äî for the record , it wo n't ‚Äî but a teacher or faculty member ca n't force or lead the entire class to pray their particular deity or any deity .
In other words , the purpose of the bumper sticker is misguided in that it is arguing against a problem that does n't actually exist . ‚Äú God , ‚Äù as in school prayer , is allowed in public schools as long as it is done by students in a non-disruptive fashion . Still there is a serious problem with school violence and prayer is n't going to solve that problem . In fact , religious bigotry is often the underlining cause of that problem .
When children are bullied , they often feel detached from the school and their peers . While there is no excuse for violence , eliminating the culture of bullying within schools would dramatically cut down on violence in schools . There is a group of people who preach that anyone who differs from their idea of moral purity will be and ought to be tortured for all eternity in Hell . They tend to bully gays , atheists , those of other religious views , and anyone else who does n't fit their ridged view of piety . Who could they be ? I 'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that perhaps they are the children of religious fundamentalists ?
These people love to use the persecuted card as a tool to bully and persecute others . For example , by inaccurately claiming that God has been forced out of public schools , they are attempting to force everyone to pray to their God in their way . They want to turn their prayers into a show spectacle for everyone to see and for those of other religions or no religion to feel uncomfortable and force religious conformity to the majority ‚Äì which just so happens to be Christianity .
But just you wait , the moment a non-Christian prayer or invocation is sponsored by a public school official or faculty member , Christian heads will explode . In their mind , prayer is school is great as long as it is their prayer to their deity . Just you wait bu when it is a Satanist , a Hindu , a Scientologist , or an invocation from any other religion or non-religious alternative that is sponsored in the same way , they will be up in arms demanding that they are being persecuted because their children were allowed to listen to it . Yet they have no problems with other people 's children being forced to listen to their religious prayers .

SACRAMENTO -- California has signed a contract with private prison contractor Geo Group to lease space for 1,400 inmates in overcrowded state lockups .
The company announced the contract early Monday morning , even before Gov . Jerry Brown learns whether federal judges will grant his request for a three-year delay in the courts ' orders to cap the prison population . The governor 's lawyers have asked judges to make their own decision by Friday .
Geo Group issued a news release Monday from its Florida headquarters announcing the company had inked deals with the state for two lower-security prisons it owns in California , in Adelanto and McFarland . The company said the contracts are for five years , and it expects to begin receiving inmates by the end of the year .
It estimated its annual revenue from the deal at more than $ 30 million .
Brown has asked federal judges to delay its order to remove some 9,600 inmates from state prisons by the end of December , in trade for promising to restore $ 150 million to a grant that funds community probation and rehabilitation programs .

Islamic State of Iraq and Syria militants have abducted at least 70 Christians , including women and children , after overrunning a string of villages in northeastern Syria , activists and relatives said Tuesday .
The Sunni extremists , who follow a radical interpretation of Islam , have repeatedly targeted religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq since seizing control of large swaths of both countries . The group 's fighters have ransacked churches , demolished Shia and Sunni Muslim shrines , and enslaved women of the Yazidi community , a tiny sect ISIS considers heretical .
The latest assault began before dawn on Monday , when the militants swept through the villages nestled along the banks of Khabur River near the town of Tal Tamr in Hassakeh province . The area is predominantly inhabited by Assyrians , an indigenous Christian people who trace their roots back to the ancient Mesopotamians .
During the raids , the militants took between 70 and 100 Assyrians captive , said Nuri Kino , the head of the activist group A Demand For Action , which focuses on religious minorities in the Middle East . He said some 3,000 people managed to flee the onslaught and have sought refuge in the cities of Hassakeh and Qamishli .
Kino said his organization based its information on conversations with villagers who fled the attack and their relatives .
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the abductions , but put the number of Christians held by the Islamic State group at 90 . The Observatory relies on a network of activists inside Syria .
Both activist groups said that most of the captives come from the village of Tal Shamiram , located some 85 kilometres southwest of the provincial capital of Qamishli .
'Have they been slaughtered ? '
An Assyrian Christian woman from Tal Shamiram who now lives in Beirut said she has been scrambling to find out what has become of her parents as well as her brother and his wife and kids .
`` Land lines have been cut , their mobiles are closed , '' she told The Associated Press . `` Have they been slaughtered ? Are they still alive ? We 're searching for any news . ''
She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of endangering relatives believed to be held by the militants .
`` My family visited me last month and returned to Syria . There were clashes but it was normal , nothing exceptional . I feel so helpless , I can not do anything for them but pray , '' she said by telephone , her voice breaking .
ISIS 's online radio station , al-Bayan , said in a report Tuesday that ISIS fighters had detained `` tens of crusaders '' and seized 10 villages around Tal Tamr after clashes with Kurdish militiamen . ISIS frequently refers to Christians as `` crusaders . ''
It was not immediately clear what ISIS planned to do with the Assyrians .
The militants have a long history of killing captives , including foreign journalists , Syrian soldiers and Kurdish militiamen . Most recently , militants in Libya affiliated with ISIS released a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians .
But ISIS also could use its Assyrian captives to try to arrange a prisoner swap with the Kurdish and Christian militias it is battling in northeastern Syria . There is a precedent : the extremists have released Kurdish school children as well as Turkish truck drivers and diplomats after holding them for months .
The fighting around Tal Tamr has coincided with heavy clashes between Kurdish militiamen and ISIS militants about 90 kilometres to the east near the Iraqi border . Kurdish fighters from the People 's Protection Units , or YPG , launched an offensive over the weekend , quickly seizing some 20 villages from the extremists .
The fighting continued through Tuesday , as the YPG has captured another 10 villages , the Observatory said .

SALT LAKE CITY -- The highlight of Michigan 's athletic year happens later tonight when Jim Harbaugh makes his Wolverine coaching debut at Utah . The game arrives after roughly eight months of endless hype and attention , and an exhausting scheduled kept by Harbaugh himself . The most grueling portion of Harbaugh 's offseason ? His eight-day 'Summer Swarm ' satellite camp tour during the early part of June . Harbaugh , his coaching staff and a Michigan travel party hit 10 camps over seven states during an eight-day run . The bill : $ 211,948 , according to a FOIA request made by MLive , which was delivered by Michigan on Thursday . That number is higher than the total recruiting budgets used by 40 different NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision schools during the entire 2012-13 athletic year , per USA Today 's database . As a point of reference : Wisconsin , a Big Ten school , spent $ 256,967 on recruiting during that same time frame . The group spent $ 4,178 on meals , $ 9,289 on lodging , ground transportation and `` other , '' and $ 198,481 on airfare . That 's a large price tag , but for Harbaugh , it may have been worth it as Michigan went on a torrid recruiting run during the month of June . Fourteen of Michigan 's current 23-player 2016 recruiting class offered a commitment during the month of June .

Modern solar cells are based on a design and prototype that was reported by Bell Labs scientists in 1954 . It made the front page of The New York Times , which predicted solar cells would eventually lead ‚Äú to the realization of one of mankind 's most cherished dreams‚Äîthe harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization. ‚Äù How are we doing on that dream ? Compared to the past , solar panel prices have plunged , but they contribute to less than 0.1 % of the world 's electricity production because solar electricity still is n't cheap enough to compete with grid electricity . There is certainly plenty of sunlight available to bring us close to this utopia . But are there any solar cell technologies that can meet this promise ?
Let 's look at some numbers . The total power produced from solar panels installed worldwide is approximately about 30 Gigawatts . If we wanted 5 % of the world 's electricity production to come from solar panels , installed capacities would need to increase more than 50-fold to about 2000 Gigawatts . In order to get there in say , 25 years , we need about 75-80 Gigawatts of capacity installed every year , on average . So not only do these new solar cells have to be cheap , the materials used need to be available in vast quantities .
More than 80 % of solar cells today are made of silicon . There is certainly more than enough silicon available : it is the second most common element in the earth 's crust . Can silicon fulfill this need ? Opinions are split . Since silicon does not absorb visible light too well , one needs thick , high quality layers that can be expensive . Based upon this , one group argues that the prospects for really cheap silicon solar cells are dim . Then there is the ‚Äú do n't bet against silicon ‚Äù school , who put their money on this old warhorse with the view that economies of scale , and the constant innovation that has always accompanied silicon technology , will eventually drive prices down .
The remaining 20 % of the solar cells are built using thin-film technologies , based on materials that are deposited in the form of micron-thick films on glass substrates . The most popular of these right now is a technology based upon a two-element compound called CdTe ( cadmium telluride ) . But cadmium is toxic ( countries like Japan will not allow solar cells with Cd ) , and tellurium is one of the rarest elements in the world . Therefore it appears unlikely that CdTe can fuel the kind of growth desired for the future of solar .
The second thin-film technology gaining steam , with a handful of manufacturers already selling products , is CIGS , a 3- ( or 4- ) element compound called copper indium gallium selenide ( the gallium is optional ) . It is more likely to hit higher efficiencies than CdTe , but the technology is not as far along the maturity curve as CdTe is . The concern with CIGS centers around the availability of the element indium . This is an element that is also sought after by the flat screen business and it is questionable whether there is enough indium available to sustain growth rates of more than 10-20 Gigawatts/year .
Which brings us to the question : is there a thin film solar material that we anticipate will be really cheap ? That could be slapped onto cheap substrates in massive volumes , the way we make things like roofing and sheet metal ? Right now the answer is no , though the desire for something like this has driven much research .
One promising thin-film material is a compound called CZTS ( copper zinc tin sulfide ) . In terms of maturity it is far behind CIGS and CdTe : nobody manufactures a CZTS solar cell yet . But all of the elements in CZTS are plentiful and cheaply available , and efficiencies are rising . Researchers ( primarily in Japan and Europe ) worked on CZTS through the 1990s , and till last year the best power conversion efficiencies in this material stood at 6.8 % ( by comparison the best silicon solar cells , CIGS , and CdTe solar cells have efficiencies of about 25 % , 20 % , and 16 % , respectively ) . Then in 2009 , IBM researchers were able to increase the efficiency to around 9.7 % by adding a bit of selenium and changing the deposition process . There is now worldwide research interest in this material .
What do the costs of solar panels need to be ? Today an installed solar panel system costs anywhere from between $ 3/Watt to around $ 6/Watt ( approximately ) around the world . The US Department of Energy has an ambitious cost target of less than $ 1/Watt , which means that the panels themselves should be around $ 0.50/Watt . If we come within striking distance of these numbers , and these solar panels were available in plenty , the energy production landscape of the world would change .

Human trafficking is the cause c√©l√®bre for sensationalist media . Celebrities Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore have started a campaign against the sex trafficking of minors . Videos about trafficking regularly go viral . High-profile human trafficking cases have seized the public 's attention . As someone who works in the anti-trafficking field , you might think I would be thrilled about all this public attention . I 'm not . A great deal of the existing human trafficking content is both inaccurate and irresponsible . This tripe is often excused because it is ‚Äú raising awareness. ‚Äù The assumption is that more awareness will lead to more anti-trafficking efforts . While this may be true , it is not always helpful . When misinformed people do make an effort to end human trafficking , they will often support policies and organizations that are ultimately counter-productive to the fight against human trafficking .
Human trafficking is an emerging and complicated problem that can be difficult to discuss appropriately and sensitively . What follows is a simple guide to avoiding some of the most common misunderstandings and misrepresentations :
Do not repeat ‚Äú statistics ‚Äù without investigating
All human trafficking statistics should be regarded with some skepticism . Human trafficking is an illicit and hidden activity and is therefore exceedingly difficult to study . Research is further hindered by misuse of terms , poor methodology and lack of adequate funding . Unfortunately , in a vacuum of reliable data , people tend to unquestioningly cite or simply fabricate trafficking data . Statistics used by established organizations or ‚Äú experts ‚Äù are not above critical assessment . Even oft-repeated , canonical statistics have been shown to be based on outdated or nongeneralizable studies .
Not all prostitution is human trafficking .
The term ‚Äú prostitution ‚Äù refers to any exchange of sex for material benefit and exists on a spectrum of exploitation . At one end are women , men and transgender individuals who freely choose to engage in sex work . At the other end of the spectrum are victims and survivors of sex trafficking . These women , men , transgender individuals and children are prostituted against their will through force , fraud or coercion . Conflation of sex work and sex trafficking often leads to policies that criminalize prostitution , making sex workers more vulnerable to violence and exploitation and denying their basic human capacity to freely choose how they use their bodies . Meanwhile , the distinct needs of trafficking survivors are ignored in favor of ‚Äú demand reduction ‚Äù programs that have not had any discernible effect on sex trafficking .
Do not sensationalize or sexualize * human trafficking victims and survivors .
Reveling in graphic details does not help victims and survivors , nor does it contribute in any meaningful way to the fight to end human trafficking . Rather , it tokenizes the experiences of victims and can trigger trauma for human trafficking survivors .
Before portraying a trafficking victim or survivor , ensure that it is necessary . Does this particular portrayal contain important information that could not otherwise be effectively conveyed ? Is the victim/survivor 's experience being used to promote an organization by inciting feelings of shock , horror or disgust in the viewer ?
When portraying , publishing or publicly identifying a human trafficking survivor or her/his story , the interests and needs of the survivor should be of primary importance . After ensuring the survivor has given fully informed consent ( confidentiality , scope , framing , support , etc . ) , it is critical to question how the portrayal might affect other survivors and whether the portrayal may create a skewed public perception .
Do not ignore forced labour .
The International Labour Organization estimates that of the 20.9 million people in human trafficking , 14.2 million are victims of forced labour , as compared to 4.5 million in sex trafficking . Yet sex trafficking captures a hugely disproportionate amount of public focus . This skewed representation of human trafficking leads to imbalanced responses to human trafficking . Sex trafficking is an important issue that warrants special attention , but not to the exclusion of the plight of the estimated 14.2 million people in forced labour .
Human trafficking is not something that only happens ‚Äú over there . ‚Äù
The United States is a significant destination , origin and transit country for human trafficking . As such , Americans have an obligation to confront and be accountable for the human trafficking occurring within their borders . The myopic focus on sex trafficking of girls in Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe draws attention away from the fact that the tomatoes we eat may be the product of forced labor in Florida or that the person selling magazines at our door may be a homeless youth being trafficked state to state .
Do not ignore men and boys .
According to the ILO 's 2012 estimates , 60 percent of the 14.2 million people in forced labour are male . Yet male victims of human trafficking are rarely discussed . The lack of public attention on the trafficking of men and boys is reflected in the absence of services for male survivors of human trafficking . According to a 2012 study conducted by the Polaris Project , there are 529 shelter beds available specifically for trafficking survivors in the United States . Of those 529 shelter beds , 125 are available to men , and a mere two are reserved for men only .
The problems identified here are not merely semantic . The discourse of human trafficking has real impacts on anti-trafficking efforts and on trafficking victims and survivors . While awareness-raising is critical , it should not be used to justify or excuse misleading or inaccurate information . We will not see true progress until the passion of the anti-trafficking movement is matched with intellectual rigor and is freed from narrow and paternalistic tendencies .

The biggest winner in 2014 was you , the user . That 's because a host of new products and services emerged to help protect the privacy and security of your data and communications . The rulings in two court cases also provided better protection against the warrantless seizure of your data .
But you were also the biggest loser this year in terms of privacy and security . Ongoing revelations about the NSA 's widespread surveillance have made it clear that the intelligence agency , and its spy partners in the UK and elsewhere , will not rest until they 've seized or deciphered every bit of your data .
There were other winners and losers this year as well‚Äîdefined as those who contributed to the privacy and security of your data , those who defeated it , and those who simply failed to respond in a security-conscious way . Looking back at 2014 then , here 's a breakdown of the year 's biggest winners and losers .
The Winners
Apple
If the NSA can be thanked for anything it 's for the competitive race the spy agency helped spur among tech companies scrambling to outdo one another in the privacy realm . Apple took the lead when it announced that the operating system , iOS8 , would encrypt nearly all data on iPhones and iPads by default‚Äîincluding text messages , photos and contacts‚Äîand that Apple itself would not be able to decrypt it without the user 's passcode . Previous versions of the operating system allowed Apple to unlock devices with a key that the company controlled . It was a move intended to protect the data from all intruders but would in particular prevent law enforcement from forcing the company to unlock a user 's device . Google announced it would follow suit with its next Android software release . The praise , and backlash , were immediate . While consumers lauded the two companies for putting their privacy first , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI director James Comey blasted the two companies saying that it would prevent law enforcement agencies from obtaining data even when they have a warrant ( which was not entirely true‚Äîdata backed up to iCloud and metadata is still available to law enforcement with a warrant ) . Apple responded by saying its intent was n't to hamper law enforcement but to make user data more secure against all intruders .
WhatsApp
The mobile messaging app outdid even Apple 's own messaging protections when it announced it was implementing end-to-end encryption for its hundreds of millions of users . WhatsApp communication is now encrypted with a key that only the user possesses and stores on his or her mobile phone or tablet , which means that even WhatsApp can not read the user 's communication or be compelled by spy agencies and law enforcement to decrypt it . Although Apple has implemented a version of end-to-end encryption for iMessage users , that implementation has some security drawbacks that do n't exist in the WhatsApp scheme .
Florida Supreme Court
In an important case closely watched by civil liberties groups , Florida 's top court ruled that cops need a warrant to obtain cell tower data . The court ruled that obtaining cell phone location data to track a person 's location or movement in real time constitutes a Fourth Amendment search and therefore requires a court-ordered warrant . The case specifically involves cell tower data for a convicted drug dealer that police obtained from a telecom without a warrant . But the ruling would also cover law enforcement 's use of so-called ‚Äú stingrays ‚Äù ‚Äî‚Äìdevices that simulate a legitimate cell tower and force mobile devices in the vicinity to connect to them so that law enforcement agencies can locate and track people in the field without assistance from telecoms .
U.S. Supreme Court
In another important case , the nation 's top court ruled that cops ca n't search the cell phones of arrestees without a warrant . U.S. prosecutors had argued that an arrestee 's cell phone was ‚Äú materially indistinguishable ‚Äù from any other storage device , such as a bag or wallet , found on an arrestee . But the justices were n't buying that claim . ‚Äú Modern cell phones , as a category , '' they wrote in their decision , `` implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by a cigarette pack , a wallet or a purse . ‚Äù
Yahoo
Say what you will about Yahoo as a viable internet company , but when news of the NSA 's Prism program broke last year , the tech giant emerged as a bit of a privacy hero . Many of the companies named as participants in the government 's data-collection program were caught flat-footed , having to defend against accusations that they had willingly handed customer data over to officials without a fight . But it soon emerged that Yahoo had in fact put up a scrappy legal fight against the government 's demands‚Äîalthough it ultimately lost . The company launched the fight after receiving a warrantless request for data in 2007 . It 's not clear the extent of the data the government sought , but Yahoo fought back on Fourth Amendment grounds , asserting that the request required a probable-cause warrant and that the request was too broad and unreasonable and , therefore , violated the Constitution . The battle came to an end in 2008 after the Feds threatened the company with a massive $ 250,000 a day fine if it did n't comply , and a court ruled that Yahoo 's arguments for resisting had no merit . While ultimately failing , Yahoo 's role in The Resistance should be commended .
Google 's Project Zero
Vendor bug bounty programs have been around for at least a decade , with software makers and web sites increasingly upping the amount they 're willing to pay to anyone who finds and reports a security vulnerability in their program or system . This year Google upended the tradition by announcing it had built an in-house hacking team to hunt for vulnerabilities not only in its own software , but in the software of other vendors as well . Project Zero aims to make the internet more secure for everyone by focusing on uncovering the high-value vulnerabilities , like Heartbleed and Shellshock , that put everyone at risk .
Privacy and Security Losers
Sony
Plenty of companies over the years have suffered sensational hacks , but Sony 's breach may turn out to be the hack of the decade‚Äînot only because of the nature of the breach and the information stolen , but the way the pilfered data is being rolled out in batches , prolonging the agony and suspense for workers and executives . Some of the disclosures have been lame and mundane‚Äîfor example , the pseudonyms celebrities use to check into hotels . Others have been embarrassing , such as the tasteless and racist exchange about President Obama between Sony Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin . Still others have been outright damaging and invasive‚Äîthe release of information about employee background checks and medical records and corporate secrets about negotiations and business deals .
President Obama
This year the U.S. government finally acknowledged that it withholds information about security vulnerabilities to exploit them , rather than passing the information on to software vendors and others to fix them . In making this revelation , the White House announced it was `` reinvigorating '' a so-called equities process designed to determine when to withhold and when to disclose‚Äîoverseen by the president 's National Security Council . Going forward , the NSA must disclose any vulnerabilities it discovers‚Äîunless the hole would be useful for intelligence agencies or law enforcement to exploit . But loopholes that allow law enforcement to retain zero-days in order to exploit them , and a decision process that does n't include an external oversight body like Congress , means the public has to trust important issues about security to a process that is n't transparent .
US Marshals
In a move so stunning that civil liberties groups are still shaking their heads over it , the U.S . Marshals Service in Florida made a Hail Mary to seize public records about a surveillance tool before the ACLU could obtain them . The civil liberties group had filed a public records request with the Sarasota , Florida , police department for information detailing its use of stingrays and had made an appointment to visit the facility where the documents were being held . But before they could get there , marshals swooped in to grab the recordsand abscond with them , claiming the police department did n't own them . The feds and local police around the country have gone to other extraordinary lengths to keep the public in the dark about their use of the tool . This was simply the boldest . ACLU staff attorney Nathan Freed Wessler called the move ‚Äú truly extraordinary and beyond the worst transparency violations ‚Äù his group had seen in the secrecy battle over the use of stingrays .
Verizon
Consider it the digital cookie monster that gobbles all your footprints . Verizon Wireless ran into trouble when a technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation noticed that the telecom had been tracking its wireless users online activity by subtly slipping a `` permacookie '' ‚Äîa string of about 50 letters , numbers , and characters‚Äîinto data flowing between users and the websites they visited . Users got the cookie whether they wanted to be tracked or not , since Verizon revealed there was no way to `` turn it off . '' AT & T was testing a similar system with its customers until the backlash prompted the telecom to stop the practice .
Gamma International
The British-German maker of the government spy tool FinFisher has claimed for years that it does n't sell its product to police and spy agencies in countries with oppressive regimes known for human rights violations . But this year a hacker broke into the company 's network , stole about 40 gigabytes of data and released it online . Among data published from the company were internal logs and documents leaked to WikiLeaks , which showed discussions between Bahraini officials and tech support workers for Gamma over problems officials were having with the software . They complained they were ‚Äú losing targets daily ‚Äù as a result of glitches with the spy tool and provided Gamma with a list of 13 computers they were targeting , all of which were based in the UK . Although the names of the victims were not directly identified , their IP addresses , user names , and unique computer names were all on the target list shared with Gamma . The human rights group Bahrain Watch analyzed the data and were able to identify three Bahrainian pro-democracy activists , who have been living in asylum in Great Britain after being imprisoned and tortured in Bahrain . In October , the UK civil liberties group Privacy International filed a criminal complaint against with the National Cyber Crime Unit of the National Crime Agency alleging that the company was criminally complicit in helping the Bahrain government engage in unlawful interception of communications‚Äîa violation of UK 's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000‚Äîand that Gamma was not only aware of the surveillance but actively assisted it . By selling and assisting Bahraini authorities in their surveillance , the complaint asserts , Gamma is liable as an accessory under the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 and is also guilty of encouraging and assisting the unlawful activity , a crime under the Serious Crime Act 2007 . The group wants the government to conduct a formal investigation , though so far the government has failed to respond to their complaint .
In one of her first public statements since taking three days off from campaigning to recover from pneumonia , Hillary Clinton expressed ‚Äú sympathy ‚Äù for former Secretary of State Colin Powell , who had two years of hacked email messages leaked this week . While she declined to comment on the specific content of Powell 's emails , Clinton told CNN 's Don Lemon on The Tom Joyner Radio Show that she has ‚Äú a great deal of respect for Colin Powell , and I have a lot of sympathy for anyone whose emails become public. ‚Äù Pivoting to the apparent perpetrators of the hack , she added , ‚Äú What I think is really important about the emails is the chilling fact , Don , that the Russians are continuing to attempt to interfere in our election . And I have to say I 'm increasingly concerned by how we 've seen Donald Trump 's alarming closeness with the Kremlin become more and more clear over the course of this campaign . It 's deeply concerning . ‚Äù
Among the revelations in Powell 's emails were his assertion that ‚Äú everything [ Hillary Clinton ] touches she kind of screws up with hubris ‚Äù and his description of her as ‚Äú greedy ‚Äù and ‚Äú not transformational. ‚Äù He had equally negative things to say about Donald Trump , calling him a ‚Äú national disgrace and an international pariah. ‚Äù But perhaps his harshest judgement was of Bill Clinton , who Powell suggested was ‚Äú still dicking bimbos at home . ‚Äù
Much of the discussion surrounding the yet-unapproved National Defense Authorization Act for 2011 has focused on the future of ‚Äú Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell. ‚Äù But the Senate version of this bill contains another controversial provision that would reverse the prohibition on use of military facilities for elective abortions , though women would have to pay for the services themselves . Although a small step , this would be an important advance toward recognizing the significant contribution that women bring to our armed forces .
Women make up approximately 14 percent of active duty forces , and 97 percent are of reproductive age . Like the general U.S. population , unintended pregnancy is common among women in the military , despite policies aimed at restricting sexual contact . The unfortunate reality is that not all sexual activity is consensual , with as many as one-third of female soldiers reporting being a victim of sexual assault .
Ibis Reproductive Health is conducting several studies aimed at understanding the experiences of women in the U.S. military seeking reproductive health care , and our research has uncovered many barriers faced by active duty soldiers . In an online survey , about one-quarter of women who had been deployed overseas reported difficulties obtaining a birth control method at military facilities . Women complained of problems making an appointment with a clinician to obtain contraception , the lack of availability of certain methods , an inability to get enough supplies at one time , as well as concerns about the confidentiality of services . Those who wanted an IUD before deployment found it particularly hard to access due to restrictions about who was eligible for the method‚Äîrestrictions that are not based on the most up-to-date clinical evidence .
But the biggest challenge is faced by military women deployed abroad who find themselves with an unintended pregnancy . Federal policy under U.S. Code 1093 states that no Department of Defense facility or funds may be used for abortion except when the life of the pregnant woman is at risk . If a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , the abortion may be performed at a military facility , but the woman must pay for it out of pocket . Despite these latter exceptions , and the known high rates of sexual assault against servicewomen , very few abortions take place at military facilities .

Why do women in the military decide to seek abortion ? In our research , women with an unintended pregnancy had a strong desire to complete their tour of duty and continue serving their country , and they did not want to disrupt their service by returning home because of the pregnancy . Beyond this , their reasons were similar to those of most women who make this difficult choice : because it 's the wrong time in their life to have a child , because they do n't have the financial resources to support a child , because they 're worried the pregnancy will adversely affect their career , or because they were raped , among others .
The ban on abortion care at military facilities is particularly difficult for women deployed in active combat zones , where their mobility is severely limited . In addition , abortion is illegal in Iraq and Afghanistan except to save the life of the pregnant woman , meaning most women ca n't access care off base . Indeed , a woman 's only option to access safe abortion care may be to take personal leave to return home and pay for the service herself . Such a requirement makes it difficult for a woman to keep her decision confidential and can delay accessing services . It also takes her away from the job she enlisted to do .
So what 's the solution ? Military policy needs to catch up with the recently issued U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use and make the full range of birth control options easily available to everyone‚Äîespecially long-term methods like the IUD or implants that would be most convenient during deployment . The recent decision to make emergency contraception a required medication on the military 's basic core formulary is an encouraging step , but more work is needed to ensure widespread access to all birth control methods .
And when a woman in the military is faced with an unintended pregnancy , she should have the same access to care and support as American women not in the military , regardless of whether she decides to continue the pregnancy or not . Supporting the troops means supporting their reproductive rights as well .
Associated Press photographer Paulo Duarte took the soccer photo of the decade ‚Äî if such a category exists .
Duarte caught what appears to be a ghost celebrating a goal in the now-famous image , according to 101 Great Goals . It happened on On Oct. 3 , when James Rodriguez scored in the 83rd minute to give FC Porto a 1-0 lead over Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) in the UEFA Champions League .
A delighted Rodriguez was running toward a teammate to celebrate when Duarte snapped the picture . The image has n't been altered in any way , and the original photo can be seen on the AP 's photo archive .
‚Äú The photo was taken by an AP photographer [ Duarte ] at the match , and it appears to show a silhouette of a man looking like he comes from another era , wearing clothes and a haircut from the mid 1900s , ‚Äù the report says . ‚Äú According to the experts , it would only have been possible to catch this image with a professional camera and the supposed ghost is too clear for it to be a blur or lighting issue . ‚Äù
Big spenders PSG has become one of world soccer 's must-see teams in the last year . Apparently word has spread to the other side , and the FC Porto ghost decided to see what all the fuss was about . See for yourself in the photo below ( via Twitter/ @ FootballReport ) .

If you own a notebook or handheld device equipped with accelerometers , which are more common part of these PCs , the new Firefox 3.6 will be able to use that part of the equipment .
The new version of Firefox is able to take data of the orientation of the device from the built-in accelerometer and inform application executed in the browser window . In Mozilla think that this feature is useful for early web-lab type games where the user controls the movement of an object with movement of device , such as ( from ‚Äú that ‚Äù time ) Marble Madness , for those which still remember it .
Of course , not exclude the possibility of some other applications outside of games , but in this moment nothing comes to mind‚Ä¶

Ted Wells is gon na need a bigger retainer .
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello tells PFT that the league has advised teams that potential violations of the rules regarding the three-day negotiating period will be investigated via memo sent Monday .
‚Äú The memo makes clear that we will look into any potential violations of the rules , ‚Äù Aiello said .
The question becomes how will the NFL look into potential violations ? Starting with the Sunday news that defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh will sign with the Dolphins , the floodgates opened , with multiple teams linked to multiple players .
Seahawks cornerback Byron Maxwell has said he 's going to Philly . So is running back Frank Gore . Meanwhile , Eagles receiver Jeremy Maclin reportedly is going to the Chiefs .
The list goes on and on , with plenty of teams doing exactly what the annual list of pre-free agency ‚Äú thou shalt nots ‚Äù says they shalt not do .
While it 's impossible for negotiations to not result in offers and , in turn , contracts , the league 's goal is discretion . In past years , teams have indeed been discreet .
This year , the only news that got out on Saturday involved players staying with current teams ( which is permissible ) . As of Sunday , all hell broke loose .
It 's highly unlikely that the NFL will sic Wells on most of the league 's franchises for phone records and text messages and emails that would demonstrate offers were made and deals were done when teams and agents were supposed to be simply negotiating . The more likely goal of the memo is to get teams to go back to the days when we knew offers were being made and deals were being done .
We just did n't know who and where and for how much .
Woman unable to open eyes 3 days a week : report
Posted
An Australian woman is blind three days out of every six because her eyes involuntarily shut and she can not open them , a report has said .
The woman 's mysterious medical condition has left doctors puzzled .
Natalie Adler , who experts believe may be the only person in the world with this condition , said she has had this medical predicament since she was 17 .
`` I woke one Sunday and my eyes were swollen . It was the day before an English exam , '' the 21-year-old told Melbourne 's Herald Sun .
`` My eyes started closing intermittently , really randomly , but within a few weeks they were closing for three days [ at a time ] . ''
Doctors from the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital said Ms Adler 's condition was baffling .
`` She 's a one-off and we do n't have a diagnosis , '' said Professor Justin O'Day of the hospital 's neuro-ophthalmology department .
`` It 's unusual to see somebody with this degree of spasming and eyelid closure , especially at this age . There is no known cause . ''
Professor O'Day said the medical condition blepharospasm , which causes an involuntary closing of the eyes , could be used as a reference but that it did not explain why Ms Adler 's eyes closed according to a routine .
Botox treatment
When Ms Adler 's eyes are closed , she can not see at all except through a small slit in her left eye . On the days when they are open , she can see clearly but her left eyelid droops .
For almost two years , doctors treated her by injecting Botox around her eyes , allowing her to see for five days out of six .
But the treatment no longer works for Ms Adler , who also suffers from fatigue and nausea , and she is now hopeful that electrical stimulation tests around her eyes might help .
Ms Adler plans her life around her condition , but still misses some important dates .
`` On my 18th birthday , my eyes were closed , but on my 21st they were open , so I had a party , '' she said .
`` Not being able to go to the football or seeing my friends as much is what I miss the most . ''

Jung Yeon-Je , AFP | Replicas of North Korean Scud-B missile and South Korean Hawk surface-to-air missiles are displayed at the Korean War Memorial in Seoul on July 8 , 2016 .
North Korea fired a ballistic missile from a submarine on Saturday but it appears to have failed soon after launch , South Korea 's military said .

The launch comes at the end of a week of sharply rising tensions on the peninsula . It is only a day after the U.S. and South Korea pledged to deploy an advanced anti-missile system to counter threats from Pyongyang , and two days after North Korea warned it was planning its toughest response to what it deemed a ‚Äú declaration of war ‚Äù by the United States .
That followed Washington 's blacklisting of the isolated state 's leader Kim Jong-un for alleged human rights abuses .
The South 's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile was launched at about 11:30 a.m. Seoul time ( 0230 GMT ) in waters east of the Korean peninsula .
The missile was likely fired from a submarine as planned but appears to have failed in the early stage of flight , the Joint Chiefs said .
South Korea 's Yonhap news agency said the missile 's engine successfully ignited but the projectile soon exploded in mid-air at a height of about 10 km ( 6 miles ) , and covered not more than a few kilometers across the water .
The South 's military declined to confirm those details .
The missile was detected in the sea southeast of the North Korean city of Sinpo , South Korea 's military said . Satellite images indicate Pyongyang is actively trying to develop its submarine-launched ballistic missile programme in this area , according to experts .
Abe condemns
Neighbouring Japan , the United States , and South Korea 's military condemned the missile launch as a flagrant violation of U.N. sanctions .
The missile launch is a ‚Äú clear challenge to U.N. Security Council resolutions , ‚Äù Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Saturday , according to Kyodo news agency .
‚Äú We should strongly condemn the launch by working with the international community , ‚Äù Abe told reporters .
Abe said the launch did not gravely affect Japan 's national security .
The U.S. said it was monitoring and assessing the situation in close coordination with its regional allies and partners .
‚Äú We strongly condemn North Korea 's missile test in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions , which explicitly prohibit North Korea 's use of ballistic missile technology , ‚Äù said Gabrielle Price , spokeswoman for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the U.S. Department of State .
‚Äú These actions , and North Korea 's continued pursuit of ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities , pose a significant threat to the United States , our allies , and to the stability of the greater Asia-Pacific , ‚Äù she added .
The North has conducted a string of military tests that began in January with its fourth nuclear test and included the launch of a long-range rocket the following month .
The U.N. Security Council imposed harsh new sanctions on the country in March for its nuclear test and rocket launch .
North Korea rejects the sanctions as infringement of its sovereignty and its right to space exploration .
South Korea and the United States said on Friday they would deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) anti-missile system with the U.S. military in South Korea to counter the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea , drawing a sharp and swift protest from neighbouring China , Pyongyang 's sole major ally .
Pyongyang also conducted a test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile ( SLBM ) in April , calling it a ‚Äú great success ‚Äù that provided ‚Äú one more means for powerful nuclear attack ‚Äù .
A report on 38 North , a website run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in the U.S. , said in May that North Korea 's submarine-launched ballistic missile program is making progress , but it appeared that the first ballistic missile submarine and operational missiles are unlikely to become operational before 2020 .

10 Galleries : Rutgers-Camden students rally against proposed merger with Rowan University
By Jarrett Renshaw and Kelly Heyboer/ The Star-Ledger
TRENTON ‚Äî After a long and stormy session , state legislators cobbled together a new version of a higher education reorganization plan Monday night that supporters hope to get the through the state Legislature despite unanswered questions about its cost .
The new version of the plan will delay the reshuffling of Rutgers University , the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Rowan University by a year , until July 2013 , so that the costs do not affect next year 's state budget , lawmakers said .
The bill 's sponsors also agreed to a series of sweeping amendments to the original bill that will give more power to the Rutgers-Newark campus , protect University Hospital in Newark , honor union contracts and prevent layoffs on all three campuses for at least 12 months .
Those changes were intended to win over Essex County politicians , union leaders and other critics who had threatened to derail the controversial proposal .
The hearing was at once confusing and frustrating for lawmakers , particularly state Sen. Paul Sarlo ( D-Bergen ) , chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee .
`` I do n't even know what to make of this hearing anymore , '' said an exasperated Sarlo , who left his seat several times to talk to Senate President Stephen Sweeney , the architect of the measure , and his staff .
Few in attendance had answers to crucial questions about how much the sweeping proposal would cost , including two Treasury officials who were quickly dismissed by an angry Sarlo .
The only person who seemed to have a grasp of the financial complexities was Candace Straight , an appointee of Gov . Chris Christie to the 11-member Rutgers Board of Governors .
Straight said questions remained about how much the restructuring would cost Rutgers if the state did n't help defray some of the expenses , including the cost of absorbing UMDNJ 's debt and such liabilities as lingering medical malpractice suits .
For Rutgers to take over a school like UMDNJ losing so much money carries a huge financial risk , she said , noting that a $ 100 million loss would equal a 15 percent increase in tuition .
`` I do n't want to finance this on the backs of New Jersey families , '' Straight said .
She blasted the deal , then said she said it was an `` excellent '' plan but lacked crucial financial details . And she eventually told lawmakers she would vote against the bill if she were they , sending Democratic staffers into damage-control mode .
To further confound observers , Straight issued a statement on Rutgers stationery an hour after her testimony saying : `` Certain aspects of my testimony may have left an unclear impression about my position on the merger bill . ''
She said that if amendments she had discussed were inserted , `` I fully support the bill . ''
Finally , despite a yawning lack of financial information , the committee unanimously advanced the measure , sending it to the full Senate . The embattled plan still faces hurdles in the Assembly , where it has yet to be taken up .
And even if the full Legislature approves some variation of the reorganization plan , the Rutgers Board of Governors and Board of Trustees have retained a law firm and may well challenge the entire arrangement in court .
That said , the changes to the original plan ‚Äî submitted as an alternative to a proposal by Christie that got the ball rolling ‚Äî appeared to have swayed two crucial Essex County lawmakers , Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver and Newark Mayor Cory Booker , who held a closed-door meeting with North Jersey lawmakers today to rally support .
It is unclear if the private negotiations will be enough to get a basic agreement in place by the end of the month , the deadline imposed by the governor , who supports the Legislature 's plan .
State Sens . Joseph Vitale and Donald Norcross , the main sponsors of the Senate bill , and their staff members struggled to answer questions about the cost of the merger during the hearing , that stretched into the evening .
The legislators said Rutgers and Rowan would absorb most of the costs of the merger over several years , without additional state aid . But they offered no total dollar figure . An estimate of $ 40 million to $ 50 million given by Rutgers officials applied to an earlier version of the merger proposal but not the amended plan , they said .
The state Treasury Department offered testimony , but few details , on the price tag . A four-page fiscal note prepared by the department also failed to determine a total price tag and did not consider the cost of the last-minute amendments .
`` The department may prepare additional , more detailed analysis when the bill language has been finalized , '' the note said .
The basics of the proposed restructuring remain the same : UMDNJ would be broken up and Rutgers would take over most of its medical and dental schools in North and Central Jersey . University Hospital in Newark would become its own entity and partner with a private hospital system .
In South Jersey , Rowan University in Glassboro would take over UMDNJ 's School of Osteopathic Medicine . Rowan would also partner with Rutgers-Camden , which would cut financial ties from the university while keeping some academic ties with Rutgers ' main campus in New Brunswick .
Among the changes to the plan announced today :
‚Ä¢ A new chancellor 's post would be created to oversee the parts of UMDNJ being taken over Rutgers in Newark . The chancellor would report to Rutgers ' president , just like the current Rutgers-Newark chancellor . Rutgers-Newark would also get its own board of governors to help oversee the campus .
‚Ä¢ New seats would be added to Rutgers Board of Governors , including two that must go to residents of Essex County and one to a resident of Middlesex County . Those seats would help ensure the regions have more of a say in how the university is run .
‚Ä¢ University Hospital in Newark would get `` sufficient '' funding from the state and other protections to help it continue to provide charity care to a low-income Newark residents , even if it partners with a private hospital company to run its day-to-day operations .
Earlier in the day , Assembly Speaker Oliver and Newark Mayor Booker held a closed-door gathering with North Jersey lawmakers today in Trenton to detail the deal they negotiated to get their support for the merger plan , according to sources who attended but were not authorized to discuss the meeting .
Their demands included the new Rutgers chancellor in Newark , additional protections for University Hospital and more seats on the Rutgers board for Essex County residents . The changes to the legislation are designed to appease some of the concerns of North Jersey lawmakers , including those in Newark who said the higher education reorganization deal would help Camden at Newark 's expense .
Sources said there is still some division among Essex County legislators over whether to go along with the deal struck by Booker and Oliver . But the support of Oliver , the highest-ranking Assembly Democrat , is one of the keys to getting the higher education reorganization approved .
But it is unclear if the changes in the legislation , which is still evolving , are enough to win the support of Rutgers officials , including members of the Rutgers Board of Trustees . Some trustees , who oversee a portion of Rutgers ' assets , have threatened to sue if the reorganization is passed .
Rutgers University officials said today they have retained the international law firm Hogan Lovells to advise school leaders on the legal issues surrounding the reorganization .
`` The firm will augment the university 's existing team of in-house and outside legal representation to advise the Board of Governors , the Board of Trustees and the administration , '' Rutgers officials said in a statement .
The alt-left is at it again . This time they are using their Internet and media echo chamber to malign Steve Bannon , concocting a narrative that is false but endlessly repeated by their soldiers in the never-ending campaign to discredit conservatives and members of the Trump camp . Playing the race card in all its variations has become the modus operandi of the liberal/left political world .
Mr. Bannon , who has been appointed chief White House adviser and political strategist for Mr. Trump , has been a staunch and reliable friend of Israel 's , and hired a host of Jewish journalists throughout his leadership at the conservative Breitbart news magazine . His ardent support for the Jewish state has remained consistent , even as many liberal Jewish organizations were condemning Israel and spouting fashionable anti-Israel criticisms emanating from the Left .
Like Mr. Trump before him ‚Äî who for four decades was known as a champion of Israel 's ; was generous in charitable contributions to it ; and easily hired Jews and routinely accommodated their religious Sabbath needs ‚Äî Mr. Bannon began to be accused of being anti-Jewish when he came on board the Trump Express to install a patriotic and politically conservative legislative approach at odds with the liberal agenda .
The Anti-Defamation League this week accused Mr. Bannon of antisemitism because , in its words , he is associated with nationalistic movements and antisemitic white supremacist groups . I have seen no credible evidence that he is associated with any antisemitic groups , though he , like me , is an American nationalist . In the ADL 's founding years , its mission was to combat antisemitism , but in the last few decades it , like some other establishment Jewish organizations , appears to have become an ideological arm of the Democratic party , viewing all of American life through the prism of a neo-leftist agenda no longer rooted in classical liberalism .
Thus , for them , as seen in their publications , the innocuous term ‚Äú western values ‚Äù becomes a code phrase for the exclusion of non-whites , and the term ‚Äú America First ‚Äù becomes a racist one . To most Americans , however , putting America and its citizens first is the most natural thing a nation should try doing ‚Äî whether in relation to employment , security or pride in its historic outlook and values , in this case our founding principles and Judeo-Christian ethos .
While the ADL considers the predilection towards nationalism a disguised attempt to exclude or persecute Jews and others , to most sane people , nationalism amounts to an expression of pride in one 's country and her values , which in America 's case is something to be proud of indeed . Loving one 's country and its western values , or having pride and finding comfort in one 's ethnicity or race ( even if white ) are not disqualifying features in a human being .
Those who see in American individuals proud of their Christian faith or their European ancestry people to be feared are themselves either very insecure or harbor a bigotry and discomfort with those in the majority . Truth be told , in liberal establishment organizational circles , the feeling is that nobility and fair-mindedness reside only in minority communities , while the majority , in this case Christians and whites , are automatically suspect unless they prove otherwise , with advocating liberalism and cultural self-effacement as their only redeemable options .
The new head of the ADL , Jonathan Greenblatt , is a former member of the Obama administration . Like so many leaders of today 's establishment Jewish organizations , he is a high-level advocate for the leftism characteristic of the George Soros agenda . This is in spite of Soros having called his collaboration with the Nazis in Hungary during WWII ‚Äú an exciting and happy time for me . ‚Äù
Like so many others , some non-observant , secular Jewish leaders have replaced their Judaism with liberalism , giving it transcendence above all else , making it their new religion and calling . In fact , Greenblatt and the ADL have recently become eager and severe critics of Israel 's necessary defense policies ‚Äî and this may be indicative of an alarming trend in the secular Jewish community of abandoning Israel when supporting it implies a conflict with the socialism and multi-culturalism it holds dearer and which has become divine-like in these circles .
After the election showed that many Orthodox Jews voted for Mr. Trump because of years of humiliating anti-Israel bias in the Obama administration ‚Äî as well as Obama 's and Mrs. Clinton 's enabling and masterminding of Iran 's catapult to nuclear power ‚Äî many Jewish liberals have begun speaking of their desire to ‚Äú forget Israel 's needs if it makes the liberal agenda harder to realize : vote liberal , for the liberal agenda reigns supreme above all else . ‚Äù
During the 2012 Democratic Party Convention , there were tremendous boos when support of Israel and Jerusalem as Israel 's eternal capital was proposed . This was orchestrated , as seen on TV , by hundreds of delegates . Indeed , the Black Lives Matter movement has also spoken in rabid anti-Jewish and anti Israel terms . The ADL has not denounced them and remains their defender , just as have Clinton and Obama . The ADL and the Reform Jewish movement knew full well of Obama 's association with Rev . Wright , Rashid Khalidi and Al Sharpton , all of whom are known for antisemitic statements . Yet , regardless of the preponderance of anti-Israel leading lights on the Left , and thousands of anti-Jewish people found in the Democratic party , the ADL and the Reform denomination retain their affiliation and affection for the left-wing community , ignoring its blatant antisemitism .
The Jewish members of the alt-left are eager to turn neutral and positive phrases into antisemitism and cast friends like Bannon and Trump ( the latter with religious Jewish grandchildren ) into figures to be feared , jeered at and demonized as ‚Äú deplorables. ‚Äù Why ? Because they have sold their souls to the ideology of leftism and class warfare . It has become their identity . Their power resides in the Democratic party , and power is a powerful aphrodisiac .
These organizations have not accepted , nor will genuinely accept , the results of the election . They will try to stop Trump 's policies and thwart the will of the people they consider inferior and non-educated , by tarring and discrediting Trump 's appointees as racist and antisemitic . They are setting up tribunals that label their opponents ‚Äú hate-mongers , ‚Äù when it is they themselves who are behaving in a bigoted and hateful fashion . Too many are whipping themselves up into hysteria , based on prejudicial presumptions they themselves have created over the years . We should no longer allow them to impugn good , patriotic individuals .
Unlike what the ADL , the alt-left and the Reform Jewish movement claim , the American people voted for Mr. Trump not out of racism or antisemitism , but because they and their families had become voiceless and ignored , with legitimate needs that for decades were dismissed by the elites ‚Äî and now , finally , are championed by Mr. Trump and his newly appointed adviser , Steve Bannon . May God bless them and their work for America .

Mystery of Sleepless Boy Solved Boy Who Could n't Sleep Undergoes Risky , Life-Changing Operation
Not long ago , saying goodnight to his mom and dad was nearly impossible for 3-year-old Rhett Lamb . In a case that baffled doctors , Rhett was awake nearly 24 hours a day .
`` His body would give out but his mind would n't ; he 'd still be awake , '' said Rhett 's mom , Shannon Lamb . `` He 'd still be alert . It was extremely scary . ''
One of the side effects of Rhett 's lack of sleep was bad behavior
`` He was in a bad mood all the time , '' Lamb said . `` He could n't play , he did n't interact with other children . His frustration level was so high , and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse . He could n't communicate with anyone . It was heartbreaking . ''
Rhett 's temper got so bad he would hit his mother , even giving her black eyes .
`` He would hit you , he would bite you , he would head butt you and anything else around him , and you did n't know from one minute to the next what was going to happen , '' she said .
Rhett 's dad David Lamb said , `` It was like he was losing his mind and there was nothing we could do to help him . ''
The Lambs , who live in St. Petersburg , Fla. , arranged opposite work shifts so one of them could stay home and take care of Rhett .
`` You get to the point where you ca n't function anymore and you ca n't think straight , and you get up in the morning and you take a shower to go to work and you drive to work and you 're a robot , '' Shannon Lamb said . `` You are an absolute robot . And then you dread coming home 'cause you know it 's the same thing . ''
Finally , a Diagnosis
After dozens of doctors ' visits and years of conflicting opinions , Rhett was finally diagnosed with a rare brain condition called chiari malformation .
Chiari malformation is a neurological disorder in which the bottom part of the brain , the cerebellum , descends out of the skull and crowds the spinal cord , putting pressure on both the brain and spine , causing a number of symptoms , including sleeplessness .
Once diagnosed , doctors were able to perform a risky surgery that offered a 50-50 chance Rhett would be able to sleep normally for the first time .
Rhett Up to Speed
Dr. Gerald Tuite , a pediatric neurosurgeon at All Children 's Hospital in St. Petersberg , made an incision from the base of Rhett 's skull to the top of his neck to remove bone around the brain stem and around the spinal cord , producing more space and reducing the pressure .
The surgery was a success . Rhett was finally able to sleep through the night , and his behavior improved dramatically .
Because of the disease , he was functioning at the level of an 18-month-old and could n't even speak . But in a matter of months , he has almost caught up to his peers , and for the first time in his life , he is interacting with other children .
It 's a time the Lambs thought would never come .
`` You could n't give him a hug or touch him or anything , and now he walks through the door and wants a big hug , '' Shannon Lamb said . `` And it 's heartbreaking at this point because you just look at him and think , 'This is something I never thought I would have . ' ''

‚Äî Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors , the record-setting duo known as the `` Splash Brothers '' for their long-distance prowess , fellow All-Stars James Harden of the Houston Rockets and Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers , and the player on pace for a historic shooting season , Kyle Korver of the Atlanta Hawks , will showcase their range in the 2015 Foot Locker Three-Point Contest on Saturday , Feb. 14 , at Barclays Center in Brooklyn , N.Y . The eight-player field also features defending champion Marco Belinelli of the San Antonio Spurs , the Portland Trail Blazers ' Wesley Matthews and J.J. Redick of the Los Angeles Clippers .
The Foot Locker Three-Point Contest is part of State Farm¬Æ All-Star Saturday Night , which will be exclusively televised by TNT . This marks Turner Sports ' 30th year of NBA All-Star coverage .
Curry , the top vote-getter in NBA All-Star Balloting 2015 presented by Sprint , became the fastest player to hit 1,000 3-point field goals in NBA history when , on Jan. 8 , he accomplished the feat in his 369th game . He drilled 10 treys in a season-high 51-point performance against the Dallas Mavericks on Feb. 4 , becoming the second player in league history ( along with J.R. Smith ) to have multiple games of at least 10 makes from long range . The sixth-year guard will be competing in his fourth Foot Locker Three-Point Contest , and he 'll also participate in the Degree Shooting Stars during State Farm All-Star Saturday Night .
Thompson , a first-time All-Star , set an NBA record for most points in a quarter on Jan. 23 against the Sacramento Kings , piling up 37 in the third period of a career-high 52-point barrage that included 11 treys and a league-record nine in one quarter . Curry and Thompson are the only teammates ever to combine for 400 treys in back-to-back seasons .
Harden , the league 's leading scorer ( 27 points per game ) and the Kia NBA Western Conference Player of the Month for both December and January , ranks fifth in both 3-pointers made ( 130 ) and attempted ( 336 ) . The All-Star quartet is rounded out by Irving , the 2013 Foot Locker Three-Point Contest winner . Irving sank a Cavs-record 11 three-pointers during a career-high 55-point outburst against Portland on Jan. 28 , a performance that helped him earn NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors .
Korver leads the NBA in 3-point accuracy at 53.2 percent , and his 53.6 percent shooting through 41 games was the highest mark in league history at the halfway point of the season . Set to make his third appearance in the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest and first since 2005 , Korver is on track to become the first player among qualifiers ever to shoot at least 50 percent from the field , 50 percent from beyond the arc and 90 percent from the free-throw line .
Belinelli will defend the crown he won by defeating Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal in New Orleans in 2014 . Matthews leads the NBA in 3-pointers made ( 151 ) and attempted ( 376 ) . The Clippers ' Redick is enjoying a career year from deep , connecting on 43.2 percent and threatening to shatter his previous high of 165 triples in a season ( he is currently at 114 ) .
In the two-round competition , five shooting locations are positioned around the 3-point arc . Four of the racks contain four orange balls ( each worth one point ) and one multi-colored `` money '' ball ( worth two points ) . The fifth rack will be a special `` all money ball '' rack , which each participant can place at any of the five shooting locations . Every ball on this rack will be worth two points . The players have one minute to shoot as many as the 25 balls as they can . The three competitors with the highest scores in the first round advance to the championship round . Complete rules can be found at mediacentral.nba.com .

PORTLAND ‚Äì The University of Southern Maine plans to stop offering degrees in physics because of low enrollment , and the school 's president said Thursday that other programs could follow .
The decision to cut the physics major shocked students and prompted professors to vow a fight .
Additional Photos Edward Gleason , manager of the Southworth Planetarium at USM , talks about the possible elimination of the physics major at the university on Thursday , Sept. 12 , 2013 . Gordon Chibroski / Staff Photographer University of Southern Maine physics students work on physics problems Thursday , Sept. 13 , 2013 as physics professor Paul Nakroshis , second from left , helps Ramses Damayo , left , a junior at USM . The university is eliminating the physics major because of under-utilization . Other physics majors are junior Deb Hilton , second from right , and senior Trevor Hamer , right .
‚Äú You ca n't call yourself a university if you eliminate something as basic as physics , ‚Äù said associate physics professor Paul Nakroshis . ‚Äú It 's not over . ‚Äù
On Wednesday , Provost and Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Michael Stevenson told Nakroshis and department Chairman Jerry LaSala to suspend enrollment of new physics majors immediately and form a plan to dissolve the major , incorporating the staff and classes into other departments .
Eighteen students are now in the program , which generally graduates three or four a year . They will be allowed to finish .
The department has four professors , one of whom plans to retire in 2014 .
Introductory physics courses , which students need for many other science degree programs , will continue . But USM will stop offering upper-level courses , about four a year , that are required for the physics degree but regularly have only five or six students .
Stevenson also said in a memo to department heads that the popular Southworth Planetarium , part of the physics department , could be closed . The planetarium , which is the only one in southern Maine , attracts more than 17,000 people a year for a variety of programs .
University officials said Thursday that they intend to keep it open , but Stevenson told the physics department ‚Äú to develop a plan for its use ‚Ä¶ or recommend its closure . ‚Äù
Stevenson was not available for comment Thursday .
OTHER PROGRAMS MAY BE CUT
Ending the physics major is simply a financial decision , said USM President Theodora Kalikow , because the upper-level courses consistently have fewer than 12 students , a baseline for enrollment .
‚Äú The financial situation and the academic situation at this campus needs to be addressed , ‚Äù Kalikow said .
‚Äú ( Physics ) is not the only program we are looking at , ‚Äù she said . ‚Äú It 's their turn . There are other programs in different areas , and it will be their turn , too . ‚Äù
Kalikow would not say what other programs , or how many other programs , are being considered for elimination .
‚Äú We have to stop doing many things that are unproductive , ‚Äù she said .
STUDENTS SHOCKED , INCREDULOUS
Many students heard about the university 's plan Thursday morning .
‚Äú Walking around out there , you can tell which ones have heard the news . They all look like they 're in mourning , ‚Äù said assistant physics professor Julie Ziffer , motioning toward the hallways outside the physics department offices . ‚Äú They look shocked . ‚Äù
A handful of physics students who were doing homework between classes said they could n't believe the school would make such a move .
‚Äú This is so bad , ‚Äù said junior Ramses Tamayo , looking up from pages of handwritten formulas scattered on a lab table in front of him . Across the table , senior Trevor Hamer agreed .
‚Äú Isaac Newton would be rolling in his grave , ‚Äù Hamer said . ‚Äú I think it 's ridiculous . ‚Äù
Nakroshis said he plans to get the Faculty Senate involved and make a case to keep the major , which was created in 1987 .
‚Äú Do n't worry , ‚Äù Nakroshis told the students . ‚Äú I 'm not going to let it go down without a fight . ‚Äù
Nakroshis , who has taught at USM for 16 years , said he has never before had upper-level physics courses cut because of low enrollment .
Besides hurting USM 's ability to attract top instructors and students , cutting the major does n't make sense because the department , on average , has large classes and makes money , he said . Introductory physics courses regularly have more than 100 students .
‚Äú There 's no financial argument , ‚Äù said Nakroshis , who did a comprehensive review of the department in 2012 , when he served as its chair .
Kalikow said the financial concern is professors teaching small numbers of students , not the average class size or department budget .
UNDER-ENROLLED CLASSES A TARGET
Ziffer said USM 's decision contradicts an effort touted by state and education officials to get more students involved in science , technology , engineering and math . She said physics graduates go on to high-wage jobs and start businesses in the area .
The median annual salary for a physicist is $ 105,430 , according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Physics is also the basis for various careers in manufacturing , engineering , scientific research , biology and astronomy , among other disciplines .
‚Äú We are producing people who contribute , who have high impact , ‚Äù Ziffer said .
Two students in the program now are in USM 's three-year-old Pioneer Program , which gives full scholarships to top students from Maine .
‚Äú I 'm worried about being able to get classes , ‚Äù said Tyler Nelson , a freshman who is in the Pioneer Program and double-majoring in physics and math . ‚Äú I feel like they are pushing around the small majors . ‚Äù
Small majors and under-enrolled classes have been under the microscope throughout the University of Maine System since 2010 , when its trustees instituted the ‚Äú Rule of Five ‚Äù ‚Äî that each major should graduate at least five students a year ‚Äî and the ‚Äú Rule of Twelve ‚Äù ‚Äî requiring that classes have at least 12 students or be cut .
USM spokesman Robert Caswell said the school cut 47 classes this fall because of low enrollment , including one upper-level physics course in which only four students were enrolled . Of the 1,599 undergraduate classes remaining , 187 have fewer than 12 students .
Physics is not the first major to be cut under the Rule of Five at USM , Caswell said . German and Russian were cut in recent years because of low enrollment .
Since 2009 , the school has added majors in sports management and in tourism and hospitality , and a doctorate in nursing practice .
The physics department went through the same review and threat of elimination several years ago , but the USM president and provost at the time came to a different conclusion , recommending that the department get more resources .
‚Äú Well , of course they came to different conclusions , ‚Äù Kalikow said Thursday . ‚Äú It was two , three years ago . That was a different world . It was before frozen tuition , before even more declining enrollments , and before state appropriations were level , at best .
‚Äú We have to serve the students in the most effective way with the resources we have , ‚Äù she said .
Under Stevenson 's proposal , the department must respond to the plan by May 31 . The decision to eliminate the major needs approval from Kalikow and then the UMaine System 's board of trustees .
PLANETARIUM LOSES MONEY
The physics department also oversees the popular but money-losing Southworth Planetarium . LaSala , the department chair , is the director of the planetarium .
Planetarium Manager Edward Gleason said Thursday that he did n't know of any plan to close the facility and , in fact , recent shows such as the current ‚Äú Dinosaurs at Dusk ‚Äù have been among the venue 's biggest draws .
‚Äú We 're generally used every day , year round , ‚Äù said Gleason , who has managed the planetarium since 1999 .
‚Äú We have concerts , poetry , mythology classes , science classes . It 's very popular . ‚Ä¶ especially with school groups and for this dinosaur show , ‚Äù he said , gesturing to the program running on the ceiling .
But the planetarium , which was built in 1970 , generally loses $ 13,500 to $ 19,600 a year , Caswell said . Recent shows and aggressive marketing have reduced the losses .
Although Stevenson 's memo suggests that the planetarium could close , Kalikow said Thursday that the university intends to keep it open .
‚Äú I do n't want it to close , ‚Äù she said . ‚Äú I want it to be better . ‚Äù
The closest planetariums in Maine are at Bates College in Lewiston , the University of Maine in Orono , Maine Maritime Academy in Castine and Lee Academy in Lee , southeast of Millinocket .

MANILA , PhilippinesThe death toll from a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck the central Philippine island of Bohol on Tuesday rose to 93 , as rescuers struggled to reach patients in a collapsed hospital . Centuries-old stone churches crumbled and wide areas were without power .
Bohol police chief Dennis Agustin said 77 of the deaths came from the province . At least 15 others died in nearby Cebu province and another on Siquijor Island .
The quake struck at 8:12 a.m. and was centered about 20 miles below Carmen city , where many small buildings collapsed .
Many roads and bridges were reported damaged , making rescue operations difficult . But historic churches dating from the Spanish colonial period suffered the most . Among them was the country 's oldest , the 16th-century Basilica of the Holy Child in Cebu , which lost its bell tower .
Nearly half of a 17th-century limestone church in Loboc town , southwest of Carmen , was reduced to rubble .
The highest number of dead - 18 - were in the municipality of Loon , 26 miles west of Carmen , where an unknown number of patients were trapped inside the Congressman Castillo Memorial Hospital , which partially collapsed . Rescuers were working to reach them , said civil defense spokesman Maj. Reynaldo Balido .
As night fell , the entire province was in the dark after the quake cut power supplies . Windy weather and rain also forced back a military rescue helicopter .
Authorities were setting up tents for those displaced by the quake , while others who lost their homes moved in with their relatives , Bohol Gov . Edgardo Chatto said .
Extensive damage also hit densely populated Cebu city , across a narrow strait from Bohol , causing deaths when a building in the port and the roof of a market area collapsed .
The quake set off two stampedes in nearby cities . When it struck , people gathered in a gym in Cebu rushed outside in a panic , crushing five people to death and injuring eight others , said Neil Sanchez , provincial disaster management officer .

`` We ran out of the building , and outside , we hugged trees because the tremors were so strong , '' said Vilma Yorong , a provincial government employee in Bohol .
`` When the shaking stopped , I ran to the street and there I saw several injured people . Some were saying their church has collapsed , '' she told The Associated Press by phone .
As fear set in , Yorong and the others ran up a mountain , afraid a tsunami would follow the quake . `` Minutes after the earthquake , people were pushing each other to go up the hill , '' she said .
But the quake was centered inland and did not cause a tsunami .
Offices and schools were closed for a national holiday - the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha - which may have saved lives .
The earthquake also was deeper below the surface than a 6.9-magnitude temblor last year in waters near Negros Island , also in the central Philippines , that killed nearly 100 people .
Aledel Cuizon said the quake that caught her in her bedroom sounded like `` a huge truck that was approaching and the rumbling sound grew louder as it got closer . ''
She and her neighbors ran outside , where she saw concrete electric poles `` swaying like coconut trees . '' It lasted 15-20 seconds , she said .
Cebu city 's hospitals quickly moved patients into the streets , basketball courts and parks .
Cebu province , about 350 miles south of Manila , has a population of more than 2.6 million people . Cebu is the second largest city after Manila . Nearby Bohol has 1.2 million people and is popular among foreigners because of its beach and island resorts and famed Chocolate Hills .
President Benigno Aquino III said he would travel to Bohol and Cebu on Wednesday .
Regional military commander Lt. Gen. Roy Deveraturda said he recalled soldiers from holiday furlough to respond to the quake . He said it damaged the pier in Tagbilaran , Bohol 's provincial capital , and caused some cracks at Cebu 's international airport but that navy ships and air force planes could use alternative ports to help out .
The Philippine archipelago is located in the Pacific `` Ring of Fire , '' where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common . A magnitude-7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people on the northern island of Luzon in 1990 .

The Bank of Canada has increased its benchmark interest rate for the second time this year , a sign that the economy is improving enough to allow borrowing costs to rise from historic lows reached in the aftermath of the global financial crisis .
The overnight lending rate was raised to 1 per cent from 0.75 per cent . The move followed a rate hike in July , the first since 2010 . Until this summer , the benchmark rate had been locked at 0.5 per cent for two years as the country adjusted to the challenge that low oil prices posed for an already sluggish economy .
When the Bank of Canada changes its benchmark rate , the move ripples through to other interest rates , including those of mortgages . With that in mind , here is a guide to how the rate hike will affect homeowners and prospective buyers .
Story continues below advertisement
Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages
There is no immediate impact on payments for existing mortgages . Only when the mortgage comes up for renewal would higher rates affect payments .
The interest rate on fixed-rate mortgages is influenced by the interest rates on bonds issued by the federal government , not the Bank of Canada 's overnight rate .
But if the central bank is confident enough about the economy to start pushing the overnight rate higher , expect interest rates in the bond market to rise as well . This explains how an increase in the overnight rate can indirectly affect fixed-rate mortgages .
How will your mortgage payments change ?
For those with a fixed-rate mortgage that will come up for renewal , we 've created the following tool to see how your monthly payments could change .
First , figure out the mortgage amount remaining at the start of your next term , and the remaining amortization . ( Talk to your mortgage lender to find out , or use a calculator like this one to get a rough idea . ) If you wish to compare mortgage payments , check your mortgage statement to find your current monthly payment . Finally , test out some higher interest rates than you 're now paying .
Current monthly payment ( $ ) ( add this if you want to calculate the difference ) Mortgage amount at renewal ( $ ) Amortization period at renewal ( years ) Interest Rate ( % ) Monthly cost would be :
* Notes : Calculation assumes biannual compounding . Results are for illustrative purposes only . Contact your mortgage broker for an official figure .
Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages
The interest cost on variable-rate mortgages is pegged to your lender 's prime rate , minus whatever discount you negotiated . The prime rate is in turn guided by the Bank of Canada 's benchmark overnight rate . Payments on most variable-rate mortgages will be adjusted higher in a matter of days or weeks to reflect an increase in the overnight and prime rates .

Canada 's largest banks raised their prime rates on Wednesday after the central bank 's decision , matching the 25-basis-point move . Royal Bank of Canada was the first to respond , raising its prime rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 3.2 per cent .
With some variable-rate mortgages , payments remain the same for the duration of the term . But there are adjustments going on in the background . As rates rise , more of your payment goes toward paying interest and fewer goes toward the principal . This will increase the amount of time it takes to pay off your mortgage unless you increase payments on renewal .
Borrowers tend to use the term `` variable-rate mortgage '' to describe all mortgages where rates can fluctuate during the term of the loan . However , lenders use the term `` adjustable-rate mortgage '' to describe mortgages where payments are reset according to changes in the lender 's prime rate . Variable-rate mortgages technically apply to those where the mix of principal and interest changes , but not the amount of the payment .
One final note : Toronto-Dominion Bank is an example of a lender that has a `` mortgage prime rate , '' a unique in-house rate used for pricing variable-rate mortgages . TD 's mortgage prime has been higher than its conventional prime rate . After the central bank 's hike in July , TD raised its mortgage prime rate by 0.25 of a percentage point to 3.1 per cent .
Prospective buyers
It could become tougher to qualify for home ownership .
Federal rules unveiled last fall require home buyers with a down payment of less than 20 per cent to `` stress test '' their ability to carry mortgage payments at whichever is greater : the negotiated rate in their mortgage contract or the Bank of Canada 's conventional five-year fixed posted rate .

The central bank 's rate is based on posted five-year fixed mortgage rates at Canada 's largest banks , and was most recently set at 4.84 per cent , well above many discount rates on the market .
When the Bank of Canada 's posted rate starts climbing , some home buyers will be `` stress tested '' at a higher rate . Joining the homeowner 's club will have a higher barrier of entry .
Even before the July rate hike , the mortgage market was changing . Earlier that month , Royal Bank of Canada raised rates by 0.2 of a percentage point for some of its fixed-rate mortgages as bond yields moved higher . Other major banks followed with their own rate increases .
Still thinking of getting into the market ? Here 's a tool to show how your monthly mortgage payments would differ at various interest rates .
Just fill out the mortgage amount ( the home 's purchase price minus your down payment ) and the amortization period .
Mortgage amount ( $ ) Amortization period ( years ) Monthly cost for a 25 -year mortgage at various interest rates 2.5 % 3 % 3.5 % 4 % 4.5 % 5 %
* Note : Mortgage default insurance costs not included here . Calculation assumes biannual compounding .
For some context , mortgage broker David Larock says discounted five-year fixed rates for his clients ranged between 2.39 per cent and 2.59 per cent in the first half of 2017 , while variable-rate mortgages were in the range of 2 to 2.25 per cent .
Mortgage market breakdown
The latest survey data on mortgage borrowing suggest about eight in 10 borrowers who bought a home last year have a fixed-rate mortgage , 17 per cent have a variable rate and 3 per cent have a mortgage that combines a fixed rate and variable portion .
After the McConnell sell-out and the Boehner betrayal , after the disgraceful abandonment of principles and conservative values by the Washington Republican establishment , what is the proper response from outraged conservative believers in limited government and fiscal responsibility ?
I have been sitting here on the morning after the New Years 's Day capitulation by Capitol Hill Republicans , trying to answer that question for myself .
Start with feelings . I feel abandoned by the establishment Republican Party of Washington , D.C . I feel depressed that I can not see a single conservative leader in sight who could grab the Republican Party , slap it across the face , and tell it where it can go if it does not shape up . I feel angry that Republican ‚Äú leaders ‚Äù in Washington put a higher value on their own survival in office than the principles they claim to stand for .
As I see it , the Republican Party is a rudderless ship that has lost its compass , dead in the water , with no captain and no destination . What this ship needs is a mutiny .
I have already begun my own little mutiny . About 10 days ago , I received a phone call from the Republican National Committee . The guy on the phone asked if I would renew my membership for 2013 , for a mere $ 150 contribution . ‚Äú No , I wo n't do that , ‚Äù I responded . Well , the fellow said , we understand times are tough for lots of people these days , so how about renewing for , say , $ 75 ?
‚Äú You do n't get it , ‚Äù I responded . ‚Äú I am not renewing for $ 75 nor for five bucks nor for a dime . I am done with contributions to the RNC . I donated several times in 2012 , and donated to the Republican senatorial committee , and you blew an election we should have won . I am no longer going to support the army of consultants , pollsters , media advisors , and other experts who live off the RNC and who botched the election of 2012 . I am done with the RNC . ‚Äù
The conversation went downhill from there , but it left me with a feeling of liberation . It was my declaration of independence from the Republican establishment . I told the RNC guy that from now on , I will pick my own list of true conservative candidates and donate directly to them , not to the party .
I now consider myself a citizen without a party . Everything that Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have done in the past month has reinforced my belief that only a grass-roots revolt ‚Äî a true conservative mutiny ‚Äî can save the Republican Party . The party is not worth saving unless it returns to conservative values ‚Äî limited government , adherence to the Constitution , fiscal responsibility , and a dedication to individual liberty .
I have no hope that the leaders of the party in Washington have the vision or guts to adopt and adhere to such an agenda . They will pay it lip service , of course , but they will also go on making deals with the Democrats and President Obama to sell out those principles when it is expedient for their re-election hopes .
Only if millions of conservatives across the country withhold their money and their support for the collaborators in the capital , the nervous Neville Chamberlains of the Establishment , will there be any chance of real change in the GOP . So bring on the mutiny . There is something worse than being a person without a party . And that is being a member of a party without a soul .
Protesters think minimum wage , healthcare reform and an end to police brutality are worthy of arrest and lost job prospects
Employers often reject those who is a strike or protest : ' I am willing to do whatever it takes to lead a better life '
When Precious Daniels lay down in front of the Blue Cross Blue Shield building in Detroit on a chilly morning in November 2009 , she was n't giving her future job prospects much thought .
She was , however , thinking about all of the money the insurance company was spending on its lobbyists . A supporter of the Affordable Care Act , Daniels wanted to make sure that the insurance company knew that she was n't OK with its efforts to block Obama 's healthcare law .
‚Äú It was a peaceful protest . Me and another young man did a peaceful non-violent act of blocking the doors by lying down and demanding to speak with someone higher up to present our case , ‚Äù she says .
The police were called , and Daniels was arrested for public trespassing and disturbing public peace . Less than six hours later , she was released on $ 50 bail . Months later , in January 2010 , she showed up for her hearing , only to find out that the cop who made the arrest was n't there .
‚Äú I was pretty much under the assumption that since the cop did n't show up that the charge was dropped , ‚Äù she says .
She was wrong . The arrest , which was reported to the FBI 's master criminal database , popped up weeks later when Daniels applied for a job with the US Census Bureau . She did not get the job .
Daniels is n't the only one haunted by her activism . According to the Wall Street Journal , nearly one in three adults has a file in the FBI 's criminal database ‚Äì 77.7m Americans in total . And the number is growing , with 10,000 to 12,000 new names added each day . As Americans take to streets to strike for a range of causes ‚Äì from climate change to better wages ‚Äì they take the the risk of having their name added to that database of doom .
Protesting for a cause ‚Äì and having an arrest on record ‚Äì can have a long-term effect . Once it 's marked on someone 's legal record , it 's a red flag for employers .
‚Äú The repercussion are serious , especially when you consider low-wage workers , ‚Äù says Ossai Miazad , a partner at law firm Outten & Golden . ‚Äú I was thinking about this when Occupy Wall Street was going on a few years ago . Look at Ferguson . Look at all of the arrests that have happened . All of these individuals who might have a record that they might not even realize that in six months , or several years down the road , will follow them and could cause them to lose a job . ‚Äù
In court , Americans are innocent until proven guilty . When it comes to job search , it 's the other way round ‚Äì guilty until proven innocent .

‚Äò I am willing to do whatever it takes to make a better life '
Even after the Census Bureau rejected Daniels ' job application because of her arrest , Daniels says she would make her protest again . ‚Äú In my eyes , this was worth it , ‚Äù she says . ‚Äú I truly believe that we were heard . ‚Äù
Since then , Daniels has joined a class-action lawsuit against the Census Bureau , claiming that its policy of not hiring people with arrest record counts as discrimination against minorities .
Civil disobedience ‚Äì non-violent acts of protests like blocking traffic ‚Äì have a long history within US civil rights and labor movements , says Tsedeye Gebreselassie , a senior staff attorney at National Employment Law Project .
One of the reasons that there was so much attention [ for the fast-food minimum-wage strikes on 4 September ] is because we saw hundreds of workers across the country willing to get arrested . It 's risking arrests . It 's risking losing your job . It 's risking losing future job prospects , but there comes a point where you do n't have anything to lose any more . Even if arrests were to have an effect on their future job prospects , it says lot that they are willing to take the step anyway .
‚Äú I 'd call it courageous , ‚Äù Gebreselassie says .
To Devonte Yates , a 22-year-old McDonald 's worker , getting arrested was also a sacrifice he says needed to be made .
Yates was one of the 27 protesters arrested in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , on 4 September ‚Äì the day of nationwide protests for higher minimum wage . After blocking street near a local McDonald 's , he was arrested and issued a $ 691 ticket , which he plans on paying .
‚Äú I am willing to do whatever it takes to make a better life , not only for me , but for the people that are going to come in generations after me . I am a McDonald 's worker and I am fighting to make my job better , ‚Äù he says .
‚Äú If it stops me from getting another job , that 's fine . This is real life . If I have to sacrifice bits and pieces of my life to see this goal of $ 15 wage increase , then that 's fine with me . ‚Äù

Employees like Yates who walk out of their jobs can be disciplined by their employers ‚Äì but legally , future employers should n't use arrests against them .
‚Äú A subsequent employer ca n't retaliate against somebody by not hiring them for it , ‚Äù says Jonathan A Segal , partner at Duane Morris LLP . ‚Äú It 's protected . ‚Äù
The current employers do , however , have the right to hire replacements for striking workers .
Consider the Market Basket strikes earlier this summer : As workers spent weeks picketing the supermarket chain in support of the ousted CEO , the company attempted to hold a job fair to replace them .
While employees are free to engage in nonviolent protests , they do not have the right to try to shut the employer down or damage its business , Segal says .
‚Äú They have the right to leave , but they do n't have the right to block customers or to stop other employees from earning their paycheck , ‚Äù says Segal , adding that such behavior can lead to arrests and is not protected as concerted action .
Still , in many states , employers are prevented from looking at arrest records when making hiring decisions .
‚Äú Arrests alone can not be considered , ‚Äù says Segal .

‚Äò $ 13 when you are unemployed is very hard to come by '
Overall , participating in protests usually counts as a summary offence , which is less than a misdemeanor . Since summary offences are the least serious ‚Äì things like running a red light or speeding ‚Äì any employer who uses one as a reason not to hire someone will have a hard time defending the decision in court .
Despite that , Daniels and about 850,000 applicants received letters from the US Census Bureau that flagged their arrests records when processing their job applications . After finding out online that she was n't the only one to whom this happened , Daniels joined the class action suit against the bureau , which has been pending since 2010 .
‚Äú Her situation is illustrative of what many people go through , ‚Äù says Miazad , who is the lead partner on the case against the US Census Bureau . ‚Äú Arrests records are notoriously incomplete . ‚Äù
To resolve the flag on her application , the Bureau asked Daniels to send in fingerprints and supporting documents within 30 days . Despite her case being dismissed and no charges being pressed by either Blue Cross Blue Shield or the Wayne County police department which detained Daniels in November 2009 , her arrests still appears on her record .
The supporting documents she needed also came at a price .
‚Äú When I tried to [ get the paperwork ] ‚Äì I was unemployed at the time - and they wanted $ 13 , ‚Äù she says . ‚Äú You know , $ 13 when you are unemployed is very hard to come by. ‚Äù Since then , Daniels , who is 39 , has worked a number of private sector jobs and is currently working in IT . She has yet to resolve the flag on her FBI file .

‚Äú In Precious Daniels ' case , which happens over and over and over again - there is no disposition . It was dismissed , ‚Äù says Miazad .
Arrest disposition is the final outcome of an arrest - whether it be dismissal , acquittal or conviction . ‚Äú But what appears on an FBI rap sheet , which they used as a basis for employment decision , is what then looks like an open arrest . ‚Äù
Unfortunately , the burden of proof that the arrest was dismissed falls on those who are looking for a job .

The protesters participating in the minimum wage strikes on 4 September were willing to do ‚Äú whatever it takes ‚Äù to get their message across .
‚Äú They were aware of the various consequences that come along with being arrested , ‚Äù says Jennifer Epps-Addison , a campaign leader for Wisconsin Jobs Now . ‚Äú They got arrested not just for themselves but for their co-workers who maybe could n't afford to have taken that big of a risk . It was n't a decision that they entered into lightly or blindly . ‚Äù
The protesters were more than prepared for the arrests , with campaign having strike funds ready to pay for any legal expenses incurred by those who were detained .
‚Äú I was well aware of what I was doing . I was well aware of the legal consequences of my actions , ‚Äù says Yates , who is currently studying criminal justice at the Milwaukee Area Technical College . And what about his arrest coming up in future job interviews ? ‚Äú I am not really worried about that . ‚Äù

The 33-year-old was assured by the front-office in Washington that he was n't on the trading block over the summer .
Per the WaPo :
At some point during the summer , Gortat would have a discussion with the Wizards and learn the team had no plans on trading him . Months later , Gortat now describes his exit interview as ‚Äú a little misunderstanding ‚Äù and says people should not have read into his comments that he wanted out . ‚Äú I 'm just a veteran who knows that [ I 'm going to be ] 34 years old , ‚Äù Gortat said , explaining the rationale behind his statements in May . ‚Äú Behind me , I have a center who 's younger and the team is going in a certain direction . I 'm the oldest guy on the team , and I 'm probably the one piece that might be traded . So [ I was ] just getting myself ready for a situation if I 'm going to be traded . ‚Äú But then when the management called me and said : ‚Äò We 're not trading you . You 're not going anywhere . ' That whole conversation died , ‚Äù Gortat said . ‚Äú I mean , I 'm here . I 'm a Washington Wizard . ‚Äù

Jewish Circumcision Opponents Grow More Vocal
‚Äú Our essential message is that all Jews do have a choice ; we can be fully identified and affiliated as Jews , and fully engaged spiritually in a Jewish context , without circumcising our infants , ‚Äù
Learn more by visiting Beyond the Bris
( MIAMI ) - As the legal maneuvering begins in San Francisco over a ballot initiative that seeks to prohibit the non-medically necessary circumcision of minors there , a number of Jewish people opposed to the practice are stepping forward to weigh in on the circumcision question . Earlier this week , the Jewish Circumcision Resource Center of Boston , Massachusetts , or JCRC , ( not to be confused with the Jewish Community Relations Counsel ) released a Message to Jewish Americans that addressed questioning circumcision from a Jewish point of view .
‚Äú Our essential message is that all Jews do have a choice ; we can be fully identified and affiliated as Jews , and fully engaged spiritually in a Jewish context , without circumcising our infants , ‚Äù the statement says . ‚Äú Our core principles are simple and unambiguous : infants are people ; their bodies belong to them alone . Every person should have the right to make an informed decision about the removal or alteration of any normal , healthy , functioning body part when he or she is older . ‚Äù
The message was signed by several longtime opponents of infant circumcision who are Jewish , including cultural anthropologist Leonard Glick , M.D. , Ph.D. and pediatrician Paul Fleiss , M.D. , M.P.H .
The JCRC 's message also addressed issues of insensitivity toward Jewish people within the broader movement opposing circumcision . `` Unfortunately , there may be statements and tactics by individuals opposed to circumcision that are insensitive and even offensive to many Jews . We regret this and absolutely reject all statements or actions , often based on ignorance , that are disrespectful of any religion or ethnic group , '' the statement says .
Jonah Lowenfeld of The Jewish Journal of Greater LA yesterday reported on the JCRC 's statement as part of a longer piece on a newly filed lawsuit that seeks to block a vote on the San Francisco initiative .
The Jewish Circumcision Resource Center was founded by Ronald Goldman , Ph.D. in the mid-1990s and serves to support the questioning of circumcision among Jews . Goldman says his organization decided to issue the statement because of the increased attention to the topic , accompanied by a general lack of awareness about the harm of circumcision . `` There may be a misunderstanding of the reasons why many people question circumcision , '' Goldman says . `` We wanted to clarify that and take the opportunity to raise awareness about the practice . '' He says he also wanted to assure Jews that questioning circumcision can be done respectfully and compassionately .
In a separate comment which appears on the JCRC web site , Goldman specifically addresses the Foreskin Man comic -- but does not name it -- which has angered the Jewish community with it 's images of a monster mohel . According to Goldman 's comment : ‚Äú A publication on Jewish circumcision is receiving attention because it is insensitive and offensive to many Jews , and I regret that . Please understand that it represents only the writer who speaks for nobody else . The movement to question circumcision is wide and diverse . There is no organization that controls , or could control , what individuals who oppose circumcision may say or do . ‚Äù
Goldman began to seriously question circumcision in the 1980s after attending his first Jewish ritual circumcision , or bris . ‚Äú As one who is very sensitive to the pain experienced by children , I was reluctant to go , but I attended in order not to offend the family , ‚Äù Goldman says . ‚Äú I remember the sound of his [ the infant 's ] cry . I ca n't imagine an infant crying any louder or with more agony , pain , and sense of urgency in his voice . Using every bit of energy he had , the infant protested vehemently what was being done to him with the best of adult intentions . ‚Äù
Goldman was also struck by the response of others in the room . A few people were crying quietly , including the parents . Others were silent . There was an atmosphere of discomfort and anxiety . Goldman retreated to the kitchen , which was the farthest place in the house he could get . ‚Äú I wanted to protest to others what was happening , but I restrained myself because I believed that people would not listen to me . This conflict caused me much distress . I resolved never to attend another bris , ‚Äù he says .
Goldman also resolved to do something about what he 'd witnessed . He eventually published a book on the harms of circumcision titled Circumcision : The Hidden Trauma , and another book that addressed concerns specific to the Jewish community titled Questioning Circumcision : A Jewish Perspective . Both books have become primers on their subjects .
Today , Goldman is a Executive Director of the Circumcision Resource Center , a nonprofit educational organization with the purpose of informing the public and professionals about male circumcision . He maintains the Jewish Circumcision Resource Center as a separate but affiliated web site . Goldman says he feels questioning Jewish circumcision is best accomplished within the Jewish community and this is happening .

Northwestern heads to is annual camp in Kenosha , Wisconsin , this week for practice , and presumably to take in the picturesque views of the University of Wisconsin-Parkside . I actually told my editor at SB Nation , Jason Kirk , that I could n't work on Tuesday and Thursday this week because I have to go to Wisconsin for Northwestern practice . Our exchange :
Jason : Northwestern 's practicing in Wisconsin ?
Me : Yeah , it 's dumb .
Jason : Seems dumb !
Anyways , if you know NU football history , you 'd know that Camp Kenosha has grown into a not dumb tradition . Gary Barnett started bringing his teams up there to get them focused in the middle of nowhere , and Pat Fitzgerald has embraced the tradition , as well , bringing his team up to Wisconsin to get away from it all .
`` It puts us in a football-only environment , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , '' says Fitzgerald , entering his fourth year as Northwestern 's head coach . `` Being a player , the initial [ reaction is ] , 'Where am I ? ' And then after that , you ca n't wait to get up here . `` It 's football . You do n't have to worry about school or any other distractions and really grow and come together with your teammates . ''
Look , I do n't claim to know whether this is really a good or a bad thing for Northwestern football . I do n't think skipping the camp would 've done much to hurt NU 's 2012 season or help its 2013 season , but there does n't seem to be much downside to it , and it 's probably nice for the players to get away for a bit .
But what 's funny is that Northwestern sees Kenosha as a great thing because it 's also the worst . Kenosha being so dreadful is what made it so appealing to Fitz and Barnett . In fact , it 's so dreadful , that in 1997 , one player paid $ 140 to take a cab to Evanston to get away from Kenosha .
The isolation and nearby farmland were exactly what Northwestern coach Gary Barnett was looking for in a no-nonsense training camp , but not what ( freshman Chris ) Leeder was looking for in the way of a life . So he did what any desperately lonely guy would do . He called a cab . Thanks to Leeder , we now know the fare from Kenosha to Evanston is $ 140 , the elevated train ride to Union Station is pocket change and the train ride to Grand Rapids , Mich. , near Leeder 's hometown , is $ 25 .
You can see why I 'm oh so excited to be making the hour-and-15-minute trip up the Tri-State tomorrow ( and Thursday and Saturday ) for practice ‚Äî and this is coming from someone who grew up in Iowa next to a cornfield and whose favorite place in the world during his childhood was a farm in upstate New York that was surrounded by woods and Amish people ( i.e . not a ton of entertainment ) .
But here 's an idea of what Kenosha entails : First , you have to drive on the Edens ( and the Tri-State ) during traffic . When you finally get to Wisconsin , you 're bombarded by cops who love to look for out-of-state license plates , and then you hit the construction between Pleasant Prairie and Kenosha , which I 've confirmed with InsideNU Wisconsinite ( is that right ? ) Callie Counsellor has been going on for centuries . Then , you wind through farmland that takes you way past the actual town of Kenosha until you come to Wisconsin-Parkside , which looks like a large high school , has confusing roads and does n't have an actual football field .
Here are the two pictures of Wisconsin-Parkside on Wikipedia :
So yeah , not super fun or pretty looking .
To be fair , Kenosha does have two redeeming qualities . It has the Mars Cheese Castle , where you can find an incredible selection of cheese , alcohol and root beer , and it has a gas station that I once saw people drive their snow mobiles to , which is pretty # Wisconsin and pretty badass . But aside from those two things , Chris Leeder 's escape story is a pretty accurate picture of the town .
Update : Other things in Kenosha that do n't suck , in case you need ideas for your next family vacation .
@ RiseNU @ NickMedline @ insidenu while you 're up there do NOT miss Franks Diner . Best breakfast in the Midwest ! Hands down ! ‚Äî Luke S. ( @ lunker35 ) August 11 , 2014
@ insidenu They 're supposed to have a good car wash there .... ‚Äî Nate Williams ( @ BigEasyCat44 ) August 11 , 2014
So hopefully this gives you a good look into where your favorite Wildcats will be spending the next week . And just remember , Kenosha is the absolute worst , which is why , to Northwestern football , it 's the absolute best .
Update : Kenoshans have their own subreddit and they do n't really like us .

Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey does n't resent teammate Le'Veon Bell staying home while the rest of the team is sweating through August practices .
In fact , Pouncey says Bell is doing exactly what he should do , and exactly what Pouncey himself would do if in the same situation as Bell , who is facing playing the 2017 season for the one-year , $ 12.1 million franchise tender .
‚Äú People catch feelings about certain things . I think anybody in his situation would do the same exact thing . I would . We 'll see how things turn out . I 'm pretty sure he 'll come in here and ball out like normal , things that Le'Veon does in the pass game and the running game , ‚Äù Pouncey said , via ESPN .
Pouncey said he completely understands why Bell wants a lucrative long-term contract ‚Äî and why the Steelers do n't want to give him what he wants .
‚Äú There 's a business part , ‚Äù Pouncey said . ‚Äú At the end of the day , it does n't look like it on [ the team executives ' ] side because they sit up there in the office every single day . As a player , you try to go out there and get as much as you can . Especially with the things that Le'Veon has been through and the production he 's put on the football field , he deserves a big-time contract . Who in the NFL would n't say that ? At the end of the day , it 's a business . That 's why the Steelers are one of the greatest organizations in all football . They know what they are doing upstairs . No one down here questions it . ‚Äù
Bell is likely to sign the franchise tender and report to the Steelers within a week .
Armenians Being Removed From The Ottoman Military
For hundreds of years , non-Muslim draftsmen and laborers had work along side the Ottoman Army peaceably . Apart from serving in different spheres of the Ottoman state system , Armenians also held high positions at the Military ( War ) and Navy ministries . When the war started in August 1914 , 60,000 Armenian men joined those already serving in the Ottoman army . In January 1915 , the Ottoman Army suffered a large defeat by Russian forces at Sarikamish . Enver Pasha , the Minister of War and the actual leader of the Ottoman Empire , feels the defeat at Sarikamish is the blame of Armenian soldiers for treachery .
https : //100yearsagotoday.wordpress.com/‚Ä¶/ottoman-forces-suf‚Ä¶/ On February 12 , 1915 by the order of the Enver Pasha the disarmament of the Armenian soldiers of Ottoman army started . Disarmed soldiers were formed into amele taburi-es ( labor battalions ) and hamal taburi-es ( cargo transportation battalions ) At the same time the isolation and arrest of Armenian officers started . The removal of these Armenians in the military will leave the Armenian population under Ottoman control without protectors .

As Seattle , and many other American cities , find themselves in the midst of a demographic gentrification shift , it 's important to look back at the way policies and decisions about who could live where created the situation that 's not being affected . An interactive platform by the University of Richmond called `` Mapping Inequality '' looks into just that . Specifically , it digs into the mother of all redlining resources : homeowners ' Loan Corporation ( HOLC ) maps from the Great Depression .
HOLC recruited mortgage lenders , developers , and real estate appraisers in nearly 250 cities to create maps that color-coded credit worthiness and risk on neighborhood and metropolitan levels . These maps and their accompanying documentation helped set the rules for nearly a century of real estate practice . They have also served as critical evidence in countless urban studies in the fields of history , sociology , economics , and law . Indeed , more than a half-century of research has shown housing to be for the twentieth century what slavery was to the antebellum period , namely the broad foundation of both American prosperity and racial inequality . Through offering a digital library of the state 's role in housing development , Mapping Inequality illustrates vividly the interplay between racism , administrative culture , economics , and the built environment .
Back then , neighborhoods were color-coded based on potential credit risks they posed to homeowners . Green `` best '' and blue `` still desirable '' neighborhoods were the kinds of places white buyers would look to live . Red `` hazardous '' neighborhoods were noted because of high densities of African-American and other minority demographics and would therefore be considered discouraging at the time . This is redlining in the most literal sense .
Included is a 1936 map of Seattle with this color coding , or as it 's referred to , `` Grades of security . ''
The interactive map also includes a spatial analysis tool that gives you a sense of how things shook out based on how close they were to city center . Aside from business and commercial spaces , what makes up the center of Seattle was almost entirely considered `` hazardous '' or `` declining '' neighborhoods . If you wanted to find something `` desirable , '' you had to go to the next circle out and look for pockets in Washington Park , Montlake , Madison Park , Mount Baker , Queen Anne , Alki , and North Admiral . North Seattle is a trove of `` desirable '' neighborhoods while South Seattle leans heavily into `` undesirable . ''
It 's hard not to look at this 1936 map and see how it and the practices behind it helped shape the city we know today . Or at least , the city we 've known until now . Developers are remaking many of these `` undesirable '' neighborhoods and gentrification is shifting things around once more . Whether or not the thinking involved in the two eras is more similar than we care to admit , that 's a discussion playing out in government meetings and coffee shops all across Seattle each day .
Police are searching for a man suspected of shooting a woman Monday evening , according to a Chattanooga Police Department news release .
Police responded to the 4500 block of Fagan Street about 10 p.m. and found Kanya Thompson , 34 , suffering from two gunshot wounds , one in each leg .
Thompson had been in an altercation with the suspect , Bobby Johnson Jr. , 32 , earlier in the evening . Johnson left the house , returned with a gun and shot Thompson , according to police .
The victim was treated by Hamilton County Emergency Medical Services and transported to a local hospital . The victim is listed in critical condition .
Chattanooga Police Violent Crimes Investigators are currently working to obtain warrants on and locate the suspect .
Chattanooga Police ask anyone with information regarding this crime to call 423-698-2525 .
This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available .

ChangePrecision
This package makes it easy to change the `` default '' precision of a large body of Julia code , simply by prefixing it with the @ changeprecision T expression macro , for example :
@ changeprecision Float32 begin x = 7.3 y = 1/3 z = rand ( ) .+ ones ( 3,4 ) end
In particular , floating-point literals like 7.3 are reinterpreted as the requested type Float32 , operations like / that convert integer arguments to Float64 instead convert to Float32 , and random-number or matrix constructors like rand and ones default to Float32 instead of Float64 . Several other cases are handled as well : arithmetic with irrational constants like pi , linear-algebra functions ( like inv ) on integer matrices , etcetera .
The @ changeprecision transformations are applied recursively to any include ( filename ) call , so that you can simply do @ changeprecision Float32 include ( `` mycode.jl '' ) to run a whole script mycode.jl in Float32 default precision .
Code that explicitly specifies a type , e.g . rand ( Float64 ) , is unaffected by @ changeprecision .
The US army has said it wants invisibility cloaks for its soldiers within 18 months . How realistic is that ?

The US army wants invisibility cloaks for its soldiers . Not just that ‚Äì it has announced that it wants to test the best contenders within the next 18 months . Seems a bit unrealistic ? Well , we may not be as far away as you think .
In 2006 , John Pendry , a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London , showed that it should be possible to bend light around an object and hide it using metamaterials ‚Äì structures engineered at microscopic levels to channel electromagnetic waves . Since then , many devices trumpeted as invisibility cloaks have been described , but they only work in the lab with specific wavelengths or from certain angles .
Now the US army has made a call for proposals from companies for wearable camouflage with a chameleon-like ability to change according to the background . So how will they manage this ? Metamaterials are probably the best solution : previous efforts in this field using technology like LEDs were hampered by power and computing requirements .

But although they can bend light , metamaterials can not make things disappear completely .
‚Äú Complete invisibility of macroscopic objects for all visible colours is fundamentally impossible , ‚Äù says Martin Wegener of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany . His team has created cloaks from photonic crystals that work for certain wavelengths , but bending light over the entire spectrum is forbidden by relativity .
‚Äú This means that you may see less of something at a particular colour , but see it at all other colours , ‚Äù says Wegener .
The wearer would be effectively transparent at some wavelengths but not all , rendering them as a coloured shadow or ghost image .
Contractors will demonstrate the feasibility of their approach in the first six months of the programme . Those selected for the following one-year phase will submit 10 prototype uniforms for testing . These need to work in all terrain from all angles . They also need to function across a wide range of temperatures , in rain and snow , and without hampering a soldier 's normal duties .
If the adaptive camouflage requires a power source , this must weigh no more than 0.45 kilograms and provide at least 8 hours of operation .
Some firms claim to be on their way there already . Guy Cramer , CEO of Canadian camouflage makers Hyperstealth Biotechnology , says he demonstrated metamaterial camouflage to US military scientists last year , and that the new project will allow him to move forward with it . But Cramer wo n't yet reveal details or release photographs of the material .
Metamaterials might be used to generate adaptive camouflage patterns rather than for cloaking , suggests Andrea di Falco of the University of St Andrews , UK .
¬ìMetamaterials might be used to generate adaptive camouflage patterns rather than for cloaking¬î
The new specimens will be compared with existing camouflage patterns using standard NATO tests , indicating that something less than complete invisibility is expected .
However , as Wegener points out , the word ‚Äú invisible ‚Äù can mean different things . If the wearer looks like a shadow among other shadows and can not be identified as a person , they may be invisible enough for military purposes .

Ray Rice has n't found many media defenders on Monday after the Baltimore Ravens terminated his contract and and the NFL suspended him indefinitely following the release of surveillance video showing him punching out his then-fianc√©e Janay Palmer . Until now .
During an appearance with Steve Malzberg on NewsMax TV , Dr. Ben Carson shared his opinions on the matter , in essence defending Rice and laying near equal blame on Palmer .
‚Äú I 'm hopeful they will get some help for him , ‚Äù Carson said , after being asked whether he agreed with the moves today by the team and the league . ‚Äú I mean , obviously anyone who would do something like that needs some help . ‚Äù
‚Äú And let 's not all jump on the bandwagon of demonizing this guy , ‚Äù Carson continued . ‚Äú He obviously has some real problems , and his wife obviously knows that , because she subsequently married him . So they both need some help . So rather than just jumping on a punitive bandwagon , let 's just see if we can get some help for these people . ‚Äù
Yes , they ‚Äú both need some help. ‚Äù But only one of them was dragged unconscious out of an elevator after being brought down by a single punch .

Senators GM Bryan Murray made a pitch that would have certainly improved the club 's blueline in the hours before free agency opened Wednesday .
It 's believed the Senators were among a group of teams that spoke to the Vancouver Canucks about defenceman Kevin Bieksa before he was dealt to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a second round pick in the 2016 NHL entry draft Tuesday night before free agency opened .
The reality is the 34-year-old Bieksa had a no-trade clause he could exercise so he was able to dictate where he ended up which is why after a deal fell through with the San Jose Sharks last Friday in Fort Lauderdale , he ended up landing with the Ducks .
There were several teams involved in the discussions with the Canucks including the St. Louis Blues . In the end , Bieksa controlled his own destiny and it 's believed one way or another he wanted to go to the Golden State .

To an audiophile , there 's no such thing as ‚Äò too expensive ' if it means an upgrade to their setup could improve their listening experience . And in Japan , some acoustic connoisseurs are now installing their own utility poles , with custom transformers , to ensure all of their audio gear is getting the purest power possible .
The Wall Street Journal spoke to Takeo Morita , a retired lawyer in Japan with a personal sound system that already includes a $ 60,000 amplifier , gold and silver cables , and other gear that will put your bundled iPhone earbuds to shame . But with audiophiles there 's always room for improvement , and he realized that electromagnetic interference from his neighbors ' appliances was propagating through their shared power lines , reducing the quality of the sound he was getting .

The solution was to receive power more directly from his local power grid , which required the installation of his own private utility pole . With upgraded wiring , a better transformer , and an improved circuit breaker , the upgrade can run close to $ 40,000 , not including what your local power company decides to charge you for the privilege of private power .
But to Morita , and other audiophiles in Japan , who believe they 're now hearing so much more of their favorite albums thanks to the cleaner power feeding their sound systems , it 's not a question of whether or not they can afford these upgrades‚Äîit 's how soon can these private utility poles be installed ?

The young monk Djishin approached master Kaimu and said , ‚Äú Tell me about the Temple of the White Iron Sky , where you were first apprenticed . ‚Äù
Kaimu said , ‚Äú It is a strange and perilous place . Knowledge hangs in the air as thick as the mist , yet if you linger there for an hour you will emerge knowing less than when you went in . ‚Äù
Djishin thought , I must see how such a thing can be true . Thus he set out .
By his maps , the temple lay nestled in the folds of a forested hill below high mountains ; a signpost on the main road pointed to an untended path . Djishin followed the path through a great AND Gate and found that the climbing land beyond was indeed shrouded in mist , billowing in great roils from a grove of weeping-cypress trees further up the hillside . The mist curled around the base of a pale tower at the center the temple grounds . The path‚Äînow flagged with damp stones‚Äîled Djishin to its steps .
‚Äú What is this place , fellow ? ‚Äù he asked a white-clad monk seated upon the steps .
The monk looked up from the Haskell code he was studying . ‚Äú Outsiders call it the Tower of the Elephant 's Tusk , though we know it by another name . But answer this question : Are you a software engineer ? ‚Äù
‚Äú In heart and in deed , I am , ‚Äù answered Djishin .
‚Äú If you would be one in thought as well , then follow the path to the cypress grove , and converse with the nuns that meditate there , ‚Äù said the white-clad monk . ‚Äú The tower is not yet for you . ‚Äù
Within the grove the mist thickened to a warm and bitter-tasting fog ; from somewhere up ahead came the sound of bubbling water . The trees parted , and Djishin found himself in a clearing where four nuns in white robes sat contemplating a monolith of glistening black basalt . On its face were inscriptions such as the monk had never seen :
( > > = ) : : m a - > ( a - > m b ) - > m b return : : a - > m a
‚Äú What is this stone , great ladies ? ‚Äù asked Djishin .
‚Äú We call it the Monad , ‚Äù said the first nun .
‚Äú Why do you venerate it so ? ‚Äù asked Djishin .
‚Äú Through it , we may touch the impure without being corrupted , ‚Äù said the second nun . ‚Äú We can fell a Maybe-tree with a Maybe-ax and always hear a Maybe-sound when it crashes down‚Äîeven if the sound is Nothing at all , when the ax is n't real or there 's no tree to fall . ‚Äù
‚Äú Can you ... explain that explanation ? ‚Äù asked Djishin .
‚Äú It empowers us to code without error , ‚Äù said the third nun . ‚Äú For we only deem a function safe if its input alone determines its output . But when a function bleeds side-effects , then from each drop a vine may spring to pierce our application with its thorns . The Monad tells us how to weave bandages to staunch the flow . We wrap the function up , we bind the Real World down ; we pass it in , shake it , and pull it back out , and that 's what it 's all about . ‚Äù
‚Äú And this inscription , this is code ? ‚Äù asked Djishin , wondering at the monolith .
The nuns looked at each other . ‚Äú Someday all will know it as such , as readily as 20 GOTO 10 . But answer this question : are you a software engineer ? ‚Äù
‚Äú I am no longer certain , ‚Äù answered Djishin , whose confusion was complete .
At which point the young monk was enlightened .
Qi 's commentary
Ironically , the Monad always has at least one side-effect : it makes me feel like an idiot .
Qi 's poem
The screen darkens .
Semicolons scatter to the four corners of the window .
A storm may beat the high hill down‚Äî
Yet when the world changes , storms yield to a greater enigma .
An award-winning non-profit organization that provides child abuse prevention information and training to Ontario 's francophone schools is facing a provincial payroll tax snafu that could tip the organization into bankruptcy . ‚Äú We are largely funded by government to do our work , ‚Äù said Lisa Weintraub , executive director of le Centre Ontarien de Pr√©vention des Agressions ( COPA ) . ‚Äú We just do n't have $ 40,000 sitting around in an account to pay this . ‚Äù

The Toronto-based organization , which also serves many English school boards across the province , was shocked in January when a provincial auditor called to say COPA had neglected to pay its Ontario employer health tax and is facing back-taxes , penalties and interest going back to 2009 . Weintraub admits her organization 's own auditor made a mistake by not advising her about the tax . But she says the federal Canada Revenue Agency also messed up by waiting six years to notify provincial officials that the tax was due . Ottawa usually notifies the province within two years when an employer 's payroll reaches $ 450,000 and triggers the tax .

‚Äú We can try to pay for two years of arrears , but to ask for six years will put us under , ‚Äù said Weintraub , who took money out of her personal RRSP account to pay $ 7,000 owed for 2015 . NDP MPP Peter Tabuns ca n't believe the government is playing hardball with the 21-year-old agency that operates out of his Toronto Danforth riding . ‚Äú This is ridiculous , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú While one arm of government pays this organization to provide vital services , the other arm tries to shut it down . Who wins here ? Not the taxpayer. ‚Äù COPA , which serves children from kindergarten to high school , is the only organization of its kind in the country and has received awards from both the Canadian and Ontario teachers ' federations for its programs . The Flemish government in Belgium was so impressed with COPA 's website , it created one just like it , Weintraub said . Tabun has appealed to Finance Minister Charles Sousa to intervene . But in a letter dated July 5 , the minister says employers are responsible for understanding their employer health tax obligations and that ‚Äú extensive information ‚Äù is available on the ministry 's website .
While Sousa says he appreciates COPA 's difficulties , ‚Äú to grant relief from the penalties and interest would be inequitable to other taxpayers who have been assessed under similar circumstances and subsequently paid the applicable tax , interest and penalties. ‚Äù Sousa is ‚Äú acting like a bureaucrat and not a problem-solver , ‚Äù said Tabuns . In a reply to Sousa , he suggests COPA 's main government funders , the education ministry and Women 's Directorate , should give the organization a one-time grant to cover the tax . It is money COPA would have asked them to pay in the first place , had the organization known it was due , he noted .

Sousa could then credit those ministries for the grant , he added . ‚Äú There is a way to keep COPA alive and keep the tax system whole , ‚Äù Tabuns said . ‚Äú The question is whether the government cares whether francophone children in the province receive training in abuse prevention. ‚Äù In an emailed statement to the Star on Friday , Sousa said he was not able to comment on COPA 's tax woes due to taxpayer confidentiality . ‚Äú However , ‚Äù he said , ‚Äú if a situation arises where a company or organization is unable to fulfill their tax obligations , alternative payment plans can be arranged . ‚Äù

A DC Comics insider says an established character will be revealed as gay . Who could it be ?
The smart money is on Batman or Aquaman or Wonder Woman but , frankly , a case could be made for all or any of them : who is the comic book superhero who has been suppressing their homosexuality all these years ?
The speculation has begun after DC Comics co-publisher Dan DiDio let slip at the Kapow comic convention in London that an established character would be revealed as gay .
We already have lesbian , flame-haired crime fighter Batwoman and the gay male couple Apollo and Midnighter . Next up , it would seem , will be a character previously assumed to be straight .
The writing has been on the wall for a while . More than a year ago DiDio was interviewed in the Advocate talking about gay characters and the need to reflect society as it is . Then , the intention was to introduce completely new characters . He said : `` One of the things we 're very focused on doing for these types of stories is rather than [ change an existing ] character , we want to make sure that this is the basis of whom that character is right from the start . ''
Now the intention seems to be that a character previously thought to be straight will sensationally reveal themselves to be gay .
The Navajo call Darlene Arviso ‚Äú the water lady , ‚Äù because for six years she 's delivered this liquid luxury to families in 250 homes that lack indoor plumbing .
Arviso fills two 55-gallon blue barrels outside each home , driving across 75 miles of bumpy , unpaved roads five days every week to do it .

When the barrels are topped off , she 'll fill any other containers they have , from recycled pickle buckets to empty soda bottles .
She 's been the only driver for the St. Bonaventure Indian Mission since it started the water deliveries of water pumped from its on-site well in 2009 .
The Navajo reservation in western New Mexico has been hit hard by the drought in the American west ; years of uranium mining has used up much of the groundwater and roughly 15,000 people have no running water .

‚Äú You know what we do ? ‚Äù Georgianna Johnson , one of the people on the route , told NPR News . ‚Äú ‚Äò The water truck 's coming ! Get the buckets ready ! ' We get all happy . Today 's the day I 'm going to take a bath . ‚Äù
Arviso fills the buckets , twice per month for each family , from a big , yellow tanker truck .
Good news is finally coming to the reservation , after the Christian Mission contacted nonprofit DigDeep , which was able to find clean water 1,800 feet below the surface . In the spring it will begin digging a well , and it hoped to raise enough money to pipe the water to people 's homes .
After a television segment about the lack of water was broadcast on CBS Sunday Morning two weeks ago , more than $ 661,000 was donated to DigDeep , giving the organization the money they need to begin piping the water into homes .

Recently , the website TakePart.com and DigDeep surprised Arviso with 3,000 messages of thanks , honoring her for her commitment to the deliveries . She was surprised , but says she ca n't imagine retiring .

Omsk photographer submits a request to Russia 's investigative committee to determine the existence of God
Vasiliy Melnichenko has turned in the appropriate documents . As the artist himself explained in an interview with Echo Moskvy , if the investigation determines that God does n't exist , then an investigation into the Russian Orthodox Church needs to take be initiated . Or a criminal case under the article of ‚Äú Fraud on an exceptionally large scale ‚Äù . If the investigation determines that God does exist , then Melnichenko wants to see the justification that the church operates on a legal basis , in particular , representing his interests .

Washington ( CNN ) US investigators believe Russian hackers breached Qatar 's state news agency and planted a fake news report that contributed to a crisis among the US ' closest Gulf allies , according to US officials briefed on the investigation .
The FBI recently sent a team of investigators to Doha to help the Qatari government investigate the alleged hacking incident , Qatari and US government officials say .
Intelligence gathered by the US security agencies indicates that Russian hackers were behind the intrusion first reported by the Qatari government two weeks ago , US officials say . Qatar hosts one of the largest US military bases in the region .
The alleged involvement of Russian hackers intensifies concerns by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies that Russia continues to try some of the same cyber-hacking measures on US allies that intelligence agencies believe it used to meddle in the 2016 elections .
US officials say the Russian goal appears to be to cause rifts among the US and its allies . In recent months , suspected Russian cyber activities , including the use of fake news stories , have turned up amid elections in France , Germany and other countries .

Study Enrollment
The Contraceptive CHOICE Project is a prospective cohort study with the primary goal of promoting the use of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods as a means of reducing unintended pregnancies.13 From August 2007 through September 2011 , we enrolled 9256 participants at risk for unintended pregnancy . All participants chose a contraceptive method and received it at no cost . Study participants were a convenience sample of women and adolescents in the St. Louis region , recruited by means of referrals from medical providers , newspaper reports , study flyers , and word of mouth .
The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board before recruitment was initiated . All participants provided written informed consent .
Eligible participants were 14 to 45 years of age , were not currently using a contraceptive method or were willing to switch to a new reversible contraceptive , had no desire for pregnancy for at least the next 12 months , were sexually active or were planning to become sexually active with a male partner during the next 6 months , resided in the St. Louis region , and spoke English or Spanish . Persons were excluded if they had undergone a hysterectomy or sterilization procedure .
Study Design
Before enrollment in the study , all potential participants were read a standardized script regarding long-acting reversible contraceptive methods that stated that the two IUDs and the subdermal implant were the most effective methods of contraception ( see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org ) . If they were eligible for enrollment , participants received contraceptive counseling regarding all reversible contraceptive methods , including their effectiveness , side effects , risks , and benefits . Each participant was then provided with a reversible contraceptive method of her choice at no cost for 3 years ( first 5090 participants ) or 2 years ( remainder of cohort ) . Participants were permitted to discontinue or switch methods as many times as desired during the follow-up period . A comprehensive baseline interview was performed , and participants were screened for sexually transmitted infections .
Participants were followed prospectively , with telephone interviews at 3 and 6 months and every 6 months thereafter for the duration of follow-up . Participants received a $ 10 gift card for every completed follow-up interview . In the baseline and follow-up interviews , we collected comprehensive information on demographic characteristics and reproductive history .
This analysis includes the first 7486 participants who used an IUD , implant , DMPA injection , pills , patch , or ring during the study . Periods of condom use or other contraceptive method use ( e.g. , diaphragm or natural family planning ) were excluded from the analysis of contraceptive failure . At each survey , participants were asked about missed menses and possible pregnancy . Any participant who thought she might be pregnant was asked to come in for urine pregnancy testing . A pregnancy log was used to record all pregnancies . Participants who had a pregnancy were asked if it was intended and what contraceptive method ( if any ) they were using at the time of conception . The conception date was estimated from the date of the last menstrual period or from the gestational-age assessment on ultrasonography . Contraceptive-method failure was defined as conception that occurred during a period when the contraceptive method was used . If the participant stated that she had stopped using the method , this was listed as ‚Äú no method ‚Äù and was not considered a contraceptive-method failure . We excluded conception that occurred after a participant stopped using a method owing to a desire to conceive ( intended pregnancy ) .
Information about periods of contraceptive use , including start and stop dates , was collected from three sources : scheduled telephone interviews ; pharmacy data obtained from the partner pharmacy where participants obtained pills , patch , or ring ; and the participant contraceptive-method log , which documented in our research records when the participant initiated or discontinued use of a method or switched to another method ( i.e. , insertion or removal of an IUD or implant ; receipt of an initial pill supply , patch , or ring ; and DMPA injection ) . A participant was considered to have used DMPA for the 3-month interval after a record of an injection . In the case of expulsion of an IUD , if the participant knew the device had fallen out and she became pregnant , the unintended pregnancy was attributed to ‚Äú no method ‚Äù ( unless an alternative method was used ) . However , if the participant was unaware that the device had fallen out , the pregnancy was attributed to IUD failure .
At each follow-up interview , we asked participants if they were still using the same contraceptive method , if they had stopped using it , and their start and stop dates . For participants who did not answer these questions , we reviewed their contraceptive-method log and pharmacy-refill records to confirm their status . If the data from the log , follow-up interview , and pharmacy records were conflicting , we used the data source with the most detailed information . If multiple contraceptive methods were used simultaneously ( e.g. , pills and condoms ) , the most effective method was assigned.9 Data from participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the time of their last completed interview .
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was contraceptive failure . We also evaluated pregnancy rates by age group as a secondary outcome . Our hypotheses were , first , that participants using pills , patch , or ring would have higher rates of contraceptive failure than those using long-acting methods and , second , that the rate of failure with the pills , patch , or ring would be higher among younger women and adolescents ( < 21 years of age ) than among older women .
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of Stata software , version 11 ( StataCorp ) . The significance level ( alpha ) was set at 0.05 . To describe the demographic characteristics of the study participants , we used means , standard deviations , frequencies , and percentages . For the comparison among users of different contraceptive methods , Student 's t-test was used for continuous variables and a chi-square test was performed for categorical data .
We measured distinct segments of contraceptive-method use that represented the months each participant used the method . We calculated participant-years of use for each method by capturing all segments of use . Thus , participants who switched methods contributed distinct segments to multiple methods . Cox proportional-hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios for unintended pregnancy with different methods . We used clustering of variance‚Äìcovariance estimation methods to account for the effect of correlation among different periods of contraceptive use and multiple pregnancies for the same participant . Effect modification was assessed by including an interaction term between the method and the covariate of interest in the model . The final multivariate model included adjustment for confounders and other variables with the potential to influence the outcome .
UPDATE : Well , we have an interesting change here . It appears as if NVIDIA originally posted the 5.0 update changelog to the 2015 SHIELD TV release notes page , but should have posted it on a new page for the new 2017 SHIELD TV . As you can see from their release notes pages here , the 5.0 update is no longer listed on the 2015 SHIELD TV page , yet it is now listed on the 2017 model page . At this point , that means we do n't know when the SHIELD TV ( 2015 ) is getting the update to 5.0 . However , 2017 models should be getting the update almost right out of the box .
UPDATE 2 : NVIDIA says to expect the update for current SHIELD TV ( 2015 ) devices in the next week or so .
On the eve of the launch of the new NVIDIA SHIELD TV ( 2017 ) , NVIDIA has pushed out an update to the original SHIELD TV ( 2015 ) , an update that bumps the ultimate streaming device to Android 7.0 Nougat . The update is n't just an OS change , though . It brings so much more , including a bunch of stuff scheduled to be a part of the new SHIELD 's launch , like Amazon Video .
With the update to Android 7.0 Nougat , NVIDIA is including picture-in-picture support , a new settings menu , and an option I needed a year ago ‚Äì recent apps page . Other related enhancements include a pause/play button by double tapping the volume slider , ability to write to an attached USB or SD card , a cast option for HBO GO , and support for 4.1 , 6.1 , and 8.1 Plex speaker configurations .
As for other huge news , the update brings with it Amazon Video . That means Prime members and other Amazon fans can now stream Amazon 's catalog of movies and shows , like The Grand Tour , in 4K HDR . NVIDIA is simplifying their layout , as well , by including an NVIDIA Games App , where users will find GeForce NOW games , ‚Äú exclusive ‚Äù Android games , and GameStream titles . This app replaces the SHIELD Hub .

Austria is preparing for the presidential election run-off on Sunday and political turmoil is bubbling under the surface .
The decades-long traditional two-party-system is over . The far-right Freedom Party 's candidate Norbert Hofer could be elected as the new head of state .
He won the first round with more than 35 percent of the votes . Before the election he was virtually unknown not only on the international stage but also in Austria . He is seen as giving a smiling face and a soft voice to his party 's radical views .
But why the fuss ahead of the run-off as traditionally the head of state does not interfere in day-to-day politics in Austria .
Hans Rauscher is the political analyst of the daily ‚Äò Der Standard ' . He explained that while largely a ceremonial role the president can dismiss the Chancellor and the government .
‚Äú If the government says we have to raise taxes or if the government exceeds a certain quota of refugees or if the government does n't do away with unemployment within one year , he has announced these are instances when I will dismiss the government . And he can do that . Of course , there will be protests , demonstrations , whatever but it 's within his constitutional powers , ‚Äù he explained to Euronews .
The only remaining candidate who can prevent Hofer 's presidency is Alexander Van der Bellen . And the polls suggest a very close contest .
The 72-year-old professor of economy used to be the leader of the Green Party but is running as an independent .
His aim has been to unite voters who do n't want a right wing president , seen as turning the vote into a referendum on extremism
‚Äú The voters of the Freedom Party are not all Nazis . They are protest voters . They are fed up with the ruling coalition which was n't very successful . On the top of unemployment , raising of prices , inflation , came of course the influx of refugees which tipped everything , ‚Äù added Rauscher .
Werner Faymann was chairman of the Social Democratic Party and Chancellor of Austria . He resigned from both positions amid widening criticism within his party . Now with the far-right Freedom Party leading the polls Austria faces a tough decision on Sunday .
Euronews correspondent Gergely B√°rtfai reported from the Austrian capital , Vienna : ‚Äú The Hofburg , the former traditional residence of the Habsburg dynasty 's emperors , is now the office of the President of the Republic of Austria .
‚Äò One of the candidates will move in here after the election and with the move will be sending an important message to Europe . ‚Äù
How should the U.S. win the war of ideas against Islamism ?
That question understandably provokes strong differences of opinion .
For example , honest people can disagree over the merits of the Obama administration 's Countering Violent Extremism policy , which George Selim , director of the Office of Community Partnerships , described as ‚Äú the first federal assistance program devoted exclusively to providing local communities with the resources to counter violent extremism in the homeland . ‚Äù
However , recent reports from certain quarters in the media have given an unfair representation of the new administration 's approach . This reporting has obscured rather than clarified , and ultimately does nobody any favors .
In January 2017 , then secretary of homeland security , Jeh Johnson , announced $ 10 million worth of Countering Violent Extremism grants for 31 organizations .
But rather than accept this policy as a done deal , the incoming secretary , John Kelly , requested a review of the grants . When all was said and done , many groups kept their funding , some new grants were handed out , and others were cut .
This move should have been largely uncontroversial , considering the competing views that exist on how to best combat violent extremism and to deal with extremism more broadly .
But instead , some media players twisted this story to suggest that the Trump administration was somehow largely sympathetic to white supremacists .
Specifically , this stemmed from the administration 's decision to cut a $ 400,000 grant to Life After Hate , a group made up of former right-wing extremists , who planned to use the money for an online campaign targeting neo-Nazis .
This led to a string of stories in Politico , Newsweek , Think Progress , and the Chicago Tribune that focused on the Department of Homeland Security cutting funds to that particular group above any other . Salon called the decision ‚Äú inexplicable . ‚Äù
The subtext was clear : The Trump administration is soft on the far right .
Others were not as subtle in making that charge . The Muslim Public Affairs Council ( which also had its grant cut ) accused the Trump administration of turning a ‚Äú blind eye ‚Äù to white supremacy .
Christian Picciolini , one of Life After Hate 's founders , accused the administration of ‚Äú refusing to acknowledge that white nationalist extremists are a major domestic terrorist threat . ‚Äù
What these media sources ignored was a February 2017 Washington Free Beacon story highlighting some of Picciolini 's more unsavory tweets .
As the story points out , between November 2016 and January 2017 , Picciolini took to Twitter to launch a series of incendiary insults against President Donald Trump . These tweets stated :
‚Äú OK , America . Time to put an end to this nonsense once and for all . The Nazis fooled us once and this time we BECAME the Nazis . # Revolt ‚Äù . ‚Äú Shame on you , UNITED States of America . Last night , you committed suicide . ‚Äù
half of us fought against him and will continue to do so . # notmypresident ‚Äî Christian Picciolini ( @ cpicciolini ) November 9 , 2016
Nice knowing ya . People like me , most journalists , POC , peace activists , cops & educators , wake up tomorrow with fresh targets on our backs . ‚Äî Christian Picciolini ( @ cpicciolini ) November 9 , 2016
In response to one Trump tweet , Picciolini responded , ‚Äú F‚Äî you , a‚Äî‚Äî- . ‚Äù
Life After Hate surely does important work , but this is hardly sensible behavior for someone hoping to earn a government grant . It would also not be a great look for Homeland Security to spend Countering Violent Extremism money on a group founded by someone whose messaging appears a tad , well , extreme .
One would imagine that Picciolini would not have wanted to accept the money anyway , coming from an administration headed by an ‚Äú a‚Äî‚Äî ‚Äù he thought needed to be overthrown and which possessed an agenda he had vowed to fight .
The media also seemed to overlook a $ 866,687 grant cut to a University of North Carolina project dealing with Islamism . ( That 's more than double the amount of money Life After Hate was cut . )
The university 's program had been tasked with producing ‚Äú videos and other materials to counteract jihadist propaganda that targets young people , ‚Äù yet Homeland Security ultimately decided that was not an effective use of taxpayer money .
No one in the media seized on that example to accuse the Trump administration of being soft on Islamism , because such an accusation would be patently absurd . Yet when it came to the far right , no such restraint was in display .
The unglamorous truth is that , as a Homeland Security spokesperson commented , ‚Äú The program has not been altered to focus on any one type of violent extremism. ‚Äù He went on to note that there were 16 grants that were ‚Äú equipped to handle all types of violent extremism , including white supremacist violent extremism . ‚Äù
Preventing public misunderstanding on what ‚Äú countering violent extremism ‚Äù policy actually seeks to achieve is hard enough as it is . By twisting the narrative in the way it did , the media is only making that task harder .

Targe of the Blooded Base Armor Weight Base Value 20 8 300 Additional Effects When bashing , does 3 points of bleeding damage for 5 seconds Class Heavy Armor , Shield Upgrade Material Steel Ingot Perk Arcane Blacksmith ID 000FC5BF
The Targe of the Blooded is a unique heavy shield found in The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim .
Contents show ]
Characteristics Edit
Its appearance is that of a basic wooden shield , adorned with large spikes and studs . The spikes on the shield inflict a wound‚Äîwhen an enemy is bashed‚Äîwhich bleeds for five seconds . The bleeding damage stacks if the target are bashed over and over . It is one of the weaker heavy shields in the game , being comparable to an iron shield , thus it seems to be intended for use as a secondary weapon while still providing some defense .
Location Edit
The Targe of the Blooded is carried by a hostile Redguard named Umana in the Dwemer Ruin of Alftand . She is encountered at the end of Alftand , where she begins fighting with an Imperial named Sulla Trebatius after some conversation with him .
Smithing Edit
The Targe of the Blooded can be upgraded at a workbench with a steel ingot and the Arcane Blacksmith perk , though it does not benefit from any Smithing perks . This means the shield can not be improved past flawless quality without boosting the Smithing skill over 100 . This can be achieved by using enchanted items and/or blacksmithing potions to fortify Smithing .
Enchantment Edit
Bashing with this shield inflicts this penalty on the target :
Damage Health : 3 points per second ( 5 sec duration )
It can not be disenchanted to learn its effects .
Unlike the perk that causes bleeding damage that is inflicted by waraxes ( which only effects enemies that can bleed ) , the Targe of the Blooded 's effect also inflicts `` bleeding damage '' on enemies that do n't bleed , such as Draugr and Dwarven Automatons . This is somewhat similar to the Ebony Mail , which poisons enemies that can not normally be poisoned , like the aforementioned examples . The damage from continuously bashing also stacks , and continues to work if the targeted enemy is in the `` bleedout '' state .
Trivia Edit
The damage and duration are similar to that of Frostbite Venom , though the venom inflicts damage at 5 per second , and also damages stamina .
The effects of Targe of the Blooded can be useful when combined with the Ebony Mail , since bleeding damage in conjunction with poison will quickly take out most enemies .

Search and Analytics are key features of modern software applications . Scalability and the capability to handle large volumes of data in near real-time is demanded by many applications such as mobile apps , web and data analytics applications . Autocomplete in text fields , Search suggestions , Location or Geospatial search and Faceted Navigation are standards in usability to meet business requirements nowadays .
Tuning is essential , necessary and crucial ! Any system tuning must be supported by performance measurements ; that 's why a clear understanding of monitoring and the implications of changed metrics is essential for anyone using Elasticsearch .
This three part tutorial series introduces some tips and methods for performance tuning , explaining at each step the most relevant system configuration settings and metrics .
Cluster State Size ( Capacity Planning for Index and Shard )
If 1 shard is too few and 1,000 shards are too many , how do I know how many shards I need ? This is a question that is impossible to answer in the general case . There are just too many variables : the hardware that we use , the size and complexity of our documents , how we index and analyze those documents , the types of queries that we run , the aggregations that we perform , how we model our data , and more .
It 's very easy to create a lot of indices and lots and lots of shards in elasticsearch , but creation of each index and shard comes at a cost . The management load alone can degrade our ES cluster performance , potentially to the point of making it red , if we have too many indices or shards . Overloading elasticsearch with too many indices/shards can also have pretty significant impact on the performance of indexing and search .
Elasticsearch provides the flexibility of being schemaless . We can add a JSON document with any number of fields to an index without first telling ES anything about what those fields are . These new fields‚Äîwhat they 're named , what type they are , and what index they live in‚Äîare automatically added to Elasticsearch 's index mapping and cluster state . The biggest bang to management overhead is the size of the Cluster State , which contains all of the mappings for every index in the cluster .
The Cluster state API allows getting a comprehensive state information of the whole cluster .
$ curl -XGET 'http : //localhost:9200/_cluster/state '
The API response for a single node cluster with 3 templates and 5 indices will be something like this :
{ `` cluster_name '' : `` elasticsearch '' , `` version '' : 6 , `` state_uuid '' : `` skxF0gCYTAGQAUU-ZW4_GQ '' , `` master_node '' : `` VyKDGurkQiygV-of4B1ZAQ '' , `` blocks '' : { } , `` nodes '' : { `` VyKDGurkQiygV-of4B1ZAQ '' : { `` name '' : `` Siege '' , `` transport_address '' : `` 127.0.0.1:9300 '' , `` attributes '' : { } } } , `` metadata '' : { `` cluster_uuid '' : `` QMSq7EOfToS-v5dKc0GdUA '' , `` templates '' : { `` template_one '' : { `` template '' : `` template_one_ * '' , `` order '' : 0 , `` settings '' : { ... } , `` mappings '' : { ... } } , `` template_two '' : { ... } , `` template_three '' : { ... } } , `` indices '' : { `` index_one '' : { `` state '' : `` open '' , `` settings '' : { ... } , `` mappings '' : { ... } , `` aliases '' : [ ... ] } , `` index_2 '' : { ... } , `` index_3 '' : { ... } , `` index_4 '' : { ... } , `` index_5 '' : { ... } } } , `` routing_table '' : { `` indices '' : { `` index_one '' : { `` shards '' : { `` 0 '' : [ { `` state '' : `` STARTED '' , `` primary '' : true , `` node '' : `` VyKDGurkQiygV-of4B1ZAQ '' , `` relocating_node '' : null , `` shard '' : 0 , `` index '' : `` index_one '' , `` version '' : 18 , `` allocation_id '' : { `` id '' : `` hAZf59wDSNS7im1wOdToHA '' } } ] } } , `` index_two '' : { ... } , `` index_three '' : { ... } , `` index_four '' : { ... } , `` index_five '' : { ... } } } , `` routing_nodes '' : { `` unassigned '' : [ { `` state '' : `` UNASSIGNED '' , `` primary '' : true , `` node '' : null , `` relocating_node '' : null , `` shard '' : 0 , `` index '' : `` index_three '' , `` version '' : 0 , `` unassigned_info '' : { `` reason '' : `` CLUSTER_RECOVERED '' , `` at '' : `` 2017-02-08T18:46:11.027Z '' } } , { ... } ] , `` nodes '' : { `` VyKDGurkQiygV-of4B1ZAQ '' : [ { `` state '' : `` STARTED '' , `` primary '' : true , `` node '' : `` VyKDGurkQiygV-of4B1ZAQ '' , `` relocating_node '' : null , `` shard '' : 0 , `` index '' : `` index_one '' , `` version '' : 18 , `` allocation_id '' : { `` id '' : `` hAZf59wDSNS7im1wOdToHA '' } } , { ... } , { ... } ] } } }
By default , the cluster state request is routed to the master node , to ensure that the latest cluster state is returned . For debugging purposes , we can retrieve the cluster state local to a particular node by adding local=true to the query string .
As the cluster state can grow ( depending on the number of shards and indices , our mapping , templates ) , it is possible to filter the cluster state response specifying the parts in the URL .
$ curl -XGET 'http : //localhost:9200/_cluster/state/ { metrics } / { indices } '
Metrics can be a comma-separated list of
version - Shows the cluster state version .
master_node - Shows the elected master_node part of the response
nodes - Shows the nodes part of the response
routing_table - Shows the routing_table part of the response . If we supply a comma separated list of indices , the returned output will only contain the indices listed .
metadata - Shows the metadata part of the response . If we supply a comma separated list of indices , the returned output will only contain the indices listed .
blocks - Shows the blocks part of the response .
We can plan for cluster state , size or capacity in order to decide the number of primary shards as follows :
Create a cluster consisting of a single server , with the hardware that we are considering using in production .
Create an index with the same settings and analyzers that we plan to use in production , but with only one primary shard and no replicas .
Fill it with real documents ( or as close to real as we can get ) .
Run real queries and aggregations ( or as close to real as we can get ) .
Once we define the capacity of a single shard , it is easy to extrapolate that number to our whole index . Take the total amount of data that we need to index , plus some extra for future growth , and divide by the capacity of a single shard . The result is the number of primary shards that we will need .
Life Inside an Elasticsearch Cluster ( Topology )
Elasticsearch provides a pretty large toolbox for composing complex cluster topologies . We can make heterogeneous clusters with beefy nodes hosting our hot indices , and have less expensive nodes host historical data , e.g . using node attributes and shard allocation filtering . Different nodes in a cluster can have different roles ( data and/or master ‚Äì or none as a client ) as well as properties ( such as zone ) . An advantage of splitting the master and data roles between dedicated nodes is that we can have just three master-eligible nodes and set minimum_master_nodes to 2 . We never have to change this setting , no matter how many dedicated data nodes we add to the cluster . Setting up a proper cluster topology helps avoid problems like split brain .
Master Eligible Node
The master node is responsible for lightweight cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index , tracking which nodes are part of the cluster , and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes . It is important for cluster health to have a stable master node . Master nodes must have access to the data/ directory ( just like data nodes ) as this is where the cluster state is persisted between node restarts .
To create a standalone master-eligible node , set :
node.master : true node.data : false node.ingest : false
The node.master role is enabled by default .
Disable the node.data role ( enabled by default ) .
Disable the node.ingest role ( enabled by default ) .
Data Node
Data nodes hold the shards that contain the documents we have indexed . Data nodes handle data related operations like CRUD , search , and aggregations . These operations are I/O- , memory- , and CPU-intensive . It is important to monitor these resources and to add more data nodes if they are overloaded . The main benefit of having dedicated data nodes is the separation of the master and data roles .
To create a dedicated data node , set :
node.master : false node.data : true node.ingest : false
Disable the node.master role ( enabled by default ) .
The node.data role is enabled by default .
Disable the node.ingest role ( enabled by default ) .
Ingest Node
Ingest nodes can execute pre-processing pipelines , composed of one or more ingest processors . Depending on the type of operations performed by to ingest processors and the required resources , it may make sense to have dedicated ingest nodes , that will only perform this specific task .
To create a dedicated ingest node , set :
node.master : false node.data : false node.ingest : true
Disable the node.master role ( enabled by default ) .
Disable the node.data role ( enabled by default ) .
The node.ingest role is enabled by default .
Coordinating Only Node
If we take away the ability to be able to handle master duties , to hold data , and pre-process documents , then we are left with a coordinating node that can only route requests , handle the search reduce phase , and distribute bulk indexing . Essentially , coordinating only nodes behave as smart load balancers .
To create a coordinating only node , set :
node.master : false node.data : false node.ingest : false
Disable the node.master role ( enabled by default ) .
Disable the node.data role ( enabled by default ) .
Disable the node.ingest role ( enabled by default ) .
Enable Memory Lock Check to Disable Swapping
Swapping is the process whereby a page of memory is copied to the preconfigured space on the hard disk , called swap space , to free up that page of memory . The combined sizes of the physical memory and the swap space is the amount of virtual memory available .
Swapping is very bad for performance and for node stability and should be avoided at all costs . It can cause garbage collections to last for minutes instead of milliseconds and can cause nodes to respond slowly or even to disconnect from the cluster . Compared to memory , disks are very slow . Memory speeds can be measured in nanoseconds , while disks are measured in milliseconds ; so accessing the disk can be tens of thousands times slower than accessing physical memory . The more swapping that occurs , the slower our process will be , so we should avoid swapping at all cost .
When the JVM does a major garbage collection it touches every page of the heap . If any of those pages are swapped out to disk they will have to be swapped back into memory . That causes lots of disk thrashing that Elasticsearch would much rather used to service requests . One of the several ways to disallow swapping is by requesting the JVM to lock the heap in memory through mlockall via Elasticsearch setting bootstrap.mlockall . However , there are cases where Elasticsearch fails to lock the heap ( e.g. , if the elasticsearch user does not have memlock unlimited ) . The memory lock check can be used to verify if the bootstrap.mlockall setting is enabled or to confirm if the JVM was successfully able to lock the heap .
There are three approaches to disabling swapping :
Enable bootstrap.mlockall
The mlockall property in ES allows the ES node not to swap its memory ( Note that it is available only for Linux/Unix systems ) . This property can be set in the config/elasticsearch.yml file by adding the following line .
bootstrap.mlockall : true
In the 5.x releases , this has changed to bootstrap.memory_lock : true .
mlockall is set to false by default , meaning that the ES node will allow swapping . Once we add this value to the property file , we need to restart our ES node . After restarting Elasticsearch , we can see whether this setting was applied successfully by checking the value of mlockall in the output from this request :
curl -XGET localhost:9200/_nodes ? filter_path= * * .mlockall
The response should be like
{ `` nodes '' : { `` VyKDGurkQiygV-of4B1ZAQ '' : { `` process '' : { `` mlockall '' : true } } } }
If we see that mlockall is false , then it means that the mlockall request has failed . We will also see a line with more information in the logs with the words Unable to lock JVM Memory . The most probable reason , on Linux/Unix systems , is that the user running Elasticsearch does n't have permission to lock memory . This can be granted as follows :
Setting ulimit -l unlimited as root before starting Elasticsearch , or set memlock to unlimited in /etc/security/limits.conf .
Setting MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY to unlimited in the system configuration file ( or see below for systems using systemd ) , if using RPM or Debian systems .
Setting LimitMEMLOCK to infinity in the systemd configuration , if using systemd Systems .
If we are setting mlockall property , we must ensure that we are giving enough memory to the ES node using the -DXmx option or ES_HEAP_SIZE .
The default installation of Elasticsearch is configured with a 1 GB heap . If we are using the default heap values , our cluster is probably configured incorrectly . The easiest way to change heap size is to set an environment variable called ES_HEAP_SIZE . When the server process starts , it will read this environment variable and set the heap accordingly . As an example , we can set it via the preferred command line as follows :
export ES_HEAP_SIZE=10g
Alternatively , we can pass in the heap size via JVM flags when starting the process :
ES_JAVA_OPTS= '' -Xms10g -Xmx10g '' ./bin/elasticsearch
Ensure that the min ( Xms ) and max ( Xmx ) sizes are the same to prevent the heap from resizing at runtime , a very costly process . Generally , setting the ES_HEAP_SIZE environment variable is preferred over setting explicit -Xmx and -Xms values .
Disable All Swap Files
Alternately , we can completely disable swap . Usually Elasticsearch is the only service running on a box , and its memory usage is controlled by the JVM options . There should be no need to have swap enabled . On Linux systems , we can disable swap temporarily by running : sudo swapoff -a . To disable it permanently , we will need to edit the /etc/fstab file and comment out any lines that contain the word swap .
Configure Swappiness
Another option available on Linux systems is to ensure that the sysctl value vm.swappiness is set to 1 . This reduces the kernel 's tendency to swap and should not lead to swapping under normal circumstances , while still allowing the whole system to swap in emergency conditions .
Give It a Whirl !

Prime Minister John Key must explain revelations this evening that the GCSB operates X-Keyscore in New Zealand and is conducting mass surveillance on New Zealanders without their knowledge , said the Green Party .
‚Äú Yes or no John Key , is X-Keyscore spying on New Zealanders ? ‚Äù asked Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman .
‚Äú Revelations from Edward Snowden that X-Keyscore is operating on the Southern Cross cable , collecting both metadata and content , and that he has seen that data , need to be explained .
`` Prime Minister John Key has no choice but to start answering questions about what it means to New Zealand to be a member of the Five-Eyes network , and what the specifics of the Five-Eyes spying is .
‚Äú John Key 's document dump and obfuscations over the past 48 hours have been a red herring . Snowden 's allegations around X-Keyscore have nothing to do with Cortex or cyber protection .
‚Äú John Key is trying to purposefully mislead people by focusing on Cortex and cyber protection . What he must come clean on is X-Keyscore and declassify all information relating to it .
‚Äú The one thing that needs protection is New Zealanders ' privacy and rights . It is critical there is a public debate and public acceptance of this kind of mass surveillance before it is done . It can not be secretly imposed on us .
`` New Zealanders have the right to know what our spy agencies are up to , and what this means for our private information .
`` It 's becoming increasingly implausible for Mr Key to claim that New Zealand is not participating in the type of activity that the other Five-Eyes partners have been found to be undertaking , when over and over again we 're seeing evidence to the contrary .
‚Äú The Snowden allegations strike to the heart of the John Key 's honesty and integrity . If the allegations prove true John Key has , at best misled , and at worst lied to the New Zealand public on a fundamental issue of privacy .
`` We need a wide ranging independent inquiry into New Zealand 's intelligence agencies to understand what John Key has got us into .
‚Äú We need to change the Government . Our spy agencies need proper oversight and public agreement of their functions and John Key has proven himself not to be up to the job , ‚Äù said Dr Norman .
After not being seen for more than 30 years , the Japanese river otter ( Lutra lutra whiteleyi ) has been declared extinct by the country 's Ministry of the Environment , which also last week declared several other species extinct .
Once numbering in the millions , Japanese river otters‚Äîa subspecies of the European or Eurasian otter ( L. lutra ) ‚Äîwere overhunted for their fur , most of which was sold to foreign traders , and further suffered when their habitats became developed and polluted . The animals grew to about a meter in length and subsisted mainly on fish and shrimp .
The river otter was last officially observed in the wild in a river in the city of Susaki in Japan 's Kochi Prefecture in 1979 , when a single animal was photographed . The otter remains the official animal symbol of Japan 's Ehime Prefecture , home of the poet Masaoka Shiki ( 1867-1902 ) , who equated himself with otters in his haiku and referred to himself as Dassai Sho-oku Shujin ( `` Otter Bookstore Owner '' ) . The anniversary of Shiki 's death is celebrated every September 19 as Dassai-ki ( `` Otter 's ceremony anniversary '' ) , according to a report in Asahi Shumbun .
Several searches have been conducted for the river otter over the years , although little if any evidence of their continued existence has been found . Yoshihiko Machida , a professor emeritus at Kochi University , told The Mainichi that one case of otter droppings was confirmed in 1999 . He said he still has hope that the otter exists and plans to continue searching it .
In addition to the river otter , the Ministry of the Environment also declared as extinct a subspecies of the least horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus pumilus miyakonis ) , which was last seen in 1971 . The Japanese subspecies of the Asian black bear ( Ursus thibetanus japonicus ) was declared extinct on the island of Kyushu , where it has not been seen since 1957 ( it persists elsewhere in Japan ) . One bird species , one insect species , one shellfish species and two plant species were also listed as extinct . The names of those additional groups were not immediately available .
The otter and horseshoe bat mark the first mammal extinctions in Japan of species that persisted until at least some point during the Showa period , which lasted from 1926 to 1989 . Four other Japanese mammals went extinct during what is known as the Meiji restoration period from 1868 to 1912 , including two wolf subspecies‚Äî the Hokkaido wolf ( Canis lupus hattai ) and the Honshu wolf ( Canis lupus hodophilax ) ‚Äîand two bats‚Äî the Okinawa flying fox ( Pteropus loochoensis ) and the Ogasawara bat ( Pipistrellus sturdeei ) . The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources currently lists the two bats as `` Data Deficient '' rather than `` Extinct '' as there is some doubt about their taxonomy and whether or not they were actually endemic to Japan .

Nestled within a business strip mall , jammed between obscure nebulous white collar businesses like Lara Bown Counseling and PRIDE Payment Networks , is a world class training facility where elite athletes train in the beautifully brutal sport of Mixed Martial Arts . Grounded by it 's affiliation with one of the world 's best fight teams , American Top Team H.D . seeks to cull together some of the regions the best instructional talent all under one roof .
On it 's surface American Top Team H.D . is a fighter 's gym . World class jiu-jitsu , muy thai , and wrestling instructors all convene to guide you as you grow and develop from a ‚Äú 9 to 5 ‚Äù ham and egg chump , to a cage fighting bad ass . But underneath the surface is a comprehensive martial arts program deeply anchored one of the oldest martial arts known to man . Unlike many gyms who root themselves in Taekwondo , Karate , or other traditional striking arts , American Top Team H.D . weighs itself heavily in a martial art that is essential for both modern day Mixed Martial arts and self defense‚Ä¶ wrestling .
I sat down on a purple balance ball with Jason High and L.C . Davis , the Co-Owners of American Top Team H.D. , to discuss their gym , the sacrifice it takes to own a gym , how do you grapple with a man who refuses to wear underwear , how do you tell a man to wear underwear , and why their youth wrestling program is essential to their gym .
( The following interviews were edited together for brevity and clarity . )
( I showed up too early for the interviews . It 's usually packed full of dudes so it was either take these photos of empty heavy bags or take a nap . You 're welcome . )
The name , American Top Team HD , what does the HD stand for ?
L.C . DAVIS : The H.D . Stands for High , Davis . That 's Jason High , his last name and my last name L.C . Davis . We are partners and co-owners of the business . We 've partnered up with American Top Team to become an American Top Team affiliate school so we felt it was natural to try and keep our identity with the H.D . And blend [ the two names together ] .
When did you and Jason High start training together ?
DAVIS : I 've known Jason since I was in High school . We wrestled in the same area , Metro area K.C . Then we both started fighting around the same time . At the time actually I was living in Iowa and he was living in California but we always ended up in Kansas City training over the holidays and stuff .
JASON HIGH : We really did n't start training together until we both moved to Kansas City . He was training out of Militech for awhile and I was in California and we both moved back to K.C . I 'd say it was about 4 or 5 years ago .
So with the previous location you guys were still running as H.D . But what is the formal connection , what is the change with the affiliation or is that connection stronger now ?
HIGH : Yeah , It 's always been a pretty strong affiliation but we 're just making it official now basically .
( I should have taken the nap . Instead I was the creepy guy with a camera waiting for the kids to show up‚Ä¶ SMH )
What was the reason for the new facility ?
HIGH : Just more space , better facilities‚Ä¶ you know basics like mens and womens bathrooms , changing rooms , stuff like that .
DAVIS : The previous gym we were at in Leewood , Kansas , it was just a smaller facility . Now with the American Top Team name behind us we 're going to be able to bring in Ricardo Liborio ( Head Instructor and founder of American Top Team ) like we did and we 'll be able to rank all of our guys through black belt , through the American Top Team affiliate .
( Photo courtesy of American Top Team H.D . )
And how did the Ricardo Libario seminar go ?
HIGH : Oh it went really well , it was amazing . We had a pretty good turnout , good numbers . Everybody was really enthusiastic , it was a great seminar , and he 's a great host . It went really well and we 're going to have him out , hopefully before the end of the year . But regular belt promotions , if we do n't do one before the end of the year , will start next year . We would like to have him out twice a year for belt promotions and his seminar .
That 's cool , it makes the whole belt promotion process less vague .
DAVIS : So that 's going to be our affiliation and also on top of that we 're welcomed to send any of our fighters to [ A.T.T . Headquarters ] . So we can send any pro fighter that has a big fight coming up we can send them off to Florida for a month or weeks at a time and let them go train with some of the best fighters in the world , some of the best coaches in the world . And with us being the only American Top Team affiliate here in Kansas City I think it 'll be a good niche that will kind of single us out and make us more in demand .
Now here at this location what resources do your facility offer for people that want to join ?
DAVIS : Oh man , we have everything you need . We have treadmills , the aerodyne [ bicycle ] , we have personal training rooms so if you 're not into the class setting and do n't want to have a lot of people looking at you or you do n't like working out in front of a group setting , we have a one on one private training room . We have free weights , kettlebells , and we also do classes for everyone .
We have our fit line of classes . So if you 're not looking to do any of the martial arts and you just want to come here for the fitness membership only we have classes for you . We have a jiu-jitsu only membership . So if you only want to do Gi and No Gi classes we have a membership for you . We have a wrestling only membership . We have something for everyone . Like I said , all of our basic martial art classes ; wrestling , muy thai , jiu-jitsu , boxing , kickboxing , we have all of those classes and then as well we have your basic fitness classes . So we got a little bit of something for everybody .
Of the resources that your facility provides which ones are you most proud of here ?
HIGH : I 'd say the instructors : myself ( Wrestling ) , L.C . Davis ( Wrestling ) , Wes Wasmer ( Muy Thai ) , Travis Conley ( Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ) ‚Ä¶ we got a good crew here . I think they are the main resource that we have .
( Do n't worry , Wes Wasmer went like‚Ä¶ 12 .5 % with the little guy ? )
I know that both you and Jason High have your foundation in wrestling , does that wrestling culture kind of run through the ethos of the gym here ?
DAVIS : Absolutely , every gym has to have some type of niche and I would say that our niche is wrestling . Both owners , we were college wrestlers . I was a college wrestling coach and we both come from strong wrestling backgrounds . And that 's going to be the biggest thing that we 're going to try and push here is our youth wrestling club . This will be our fourth year of having a youth wrestling club . We 're chartered in Missouri and Kansas under U.S.A. Wrestling , so that 's very unique . You have kids from both states wrestling with us and something else that 's really unique for this gym , we have wrestling all year round where a lot of wrestling clubs only wrestle for those 3 or 4 months during the season . We can wrestle your kids all year long .
That 's kind of unique for an MMA gym .
HIGH : I think as people start to realize‚Ä¶ as you start to see the importance of wrestling in MMA it will start to be more common . Kids wrestling is something that both L.C . and I did as kids so we definitely owe a lot to those kids programs so we thought we 'd have one for ourselves .
I 'm assuming you guys are getting a pretty big turnout for the off season wrestling ?
DAVIS : Yeah , so far so good . You know we 've only been open for about two months here so we 've had good numbers in our high school wrestling class , then we have a youth wrestling class that 's been going on as well .
HIGH : We have guys out there getting in tournaments . We wrestle hard , those kids are getting better every year they 're working hard for sure .
In terms of your fighters , what does an HD fighter bring to the cage that is unlike other gyms in the area ?
DAVIS : Well I know that an HD fighter is going to come to the cage well prepared . That 's one thing I can vouch for . We do n't let our fighters get in the cage unless they 've been prepared . If they 're not in here everyday training , working hard , and representing the gym , the right way , then we do n't allow them to fight .
How many hours a week does the MMA dream take ?
HIGH : Between the gym and fighting ? I do n't even really know , I 've never counted it . Easily 40 [ per week ] at least .
DAVIS : It takes a lot of hours , a lot of time but it 's something I love doing . I would n't want to do something else , this is my passion , this has been my dream to own a gym . I 've always been into fitness and working out . I was an exercise science and fitness major in college so being in athletics and sports and working out , that 's always been my dream . When I was five [ years old ] and did n't even know I was going to be a professional fighter I knew that I was going to do something in athletics . To be able to own a gym , train people , make people better , and share the knowledge that I 've obtained‚Ä¶ it 's just a blessing and a dream come true .
L.C. , How hard is it to balance your family life , your career , as well as being a gym owner ?
DAVIS : It 's tough man , it 's tough . The hardest thing is trying to balance the time between being a coach and a trainer [ versus ] being a fighter . There 's only so many hours in a day that I can train people but that takes a lot of energy and time to train people . So when I have a fight coming up I kind of got to tell myself , ‚Äú Okay you can only do so many classes this week , you can only teach so many private [ classes ] this week because you have to have your energy saved up for your own training . So I kind of got to balance to make sure I can focus on myself as much as I focus on others .
Is that tough though , knowing the boundary of how selfish to get leading up to a fight ? Because I mean some guys just totally cut off from everything .
DAVIS : Yeah , It 's very tough because I ca n't be selfish like that because I‚Ä¶ own a gym . So as much as I would like to be like , ‚Äú I 'm going in seclusion , do n't talk to me for two months. ‚Äù I ca n't do that . I just have to find that nice balance .
What is the craziest drop-in story you 've had at your gym ? Take a moment and think about it .
DAVIS : At the old gym we had a radio ad . We got lucky with Hot 103 and they did a radio ad for the gym and they 're telling everybody , ‚Äú Come check out the gym ! ‚Äù So we got a hit . A guy came to the gym and said he had heard us on 103 . So he comes into jiu-jitsu class and he has his big baggy basketball shorts on and I 'm pretty sure he did n't have underwear on . Everything he did , he 's just swinging around everywhere .
Then he has to partner up with everyone , no one wants to be his partner and I do n't know how to tell the guy , ‚Äú Bro , your stuff is swinging everywhere no one 's gon na grapple with you. ‚Äù So it was really awkward man . A couple of people had to partner with him and I told them afterward , it was pretty funny‚Ä¶
HIGH : ‚Ä¶ I ended up doing throwdowns [ with him ] and I did n't know I was hooking up with his balls but L.C . Was just laughing at me .
Haa‚Ä¶ so you 're the one that got stuck actually training with him ?
HIGH : L.C . Was laughing at me and I was like , ‚Äú How come you did n't tell me dude ? ‚Äù And he 's like , ‚Äú Ah man , I did n't want to put him off in the middle of class‚Ä¶ blah blah blah‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
Yeah . That guy was kind of weird actually .
DAVIS : We all laughed about that for months . He only came one time and never came back . I think he just came to expose [ himself to ] everybody , to show his man goods off and leave us alone .

L.C. , I know you 're probably working out the details on your next fight , do you have any idea on when that 's probably going to be ?
DAVIS : I 'm hoping for September , they 're telling me September twelth , September nineteenth , they told me a couple of opponents names . I 'm hoping to have something hammered out at the end of the week . I 'm getting married September 27th .
Congratulations , that 's some weird timing .
DAVIS : Yeah , so I 'm going to be fighting a week or two weeks before the wedding . And I know they 're doing another show in Wichita October 24th . So I 'm hoping I can get two back to back fights .
That would be awesome .
DAVIS : Yeah , so hopefully I can get on the September card and I 'm pretty sure they 'll put me on the Kansas card with me being a local guy and hopefully I can finish the year off with two more fights and go undefeated in Bellator this year .
With the exit of Bjorn Rebney from Bellator , have you noticed any change in the operation of Bellator ?
DAVIS : I have n't noticed any changes yet but I know a lot of the contracts are going to get redone because they 're doing away with a lot of the tournaments . I know they have to change everyone 's contract now so I think that 's going to be a little bit of a process . That 's pretty much the only thing I 've noticed . I know they 're going to try an bring in some more big name fighters and do bigger shows . Doing away with the tournaments I think they can showcase guys a little better than just randomly throwing a tournament every week .
( Photo courtesy of A.T.T.H.D . Congratulations with the promotion to brown belt Jason . )
Jason , do you know what your plans are , in terms of your next fight coming up ?
HIGH : I do n't have anything lined up yet .
Are you still keeping weight ?
HIGH : Yeah , I 'm not super close‚Ä¶ but I 'm within somewhere close .. haha . You know , I 'm not too far out of control .
You 're not hogging out ?
HIGH : Nah , no I 'm not . I eat pretty healthy all the time so I 'm staying decently lean . I eat a couple cheat meals or whatever here and there but nothing crazy .
Anything else you want to add maybe something coming up with your gym ?
DAVIS : Yeah , we 're gon na have Shawn Bunchin next week doing a wrestling clinic on Monday and Tuesday . That 's August 4th and August 5th and then August 23rd we 're doing an A.T.T.H.D . Wrestling seminar featuring our coaching staff . It 's right when school starts back up , just basically trying to kick off the season and let everybody know that we 're here at this new gym and we offer wrestling and we 'd love to have you come on board and wrestle for us . So this month we 're really showcasing wrestling . Our special this month is $ 30 for 30 days , so that 's another deal we 're doing in the month of august .
So come out , check out the gym we 're in Lenexa , Kansas , AmericanTopTeamHD.com is our website . We got something for everybody so come check us out .

The $ 2 million cost of a giant waka-shaped events centre on Auckland 's waterfront is a fraction of the cost being spent to host the Rugby World Cup , Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples says .
Dr Sharples is defending the spending on the waka pavillion , which will be used to showcase Maori culture , arts , businesses and enterprise .
Ngati Whatua o Orakei is getting $ 1.8m of Government funding to create a pavilion in the shape of a giant waka as part of Auckland 's world cup celebrations .
PHIL DOYLE/Fairfax SHANE JONES : `` About 180-odd K a day for a blow-up waka . ''
The waka , 60-metres long and almost 15-metres high , is a joint venture between the hapu and the Government , with support from the Auckland City Council .
The hapu is contributing $ 100,000 to the project , which has an estimated cost of $ 1,988,000 , and would own it after it was built .
Sharples said it was a `` sad indictment '' that Auckland 's waterfront had no major Maori presence , and the waka would help address that .
It was also a small fraction of the hundreds of millions being spent to stage the tournament , and a fifth of the $ 10m cost of the large white cloud that is the centrepiece of the `` Party Central '' zone .
He aslo rejected criticism from Labour MP Shane Jones , who has branded the project a `` blow up '' waka .
`` Shane Jones thinks it 's a plastic boat ... It is a chance to showcase New Zealand and show to the world what a beautiful place we are . ''
JONES ATTACKS 'BLOW-UP WAKA '
Earlier today Jones said the `` blow-up waka '' risked exposing Maori to ridicule and smacked of last-minute desperation to get them involved in the tournament 's celebrations .
Jones , who is contesting Maori Party co-leader and Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples ' Tamaki Makaurau seat this year , said the only thing Maori wanted to see from the world cup was All Blacks Piri Weepu and Hosea Gear holding the trophy aloft .
'' This is about $ 2 million for an 18-day project , so in my estimation it works out about 180-odd K a day for a blow-up waka and , really , in my view , from a plastic party . It 's a joke , '' he told Radio New Zealand .
'' So , the best way we 're going to promote Maori in the context of the world cup is a last-minute panic-stricken stunt where this waka , whether it 's made out of plastic or it 's inflatable , is actually going to be either sold or have to be wrecked , but it 's ridiculous to think that you 're going to be able to take it to China and India .
`` No , I think it 's a very shallow , costly idea which should have actually gone out to tender . If you want to get Maori in the world cup , the best way to do it is to work with the young people , not actually come up with an inflatable stunt .
'' We 're living in austere times . I just think it 's an absurd idea , and a type of indulgence that ... runs the risk of reducing Maori themselves to having a plastic identity through this plastic party in the middle of the World Cup . It 's not good . ''
VERY BEST OF MAORI ARTS
But Sharples said a business plan would be drawn up to identify ways to generate revenue from the waka and offset the cost .
`` The waka will provide the cultural heart of the entertainment programme on Auckland 's waterfront . We will showcase the very best of Maori arts , culture , business and enterprise , right in the heart of the Rugby World Cup capital .
`` The haka is inextricably identified with All Black rugby , and Maori culture is a uniquely recognisable characteristic of New Zealand . This programme builds on our distinctive brand to promote New Zealand as a top visitor destination , and a place to do business , '' Sharples said .
He said construction would start soon and the `` world 's best '' Maori arts and cultural programme was being assembled for the waka .
The Ministry of Culture and Heritage and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet were underwriting the performance programme .
`` The total outlay for the project is almost $ 2 million . A business plan will identify ways to raise revenue and likely income , so the net cost is not certain at this stage , '' Sharples said .
He said the waka would be portable and would provide `` lasting benefits '' for Auckland and New Zealand .
The spending has also drawn criticism from ACT leader Rodney Hide , who said it flew in the face of the Government 's austerity drive .
`` Here we have a government that 's borrowing $ 300 million-plus now a week and made a very clear statement that there are all these things that are nice to have , and that we need to focus on the necessities .
`` The idea that we 'd give away $ 1.9 million to have a waka that the people of New Zealand wo n't even own is appalling , '' he told Radio New Zealand .
The Greens criticised the decision to award the project to the hapu without allowing other iwi and hapu a chance to tender .
When the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission released its report to Congress this week , something slightly unusual happened : people read it . And there , buried on pages 236-247 , a mystery was revealed , and the media have greedily amplified it .
Did China 's government really divert 15 % of the Internet 's traffic for eighteen minutes in April , effortlessly intercepting sensitive traffic in flight , and generally creating a massively embarrassing man-in-the-middle attack on vulnerable global communications ?
Well , yes and no . Mostly no .
Yes , this event really happened . No , it probably was n't a deliberate attack , or if it was , it was n't a very effective one , compared to what might have happened , but that 's where the story tends to bog down in technical detail and lose most readers .
Bear with me for a few minutes . There are several fragments of truth floating around this story , but they get more confused with each retelling . Let 's lay out what 's known , and then you can draw your own conclusions .
Start over : Was Internet traffic hijacked to China ?
Yes , it was . Let me very briefly sketch how it happened .
Internet routing , believe it or not , still works on the honor system . Any organization on the Internet ( call them ‚Äú the attacker ‚Äù ) can assert that it owns the IP addresses of any other organization ( ‚Äú the defender ‚Äù ) , by sending out a single Border Gateway Protocol ( BGP ) message to its neighbors . The neighbors can choose to believe it , or not .
If they are good and diligent neighbors , they will check the new assertion against published policies , find a mismatch , and ignore it entirely . But if they believe it , they immediately pass it on again to their neighbors , who pass it on to their neighbors , and so on , potentially passing the false assertion on to the entire planet in less than 30 seconds .
Now the stage is set for traffic redirection . When you need to send Internet traffic to the defender ( for example , to send him email or read his website ) , it 's passed towards the ‚Äú closest ‚Äù organization that asserted ownership . A large fraction of all the defender 's inbound traffic is potentially redirected straight into the waiting arms of the attacker . And until they withdraw their BGP route assertion , or their neighbors start filtering it out , there 's no way to stop it . It 's that simple .
In fact , it 's so simple , that it happens every year to somebody through sheer accidental misconfiguration . It 's been happening like this , periodically , at varying levels of severity , for over a decade . Sometimes it happens to just a network or two , as in Pakistan 's global hijacking of YouTube . Sometimes it happens to tens of thousands of prefixes , as someone briefly asserts ownership of huge swaths of the Internet . Sometimes it 's China , and sometimes it 's Con-Ed . We 've seen it happen so many times , to so many people , that when it happened again in April , we did n't even feel like investing the time to blog about it .
Ok , now we 're getting somewhere . So , did the April 8th event target the US Government ?
No , almost certainly not .
On April 8th , starting at 15:50 UTC , China Telecom incorrectly asserted ownership of more than 50,000 different blocks of IP addresses . This is the source of the ‚Äú 15 % of the Internet ‚Äù factoid that you 'll hear floating around . One small part of China Telecom ( autonomous system number 23724 , used for operations in Beijing , not their primary countrywide ASN 4134 ) made this assertion , and nobody disbelieved them . Within a few minutes , they ‚Äú grew ‚Äù to more than 1,000 times their normal size , and started to receive some of the traffic bound for these 50,000 networks .
The media have reported that the hijacked addresses included victims in the US Government , sites in .mil , and so forth . Which is true .
Impacted countries by network count during the April 8th event .
In fact , it was such a broad shotgun blast of address space that it included networks from 170 different countries , including 16,000 from the USA . It also included 11,500 hijacked networks‚Ä¶ from China ! Asian networks were disproportionately affected ( China , Korea , India , Australia , Japan ) , because they were closer to the source . Several different governments had networks among the victims , as you 'd expect by pure chance , out of such a large sample .
In summary , the scattershot nature of the hijack suggests a random mistake , not a deliberate attack on anyone in particular . Of course , it 's impossible to know for sure .
Okay , but they intercepted twenty minutes of Internet traffic !
True .
But how much traffic were they really in a position to intercept ? As the hijacking propagated , ten minutes passed , and then twenty . Nobody seems to have noticed anything amiss during the event itself , which seems strange , since it was lunchtime on a busy Thursday in the USA . No increased delays ? No closed connections ? No tweets about the Internets being broken ?
One clue lies in the nature of hijacking . If two US networks are talking to each other , even if both are hijacked , traffic will probably continue to flow normally between them . Why ? Both are closer to each other than they are to the hijacker . They both choose the legitimate routes , because they 're closer than the fake routes . No traffic is diverted . ( There 's an interesting corner case where one of two US participants is at a US Internet exchange point where the attacker is also present , and therefore artificially ‚Äú close enough ‚Äù to take the traffic , but let 's skip that for the moment . )
How much data could have been intercepted , then ? Basically , the packets in flight at the time of the route hijack .. a few kilobytes of effectively random content in the middle of each TCP window , times ( at a guess ) millions of redirected conversations between largely unknown participants . It would be pretty hard to plan such an attack so that you ended up with anything useful to read !
Got it . So , you 're telling me that this was nothing to worry about , then .
Oh , no . You 've missed my point . Indeed , that 's what we thought when we first approached the April event , based on our previous experience with big-bore route hijackings .
But there 's one critical difference this time out , and it has to do with the size of the hijacker . Usually , if a small operator ‚Äú hijacks ‚Äù a large part of the Internet , they simply get buried under the weight of all the random traffic that suddenly come their way . The traffic goes down a hole and dies , and that quickly alerts people to the problem , and it gets fixed .
But this is China Telecom : the largest retail-customer-facing Internet provider on Earth , and the 11th largest Internet provider , period . They have the capacity to deal with flows like these , and their global network is large enough that some strange internal routing effects become possible .
For example , it 's also true that some traffic was diverted to China , passed through China Telecom 's network , and then was sent back into the Internet towards its intended destination , with no visible effects to the end users except an increase in packet delay . People have suggested to us that this re-routing creates the ideal conditions for a traffic-archiving man-in-the-middle attack , but cooler heads have observed that there 's absolutely no evidence that such a thing actually took place .
Redirected Packets : A Long March Around the World
So during the event , you 'd see paths going from the US to Turkey by way of China . Or London to Frankfurt by way of China . What we think happened is that one China Telecom router ( with the false route from ASN23724 ) would attract the traffic ( ‚Äú come here , little packet‚Ä¶ ‚Äù ) and send it to Beijing . In Beijing , another China Telecom router , this one without the false route , would realize the mistake and send it along to the intended destination ( ‚Äú hm , this seems to be going to America .. ‚Äù ) . Large autonomous systems are like that : they do n't always have a perfectly consistent routing picture all along their global border .
As a concrete example , here 's one of the typical traceroutes we saw during the incident , between the London Internet Exchange and a host in the USA , passing through China Telecom . This trace was collected at 16:03 UTC , about 13 minutes into the event . Total time in transit is 525ms ( this trace typically takes no more than 110ms under normal conditions ) .
1 . < our host > 0.785ms # London 2 . 195.66.248.229 1.752ms # London 3 . 195.66.225.54 1.371ms # London 4 . 202.97.52.101 399.707ms # China Telecom 5 . 202.97.60.6 408.006ms # China Telecom 6 . 202.97.53.121 432.204ms # China Telecom 7 . 4.71.114.101 323.690ms # Level3 8 . 4.68.18.254 357.566ms # Level3 9 . 4.69.134.221 481.273ms # Level3 10 . 4.69.132.14 506.159ms # Level3 11 . 4.69.132.78 463.024ms # Level3 12 . 4.71.170.78 449.416ms # Level3 13 . 66.174.98.66 456.970ms # Verizon 14 . 66.174.105.24 459.652ms # Verizon [ .. four more Verizon hops .. ] 19 . 69.83.32.3 508.757ms # Verizon 20 . < last hop > 516.006ms # Verizon
Traceroutes are notoriously hard to interpret , but here is the fact that we consistently see 400+ms latencies from hops approaching the destination is a strong indicator that these packets have , in fact , taken a Long March through China on their way to this particular US host .
It 's a story that was repeated over and over , as this image of selected traceroute paths during the event suggests . Chinese routers are in red , non-Chinese routers in other colors . Traffic flows that dip into China and re-emerge on the other side to reach their original destinations are clearly visible .
Conclusion : Watch Your Backs , People
There you have it . The route hijacking took place , pretty much as described by the Congressional report and the media . Once you dig into the details , the conclusion you reach is up to you . On one hand , Internet routing is an exceedingly blunt instrument with which to attack an organization or capture man-in-the-middle traffic . It 's about as subtle as a firecracker in a funeral home ‚Äî the effects are visible for all to see , planetwide .
On the other hand , if you were so inclined , I suppose you could plausibly interpret the April 8th incident as a bit of technological muscle-flexing ‚Ä¶ maybe even a capability demonstration . The problems with the Internet 's trust-based infrastructure are real , they are serious , and they are trivially exploitable by state- and non-state actors who want to influence world affairs .
Is there anyone left on the planet by now who 's ( a ) in charge of a large chunk of address space , ( b ) not monitoring the BGP routing of that space , and ( c ) not petitioning their service providers to implement the best common practices for route filtering ? If the US Congress , Fox News , and the Drudge Report all know about these threats , then your business continuity insurance provider and SAS-70 auditors probably are n't far behind .
Study : Middle School Algebra Push Yields Minimal Performance Gains
Many states are pushing students to take Algebra 1 in middle school to prepare them for advanced math in high school . A new analysis , however , suggests that increased enrollment has n't led to higher math performance for states on the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
The study was released last week as part of the annual report on education by the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution , in Washington .
Brookings senior fellow Tom Loveless tracked the number of students taking the 8th grade NAEP between 1990 and 2011 who reported taking an advanced math class , which could mean Algebra 1 , Algebra 2 , Geometry , or an algebra course `` stretched over two years . ''
In 1990 , only 16 percent of 8th graders enrolled in an algebra course , versus 81 percent in a more basic pre-algebra course . By 2011 , fully 47 percent of 8th grade students reported taking Algebra 1 or higher math .
Between 2005 and 2011 , 45 states boosted the number of 8th graders taking Algebra 1 , with an average increase of 5.5 percent more of those students taking a math course at the level of Algebra 1 or higher .
Mr. Loveless found no connection , though , between increases in the number of 8th graders enrolled in Algebra 1 and states ' average NAEP math scores , even after controlling for changes in the states ' rates of children in poverty , English-language learners , and black and Hispanic students .
A recent analysis of high school coursework by the National Center for Education Statistics found that a majority of high school courses labeled Algebra 1 and Geometry cover a significant amount of more basic material .
Critics noted that the NCES study did not include data on 8th grade Algebra 1 and Geometry courses , even though one in five 2005 high school graduates had taken Algebra 1 in middle school . But the Brookings study suggests the high school pattern may hold in middle school math courses , too .

In states that did not increase their enrollments , students in 8th grade Algebra 1 courses performed , on average , 9.2 points better in 2011 than in 2005 . In states with rising enrollments , by contrast , students in 8th grade Algebra 1 improved only 5.2 scale points during the same period .
`` I think the Brookings study using state aggregated data confirms a lot of what NCES finds in our more detailed transcript analysis , '' said NCES Commissioner Sean P. `` Jack '' Buckley .
Mr. Loveless said the study suggests that advanced math in middle school may be `` watered down '' as more students of different ability levels in math take the course .
`` Algebra in 8th grade used to be reserved for gifted students ; if you were a high flier in math , you were moved up , '' he said . As taking Algebra 1 in 8th grade becomes the `` new normal , '' he said , gifted math students are being pushed to take the subject in 7th grade , and take a geometry course in 8th .
`` It does n't matter what we do as the norm , there will be another class created for gifted [ students ] , '' Mr. Loveless said .

The unipolar , US-led global order is facing its most difficult challenge since the fall of the Berlin wall , most notably from Russia and China . This competition is currently most harrowing in Syria , but it is also playing out in the tiny but geostrategic East African nation of Burundi . Burundi borders Rwanda to the north , Tanzania to the east , and the hugely resource rich Democratic Republic of Congo to the west . In May , Russia and China blocked a UN Security Council resolution to censure Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza for seeking a third term . Russia 's U.N . Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters , ‚Äú It 's not the business of the Security Council and the U.N. Charter to get involved in constitutional matters of sovereign states. ‚Äù Earlier , a Russian firm won the contract to exploit Burundi 's nickel reserves , which are probably its most valuable mineral resource .
The country 's highest court ruled that Nkurunziza was constitutionally entitled to seek a third term , and he went on to claim victory in the election , after defeating a May coup attempt . Western governments and press nevertheless continued to excoriate Nkurunziza , as violence continued in the country 's capital , Bujumbura , and on its border with Rwanda .
I spoke to Didas Gasana , a Rwandan journalist who has taken political refuge in Sweden , where he writes that Burundi is Africa 's Syria , deep down in the center of Sub-Saharan Africa .
Ann Garrison : Didas , you wrote an essay publisehd in The Rwandan and the San Francisco Bay View comparing Syria and Burundi . Could you explain your main points ?
Didas Gasana : Both Syria and Burundi are international hot spots , where the global centers of power ‚Äì that is the US and Russia ‚Äì are tussling it out . So , basically I was trying to show that what we see in Burundi is not an internal problem . It 's actually between the Kremlin and Washington D.C. , which is the same case in Syria .
AG : You described Burundi as a proxy war . Could you explain ?
DG : What distinguishes Burundi from Syria is that in Syria we have the Russian and the US forces sharing the same airspace . In Burundi , the US , the UK , Israel and Belgium are using Rwanda ‚Äì are using Paul Kagame 's Rwanda ‚Äì while the Russians and Chinese are using Tanzania and South Africa .
AG : We 're being encouraged to think of the Burundian conflict in terms of Hutu and Tutsi . Is there anything you 'd like to say about that ?
DG : I am a close cousin of the Burundians . Rwandans and Burundians are close cousins , and I do n't buy that story . I do n't believe that , because when you look at the opposition in Burundi , the people who are opposed to President Pierre Nkurunziza are both Tutsis and Hutus . And in his cabinet , we have got both the Hutus and the Tutsis . So it is not an inter-ethnic divide , and in the end , it all boils down to who is using the opposition against a legitimate government .
AG : With Pierre Nkurunziza 's government being the legitimate government in Burundi ?
DG : Yes .
AG : This week Reuters reported that the African Union Peace and Security Council had urged the AU to send troops to Burundi , so as to intervene in the event of mass violence . What do you think of this ?
DG : Well , personally , I think the African Union should be sending peacekeepers to Rwanda , most especially on the Rwanda/Burundi common border , because we know where the trouble is coming from . Burundi , internally , would be safe had it not been for the intrusion of Rwanda and the power that Rwanda is working for , meaning the US , the EU , and Israel . So , even if we have these troops on Burundian soil , without curtailing Rwanda 's ability to destabilize Burundi , we wo n't have any room for peace in Burundi , and therefore no peace to keep in Burundi .
AG : OK , you think the African Union should send peacekeepers to the Rwandan Burundian border because Rwanda is destabilizing Burundi and if Rwanda is not stopped , there will be no peace to keep in Burundi . Right ?
DG : Absolutely . That is what I would say , Ann .
AG : Do you think that the AU peacekeepers will intervene in the interests of peace rather than the interests of one or the other side of the competition between two axes , the US/EU and Russia/China ?
DG : Well , first of all we have to look at the international economics and politics of peacekeeping . These peacekeepers , if they 're in Burundi , they may tend to lean on the side that is able to lobby more effectively than the other . So if Russia and China lobby these peacekeepers , they may go on their side . If the US and the EU succeed in lobbying them more effectively , they may go on their side . It 's all about lobbying . It 's all about politics and economics . I think that the African Union will be divided on this because Russia and China have influence in the AU , just as the US and the EU do . So the effect of their lobbying is an important thing to keep an eye on .
AG : Is there anything else you 'd like to say about this ?
DG : Well , I 'd like to say that the Russians and the Chinese , the ordinary people who pay the taxes and make the government possible , like the ordinary citizens of the US and the EU , they must hold their governments responsible and accountable for their foreign policy . US citizens , Russian , Chinese and EU citizens must understand that the ordinary man is not profiting from resource war and conflict economics in Africa . Multinational corporations are profiting .
Didas Gasana is a Rwandan journalist who has taken political refuge in Sweden because his criticism of President Paul Kagame 's Rwandan government put his life in danger . His essay , ‚Äú Like Syria , Burundi is a war theater : the China-Russia axis vs. the US-EU axis , ‚Äù is published on the website of the San Francisco Bay View , sfbayview.com .

A recent poll just dealt a massive blow to the last argument for proponents of the Affordable Care Act , more commonly referred to as ‚Äú Obamacare , ‚Äù and even Democrats have to agree : This is the end for Obamacare .
The poll , conducted by McLaughlin and Associates , surveyed respondents from varying political backgrounds with 36 percent being Democrats , 33 percent Republicans and 31 percent independents . The survey wanted to get to the bottom of the strongest argument in favor of Obamacare ‚Äî protection for those with pre-existing conditions .
What the poll showed , however , was that Americans across political party lines prefer something else over that protection clause : actual affordability .
According to the Washington Free Beacon , respondents were asked whether they were preferred the law guarantee lower health insurance premiums , the Affordable Care Act 's pre-exisiting condition protections or different pre-existing condition provisions be implemented that would lower premiums .
The major failure of the ACA was that it was by no means affordable , according to the poll results . Premiums were extremely expensive and citizens received a tax penalty for not having insurance despite the high costs of the premiums .
In October of 2016 the Obama administration announced that ACA premiums were set to increase by double digits .
It would appear , based on the poll , that this was a major concern for Americans , as 37.1 percents responded that they would prefer lower health insurance premiums versus 26.8 percent who wanted to keep Obamacare ‚Äò s pre-existing conditions clause .
Additionally , 25.8 percent preferred a new provision to be implemented for those with pre-existing conditions without raising premiums and about 10 percent were undecided .
Jeffrey Anderson , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , interpreted the poll as saying that some Americans ‚Äî though clearly not the majority ‚Äî wanted provisions to guarantee coverage for those with pre-existing conditions , but at lower cost .
‚Äú It seems clear , then , based on the poll 's results , that Americans do want preexisting-conditions protections , but they do not want Obamacare 's preexisting-conditions protections ( to ) lead to significantly higher premiums , which they unquestionably do , ‚Äù Anderson explained .
Anderson drafted an alternative to the ACA in 2014 and has been steadily gaining traction with his proposal , which would seek to fix many of the issues present in the current law . You can read his full proposal here . The people have spoken , and Obamacare is not what they want . It 's time to let someone else try their hand at fixing the issues by actually listening to what American taxpayers care about , cutting back federal involvement in health care and unleashing the power of the free market .

The Manchester City pipeline has dropped off yet another talented player on the shores of the Bronx .
New York City FC have signed Norwegian goalkeeper Eirik Johansen ; a youth product of the Manchester City Academy .
‚Äú We had a good look at Eirik over the course of the pre-season , and he adapted well to the team and to our style of play . It 's always good to have strong competition for places in the team , and Eirik will add to an already strong group of goalkeepers vying for game time . It 's a long season and guys will get their opportunities for various reasons . ‚Äù
Terms of the deal were not disclosed .
Johansen , 22 , signed with Manchester in 2012 , going on loan to League One side Scunthorpe United in 2013 and then Norwegian club Sandefjord in 2014 . He has represented Norway at the youth international level and has also been a fixture with NYCFC through preseason training , particularly as Ryan Meara fell to injury .
‚Äú I had a great experience working with squad and coaches during the pre-season and I 'm excited to re-join the team on permanent basis . The quality of the training really impressed me , as did the way the team came together in such a short period of time . ‚Äù

Why the Cowboys are putting their faith in Jeff Heath as a starting safety Share This Story On ... Twitter

Louis DeLuca/Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys strong safety Jeff Heath ( 38 ) is brought down after intercepting a pass from Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston ( 3 ) during the Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. the Dallas Cowboys NFL football game at AT & T Stadium in Arlington , Texas on Sunday , December 18 , 2016 . ( Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News )
By Bob Sturm , Special contributor Contact Bob Sturm on Twitter : @ SportsSturm
Of the Cowboys ' projected 22 starters for Week 1 , you can find several All-Pros , first-round picks , and at least four players included on the NFL 's list for most jerseys sold . You can find guys who are adored and feared throughout the land and the focal point of why the Cowboys will be great this year . You will also find Jeff Heath . Heath , 26 , is entering his fifth year with the Cowboys and appears to be the Cowboys ' main plan to start alongside Byron Jones at safety ( primarily free safety ) this season . This after playing the fourth most snaps of any safeties last year , behind Jones , Barry Church , and even J.J. Wilcox . In fact , Wilcox played 2,864 snaps on this defense over his four years before signing with Tampa Bay this spring ( Church signed with Jacksonville ) , while Heath was given the nod on 1,171 snaps in those same four years . This seems to be the biggest knock against Heath , although they are definitely different types of players who can do different things well -- if the Cowboys repeatedly preferred Wilcox over Heath , and most think that Wilcox had too many issues to be a starter in the NFL ( good luck , Tampa ) , then what could Heath realistically offer ?
Is Jeff Heath finally poised for Cowboys stardom ?
In other words , when season projections come out this summer and your friend at work who ca n't stand the Cowboys starts looking for potential weak spots in the Dallas armor , many of them have cited that this team has no players in the secondary and `` has a bunch of rookies and somehow are planning on starting Jeff Heath back there , too ! '' So , that is our exercise today . I wanted to sort through the tape we do have of Jeff Heath and ask the question , `` are the Cowboys really starting him in center field this year ? '' They had the chance to do something about their issues there and stood pat as if they are confident in the young man from Saginaw Valley State who was n't invited to the combine . The short answer to the question above is , yes , they are . But , let 's dive a little deeper . Heath has been one of the core special teams guys on this squad since he arrived and made the team in 2013 . While playing 18 defensive snaps a game over the course of his career is n't very impressive , he has played 20 special teams snaps per game during that same stretch ( which , essentially , is about all of them besides field goal and extra point teams ) . As I have said a hundred times in this space , for any NFL player who is not a Top 100 draft pick or a QB , your way onto the team is to be a special teams standout first . If you can handle that responsibility , the coaching staff will start to believe in you and give you more . For most players coming from college football , they often are n't forced to run special teams because they are star players at their school and then are ill-equipped to jump right in at the NFL level . But , you can tell those who are up for it . They excel and the team depends upon them . So , on the NFL conveyor belt , by year three or four , if you are a special teams pillar , you will need a veteran contract soon or they replace you in the draft . In most cases for those who do n't get on the field in any other way , that means a number of one-year deals on a `` play for pay '' basis . So , when we saw the Cowboys signed him to a four-year contract in the spring of 2016 ( 4 years , $ 7.67 million ) , we should have known they thought he had the chance to get in the mix on their defense if things went right for him .
Cowboys DB outlook : Dallas hoping rookies provide three things to replace lost talent in free agency
When the Cowboys played nickel ( or dime ) last year , which happened over 807 snaps of the 1,014 plays last year , they did so with three safeties or more on many occasions . They also played with four safeties in many spots . They never played with four corners , though . That was a function of personnel issues that may have been addressed in the offseason , but the overriding point is that Heath and Jones are not the only plans . They have many uses to get the best five or six DBs on the field , and they love their guys who can do both . I invite you to read this summary from fellow Cowboys writer , KD Drummond , about the way they did things last season that I used data from . He cites properly that like Byron Jones before him , Chidobe Awuzie is thought of as a guy who can play corner or safety . And both Kevon Frazier and Xavier Woods were drafted as potential `` center field '' types , so we should not assume Heath has a really long leash on his spot , but they realize there are plenty of snaps to fill . If you are playing 80 percent of your snaps in nickel , and of those , almost one-third are played in dime ( six defensive backs ) , then we have to stop with our traditional thinking that our favorite football team needs two corners and two safeties to play . That time is gone , grandpa . In the new NFL , there are no fullbacks , two starting linebackers , and lots and lots of wide receivers and defensive backs . OK , let 's look at some Heath tape and discuss his game a bit . But even that requires a moment more of set-up . On Thursday 's preseason game , Cris Collinsworth said something that I struggled with on the broadcast :
Collinsworth said `` Cowboys played more 2-Deep Coverages than any team in the league . '' I 'd love to verify that , because I ca n't believe it . ‚Äî Bob Sturm ( @ SportsSturm ) August 4 , 2017
My issue with that is based on watching the Cowboys and studying their coverages . I do n't believe what he is saying is true , but there are two issues with my challenge . 1 ) I do n't have numbers to verify my claim relative to the rest of the league . He owns Pro Football Focus , so I assume he does . That is why I would love to see his data , but I should figure he knows . 2 ) We do n't know how they label things at PFF . Are they just going with 2-deep in presnap ( Cover 2 shell ) ? Because , I will happily concede the Cowboys show 2-deep constantly in presnap . But , without fail , they are always dropping one safety down and going to a single-high safety once the ball is snapped on the majority of snaps . It would seem meaningless to log the number of times they show Cover-2 if they are not actually using that coverage , but that is the only way I would agree that the Cowboys play those coverages `` more than any team in the league . ''
10 things to know about Cowboys safety Jeff Heath , including his Division I offers outside of football
Regardless , Heath allows Jones to play closer to the line of scrimmage and trust Heath to do things they could not trust Church or Wilcox to ever do , and that is to play safety as it was meant to be played -- safely . They drop Heath in center field and ask him to read coverages , address the deepest threats , and then clean up other people 's messes and keep big plays from becoming huge plays . Take good angles and for crying out loud , if the QB throws you something , pick it off . Do you know who leads the Cowboys secondary in interceptions since 2013 ? It is sort of a trick question , because there is a four-way tie with five each . This stat , that in four years , it only takes five interceptions to lead the team in 67 games is pretty disappointing . But , there are four DBs who have done it : Church , Wilcox , Orlando Scandrick and Heath . Church played 3,443 snaps to get those picks , Wilcox 2,864 , with Scandrick using 2,593 . Heath with 1,171 shows the lone ability to get his five with a mark of less than 500 snaps per pick . He picks off a pass every 234 plays . Nobody else is close . The odd caveat is that three of his picks have come off Jameis Winston in two games against Tampa Bay , unless you know that Winston loves to throw balls up for grabs in the middle of the field quite a bit .
This one was from Week 15 when David Irving hit Winston 's elbow and that helped Heath play some CF and have a pick hit him in the bread basket .
But , he also had the game of his life in the playoffs vs. Green Bay . He had three substantial moments that put confidence in the Cowboys front office . He was so close to being a hero that day against Aaron Rodgers . First , his ability to get wide on long passes and close those windows quickly . Rodgers thought he could pick on Heath a few times , and Heath stood pretty tall . The first one was when Anthony Brown was beaten badly on a deep route . He had that pick , which counted , and another pick which did not due to Anthony Brown 's hold on Ty Montgomery .
That play could have turned the game , as Rodgers made a very risky throw . It did n't count , but Heath 's range was on full display again . That is where we should focus for this study .
Also , this moment where defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli sent him on a blitz . Rodgers was holding the ball loose and Heath did not get it out . But , again , so close to turning the game with a stop . Heath showed in the big game he could handle things , and became just the third Cowboy ever with a sack and an interception in the same playoff game .
The other game he played the most was Thanksgiving when Washington was trying to use two tight ends to pick on a Cowboys secondary that was pretty banged up . Church was out with his broken arm . Here we saw Heath show up a few different times , although , they play him very deep , so most of the action does happen in front of him .
On this play , he is playing a deep center in the red zone and has to come back to Jordan Reed . His hit ends up damaging Reed for the rest of the season . The play should have been a touchdown , but he will hit you and you will often feel it .
This view shows Heath on Pierre Garcon and swinging over to try to assist with Reed . Reed was never the same in 2016 .
They went at Heath out of zone look with DeSean Jackson later . Heath is deep , but takes a good angle to make sure Jackson stops there at the catch . This is a good zone beater route combination that caught the Cowboys with a big hole in the zone .
We do n't have a ton of run support moments , but this one shows one of his best attributes , that he is usually centered up and strong at tackling . Every safety is going to miss a few , but your safety should play as his position indicates ... with safety in mind . Stop plays .
Here he is rolling downhill to get Vernon Davis in the open field . Look , I am not here to tell you this is Darren Woodson . But , I am here to tell you that , yes , they are starting him here and yes , they think he can do it . I think he can play a little bit and am anxious to see how well in the bright lights . It will be up to him to prove his value to the organization , but even if he is ultimately not good enough , they will still ask him to remain a special teams pillar . Opponents will challenge him and see if he is a weak spot . This is a league that finds those weaknesses with great ease after a while . But , make no mistake , he believes he is ready for this , and so does his front office . Even if the Cowboys fan base does n't buy it , for now .

Amazing stories about the cognitive skills and emotional lives of other animals abound . Recently Chinese has reported that a captive bear on a Chinese bear farm killed her son and then herself after she heard him cry out in pain when a catheter was jammed into his abdomen so that bile could be extracted from his gallbladder for human medicinal purposes . Around 14,000 bears are kept in horrific conditions and routinely tortured on Chinese bear farms . In this case `` a mother bear reportedly broke free after hearing her cub 's cry , causing [ bear ] 'farmers ' to run away in .

Captive bears spend upwards of 30 years in tiny cages where they can barely move their head and neck to feed and drink water . As they get larger the bears are crushed in their cage so that more bile can be squeezed out . While the details of this case are still being investigated , most , if not all , of these bears suffer extreme psychological and physical damage , including severe , gnawing off paws , rubbing the skin off their face and nose on the bars of their cage , chewing on the bars and losing teeth , and banging their head into the sides of their cage . Liver cancer is quite common as well . The bile that is extracted is used for a variety of ailments in the name of Traditional Chinese Medicine , but there are more than 100 synthetics and herbs that are actually better and cheaper and experts agree that bile is no longer needed . Surely , it 's time for a change .
I 've worked with moon bears who have been rescued from bear farms at the Moon Bear Rescue Centre outside of Chengdu , China , founded and run by Animals Asia . To date they have rescued 361 bears and have a very active campaign specifically designed to end bear farming ( see also ) . While I 've seen unimaginable suffering I 've also met some awesome individuals and have written about them in some of my previous essays . As a wonderful example of what the Animals Asia accomplishes , consider Jasper , who , after spending 15 years of torture in a tiny crush cage , has become an ambassador for forgiveness , generosity , peace , trust , and hope ( pictures of some crush cages and a relaxing Jasper can be found here ) . Jasper welcomes new bears into the rescue centre , breaks up fights , and plays with others who were lucky enough to be rescued . While tears flow for many other captives and rescued bears , individuals like Jasper bring smiles to our face and give us hope for the future .
Clearly , it 's time to end bear farming now and a petition can be found here .

MADISON ‚Äî Earlier this semester , an anonymous poster on a college gossip website posed a question to Drew University students : Who are the fattest people on campus ?
`` Call 'em out ! '' the poster said .
When a Drew freshman saw her name on the site , followed by cruel comments about her weight , she was devastated , her family said . The 19-year-old called her parents in tears and considered transferring out of the Madison university . Her parents e-mailed the website , called university officials and filed a complaint with the state Attorney General 's Office to get the posts removed .
They did n't get very far . As of today , the comments were still on the website for anyone to see .
The site , CollegeACB.com , is popular among gossip websites that give students free rein to post anything they want about their campuses and peers . Typical posts ask users to name the `` hottest freshman girls '' or `` who 's gay on campus . ''
The owners of CollegeACB ‚Äî which stands for College Anonymous Community Boards ‚Äî are unapologetic about their site , which has pages for more than 500 campuses nationwide .
`` Why anonymity ? Because everyone has something that they 're afraid to say out loud , '' the site 's mission statement says . `` We 'll be there when you want to write without responsibility . ''
The gossip site , which was recently purchased by new owners who have gone to great lengths to remain anonymous , has been drawing increasing scrutiny in recent months . In Nebraska , Creighton University blocked CollegeACB.com on campus computers last semester . In Atlanta , Emory University students organized a petition calling for classmates to pledge to boycott the site . In New York , the president of the University of Rochester e-mailed students , asking them to consider how posting on the site hurts their classmates .
Drew University President Robert Weisbuch sent a similar letter to his campus in February , calling on students at the 2,700-student private university to boycott CollegeACB .
`` These postings result in fear , anger , mistrust and shame in individuals who are named . By that , they destroy the safe and supportive environment we so value at Drew for learning and the free expression of ideas , '' the letter said .
The site came to the attention of Drew officials when they were contacted by the parents of the distraught freshman named in the post about overweight students in February .
The student 's father said he e-mailed CollegeACB to get the posts naming his daughter removed . The site removed one comment but left the remainder of the thread , including comments using the student 's full name , he said .
`` What they did was put up a place where cowards can hide behind anonymity . I was appalled , '' said the Monmouth County father of three , who asked that his name not be used to spare his daughter further embarrassment .
Federal law shields website owners from being legally responsible for information , including anonymous gossip , posted by site users . The Drew student 's family forwarded their complaints to the state Attorney General 's Office , hoping the case would be covered by New Jersey 's anti-bullying or harassment laws .
Rachel Goemaat , a spokeswoman for the Attorney General 's Office , declined to discuss whether the state is investigating CollegeACB .
`` We neither confirm nor deny investigations , '' she said .
When asked whether the site has been contacted by New Jersey law enforcement authorities , CollegeACB 's owners said `` no comment . ''
New Jersey has a history of cracking down on college gossip websites . In 2008 , Attorney General Anne Milgram announced the state was investigating another gossip site , JuicyCampus.com , after a Princeton University student said she was being terrorized by someone posting on the site . The state subpoenaed JuicyCampus ' records and advertisers , citing consumer fraud laws .
Within days , Connecticut 's attorney general launched a similar consumer fraud investigation . JuicyCampus , which was owned by a Nevada company , went out of business in 2009 as multiple lawsuits loomed and advertisers fled .
JuicyCampus ' owners redirected the site 's traffic to CollegeACB , a nearly identical site started by Wesleyan and Johns Hopkins University students in 2008 . Peter Frank , another Wesleyan University student , purchased the site a year later and took it national . Frank sold the site in January to new owners , who have kept their identity secret .
When contacted by e-mail , the new owners declined to reveal their names or any personal details . They also refused to be interviewed by phone , saying their policy was to speak to the media only via the internet . The CollegeACB.com domain name is registered under the address of a Florida privacy service used by website owners who want to shield their names in public records .
`` We think that conversations about the site owners are an asinine waste of time . We want our audience to concentrate discussions on how to improve the site and not to obsess over our personal biographies , '' CollegeACB 's owners said via e-mail .
They also defended how the site handles complaints from users who object to CollegeACB 's posts .
`` We try to handle complaints promptly and fairly , '' the owners said .
It is unclear if CollegeACB is drawing a profit . The free site has about 450,000 unique users a month , but all of the advertising space currently is being donated to charitable causes , including Doctors Without Borders , the owners said .
When asked if their site is in danger of losing money , as JuicyCampus.com did before it folded , CollegeACB 's owners admitted gossip is n't paying so far .
`` We 're probably going to lose much more money than they ever did , '' they said .
Tesla has ended its Resale Value Guarantee program for cars purchased after July 1st , a company spokesperson has confirmed to The Verge . The program guaranteed the resale value of a Tesla Model S after three years when purchased through one of the company 's loan financing programs .
The resale value was calculated as 50 percent of the base purchase price of an entry-level Model S plus 43 percent of the value of all options added to the vehicle , including larger batteries . An update to the program guaranteed that the value of a Model S would remain higher than that of competing BMW , Audi , Mercedes , Lexus , and Jaguar models .
The program was initiated to reassure early buyers of the Model S that there would be a market for resale of the vehicles . In general , buyers of premium automobiles upgrade to newer models within a few years , making resale value an important consideration to purchasers . The program was `` backed personally '' by Tesla CEO Elon Musk , according to a Tesla blog post about the program , giving owners `` complete peace of mind about the long term value of the product . ''
`` We have discontinued the Resale Value Guarantee program as of July 1 so that we can keep interest rates as low as possible and offer a compelling Lease and Loan program to customers , '' said a Tesla spokesperson in a statement . `` We will continue to support customers currently financed through the RVG program . ''
Test driving the Tesla Model S P85D
As if trying to scamper across a frozen pond before falling through expanding cracks in the ice beneath him , Stephen Harper leads his party into the last stretch of the campaign . Those cracks are fissures in the Conservative base .
Dismay Voiced by Firebrands Who Helped Put Harper in Power read more
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‚Äò Punch to the Gut ' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions , says director Corey Payette .
Another one gaped into view last week when the head of Canada 's National Firearms Association went public with his group 's opposition to Bill C-51 , the Anti-Terrorism Act , which expands the government 's powers to spy on the citizenry in the name of anti-terrorism .
Sheldon Clare was ready to testify against the bill on behalf of the NFA , he claims , until the Conservatives offered to amend other legislation regarding firearms . He ducked the session , but then the Conservatives backed out of the deal , Clare said . Now he is running as an independent in the B.C . riding of Cariboo-Prince George .
The sound of ice cracking seemed to grow louder last week as Clare told the Toronto Star of his disillusionment :
`` I found that the Conservative government is not the friend of firearms owners despite what they 're claiming ; they 've had ample opportunity to make a lot of changes , they have not done so ; they pay lip service to this part of their so-called base , and when people tell you 'you have no one else to vote for so suck it up , ' that 's not what works well for me . I do n't like being manipulated . ''
A Conservative spokesperson said Clare 's account is `` baseless . '' But the NFA joins other potential Tory stalwarts who 've recoiled at Bill C-51 's proposed intrusion into private citizens ' affairs .
Connie Fournier did show up before a parliamentary hearing to speak out against the Anti-Terrorism Act ; she testified on the same day Clare was scheduled to . She said her concerns fell on deaf ears , and that 's been the mark of Harper 's Conservatives .
A winner of a Queen 's Diamond Jubilee Medal for promoting free speech , Fournier runs the controversial right-wing Internet forum Free Dominion and recently published Betrayed : Stephen Harper 's war on principled conservatism .
`` All the people who worked to get Harper into government are disappointed , '' Fournier said . `` He 's been in for nine years , and he took that opportunity and he squandered it . ''
Built on a vision of Reform
Fournier speaks from personal experience . She was an early organizer for the Reform Party , the populist rebellion coming out of Western Canada in the 1980s determined to end what it saw as decades of patronage , opacity and wasted tax dollars in the capital , Ottawa .
Harper was a key strategist in building the Reform Party 's base of social conservatives and haters of big government . What he helped foment , he then welded with Canada 's less-zealous , business establishment friendly Progressive Conservatives in 2003 to form the modern Conservative Party of Canada .
The Harper-led coalition held for 12 years as Canada 's more progressive parties split the left-leaning vote . The newly minted Conservatives gained a minority government in 2006 and , in 2011 , a majority mandate , grabbing 39 per cent of the overall vote .
Fournier sighed while recalling the ideals that energized Reformers . `` We really were trying to build a party that was accountable to the grassroots , '' she said . `` We got the exact opposite . ''
Harper 's seven deficits since 2006 , Canada 's new recession , and a lack of government transparency and the accumulation of Conservative scandals are some of the main complaints Fournier said she hears among past Reformers .
Moral issues
The schisms extend to social conservatives . Some are frustrated that Harper never gambled on trying to legislate against gay rights or abortion .
Randy White , the retired Reform Party Member of Parliament who once said `` to heck with the courts '' on the issue of gay marriage was recently spotted at a campaign rally for the left-wing New Democratic Party . He admitted he was considering voting for them over a few reasons .
`` I got kids , and they got families . Their disposable income is a lot less these days . I just think Canadians are looking for something that 's going to change , '' he told a television reporter .
Michael Coren , who hosted a religious program on the now defunct Fox News-styled Canadian network Sun News ( its former VP now works for Harper 's campaign ) , penned a column for the Toronto Star telling people voting Tory is not very Christian .
He said Conservatives have failed morally on `` stewardship of the environment , care for the poor and marginalized , the pursuit of peace , and personal integrity . ''
Free-spending electioneering
Meanwhile , John Robson , Coren 's former colleague at Sun News , argued in a column that Harper is handing out tax credits and government cheques for anything he thinks will win him votes -- ironic considering that Harper 's 1991 economics thesis took aim at Canadian politics for such tactics .
While that fragment of Harper 's base attacks him for emulating socialists , another key group -- those who served in Canada 's military -- are vocal in their condemnation of how they 've been treated under the Tories .
One veterans ' group calls itself Anybody But Conservatives . It commissioned a poll that found one-third of Canadians who voted for the Tories in 2011 may vote for another party over the issue . At a moment when Harper is campaigning on increasing Canada 's military spending and role in the world , the veterans ' complaints have garnered a lot of media play .
University of Toronto political science professor Nelson Wiseman said he believes the veterans ' poll is reflective of wider dissatisfaction with the Conservatives .
Stephen Harper has always banked on a committed base and a divided centre-left to stay in power . But the longer he 's done so , time , tactics , controversies and compromises have exposed contradictions within his coalition . This time around , Wiseman said , between Bill C-51 , recession , religious concerns and other issues , there 's something for everyone in the Conservative base to be unhappy about .
`` That 's the reason support for the Conservatives has dropped from around 40 per cent in the last election to about 30 per cent today , '' he said .
How that dissatisfaction manifests itself at voting booths across Canada is anyone 's guess , Wiseman said , stressing the party could still win the tight election .
But Harper 's team is clearly worried , inking hardball strategist Lynton Crosby to steer the remainder of the Conservative campaign . Crosby is expected to employ negative attacks and wedge issues in a bid to motivate jaded Conservative voters to get to the polls on October 19 .
On that day , Connie Fournier is one who wo n't be resting at home on a cushion of disappointment . She will be voting , she said . For which party , she does n't know . But it wo n't be the Conservatives .
The Flensburger Tageblatt ( FT ) first reported on Monday that the the new government in Germany 's northernmost state was dead set on testing out the controversial form of social security , whereby every citizen receives a flat monthly sum of money from the state regardless of whether they are employed or not .
‚Äú As a government we want to test out the unconditional basic income and make Schleswig-Holstein a model region , ‚Äù the newspaper quoted the state 's new deputy minister-president Robert Habeck ( Green Party ) as saying .
The news spread like wild fire across social media , fuelled by the FT speculating that citizens in the northern state could get ‚Ç¨1,000 a month under the scheme .
But a report in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung on Tuesday has dampened expectations .
‚Äú Neither the discussion nor the examination of this topic has started . It is much too early to talk about individual concrete models , ‚Äù the article quotes Schleswig-Holstein 's minister-president Daniel G√ºnther from the conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) as saying .
The new state government is made up of the CDU as largest party and the Green party and the Free Democrats ( FDP ) as junior partners .
The coalition agreement between the parties , published on Tuesday , mentions the project in much more vague terms .
`` We will create a 'laboratory for the future ' in which we will look into security models such as a citizen 's income , an unconditional basic income , or the further development of the social security system , ‚Äù the agreement states .
While the Green Party are for introducing an unconditional basic income , the FDP only support it as long as unemployed people strive to look for work , thus calling into question the idea of it being unconditional .
Any possible plan would replace other forms of social welfare , such as unemployment benefit and student loans .
Advocates of the unconditional basic income say it would do away with the huge bureaucracy needed to administer welfare payments , which costs the taxpayer billions of euros a year .
Finland introduced a pilot scheme at the start of the year , whereby 2,000 jobless people receive ‚Ç¨560 a month .

Pending home sales in California , based on signed contracts , fell 2.6 % in October compared to a year ago , the fourth month in a row of year-over-year declines , after having dropped 6 % in September , 3.5 % in August , and 2.6 % in July .
`` A continued scarcity of housing inventory , which drove up home prices , may squeeze the market heading into the closing months of the year , '' explained the California Association of Realtors ( C.A.R . ) in the report .
Of the three major regions , only the Central Valley booked gains .
San Francisco Bay Area : Pending home sales dropped 10.5 % year-over-year in October , after having dropped 10.8 % in September , 11.6 % in August , 11.5 % in July‚Ä¶ the 13th month in a row of year-over-year declines . In the two counties that make up the core of Silicon Valley - the counties of San Mateo and Santa Clara - pending sales plunged 10.9 % and 21.4 % ! San Francisco County was `` the anomaly , '' as the report put it , with pending sales jumping 15.1 % .
Southern California : Pending home sales fell 7.3 % after having fallen 7.1 % in September , and 3.8 % in August . In July , they 'd still inched up 1.4 % . The counties with the sharpest declines were San Diego ( -11.4 % ) , Riverside ( -14.0 % ) , and San Bernardino ( -10.4 % ) . But year-over-year declines also hit Los Angeles ( -4.7 % ) and Orange ( -4.9 % ) .
Central Valley region : Pending home sales rose 5.1 % year-over-year , driven by the 6.6 % increase in Sacramento County , where pending sales had plunged 16.8 % the prior month .
Wolf Street
As the sharp reversal of the Sacramento data from September to October shows , pending home sales can be volatile . But if they start pulling long enough and hard enough in the same direction , they 're an indication of what actual sales might look like over the next few months . In the Bay Area , pending homes sales have been plunging in the double digits for months . And even Southern California is no longer immune .
What 's the biggest concern among brokers ?
44 % cited `` declining housing affordability/inflated home prices/rising interest rates . '' The interest rate concern is fascinating because 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages are still quoted below 4 % , which is historically low .
Another 30 % of brokers cited a lack of available homes for sale as their biggest concern .
Others cited `` a slowdown in economic growth , lending and financing , and policy and regulations . ''
In a separate report on sales and median prices of single-family detached houses - not including condos and townhouses - C.A.R . blamed the decline in actual sales of houses ( -3.4 % in October compared to a year ago ) on these factors :
As we enter the fall home-buying season , we 're seeing signs of the market slowing as eroding affordability and persistently low housing inventory cut into home sales . Moreover , the looming tax reform bill that eliminates important incentives that help first-time homebuyers and existing homeowners will only further adversely impact the housing market .
The statewide median price - half sell for more , half sell for less - of single-family detached houses declined for the second straight month in October to $ 546,430 , after a record August , and remains up 6.1 % from a year ago . Active listings dropped 11.5 % from a year ago :
Since the beginning of the year , active listings have declined by more than 10 % every month , and the number of available listings for sale has trended downward for more than two years .
At the current sales rate , unsold inventory dropped to 3.0 months ' supply in October , down from 3.4 months ' a year ago .
And the median price of single-family detached houses ( not including condos and townhouses ) has reached these levels , according to C.A.R . - the craziest ones in red :
Wolf Street
But these are the median prices for single-family detached houses only . Condo and townhouses are not included . And that makes a difference . For example , in San Francisco condos outsell single-family houses by 60 % . The median house price soared 13 % in October year-over-year , to $ 1.59 million , after a record number of luxury home sales . But the median condo price fell a smidgen year-over-year to $ 1.13 million as a flood of new supply has been coming on the market [ read‚Ä¶ San Francisco House Prices Go Nuts , Condo Prices Stall ] .
Across California , listing prices of the homes under contract got cut more often : In October , 32 % had their listing price reduced , up from 26 % in September .
Sales above asking price have declined , and sales below asking price have increased :
23 % of pending sales were above asking price in October , down from 29 % in September - at an average premium of 9 % .
46 % of pending sales were below asking price , up from 28 % a month earlier - at an average discount of 12 % .
30 % sold at asking price , down from 43 % a month ago .
What gives ? After years of surging prices , buying a home has moved out of reach for many households . And existing homeowners who have trouble moving up to a nicer place do n't put their current homes on the market . Hence the tight supplies of houses - but not of condos . This is causing some shifts in the dynamics of the market , with the condo market already showing signs of weakness in the pricing arena .

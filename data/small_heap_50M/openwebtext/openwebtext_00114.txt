Secretary of Defense James Mattis discredited a questionable NBC report Wednesday that claimed President Donald Trump demanded a tenfold increase in the size of the nuclear arsenal .
“ Recent reports that the President called for an increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal are absolutely false , ” Mattis said in a statement . “ This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible . ”
The NBC report suggested that Trump 's surprising request caused Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to call the president a “ moron , ” part of another report which both the secretary of state and the president have criticized for inaccuracies .
Trump rejected Wednesday 's report as fake news , calling NBC out on Twitter and putting them on the same level as CNN , which the president has repeatedly attacked for its false reporting .
Fake @ NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a “ tenfold ” increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal . Pure fiction , made up to demean . NBC = CNN ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 11 , 2017
Trump called NBC 's style of reporting and journalism “ disgusting ” when speaking to reporters Wednesday .
“ It is frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write , ” he said , adding that a number of outlets are writing stories based on sources that simply do not exist .
Trump explained that , while he expects the U.S. to maintain top-notch nuclear capabilities , he believes that a substantial tenfold increase in the size of the nuclear arsenal would be excessive and unnecessary .

At the Conservative party conference , Theresa May 's ministers laid out plans to force companies to publish a list of foreign workers , curb international students and prioritise `` homegrown '' doctors . The Prime Minister herself declared that anyone who considered themselves a citizen of the world was `` a citizen of nowhere '' .
But the First Minister of Scotland is taking a very different tack . Nicola Sturgeon denounced the Tories ' `` toxic rhetoric '' in a joint statement with the leaders of the Green and Plaid Cymru parties .
Now , footage of her speech at the formal opening of the Holyrood parliament in July is being shared around the internet . In it , she set out a sweeping rebuke to anti-immigration sentiment , and social media users are responding .
Recalling how the first First Minister , Labour 's Donald Dewar , had described a Scottish parliament as `` more than our politics and our laws '' , she continued :
`` So allow me to reflect on who we are in Scotland today . We are more than 5m men and women , adults , yong pople and children , each with our own life stories , family histories and our own hopes and dreams . `` We 're the grandchildren and the great grandchildren of the thousands who came from Ireland to work in our shipyards and in our factories . We are the 80,000 Polish people , the 8,000 Lithuanians , the 7,000 each from France , Spain , Germany , Italy and Latvia , who are among the many from countries beyond our shores that we are so privileged to have living here amongst us . `` We are the more than half a million people born in England , Wales and Northern Ireland who have chosen to live here in Scotland . We are the thousands of European students studying at our universities and our colleges , and we are the doctors and nurses from all across our continent and beyond , who care for us daily in our National Health Service . `` Whether we have lived here for generations , or are new Scots from Europe , India , Pakistan , Africa and countries across the globe we are all of this and more . We are so much stronger for the diversity that shapes us . We are one Scotland . We are simply home to all those who have chosen to live here . That is who and what we are . ''
Sturgeon urged Scots to `` celebrate our differences '' and `` treat others with respect '' . She has signed a joint statement with the leaders of the Green and Plaid Cymru parties denouncing the Tories ' `` toxic rhetoric '' .
Social media users responded to a clip of the speech by sharing pictures of their family with the hashtag # WeAreScotland .

`` The Worst Generation ''
by Paul Begala
I hate the Baby Boomers . They 're the most self-centered , self-seeking , self-
interested , self-absorbed , self-indulgent , self-aggrandizing generation in
American history . As they enter late middle age , the Boomers still ca n't grow
up . Guys who once dropped acid are now downing Viagra ; women who once eschewed
lipstick are now getting liposuction .
I know it 's a sin to hate , so let me put it this way : If they were animals ,
they 'd be a plague of locusts , devouring everything in their path and leaving
but a wasteland . If they were plants , they 'd be kudzu , choking off ever other
living thing with their sheer mass . If they were artists , they 'd be abstract
expressionists , interested only in the emotions of that moment -- not in the
lasting result of the creative process . If they were a baseball club , they 'd be
the Florida Marlins : prefab prima donnas who bought their way to prominence ,
then disbanded -- a temporary association but not a team .
Of course , it is as unfair to demonize an entire generation as it is to
characterize an entire gender or race or religion . And I do n't literally mean
that everyone born between 1946 and 1964 is a selfish pig . But generations can
have a unique character that defines them , especially if they are the elites of
a generation -- those lucky few who are blessed with the money or brains or
looks or skills or education that typifies an era . Whether is Fitzgerald and
Hemingway defining the Lost Generation of World War I and the Roaring Twenties ,
or JFK and the other heroes of the World War II generation , or the high-tech
whiz kids of the post-Boomer generation , certain archetypes define certain
times .
You know who you are . If you grew your hair and burned your draft card on campus
during the Sixties ; if you toked , screwed , and boogied your way through the
Seventies ; if you voted for Reagan and believed `` Greed is good '' in the Eighties ;
and if you 're trying to make up for it now by nesting as you cluck about the
collapse of `` family values , '' you 're it . If not , even if demographers call you a
Boomer , you probably hate our generation 's elite as much as I do .
Let 's start with the Sixties , the Boomers ' dilettante ball . While a few
courageous people like John Lewis and the Freedom Riders risked their lives --
and others like Andrew Goodman , James Chaney , and Michael Schwerner gave theirs
-- the civil-rights movement was led by pre-Boomers like Martin Luther King Jr .
( who would be 71 if he were alive today ) and continued without strong support
from the Boomers on college campuses .
Still , I must say this : If you were one of those young people who did risk their
lives to fight racism in the Sixties , who put their bodies on the line to
register voters , who marched and sang and taught and preached against
segregation , you stand as the best refutation of my anti-Boomer tirade . In that
one moment of conscience and courage , you did more with your life than I 've done
in all the moments of mine . In a generation of selfish pigs , you were saints .
But the reality is that most campuses did not become hotbeds of unrest until the
Boomers ' precious butts were at risk as the Vietnam War escalated . They did n't
want to end the war because they were bothered by working-class kids being blown
apart ; if they had been , they would n't have spat on those working-class kids
when they came home from Vietnam , or tried to make heroes out of the Communists
who were trying to kill them .
Yet as troubling as that may be , the Sixties were in many ways the Boomers '
finest moment . It was at least a fad then to pretend to care about racial
justice at home and war abroad , to speak out against pollution and prejudice .
But it was mostly just talk . As they came of age , and as idealism might have
required some real sacrifice , idealism suddenly became unfashionable .
And so the Boomers careened into the Seventies without a thought to picking up
where King and the Kennedys left off . Without a war to threaten them , their
selfishness came into full bloom . You know the results : Drug abuse , once a
boutique curse of hip musicians , became more common than the clap . And speaking
of sexually transmitted diseases , the Boomers began to fornicate with such
abandon that rabbits we 're asking them to cool their jets . They did n't invent sex
or drugs or rock 'n ' roll , but they damned near ruined them all .
And do n't give me this crap about Boomer music . The Beatles were all born before
the end of the war . So was Janis . So while the Boomers can claim they had the
good taste to listen to gifted pre-Boomers , when it came their turn to make
music , the truest expression of their generation , what did they give us ?
Disco .
The generation that came before the Boomers gave them Dylan . The Boomers gave us
KC and the Sunshine Band . Thanks a lot .
Unfair ? Perhaps it is a bit of an overstatement . Some friends of mine have
suggested it 's an outrage to ignore Baby Boomer Bruce Springsteen , for one . True
enough .
But even more than music , our remarkable economy is what drives and defines the
times we live in today . And as the generation in the economic driver 's seat , the
Boomers should get the credit for building this remarkable prosperity , right ?
Well , not quite . Nothing can detract from the breathtaking entrepreneurship of
Boomers like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs . But what 's interesting is that much of
today 's prosperity owes its origins more to the high-tech young nerds of the
post-Boom generation than to the Boomers themselves . The most vital role the
Boomers have in the current economy is to sit on their brains and invest in
post-Boomer high-tech start-ups . The same folks who sponged off their parents
when they were young are now , as they age , getting rich off the industry of
their younger brothers and sisters .
Boomer political and economic values reached their most perfect expression under
pre-Boomer president Ronald Reagan in the Eighties : Screw your neighbor , lay off
the factory workers , shuffle a lot of paper , build an economy in which a few
people get the gold mine and most people get the shaft . It is telling that when
he ran for reelection , Reagan got higher support among Boomers than he did from
his fellow older Americans . Perhaps some of the Greatest Generation saw the
selfishness in Reaganism and turned away from it . And perhaps the Boomers saw
those same qualities , that savage selfishness , and embraced it .
In the long run , will it matter that one generation was so spectacularly
selfish ? Maybe not . In a great karmic irony , the Worst Generation may in turn be
raising another great one . Having taught the children of the Baby Boomers off an
on for five years now , at the University of Texas at Georgetown , I find them to
be the opposite of everything I despise about their parents -- they are engaged
in their communities , spending endless hours volunteering to build housing for
the poor or to feed the homeless . They are concerned about their classmates ,
having calmed down the PC mania and replaced it with a sensible sensitivity to
the feelings of others . They care about the future and are concerned about their
grandparents . They are more responsible in their private lives and more engaged
in our public life . I have no idea whether it 's because of the Boomers or in
spite of them .
Greatest Generation chronicler Tom Brokaw has the difference pegged : `` The World
War II generation did what was expected of them . But they never talked about it .
It was part of the Code . There 's no more telling metaphor than a guy in a
football game who does what 's expected of him -- makes an open-field tackle --
then gets up and dances around . When Jerry Kramer threw the block that won the
Ice Bowl in '67 , he just got up and walked off the field . ''
That kind of self-effacing dignity is wholly alien to the Boomer elite . But when
that day comes , when they finally walk off the field -- or what 's left of the
field -- a few of us who 've been trailing behind them will be doing a little
dance of our own .

“ Nick 's presence in that clubhouse means a lot . He 's a guy who has been around and knows the game , '' McClellan said . “ In the time I 've been in the big leagues , he 's the smartest player I 've played with . ''
That was the biggest complaint former Sox manager Terry Francona had on his way out , that the players were n't there for each other when the season started to turn sour . Punto is a player who can help change that .
“ He cares a lot about his teammates . That was something he showed us , how to be there for your teammates . ''
“ His personality will help that team , you watch , '' Jay said . “ He 's great around younger guys . Nick had a lot of respect in our clubhouse .
St. Louis outfielder John Jay believes the Red Sox made a smart move when they signed Punto to a two-year , $ 3 million deal in December .
“ Last year , when we were down by as many games as we were , it was still fun to come to the field every day thanks to guys like Nick . He kept everything loose , '' McClellan said . “ I do n't think we pull off what we did without that . ''
The Cardinals were 10 1/2 games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League wild card race in August . Punto played a significant role in their comeback , hitting .308 in September with a .924 OPS .
That Punto arrives in Boston a season after the team suffered a historic collapse is no coincidence . General manager Ben Cherington saw value in having a player who could provide leadership along with versatility .
“ I certainly hope so , '' said manager Bobby Valentine , who plans to use Punto at first base , too . “ He looks like he can make all the plays . ''
The 34-year-old Punto hit .278 with an .809 OPS for St. Louis . He played mostly second base but also started games at shortstop and third base . The Red Sox envision him in a similar role this season .
“ He 's a guy you want on your team , that 's the best way I can say it , '' reliever Kyle McClellan said before the Cardinals beat the Red Sox , 9-6 . “ It seems like he 's always doing the right thing . ''
In a game where talent can be measured by precise statistical metrics , Punto is a player whose value is harder to calculate but ca n't be denied .
Punto spent only one season with St. Louis but left a deep impression with his versatility on the field and the ability to fit in comfortably in every corner of the clubhouse .
FORT MYERS , Fla. - Nick Punto was a one-man receiving line on Thursday afternoon , standing behind the batting cage at JetBlue Park and exchanging handshakes or hugs with nearly every member of the St. Louis Cardinals who passed by on the way to their dugout .
Punto learned that part of the game from being around players like Jim Thome when he was coming up with the Phillies , and later when they were teammates in Minnesota .
“ You spend more time with your teammates during the season than you do with your wife and kids . I try to enjoy that time . There 's no other way for me to approach it , '' Punto said .
“ You snap your fingers and now I 'm in that role that Thome was for me . I 've embraced that and hopefully I pass it down . There always is a place for veterans . Teams are getting younger and younger but you need to have that veteran presence and have somebody to show you the way . ''
Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis , who has known Punto for several years , is another believer .
“ He 's going to do a lot for our team . It 's definitely a step in the right direction , '' Youkilis said . “ He 's been a winner . ''
Punto also has an alter ego known as “ The Shredder . ''
In the clubhouse , or during flights , he will surprise an unsuspecting teammate by yanking down on the collar of their dress shirt and tearing it off . It 's a way to have some fun .
“ He 's a character . He 's a lot of fun to be around , '' said Cardinals righthander Kyle Lohse , a teammate of Punto 's in Minnesota and St. Louis . “ He definitely knows the time and place . If you 've been around long enough you know the time and the place , when it 's time to have fun , and when to be serious . ''
For Punto , health will determine to what degree he can influence the Red Sox on the field . He played only 63 games last season because of three lengthy stays on the disabled list .
Punto did not get into a game in spring training while recovering from surgery to repair a hernia . The Cardinals activated him April 19 and used Punto regularly at second base before he strained a flexor muscle in his forearm . That cost him five weeks .
Punto returned in late June and lasted only a month before straining an oblique . That landed him back on the DL for another five weeks .
“ It was a mental grind going through the injuries like that , '' Punto said . “ When I finally did get healthy I started playing well and fought my way into the lineup . ''
Despite getting only 35 plate appearances in September , Punto appeared in 15 of St. Louis 's 18 postseason games and helped the Cardinals win the World Series .
Now he starts again with the Red Sox .
“ Just having a normal spring training and getting a chance to train has been nice , '' said Punto . “ You train hard in the offseason but you need spring training to get baseball strong .
“ I 'll hopefully be valuable in whatever role they want me to be . I 'll embrace any role . I 'm at the stage of my career where I just want to win . After getting a taste of that last year I want to win again with this team . ''

It 's not surprising that former Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann is defending Donald Trump . She 's a punchline for liberals and basically synonymous with a lack of rational thinking . What 's surprising to me is how she 's defending him .
Her argument , made on Jan Markell 's Understanding The Times radio show this weekend , was that everything emanating from the White House is wonderful because Trump is a man of God and he wo n't stop working .
Bachmann claimed that , since the inauguration , Trump has been “ working nonstop , 70 days in a row , [ he ] has n't taken a day off ” as part of his effort to make America great again and to take a stand for God . “ He is unashamed in standing up for increasing an awareness of God in the United States , ” she said . “ He recognizes how important that is and that that is a basis of Western civilization … As a believer in Jesus Christ , I could not be more happy with what I am seeing coming out of the Trump White House . This is beyond my wildest expectations. ” “ The president himself is man of prayer and man who loves to receive prayer , ” she cooed . “ He is a man who , I do believe , understands who the God of the Bible is and he wants to lift up the God of the Bible here in the United States … The Lord is working mightily in our government and I believe it is because God is being reverenced , God is being lifted up . Prayer is not foreign in the White House , it 's not foreign in the Executive Office Building ; looking to God , looking through Bible studies , this is not foreign anymore. ” Trump deserves all the credit because “ he is somebody who gets the fact that the God of the Bible is , He is , He exists , He is real … This president is very bold about the need for God in our country . ”
Just to point out the obvious :
President Obama was a Christian . He quoted the Bible in most speeches , had a faith-based advisory council full of Christians , and constantly talked about his faith in interviews .
Trump panders to the Religious Right while doing the bare minimum to let people think he 's a devout Christian . He references the Bible and parades his religious friends if he thinks it 'll benefit him and his agenda .
If Trump is a model Christian , he 's doing atheists a favor .
And the idea that Trump “ has n't taken a day off ” is laughable when you look at how often he goes golfing or stays at his own hotels outside of DC . He 's also taking most of August off . Because golfing can be tiring .

J.J. Abrams has been known to dip back into his well of talent on occasion , and former Fringe star John Noble is hoping the director might give him a shot once he starts putting together Star Wars : Episode VII .
Abrams ' Star Wars revival came up in a chat with IGN , and Noble went on to talk at length about how much he loves the franchise — and even name-dropped that his good pal J.J. should think about giving him a call .
Here 's an excerpt from the interview :
“ I mean I 'd love to do Star Wars . That would just be epic doing something like that . And it 's not beyond the realm of possibility . I have a terrific relationship with J.J. Abrams and Bad Robot , I really do . So it 's not beyond the realm of possibility . It 's awhile away yet ... Well , I mean Star Wars . If you 're going to do one , do Star Wars . I mean seriously , if you 're going to pick one to do , do that one . Because that 's basically a cultural revolution . It reset pop culture in some ways . So if I had to choose one , it would be that one . ”
For five seasons of Fox 's criminally underwatched Fringe , Noble showed an absolutely ridiculous range as a dramatic and comedic actor . If anyone was a good fit for Star Wars , it 's him . He has about as much sci-fi cred as you can fit in a pocket universe ( that 'd be a lot ) , and killer acting skills to boot .
C'mon , J.J. You can find room for this wise Jedi sage/wacky mad scientist somewhere , right ?

The Cavaliers and Clippers reportedly discussed a Jamal Crawford trade . Asked about joining Cleveland , Crawford said he wished he were a free agent .
In case you ca n't connect the dots…
Chris Haynes of Cleveland.com :
I know Jamal personally , and I know he would definitely like to be a part of the Cavaliers ' organization .
Jamal is one guy off the top of my head that I know would be a fit , and I know that they 'll be looking at him . They want to use that exception for a wing player .
Let 's be clear : This does n't mean Crawford does n't also want to play for the Clippers . Many role players want to join LeBron James , Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in Cleveland for the open shots and championship chance , but Chris Paul , Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan offer a similar opportunity .
The Clippers might not want to keep Crawford , though . He 's somewhat superfluous with Lance Stephenson , Austin Rivers and Pablo Prigioni coming off the bench . The Clippers might be happy to flip Crawford for just salary relief . Shedding Crawford would save the Clippers $ 16,180,533 – $ 5,675,000 in salary and $ 10,505,533 in projected luxury-tax payments .
The Cavaliers could absorb Crawford into their Brendan Haywood trade exception . That would create an even higher tax bill than the Clippers face with Crawford – the exact amount depends on salaries for Tristan Thompson and J.R. Smith – but Cavs owner Dan Gilbert has clearly green-lit massive spending .
How much Cleveland could use Crawford on the court depends on whether Smith re-signs .
If Smith does n't , Crawford is a decent alternative as a spot-up shooter . His 3-point shooting sunk to 32.7 % last season , but that was due to off-the dribble 3-pointers – which fell to 25.0 % from 36.4 % the year prior . Meanwhile , Crawford 's 3-point shooting without dribbling prior to launching ticked up from 36.0 % to 38.0 % .
If Smith returns , Crawford is even more of a luxury as another shooter . With the attention LeBron , Irving and Love attract , Cleveland can always use more spot-up threats .
Mo Williams filled the Cavaliers ' major need for an off-the-bench shot creator . The 35-year-old Crawford has declined in that regard , but there 's at least hope he could provide a little insurance .
The Cavaliers do n't need Crawford , at least not considering they could just sign Smith . But if Gilbert is willing to pay for him and the Clippers are willing to dump him for minimal return , the only question is whether Cleveland could better use that portion of the Haywood exception . Crawford would definitely strengthen the Cavs .
Apple 's stratospheric market value soared even higher in October as investors lifted the company 's shares to a new all-time high .
The tech giant added an impressive $ 77 billion in market value during the month , an amount equal to the combined value of eBay , Twitter , Yelp , AMD , and GoDaddy .
Apple ended October with a market value of $ 873 billion , continuing a years-long streak as the most highly-valued publicly-traded company . Google is No . 2 on the list at $ 710 billion followed by Microsoft at $ 642 billion .
Shares in Apple , which reports earnings on Nov. 2 , have been rising amid investor optimism about the new iPhone X , which will start shipping on Nov. 3 . Analysts expect strong demand for the phone , which starts at $ 1,000 , and comes with wireless charging and Face ID , a security feature that relies on facial recognition technology to verify a users ' identity before unlocking the device .
Apple 's shares closed Tuesday up 1.4 % at $ 169.04 , a new record closing high . During October , the company 's stock gained nearly 10 % .
Donald Trump is not exactly the guy to shy away from publicity . So while on a trip to the British Isles , during which he visited his golf resorts in Ireland and Scotland ( as you might remember , Trump recently acquired Turnberry ) , the American billionaire allowed a quick glimpse of his private aircraft 's opulent interior .
The custom-made Boeing 727-100 was purchased by the real estate tycoon back in 2011 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . Passengers are by 24-carat gold , in addition to various other luxurious features .
There 's also a 52-inch flatscreen TV with a control box that gives the viewer access to basically any movie he or she wants to see at the touch of a button . More than a simple private jet , the aircraft is fitted like a high-end hotel room , with a luxurious en suite , a bedroom , and even a guest room with couches that convert into beds .

It 's the lowest figure for an opening episode of GBBO since 2013 - when the show attracted 5.6 million viewers to BBC Two .
But the show still won the channel its biggest overnight audience since the Paralympics Opening Ceremony in 2012 .
`` The Great British Bake Off 's audience last night proves it 's still one of the country 's favourite shows , '' tweeted Channel 4 's chief creative officer Jay Hunt .
`` I am delighted millions watched the new team put 12 magnificent bakers through their paces . ''

The figures do n't include those who watch the show on the network 's catch-up service All 4 .
Last week Hunt said she would consider anything above 3 million viewers a success for the programme .
`` If it gets 5 , 6 , 7 [ million ] I would be absolutely delighted , '' she told the Edinburgh International TV Festival .
`` This show breaks even at around 3 million , so anything north of that would be fantastic . ''

Deutsche Bank did n't just get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller . They 've been sending records of Trump 's financial dealings to the Special Counsel for weeks .
The Financial Times reported :
A person with direct knowledge of the German bank 's actions told the Financial Times the production of Trump-related documents had begun several weeks ago . “ Deutsche could not hand over client information without a subpoena , ” said a second person with direct knowledge of the subpoena . “ It 's helpful to be ordered to do so . ”
Trump has done everything possible to hide his financial records .
During Tuesday 's White House briefing , Press Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Trump has no plans to release his tax returns :

Trump 's days of hiding his financial information are just about over . Between the Mueller investigation and the possibility of a Democratically controlled Congress , the walls are quickly closing in on the President . Whatever Trump and his family have been trying to hide , Mueller is going to get , and what those records could show is the depth , scope , and potentially illegal dealings that characterize the Trump/Russia relationship .
This is Donald Trump 's worst nightmare , and it all unfolding because he fired James Comey .

One year , six months , and three weeks after he was first jailed in a military brig in Kuwait , alleged WikiLeaks leaker Bradley Manning will have his day in court : According to a blog post Monday from his lawyer David Coombs , the Army private first class will have a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade , Maryland on December 16th , a day before his 24th birthday , to examine the government 's charges and evidence and determine whether to proceed with the case against him .
According to Coombs :
The primary purpose of the Article 32 hearing is to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of the government 's case as well as to provide the defense with an opportunity to obtain pretrial discovery . The defense is entitled to call witnesses during the hearing and to also cross-examine the government 's witnesses . Each witness who testifies is placed under oath ; their testimony can therefore be used during the trial for impeachment purposes or as prior testimony should the witness become unavailable .
Since he was befriended and exposed by the hacker Adrian Lamo , Manning has been accused of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks that include a video that showed an Apache helicopter firing on civilians in Baghdad , 91,000 secret files from the war in Afghanistan , about 391,000 classified files from the war in Iraq , and another 251,000 State Department Cables , by far the largest public breach of classified data in history . He 's been charged with crimes including computer fraud , theft of records , and `` aiding the enemy , '' which carries a potential death sentence , although prosecutors have said they 'll only seek life in prison .
The Bradley Manning Support Network plans to hold a rally in his support at the Fort Meade location , and posted a quote from Daniel Ellsberg , leaker of the Pentagon Papers and one of Manning 's most vocal supporters since he was arrested : “ The charges against Bradley Manning are an indictment of our government 's obsession with secrecy , ” he says . “ Manning is accused of revealing illegal activities by our government and its corporate partners that must be brought to the attention of the American people . The Obama administration lacks the courage to confront the crimes and injustices that now stand exposed . ”

This is Joe Arpaio
Why was Arpaio in court in the first place , you ask ?
To say he 's got a shady history with civil rights would be an understatement
Arpaio is the former sheriff of Maricopa County , Arizona .
He was found guilty of contempt of court earlier this summer .
GUILTY

When his department began tackling illegal immigration in the early 2000s , Arpaio did the most rational thing he could think of ...
Erm illegals are not people arg
And drained the entire sheriff 's budget in a crusade to those find those darn ‘ aliens . '
Meanwhile , the Arizonans he was supposed to be serving faced the brunt of his budget cuts .
Police units tasked with protecting local towns had resources slashed in favor of immigration task forces . Deputies made fewer arrests , emergency response times took longer , and more cases were not investigated and ultimately ignored .
In El Mirage , a small town in Arpaio 's jurisdiction , 30 violent crimes went uninvestigated , including more than a dozen sexual assaults .
Arpaio was so bad at his job that the Bush administration began an investigation into
potential civil rights violations
1/5 of traffic incident reports have evidence of 4th Amendment violations .

432 sexual assault and child molestation cases , majority involving Latinos , were not investigated .
The 3-year civil rights investigation into Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's practices continued under Obama . Here 's what the Justice Dept . found in 2011 :
Latino inmates at county jails were routinely abused through excessive force and denial of health services .

And weasels his way out of it
Soooo… .
abuses that power
Racist old white guy
Sound familar ?
gets caught
But I think ...
Sound pretty un-American
And neglecting those he 's charged with protecting
Trump justified his presidential pardon by arguing that Arpaio served his country .
Violating Americans ' civil rights
So why did Trump pardon Arpaio ?
Obama 's a socialist Kenyan Muslim ! !
Or maybe it 's a special kind of love between two old racist white dudes
But you really do n't need to look any further than Charlottesville to know why Trump pardoned Arpaio
Maybe it 's because they 're both birthers .
I mean , statistically , these guys hate most of the people they 've ever encountered . That has to be exhausting . And probably disheartening . What a supremely strange thing to willingly do to one 's self .
I think these KKK white power whatever people are kinda missing the point here . As demographics change and countries age , white supremacists ' pool of future club members is shrinking . What they 're calling for grows more impossible year after year . They must know this , right ?
Quick sidenote
It 's no secret what Trump believes
Obviously
And it 's no secret these hate groups support a Trump presidency
And it 's no secret these hate groups support a Trump presidency
Because nothing says leadership like using a humanitarian disaster to distract from your outright abuse of power .
It 's no surprise that Trump chose this weekend to announce the pardon . That 's how you know even he is aware of how bad this looks .
He announced it Friday evening . The night before Hurricane Harvey .
A person who supports the KKK and groupslike them is the thinnest definition of a person .
Yes , they are humans . But what they believe in is the furthest thing from humane .
And Trump supports them
* * Like he 's a pilgrim kidnapped from the 1600s scary * *
And though Pence 's beliefs are legitimately scary
Pence is at least intellectually and emotionally competent enough to be president .
Obviously !

Trump has pardoned Sheriff Joe Arapio
So , what does this mean exactly ?
… Here 's a little context first
GAINESVILLE , Fla. -- Florida coach Urban Meyer , who was admitted to a hospital because of chest pains following the Southeastern Conference championship game , is stepping down because of health concerns .
`` There was no heart damage , '' Meyer told The New York Times , referring to the night he was admitted to the hospital . `` But I did n't want there to be a bad day where there were three kids sitting around wondering what to do next . It was the pattern of what I was doing and how I was doing it . It was self-destructive . ''
Meyer resigned Saturday after five seasons in Gainesville and two national titles . He goes into the Sugar Bowl with a 56-10 record at Florida that includes a 32-8 mark in league play and a school-record 22-game winning streak ended early this month against Alabama .
Meyer , 45 , says he consulted with his family , his doctors , school president Bernie Machen and athletic director Jeremy Foley before deciding it is in his best interest to focus on his health and family . Meyer told his wife and three children on Christmas he planned to quit as Florida coach , The Times reported .
He told The Times his daughter Nicki , 18 , hugged him and said , `` I get my daddy back . ''
`` I saw it as a sign from God that this was the right thing to do , '' Meyer told The Times of his daughter 's reaction . `` I was worried about letting people down . I was feeling so awful and concerned about my health . That was among several other signs that said it 's time to back away . ''
Meyer 's health problems are not life threatening , a Florida source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN 's Chris Mortensen . The same source said Meyer will remain in Gainesville in a non-coaching role to be defined later .
A Florida spokesman said reports of Meyer being diagnosed with muscle-heart-valve defect and having a heart attack during the season are inaccurate . The team does not have an official medical diagnosis for Meyer .
Meyer will hold a news conference in New Orleans on Sunday afternoon and will coach his final game in the Allstate Sugar Bowl against Cincinnati on New Year 's Day .
`` I have given my heart and soul to coaching college football and mentoring young men for the last 24-plus years and I have dedicated most of my waking moments the last five years to the Gator football program , '' Meyer said in a statement . `` I have ignored my health for years , but recent developments have forced me to reevaluate my priorities of faith and family . ''
`` Coach Meyer and I have talked this through and I realize how hard this was for him to reach this decision , '' Foley said in a statement . `` But , the bottom line is that Coach Meyer needed to make a choice that is in the best interest of his well being and his family . I certainly appreciate what he has meant to the University of Florida , our football program and the Gator Nation . I have never seen anyone more committed to his players , his family and his program . Above all , I appreciate our friendship . ''
Fewer than half of the state 's cities and towns have finalized plans to provide early voting options — newly required by state law — when Massachusetts residents go to the polls in November , according to a new survey from a coalition of public interest groups and voting advocates .
For the first time , communities are required to open voting locations during the 10 business days leading up to the week of the election in November , starting this year .
In interviews , some town clerks have predicted the early voting process would go smoothly , but others said they are waiting for Secretary of State William Galvin 's office to release finalized guidelines on early voting , holding up their own planning processes .

“ I am still waiting for definitive policies , ” said Pamela Carakatsane , a town clerk in Ipswich . “ I would not even begin to plan anything out . ”

Thirty-six other states have some kind of early voting this fall , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . The law is designed to make sure that people who can not get to the polls on Election Day are not denied the right to vote .
For some towns , Galvin acknowledged , there has been a “ learning curve ” and a “ fair degree of lack of awareness ” about early voting , though he says his office is working to clarify the procedures . Preliminary recommendations were vetted last month at a public hearing , and Galvin said he will soon release a finalized set of guidelines .
But a new survey released Thursday by the Election Modernization Coalition — a group that includes Common Cause Massaschusetts , the League of Women Voters of Masschusetts , and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts , among others — showed a large number of the state 's communities are still early in the planning process , if they have started at all .
The coalitioncontacted each of the state 's 351 cities and towns by phone . Of the 313 communities they were able to reach , 138 had nearly finalized plans in place , while 126 had tentative plans — a category that yielded responses ranging from “ not yet sure ” to “ considering ” certain options .

Forty-nine municipalities from across the state had not started planning , the report said .
“ We are here today to ask them to step up , ” saidGavi Wolfe , legislative counsel at the state ACLU , at a Thursday press conference to present the coalition 's report .
Municipalities must submit final plans for early voting to the secretary of state by Oct. 10 , although votingadvocates say election officials should be prepared far before then . Galvin said he has pushed the Legislature to enforce an earlier deadline .
The law , originally signed by Governor Deval Patrick in 2014 , applies to the November elections held every two years . This year 's early voting period begins Oct. 24 and ends Friday Nov. 4 .
The coalition conducted its survey between June 9 and July 20 , and members emphasized the data is preliminary .

But Pam Wilmot , executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts , expressed frustration that Galvin did not release initial guidelines for communities to set up early voting until May .
“ We had pushed starting last summer for the guidelines to come out in the fall of last year , because so many communities really were waiting and looking for guidance , ” Wilmot said .
She added , “ I think a lot of communities felt they really were operating blind . ”
Galvin said he is not concerned that many municipalities have yet to finalize their plans . He said his office has conducted a survey of the state 's cities and towns and is currently reviewing responses .
In some instances , Galvin said , he asked communities to revise their plans to improve them . Some 75 cities and towns have also asked his office to visit potential polling sites to determine if they are large enough , Galvin said .
In addition , Galvin said , it would have been “ a matter of conjecture ” to release a set of guidelines earlier than he did , in part because many cities and towns were still waiting to approve their budgets .
“ I think the timeline is realistic , ” Galvin said .
State law requires early voting for the general election but not the state 's Sept. 8 primary , which could cause some confusion among voters , election officials said .
“ I have decided I am not mentioning anything in the papers or anything on early voting until after the state primary , ” said Ellen Schena , town clerk of Saugus . “ All you are going to do is confuse people more . ”
Though the state will finance early voting ballots , cities and towns must foot the bill for other potential costs , such as overtime pay for staff members working extra hours . Galvin said that based on his office 's survey , he has reached out to a number of municipalities and offered to help pay for additional voting sites if necessary .
Boston plans to have nine early voting sites running simultaneously on Saturday , Oct. 29 , in addition to “ one day ” sites open during the week . City Hall will be the main early voting location , and the city will spend more than $ 600,000 to facilitate the process , according to Sabino Piemonte of the Boston Election Department .
The Election Modernization Coalition said it has encouraged municipalities with more than 35,000 residents to use more than one polling site . But Wolfe , of the ACLU , said only eight cities that size or larger had indicated they planned to open multiple sites .
Carol Ann Desiderio , assistant registrar of voters for Malden , which has a population of around 60,000 , said her office originally intended to use City Hall as its early voting site but then realized the space might be too tight . Now they are deliberating on where to hold early voting . But Malden probably will have only one location .
“ It 's just the early stages of planning , ” she said .
Early voting became the center of a funding battle at the State House last month , when Governor Charlie Baker vetoed $ 1.2 million that would help the program . House and Senate lawmakers later voted to restore that funding .

No paperwork has been submitted for `` top secret '' security credentials for any of President-elect Donald Trump 's grown children or his son-in-law Jared Kushner , senior intelligence officials with direct knowledge of the situation told NBC News .
As members of the transition team , the kids can apply for `` secret '' clearance , which would allow them to review documents — routine budget and organizational — at a much lower level of classification .
But there has been no official request to vet them for top secret clearances , something they would need if they were to end up playing a formal role in the White House . That does n't mean , however , that they could n't pursue one later .

Trump has said his children will run the Trump Organization , the family business , but there has been mounting speculation that he may want Kushner by his side in the White House . Kushner played a key role in the campaign .
The process of applying for the highest clearance is arduous . It requires submission of detailed financial records , a questionnaire about past behavior and foreign contacts , and for some agencies , a polygraph examination .
`` I am not trying to get 'top level security clearance ' for my children , '' Trump tweeted Wednesday morning .
The top secret `` sensitive compartmented information '' clearance is an official designation that allows individual access to America 's most sensitive secrets on a `` need to know '' basis , including covert operations , the names of CIA sources , NSA intercepts , and nuclear plans .
So far , about 200 people associated with the Trump transition already hold top secret clearances or have in the past five years , the official said .
Fewer than four dozen names have been submitted for brand-new top secret clearances . Intelligence officials say it will take an average of four to six weeks for each to be cleared , though some may get interim clearances more quickly .
Neither the President nor Vice President — nor their wives — needs clearances . It comes with the job .
A senior intelligence official told NBC News that there has never been a requirement for the First Lady or children in residence at the White House to have any sort of security clearance . If the president chooses to share something with the First Lady or family members , it is at his discretion , since in theory , he also has the authority to make the determination that the `` disclosure '' does not damage national security , the official said .
A recent survey by Association for Computer Machinery ( ACM ) India , a global professional network in computer areas , has revealed that about 2,507 institutions across India has only produced 194 PhDs in Computer Science ( CS ) . up with Prof Pankaj Jalote , Director , IIT-Delhi , who supervised the survey , on the state of affairs of PhD education in CS , had a lot to say .
Your survey says that low enrolment for PhD in CS is attributed to the poor quality of education .
Most of the institutes lack good quality teachers , which in turn , is leading to substandard education , and naturally , students are looking for options to pursue doctoral studies in CS abroad .
CS as a field throws up a lot of opportunities for someone who has completed a Bachelor 's or a Master 's or both . Could that be one of the reasons for students not going up to the doctoral level ?
The field does throw up a lot of job opportunities depending on the level of education that you have had . But again there is lack of awareness among students as to the heights they can reach with a PhD . Pay scales and nature of opportunities are far more exciting , if one goes up to the doctoral level .
What about employment prospects for a PhD scholar in CS ? Do software giants show interest in hiring PhDs ?
All major IT software giants like Infosys and Cognizant Technology Solutions , have shown interest in hiring PhDs . The only problem is that there are n't enough PhDs . For example , 25 per cent of Google 's workforce is made up of PhDs while it is a pathetic 1-2 per cent for Indian companies .
Could the lack of academic-industry tie-ups be a reason for students not to show interest in PhD studies ?
It is not a significant factor , according to me . But again , if industry offers scholarships and internships , we could see an improvement in training . Students would get a chance to work in real-time applications significant to the field of computer science .
How can institutes attract more students towards PhD ?
First of all , students have the mindset of settling down in a job after their Bachelor 's or Master 's in the field , which is proving to be a big problem . If you have to convince students to spend four-years doing a PhD , then you have to increase their stipend , make the nature of their work more exciting , find a way to send them abroad for conferences , engage them in global collaborations and such .
Why does the country require more PhDs in CS ?
For the simple reason that a PhD can open up a sea of opportunities and students can be at the forefront of cutting-edge research . In fact , a thesis by Ramprasad Saptharishi on Unified approaches to polynomial identity testing and lower bounds won ACM 's best Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2013 . Even if we get more PhDs into teaching , that is like a battle half won .

Using Wikitude 's Object Tracking in an Ionic application
Augmented Reality ( aka AR ) is all about adding virtual objects to our world . The ultimate goal is to add those virtual objects on every real life object . Wikitude makes this process quite simple and we are going to implement it in an Ionic application .
If you are a beginner , you should have a look at the previous tutorials ( here and there ) .
Wikitude Object Tracking Setup
Before diving into the Ionic application , a setup phase is required .
The hardest task is recording the real life object .
The target manager is where the video will be uploaded to create a WTO file . Depending on the end result , the object will be more or less easy to track .
Wikitude 's object recognition technology is quite new , some objects are easier to track than others .
Here are the official restrictions :
The object should not cast any clearly visible shadows
Reflective surfaces should be avoided
There should not be any disturbances of other objects in the scene
The object should not change its original form . For example , scanning a shoe could be a problem since the form of the shoe could change . If the strings for example are tied or not could result in a different object .
Typical objects that work well are small-scale objects ranging up to 1,5 meters
They made a video showing a good example :
https : //vimeo.com/225822978
An in-depth tutorial is available there .
Here is the video that scored me 3 stars on the target manager :
I did n't need a perfect environment , nor scanning the whole object , the front part was good enough for this tutorial .
Once the video is ready , a new project is created in Wikitude 's target manager :
In the previous tutorial , the project 's type was 'image ' because we were working on the image recognition feature . This time we select 'object ' .
Once the video is uploaded , we can download the WTO file :
When it comes to virtual objects , we can create our own 3D models by using software like 3DSMax , SketchUp or Blender .
If we want to skip this step , there are other websites like Turbosquid where 3D objects are available for free or at a small price . We will need to focus on FBX files , they are the easiest to convert to the WT3 format ( Wikitude 's 3D model format ) .
Next step , downloading Wikitude3DEncoder from the download page for transforming the FBX to a WT3 file .
Once we have our files ready , we can start coding !
The Ionic Application
Let 's start with changing the requirement in the home.ts file :
requiredFeatures = [ `` object_tracking '' ] ;
We can have the most elegant and performant code in the world , if the phone does n't support the feature , it 's not going to work .
Here is the assets folder 's architecture :
The object-tracking.ts file starts as follow :
declare var AR ; class World { init ( ) { const targetCollectionResource = new AR . TargetCollectionResource ( `` assets/wto/pinguin-tracker.wto '' , { } ) ; const objectTracker = new AR . ObjectTracker ( targetCollectionResource , { } ) ; . . . } } ; let world = new World ( ) ; world . init ( ) ;
A new World instance is created then initiated . The init method will create a new TargetCollectionResource instance , this object uses the file we acquired from Wikitude 's target manager . An ObjectTracker will track every object that belong to this collection .
Creating the 3D model now :
var scale = 0.001 ; const drawableModel = new AR . Model ( `` assets/wt3/mug.wt3 '' , { scale : { x : scale , y : scale , z : scale } , translate : { x : 0.15 , z : 1 } , rotate : { x : - 90 } } ) ;
A new Model is created , its scale is quite small because the model itself is quite big so we reduce its size . It 's translated on the x and z axis otherwise it will just overlap with the target , finally it 's rotated .
We can now mix together the objectTracker and the drawableModel :
const objectTrackable = new AR . ObjectTrackable ( objectTracker , `` * '' , { drawables : { cam : drawableModel } } ) ;
Here is the final result :
Conclusion
Wikitude 's Object Recognition technology is quite new ( July 13th 2017 ) and will evolve with time . At the moment the object recognition mechanism is restricted , those restrictions will certainly disappear over time . Once we have the WTO file ready , we can work on the virtual world by first importing our FBX models in the Wikitude3DEncoder app to acquire a WT3 file . Those models can finally be placed in the Ionic application .
ERBIL , Iraq/ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Iraq 's Kurds will go ahead with a referendum on independence on Monday because their partnership with Baghdad has failed , Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani said on Sunday , shrugging off international opposition to the vote .

In response , the Iraqi government asked the autonomous Kurdish region to hand over control of its international border posts , its international airports and called on foreign countries to stop importing Kurdish crude oil .
It asked “ the neighboring countries and the countries of the world to deal exclusively with the federal government of Iraq in regards to entry posts and oil , ” according to a statement from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi 's office .
The United States and other Western powers have urged Kurdish authorities in the oil producing region to cancel the vote , arguing that it distracts from the fight against Islamic State .
Turkey and Iran have also kept up the pressure to stop the vote , with presidents Tayyip Erdoğan and Hassan Rouhani speaking by phone and expressing concern that it will “ bring chaos in the region ” , according to Erdoğan 's office .
Barzani , at a news conference at his headquarters near Erbil , dismissed the worries of Iraq 's neighbors , committing to respect laws on international boundaries and not seek to redraw the region 's borders .
“ We will never go back to the failed partnership ” with Baghdad , he said , adding Iraq had become a “ theocratic , sectarian state ” and not the democratic one that was supposed to be built after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
The vote , expected to result in a comfortable “ yes ” to independence , is not binding and is meant to give the Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) a mandate to negotiate secession with Baghdad and the neighboring countries .
Barzani said Iraq 's Kurds would seek talks with the Shi'ite-led central government to implement the expected “ yes ” outcome , even if they take two years or more , to settle land and oil sharing disputes ahead of independence .
Abadi 's government in Iraq regards the referendum as anti-constitutional and in a televised address on Sunday he said it “ could lead to ethnic divisions , exposing ( the Iraqis ) to disastrous dangers that only God knows . ”
IRANIAN , TURKISH STEPS
Earlier , Iranian authorities stopped air traffic to Iraqi Kurdistan 's international airports at Erbil and Sulaimaniya in response to a request from Baghdad , Fars News Agency said . Iran also started war games at the Kurdish border .
Speaking by telephone with Abadi , Iran 's Rouhani voiced support for Iraq 's national unity and territorial integrity , the state news agency IRNA reported .
“ Iran fully supports Iraq 's central government , ” Rouhani was quoted as telling Abadi .
On Saturday , Turkey 's parliament voted to extend by a year a mandate authorizing the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq and Syria .
Turkey has also vowed political , economic and security steps without specifying what they are , but Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim reinforced the message on Sunday .
Turkey is the transit route of all crude exported by the landlocked Kurdistan region of Iraq .
“ Turkey will never ever tolerate any status change or any new formations on its southern borders , ” he said in a speech in the capital Ankara . “ The KRG will be primarily responsible for the probable developments after this referendum . ”
But Barzani said Ankara “ wo n't benefit ” economically should it close the border with Iraqi Kurdistan .
Tehran and Ankara fear the spread of separatism to their own Kurds . Iran also supports Shi'ite groups who have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in Iraq since the U.S-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein .
Barzani said Kurds will “ keep extending their hand ” to Iran and Turkey , even if they do not reciprocate . He said he recently met in the Kurdish region Iranian Revolutionary Guard Commander Qassem Soleimani , who came to convince him to delay the vote .
The KRG has resisted calls to delay the referendum by the United Nations , the United States and Britain who fear it could lead to unrest in disputed areas like multi-ethnic oil-rich Kirkuk , as well as distracting from the war on Islamic State .
But the Iraqi Kurds say the vote acknowledges their crucial contribution in confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq .
Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who control Kirkuk were given instructions not to respond to any provocation meant to disrupt the vote , but they will defend the region if attacked from outside , he said .

The U.S. embassy in Iraq warned its citizens that there might be unrest during the referendum , especially in disputed areas like Kirkuk , also claimed by the Iraqi central government .
The Iranian military drills , part of annual events held in Iran to mark the beginning of the 1980-1988 war with Iraq , were launched in the Oshnavieh border region , according to Iranian State broadcaster IRIB .
Turkey 's military said on Sunday its aircraft launched strikes against Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) targets in northern Iraq 's Gara region on Saturday after spotting militants preparing to attack Turkish military outposts on the border .

They repeated as Presidents ' Trophy winners the following season but still tumbled to 92 in 2012 -- and only continued to slip every year since .
What 's good
Next to nothing . The product on the ice is terrible ; the Canucks have n't won a playoff series since that gut-wrenching finals loss , and they missed the postseason entirely in two of the last three years . They 're in the triple digits in every category but ownership ... which ranks No . 90 . Not good . Loui Eriksson was a nice summer pickup , and the classy Sedin twins remain the faces of the franchise . But they also just turned 36 and are nearing the end of their Cup-less careers .
What 's bad
Just about everything . The Canucks play in the soulless 21-year-old Rogers Arena , which provides one of the worst stadium experiences in professional sports ( 115th overall ) . And Vancouver fans , who have never seen their team win a title in 45 NHL seasons , pay more than all but one of the 122 other teams in the four major leagues for the privilege . That 's an awful combination . Have we mentioned the team yet ? They 're second-worst in hockey in title track and coaching and fourth worst in players . Considering all that , it 's not hard to understand how only two NHL franchises ( the Bruins and Maple Leafs ) provide less bang for the buck .
What 's new
Fan relations dropped 12 spots from a year ago - not surprising given that the Canucks offer the least frequent promotions , contests and giveaways in the NHL . And third-year bench boss Willie Desjardins clearly is n't inspiring much confidence around British Columbia after winning just 31 out of 82 games in 2015-16 , with coaching slipping 22 places . At 114th , Desjardins is only six spots better than John Tortorella -- who lasted just one disastrous season in Vancouver -- was after being run out of town in 2014 .

Three indie movies vying for Oscar laurels — “ Lady Bird , ” “ Call Me by Your Name , ” and “ I , Tonya ” — popped up on piracy file-sharing networks Tuesday .
The movies were evidently ripped from awards-screener DVDs by Hive-CM8 , a well-known piracy collective that purports to have altruistic motives .
“ We are especially sharing this for the people who cant [ sic ] visit the cinema due to illness , or because it is a limited release that does n't make it to their country , ” the group wrote in the release notes . Variety has not confirmed the authenticity of the pirated copies , which were first reported by piracy-news site TorrentFreak .
The pirates added , “ Do n't forget watching a Screener is not like the real thing , you should still all go to the cinema and support the Producers . ”
“ Lady Bird , ” “ Call Me by Your Name ” and “ I , Tonya ” are contenders in various 2018 Academy Awards categories after garnering critical huzzahs . Variety chief film critic Owen Gleiberman included all three on his list of the top 10 films of 2017 .
The piracy of the trio of movies comes two weeks after Hive-CM8 leaked Louis C.K . 's black comedy “ I Love You , Daddy , ” in the wake of that film 's distributors scrapping its theatrical release after the comedian admitted to sexual misconduct . In addition , the group claimed responsibility for the Dec. 24 piracy release of Richard Linklater 's “ Last Flag Flying , ” which stars Bryan Cranston , Laurence Fishburne and Steve Carell .

Greta Gerwig 's coming-of-age tale “ Lady Bird ” has grossed an impressive $ 28.7 million domestically , according to Box Office Mojo . “ Call Me by Your Name , ” a dramatic romance starring Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet , has grossed about $ 3.3 million ; “ I , Tonya , ” a fictionalized retelling of the saga of Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding featuring Margot Robbie in the titular role , has pulled in $ 1.3 million in 18 days of release .
More awards-season movies may leak online in the next few weeks . According to TorrentFreak , Hive-CM8 has guaranteed only that it will not be releasing blockbuster “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi ” to piracy networks .

Refocused : Miami Dolphins 16 , Tennessee Titans 10
By PFF Analysis Team • Oct 8 , 2017
Without QB Marcus Mariota in action , the Tennessee Titans offense stalled in the early going , as did the Jay Cutler-led Miami Dolphins offense . The only first half touchdown on the day came by the way of a Reshad Jones scoop and score for the Dolphins defense which lead to a 10-3 halftime lead .
Culter went on to put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter , connecting with wide receiver Jarvis Landry for a six-yard touchdown . The Dolphins ' gunslinger finished the contest with 92 passing yards , one touchdown and one interception .
Standing in Mariota 's place under center , Titans veteran quarterback Matt Cassel completed 21 of 32 passes for 141 yards and one touchdown . Of course , his efforts were n't enough to make up for Tennessee 's lackluster rushing attack .
Headlined by veteran running back DeMarco Murray , the Titans ' backfield combined for just 72 yards on 21 carries ( 3.42 yards per carry ) .
With that , we give you our PFF exclusive takeaways from the contest for each team .
Top 5 Grades :
LB Kiko Alonso , 91.9 overall grade
S Reshad Jones , 90.3 overall grade
LB Lawrence Timmons , 85.7 overall grade
G Anthony Steen , 83.9 overall grade
DI Ndamukong Suh , 83.8 overall grade
Performances of Note :
QB Jay Cutler , 73.8 overall grade
Jay Cutler was not needed to do much against the Titans to get the win . While Cutler failed to throw for 100 yards and had one interception , he was more than willing to throw the ball away and not force anything other than the one interception , letting his defense and run game win the game . When Cutler was pressured , he only completed one on seven attempts for 14 yards .
With the struggles the Dolphins offense had against the Titans , it would seem easy to blame the offensive line . However , this would be unfair , as the offensive line managed to get movement in the run game . In the passing game , the unit only allowed five pressures on 28 dropbacks .
LB Kiko Alonso , 91.9 overall grade
Kiko Alonso stood out in a game that will not exactly be replayed often . Alonso was a force to be reckoned with , as he allowed only 18 yards in coverage on four targets and recorded 6 defensive stops including a sack .
Reshad Jones ' smart play of running the fumble for the touchdown in the first quarter ended up being the difference maker . He was also a force in the run game , recording three run stops on 20 running plays .
Top 5 Grades :
S Kevin Byard , 84.7 overall grade
LB Wesley Woodyard , 83.2 overall grade
DI DaQuan Jones , 82.7 overall grade
TE Delanie Walker , 81.7 overall grade
CB Adoree ' Jackson , 80.2 overall grade
Performances of Note :
QB Matt Cassel , 77.0 overall grade
Matt Cassel showed why he is still employed as a backup QB . While he was unable to lead the Titans downfield or create big plays , he very rarely forced any throw and gave the Titans a chance to win . Cassel was five of nine on passes over 10 yards and 16 of 18 on passes under 10 yards .
With Marcus Mariota unable to play , the Titans needed to rely on smashmouth football . However , they were unable to get much going on the ground , as both running backs combined for just two missed tackles on 18 attempts and 1 fumble and another ( if the Dolphins had challenged ) that would have counted .
Kevin Byard has established himself as the best safety on the roster for the Titans . Against the Dolphins , Byard recorded two run stops and another in the passing game .
The ups and downs of Adoree ' Jackson rookie campaign hit another successful game against the Dolphins , as he only allowed two catches on five targets for 15 yards . When he was targeted , he allowed a 47.9 passer rating against .

The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Kirstjen M. Nielsen as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , installing a close confidant of White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly to lead the federal agency responsible for carrying out many of President Trump 's most ambitious domestic policy plans .
Nielsen , 45 , developed a reputation for fierce devotion to Kelly as his deputy at the White House and before that as his chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security , which he ran from January until July .
An attorney and cybersecurity expert , Nielsen will be the first DHS secretary with previous experience working at the agency . Her confirmation Tuesday gives the White House a DHS chief well versed in the politics and policy goals of Trump 's immigration enforcement agenda .
`` By confirming Ms. Nielsen 's nomination to lead the DHS , this Senate will take a serious step to strengthen our nation 's security , '' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) said in a statement .
`` Ms. Nielsen will be charged with leading the department at a critical time , '' he said . `` With her understanding of the challenges facing our nation and her experience in prevention and preparedness , I believe that she will excel as the next Secretary of Homeland Security . ''
Nielsen was confirmed 62 to 37 , the narrowest margin ever to approve a DHS secretary . Though no GOP senator voted against her , the outcome reflected intense opposition to Trump as well as doubts about Nielsen 's executive leadership experience and willingness to challenge the White House in the event of a disagreement .
Last month , a watchdog group filed an ethics complaint against Nielsen after she used a private consultant who represents clients with millions of dollars in DHS contracts to help her navigate the confirmation process .
[ Trump 's pick for Homeland Security is caught up in an ethics complaint ]
In January , soon after Trump took office , senators confirmed Kelly 88 to 11 .
Nielsen comes to the job largely on the power of Kelly 's endorsement . She will take over from acting secretary Elaine Duke , who filled the top job in a temporary capacity for more than four months , longer than any DHS chief in the agency 's 15-year history .
Duke was confirmed as deputy DHS secretary in April , but she does not have a close relationship to Nielsen . Several administration officials say Duke has informed the White House she plans to resign once Nielsen takes over . In a statement following Tuesday 's confirmation vote , Duke congratulated her and said `` I look forward to working alongside Ms. Nielsen as her deputy . ''

One of the Democrats who voted against Nielsen , Sen. Maggie Hassan ( N.H. ) , said she had concerns about the new secretary 's independence . `` Throughout her confirmation process , Ms. Nielsen failed to demonstrate that she would provide the steady experienced leadership — free from political interference from the White House — that the department needs . ''
Another Democrat who voted no , Sen. Kamala D. Harris ( Calif. ) , cited similar doubts about Nielsen 's independence . She also criticized her reluctance during confirmation hearings to accept human behavior as a cause of global climate change and said Nielsen has `` equivocated on protecting 'dreamers , ' `` those brought to the country illegally as children and shielded from deportation under Obama .
As the top official leading the DHS , an agency with a $ 40 billion discretionary budget and 240,000 employees , Nielsen will take on a broad array of responsibilities . The DHS has 22 subagencies , including immigration enforcement , transportation security , disaster preparedness and response , the Secret Service , and the Coast Guard .
`` There will be no on-the-job training for Kirstjen , '' Trump said when he announced her nomination in October , praising her `` sterling reputation . ''
Nielsen has never held the top job at a federal agency or a private-sector company .
Early in her career , she worked at the Transportation Security Administration and then as a White House adviser for emergency preparedness and disaster management under President George W. Bush . During her confirmation hearing , she told senators she learned key lessons about emergency management by having a front-row seat to the botched response to Hurricane Katrina .
Nielsen breezed through her confirmation hearing last month before members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs , assuring lawmakers that she would not obey an unlawful order from the White House .
When asked for her views on the utility of a border wall with Mexico , she echoed comments made previously by Kelly that the United States did not need a 2,000-mile physical barrier `` from sea to shining sea . ''
My first post was an exercise in getting all the bits-and-pieces together to create content . In many ways this is my first real post here ... and I want to keep a promise : For years I 've said I would measure the effects of the various headphone pads on Grado headphones ... well , I am very glad to say finally , here it is .
To the best of my knowledge , there have been five basic types of stock Grado ear-pads over the years . From left to right in the photo above :
Small Flat Pad -- - Originally the stock pad for the SR80 ; no longer available .
S-Cushion -- - Commonly called the `` Comfy Pad , '' this cushion comes stock on the Grado SR60i ( $ 79 ) , SR80i ( $ 99 ) , and SR125i ( $ 150 ) .
Flat Pad -- - Now not manufactured by Grado ; Flat Pads available at TTVJ ( $ 35 ) are identical to the originals , and manufactured by the same source .
L-Cushion -- - Commonly called `` Bowls , '' this cushion is standard issue with the SR225i ( $ 200 ) , SR325i ( $ 295 ) , RS2i ( $ 495 ) , and RS1i ( $ 695 ) .
G-Cushion -- - Commonly called `` Bagel Pads '' or `` Salad Bowls , '' this cushion is standard issue with the GS1000i ( $ 995 ) and PS1000 ( $ 1695 ) .
In addition to the above , numerous after market cushion and DIY modifications have been made for Grado headphones and a few have been included in this series of tests :
Reverse Bowls -- - Normally mounted bowl on left ; reversed bowl on right . Simply put the bowl pads reversed with the flat part towards your head .
Comfy Hole -- - Cut a quarter-sized hole in the center of a comfy pad .
Taped Bowls -- - Apply tape to the outer circumference of the bowl pads .
Goo Bowls -- - Apply silicon sealer sparingly to the outer circumference of the bowl pads . ( This is one I 've been meaning to try . )
In this article , all the above pads were tested on a pair of Grado SR225i headphones . Listening tests and objective measurements were performed . Read on for the results ...
Michael Hirsh is a national editor for Politico Magazine .
Last February Mike Flynn , the incoming national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump , tweeted : “ Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL. ” He urged his tweeps to “ please forward ” a Muslim-bashing video by one I.Q . al-Rassooli , a Britain-based , Iraqi-born polemicist who argues that Islam is less a religion than a cult in perpetual war with the West , that the Prophet Muhammad “ committed crimes against humanity on a massive scale ” and the Koran is “ a rambling , incoherent , jumbled scripture of hatred and enmity that no true God would have ever revealed to anyone . ”
Two years ago , in 2014 , Steve Bannon , President-elect Trump 's incoming chief strategist , told an interviewer that “ the Judeo-Christian West ” is “ in the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict … an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism ” —an enemy that , unless harsher measures are taken , “ will completely eradicate everything that we 've been bequeathed over the last 2,000 , 2,500 years . ”
Story Continued Below
And this past May Mike Pompeo , President-elect Trump 's nominee to run the CIA , went to the Center for Security Policy , a hardline think tank that has accused Obama administration officials of being secret agents of the Muslim Brotherhood , for a sit-down with the head of the center , Frank Gaffney . Pompeo told Gaffney in a recorded interview that the fight “ extends beyond those [ Muslims ] who are just engaged in violent extremism. ” He added : “ We do n't have to say that all Muslims are bad . But … we 're going to have a broader approach in order to keep Americans safe . ”
“ Keep up the good work , my friend , ” responded Gaffney , who is best known for insisting that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin worked for the Muslim Brotherhood , and who once argued that Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan tried to inject Sharia law into the country 's financial system . Gaffney , a frequent guest on Bannon 's Breitbart radio show , was reported to be advising the Trump transition team too , though he has denied such reports .
Welcome back , approximately , to the world just after 9/11 , when terror hung in the air , fear was raw and palpable and Islamophobia was so rampant that George W. Bush felt compelled to go to a Washington mosque six days after the attacks and declare : “ The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam . That 's not what Islam is all about . Islam is peace. ” Barack Obama , having inherited a much bigger global war from Bush after the invasion of Iraq , has avoided any talk of Islam at all and insisted on calling the enemy merely “ violent extremism. ” Obama repeatedly sought to remind Americans that it was precisely the idea of a “ clash of civilizations ” that Islamists embraced—because it frames the conflict as one against all of Islam and its culture , not just the jihadists .
But the incoming president , Trump , appears open to the clash-of-civilizations idea—one that fits neatly with his view of an America that rejects “ globalism , ” tightens up its borders against immigrants , and bans most new Muslims from coming in until they can be “ vetted. ” `` I think Islam hates us , '' Trump told CNN 's Anderson Cooper last March . While he said he was speaking of radical Islam , he added : “ It 's very hard to define . It 's very hard to separate . Because you do n't know who 's who. ” For the Trump team , who did not respond to a request for comment , Muslims appear to be guilty of radical sympathies until proven innocent .
That approach , some scholars say , will be a terrible mistake , 15 years into what is already seen by some as a “ Forever War . ”
“ Sadly , Trump traffics in a similar ‘ clash of civilizations ' narrative to that of Al Qaeda and ISIS , ” says Fawaz Gerges of the London School of Economics , author of the recently published book ISIS : A History . “ They all view the world in binary terms . … What Trump and his followers do not get is that their inflammatory rhetoric plays into the hands of ISIS and Al Qaeda , who labor hard to convince skeptical Muslims that the West is waging a war against Islam . ”
True , there is plenty of reason to critique the Obama administration : It 's not as if the outgoing president is handing off a stunning success in the war against violent extremism to Trump . On the contrary , while Obama has prevented another mass-casualty attack in the United States on the scale of 9/11 , the global conflict he will bequeath to Trump remains ill-defined , and Obama 's efforts to close Guantánamo and install legal and constitutional justifications for the spreading secret war against Islamists everywhere have yielded near total failure . It is also true the disintegration of the Arab world into civil war and territorial archipelagos run by extremist Islamist groups like ISIS may well suggest there is a kind of breakdown in Islamic-Arab culture , one in which extremism can prevail regularly over moderation and democracy . Al Qaeda , plainly , was not a one-off phenomenon .
Still , some national-security and law-enforcement experts are aghast at any loose language that lumps all Muslims together , saying all that the apocalyptic rhetoric will do is ensure that many more of the world 's 1.6 billion Muslims either support the terrorists or stand aside in resentment while the terrorists , acting in their name , do their worst . “ I 'm sure Flynn 's outspoken anti-Muslim bias will sour our already tarnished image abroad , especially in the Middle East and Asia , and make it difficult to win or retain reliable allies in any future conflicts , ” says former FBI undercover agent Michael German , author of Thinking Like a Terrorist : Insights of a Former FBI Undercover Agent and the co-writer of a new movie starring Daniel Radcliffe about white supremacist groups . “ It certainly makes al Qaeda and ISIS propagandists ' jobs easier , as well . ”
Some experts in Islam who are conservative politically , like former CIA case officer Reuel Marc Gerecht , also say the new Trumpian framing is ill-thought-out—even if Obama may be somewhat to blame by inviting a right-wing backlash to his refusal to talk about the sources of Islamist extremism at all , for fear of stigmatizing or offending Muslims . “ The Obama administration needlessly got itself into trouble by avoiding an adult conversation about the problems in the Muslim world . Muslims are n't children . They do n't need Western affirmative action programs , ” emails Gerecht . “ However , I do have a really big problem when certain individuals attempt to paint Islam , in all its 1400-plus years of glorious complexity , as a deranged civilization and faith , whose denizens and practitioners are somehow uniquely capable of violence because they are hard-wired to do so , via the Koran , the holy law , and whatever else the anti-Islam crowd thinks makes Muslims tick . This is just historically atrocious . It is often obscene . ”
There are also serious questions about how such a black-and-white global struggle would be waged strategically . Flynn , in his new book The Field of Fight : How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies , co-written with Michael Ledeen , argues that America is not confronting the radical Islamists alone , but that they are in alliance with anti-American nation states like Russia , Cuba and North Korea . Despite Trump 's fairly positive statements about Vladimir Putin , such a controversial approach could once again isolate the United States , as occurred during the Iraq war when George W. Bush targeted what he called the “ Axis of Evil. ” ( Although Trump could potentially find some allies among the right-wing parties in Europe , which also tend to cast their nationalist views as a defense of the Christian West against the Islamic threat . )
Some radical Muslims appear a little stunned by the gift they have been handed . Referring to Trump , Abu Omar Khorasani , a senior Islamic State commander in Afghanistan , told Reuters : “ This guy is a complete maniac . His utter hate towards Muslims will make our job much easier because we can recruit thousands. ” On the Shia side , Iraq 's powerful Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said in a statement that Trump “ does not differentiate between extremist and moderate Islamist trends and , at the same time , he overlooks ( the fact ) that his extremism will generate extremism in return . ”
Another concern going forward , perhaps , is that for those who identify themselves with or are seen as part of the white nationalism movement—and Bannon , for one , denies he 's part of that—the specter of a global Islamic threat against “ Western ” civilization is a convenient bugaboo , feeding the alt-right narrative of the whites against everyone else . Much as the “ Red Scare ” of the 1950s helped to consolidate far-right control in Washington , at least for a time , the bigger the Islamist threat appears , the more compelling is Trump 's call to keep the world from our shores , justify closed borders and focus on his neo-isolationist concept of “ America First. ” Indeed , much as Obama desperately wanted to end the “ war on terror , ” it is fair to question whether some of the people around Trump may not want to .
* * *
In some respects—at least as the Trumpites would put it—they are only responding to Obama 's failures to end or even contain Islamist terrorism . Certainly any hope that anti-West terror would be confined to Al Qaeda and the Arab/Muslim world would be headed toward secular democracy—the aspiration of George W. Bush in invading Iraq in 2003 , and the wishful thinking of optimists after the start of the Arab Spring in 2011—have been utterly dashed . Iraq is a dysfunctional disaster a quarter occupied by ISIS , and constantly torn between Sunni and Shia interests ; Egypt 's experiment with a democratic uprising has ended in a more brutal dictatorship than it had before ; Libya and Yemen have come under the control of Islamist militias . Secular Arab democracy seems a lost dream .
All this has lent new credence to the projection made a quarter century ago by the scholar Bernard Lewis—who coined the phrase “ clash of civilizations ” ( though it was later made famous by political scientist Samuel Huntington ) —that the Arab world would not advance until it had its own Reformation analogous to the West 's , vanquishing religion from the realm of politics and confining it to the mosque . Until that happens , Lewis argued in his original 1990 essay—in which he also included the Islamic Republic of Iran— “ This is no less than a clash of civilizations—the perhaps irrational but surely historic reaction of an ancient rival against our Judeo-Christian heritage , our secular present , and the worldwide expansion of both . ”
But even Lewis warned against buying entirely into the Islamist vision by overreacting to it . “ It is crucially important , ” he added . “ That we on our side should not be provoked into an equally historic but also equally irrational reaction against that rival . ”
Gerges , among others , fears that is precisely what lies ahead , and the over-reaction of the Bush administration after 9/11 is about to repeat itself , especially if Trump succeeds in dismantling the nuclear pact with Iran and lumps the Islamic Republic together with the other “ Islamic fascists ” he is preparing to take on . “ Trump has chosen loyalists who substitute ideology and stereotypes for hard facts and deep knowledge of the world and America 's global role , ” Gerges says . “ There is a real danger that the Trump administration could exact a heavy toll on America 's standing in the world and national security interests . We must expect and prepare for the worst in the next four years . ”

It 's a safe guess that somewhere at Merck today someone is going through the meeting minutes of the day that the hair-brained scheme for the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine was launched , and that everyone who was in the room is now going to be fired .
The Scientist has reported that , yes , it 's true , Merck cooked up a phony , but real sounding , peer reviewed journal and published favorably looking data for its products in them . Merck paid Elsevier to publish such a tome , which neither appears in MEDLINE nor has a website , according to The Scientist .
What 's wrong with this is so obvious it does n't have to be argued for . What 's sad is that I 'm sure many a primary care physician was given literature from Merck that said , “ As published in Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine , Fosamax outperforms all other medications…. ” Said doctor , or even the average researcher would n't know that the journal is bogus . In fact , knowing that the journal is published by Elsevier gives it credibility !
These kinds of endeavors are not possible without help . One of The Scientist 's most notable finds is a Australian rheumatologist named Peter Brooks who served on the “ honorary advisory board ” of this “ journal ” . His take : “ I do n't think it 's fair to say it was totally a marketing journal ” , apparently on the grounds that it had excerpts from peer-reviewed papers . However , in his entire time on the board he never received a single paper for peer-review , but because he apparently knew the journal did not receive original submissions of research . This did n't seem to bother him one bit . Such “ throwaways ” of non-peer reviewed publications and semi-marketing materials are commonplace in medicine . But would n't that seem odd for an academic journal ? Apparently not . Moreover , Peter Brooks had a pretty lax sense of academic ethics any way : he admitted to having his name put on a “ advertorial ” for pharma within the last ten years , says The Scientist . An “ advertorial ” ? Again , language unfamiliar to us in the academic publishing world , but apparently quite familiar to the pharmaceutical publishing scene .
It is this attitude within companies like Merck and among doctors that allows scandals precisely like this to happen . While the scandals with Merck and Vioxx are particularly egregious , we know they are not isolated incidents . This one is just particularly so . If physicians would not lend their names or pens to these efforts , and publishers would not offer their presses , these publications could not exist . What doctors would have as available data would be peer-reviewed research and what pharmaceutical companies produce from their marketing departments–actual advertisements .

Of the five mass extinctions in the Earth 's past , one stands above the rest in magnitude : the Permian-Trassic extinction , known as the Great Dying . It saw the disappearance of almost 60 percent of all families , and over 80 percent of all genera—in the ocean , that added up to about 96 percent of all species . The cause of this event , 250 million years in the past , is still a matter of debate .
The most likely culprit is the prolific volcanism of the Siberian Traps—the erupted basalt still covers about 2 million square kilometers—but other events may have also played a role . Evidence for a massive destabilization of methane hydrates on the seafloor ( a phenomenon described as `` The Big Burp '' ) , ocean anoxia , and even contemporary asteroid impacts have all been found .
A couple recent papers in the journal Geology have brought some new information to the discussion , and may help make the picture just a little bit clearer .
One source of significant mystery has been the nature of the organic microfossils that are common in rocks dated to the time of the extinction worldwide . The tiny fossils resemble filamentous colonies of cells , but have evaded positive identification . Some researchers think they are the remains of fungi , while others argue that they are algae instead . There 's evidence on both sides , but the two scenarios represent very different conditions . The fungus indicates a widespread dying of woody vegetation , while algae suggest extensive swamps forming along river systems .
A paper published this month shows that the microfossils are almost identical morphologically to a group of pathogenic soil fungi that can infect trees . If its authors have identified these correctly , it fits in well with an overall picture showing loss of forests and topsoil . The demise of tree species is clear in pollen studies , and there is a lot of evidence for greatly accelerated soil erosion , including increased sediment deposition in deltas with lots of soil-derived organic debris .
Modern studies show that drought stress and UV damage , both of which could be caused by the massive releases of volcanic gases from the Siberian Traps , can make trees susceptible to fungal infection .
Connecting a fungus to a global mass extinction may seem tenuous , but the authors point out that processes down in the world of the very small are often overlooked in any extinction discussions . They summarize by saying , `` There may have been a variety of other globally operating environmental stress factors , but whatever sequence of events triggered ecosystem destabilization on land , the aggressiveness of soil-borne pathogenic fungi must have been an integral factor involved in Late Permian forest decline worldwide . ”
Separately , another recent paper has pinned down the timing of the extinction . It 's not considered to have been as sudden as the End Cretaceous extinction that killed off the dinosaurs , but the precise timeline has been tough to get a handle on , and estimates have varied .
The research group looked at some marine Permian-Triassic rocks in China that recorded cyclical global climate patterns . Climate controlled the amount of terrestrial sediment that was deposited in this area , which shows up as changes in grain size through the rock layers . Using a device that measures magnetic susceptibility , they were able to precisely quantify changes in grain size across the rock layers . Together with some uranium-lead isotopic ages , they were able to pick out the orbital cycles that control climate , including the prominent 400,000 year eccentricity cycle , and use them to precisely date the extinction interval .
A couple of interesting things show up in the data . For one , minima in several of the orbital cycles coincide shortly before the start of the extinction period . ( Think of three sine waves with different wavelengths—at certain points in time , all three troughs will line up by chance . ) That could have made for some unusual climatic conditions . Additionally , the effect of the 100,000 year orbital cycle on climate seems diminished for as long as 2 million years afterward .
It 's dangerous to extrapolate to the big picture from records like this , but there 's enough there to warrant further investigation of the orbital forcings .
In the end , they found that the extinction took 600,000-700,000 years to play out . This is consistent with the idea that several events acted in concert to destabilize ecosystems and cause the loss of so many species , meaning a significant length of time would be needed . It was simply a nasty time to be a living thing on planet Earth . Some advice for any time travelers out there—steer well clear of the Great Dying .

Photographer : Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images
Apple Pay was launched last year , with lots of fanfare and support by the credit card industry . Partnering with the banks that issue credit cards overcame the resistance that early entrants in mobile payments had faced . It also solved critical technology and infrastructure problems and offered the credit-card industry a new avenue for growth . Apple Pay is n't a household name yet , but it is growing steadily and is likely to become one . Most recently , Apple announced a deal with China 's UnionPay , the state-run sole issuer of bankcards , to allow it to operate nationwide in the People 's Republic .
Apple Pay is , however , a Trojan horse . Once Apple has established its platform , it wo n't need the banks and credit cards any more . It will be able to take advantage of another new technology , the blockchain , to offer an alternative payment option . Blockchain is the core technology behind Bitcoin , and functions as a transparent ledger of transactions , concurrently hosted on numerous computers around the world -- allowing the creation of digital currencies and virtual banks .
Think about it : today you have a choice between American Express , MasterCard , and Visa , and they charge merchants roughly 2 percent of every transaction . If you were given another payment option , let 's call it AppleCoin , which provided you with a rebate of this fee , and the transaction was easier and more secure than with a credit card , which would you pick ? I doubt many people would show loyalty to the credit card industry . After all , it extracts more than $ 100 billion in fees -- a tax that we end up paying for -- and gouges us the moment we miss a payment . Apple would dominate this industry .
To be clear , Apple 's payment application has not taken off yet and works only on the latest model of its smartphones . According to data from payments-industry tracker Pymnts.com , as of October 2015 , only 15 percent of all iPhone 6/6s users had tried Apple Pay . That is an increase from 9 percent in November 2014 , but is hardly enough to set the world on fire . More significantly , only 5.1 percent of all Apple Pay eligible transactions ( meaning , in which the store has an Apple Pay terminal and the shopper has an iPhone 6/6s ) are running through the service . Because iPhone 6/6s models remain a small proportion of all iPhones in use , Apple Pay is capturing only a tiny volume of transactions .
But Apple has time on its side . And you can bet that Apple understands that the prize in play for global mobile payments is a larger market than that for phones , music , and computers combined . In classic Apple fashion , it is positioning itself to be a disruptive broker . According to industry newsletter The Nilson Report , the total of consumer and commercial purchases at merchants and cash obtained from credit and debit cards was $ 20.567 trillion in 2013 . The value to Apple is n't just transaction fees ; it is the massive treasure trove of user data . So yes , Apple is going to continue to improve on Apple Pay for quite a while .
Apple 's advantages are that the iPhone has a cult-like following . And every time users buy a new phone or upgrade to a new version of iOS , Apple has a chance to convince them to try Apple Pay . In no other business does an incumbent have so many opportunities to entice upgrades . This is particularly important considering that the major reason Apple Pay-eligible users give for not using the service is that they simply forget it exists . Changing habits takes time , and Apple has plenty of that with these users .
Financially , too , Apple also has many levers that it can push . It could offer credits on purchases of an iPhone and at the iTunes store , as well as exclusive discounts . The rebates for credit card fees could be used to buy music on iTunes , movies on Apple TV , or iPhone accessories . True , there are presently very few outlets that accept Apple Pay ; but once it gains momentum , practically every retailer will find it necessary to install an Apple Pay terminal or an add-on to their iPhones that will act as one .
The credit card companies have not done themselves a favor in forcing merchants to install a new chip-and-pin technology . The merchants are already complaining that reading the computer chips on credit cards takes a long time , annoying shoppers and costing money in lost transactions . This is bitter medicine for merchants who , with the new system , are now being forced to swallow liabilities for fraud that previously lay with the banks and credit cards . And though chip-and-pin transactions in Europe require both the chip in the card and a passcode , in the United States , terminals only require the chip . So the new format may reduce some card fraud , but is not all that much more secure than the old .
Compare this triple negative with an Apple Pay experience . Being lightning fast , it may slice 30 seconds off a chip-and-pin credit card transaction . The fingerprint it uses as the second factor of authentication ( aside from the chip in the iPhone ) not only is more secure than the four-digit passcode ; it also requires less work and can not be stolen easily or leaked wholesale , due to biometrics ' cryptographic storage . And Apple does not store the entire credit-card number on the phone , so if the phone is stolen , that information is not taken with it .
Let 's just take it as a given that Apple Pay achieves significant market penetration . What then ? Another upstart payments company , Square , gives us a flavor of what is possible when technology companies control the payments infrastructure . Square is now offering loans to its merchants without the merchant 's even requesting it . What 's more , it is basing the loan offering on the transaction volume it sees the merchant processing . And Square is taking repayment directly out of the transaction stream . Apple could easily do something like this , either for consumers or for merchants . With data and coverage come insights and smarter ways to do business .
Scofflaw Geithner sets a poor example

In his inauguration speech , President Obama singled out `` honesty and hard work , courage and fair play , tolerance and patriotism '' as `` those values upon which our success depends . ''
So why did Obama nominate a tax scofflaw to head the U.S. Treasury , which oversees the Internal Revenue Service ?
In a confirmation hearing Wednesday , the Senate Finance Committee grilled Timothy Geithner , Obama 's pick for Treasury secretary , about his tax problems and the nation 's dire financial situation . The committee could vote on his nomination today with a vote by the full Senate coming next week .
The tax issue : Geithner , who now heads the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , failed to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes when they were due on income he received from the International Monetary Fund between 2001 and 2004 .
Geithner was a regular employee of the IMF , but because it is an international organization , it is not required to withhold Social Security and Medicare tax from worker paychecks .
Instead , IMF employees are required to pay these taxes on their own , as if they are self-employed . They must pay both the employer 's and the employee 's share , which adds up to 15.3 percent of wages .
The IMF reimburses them for the employer 's half , but makes it clear that employees must pay the full amount .
The IMF goes to `` great lengths '' to make sure employees comply with their U.S. tax obligations , Sen Jim Bunning , R-Ky. , said Wednesday .
Audit shows errors
Geithner acknowledged receiving the tax reimbursement , but paid no self-employment tax for 2001 through 2004 .
In 2006 , he was audited for 2003 and 2004 and agreed to pay $ 16,732 in back self-employment taxes plus interest , according to a Finance Committee document . Penalties were waived . The audit uncovered a few other errors he had made .
Tax experts say the IRS probably did n't look at his earlier returns because it generally has three years from the date a return is filed to audit it unless fraud is involved .
After the election , when he surfaced as a candidate for Treasury secretary , Geithner paid $ 25,970 in back taxes and interest for 2001 and 2002 . Obama 's staff told senators about it Dec. 5 .
Obama has said Geithner made an `` innocent mistake . ''
Geithner said he did his own taxes using TurboTax in 2001 and 2002 . For 2003 and 2004 , he used an accountant who told him he did n't owe self-employment taxes . But he took responsibility for the errors Wednesday .
They were `` careless mistakes , avoidable mistakes , but they were unintentional . I should have been more careful . I take full responsibility for them . I have gone back and corrected the errors ; I have paid what I owed , '' he said .
If Geithner was being considered to head the Agriculture Department , it might be easier to understand or overlook his tax errors .
But the duties of the Treasury Department , according to its Web site , include : managing federal finances ; collecting taxes and paying bills ; managing the public debt ; supervising national banks ; advising on financial , monetary , economic , trade and tax policy ; enforcing federal finance and tax laws ; along with investigating and prosecuting tax evaders , counterfeiters , and forgers .
If Geithner ca n't do his taxes right , how can he expect others to ?
IRS Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson has complained for years about the tax code 's complexity . In her annual report to Congress this year , she called it the top problem facing taxpayers .
But paying self-employment tax is not one of the more arcane parts of the code . `` The complexity of the law could not be the contributing factor ( in Geithner 's case ) . We are talking about a pretty financially savvy person , '' says Robert Willens , a tax consultant to Wall Street firms .
Yet Willens predicts Geithner will be confirmed because it would be dangerous to be without a Treasury secretary right now . `` In these times , I certainly am willing to overlook it because the markets do have confidence in him as a policymaker , '' he said .
David Kotok , chief investment officer with Cumberland Advisors , does not think Geithner should be confirmed , but thinks that he will be .
`` I do n't believe there is only one person in the country who is the person for this job , '' he said . `` They had time to consider others . That is what bothered me . The president was prepared for the criticism and endorsed him . ''
He points out that Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood - Bill Clinton 's first two nominees for attorney general in 1993 - were forced to withdraw from consideration because they had employed undocumented nannies . Unlike Baird , Wood paid Social Security tax on her nanny and hired her at a time when it was not illegal to do so .
It 's not 'pay when caught '
I believe that hiring a man who failed to do his taxes right will set a terrible example . Our tax system is built on the premise of pay when due , not pay when caught .
In 2007 , Olson told Congress , `` Noncompliance has a corrosive effect on tax compliance . If compliant taxpayers believe that everyone else is paying his or her fair share , they are likely to remain compliant . But no one wants to feel like a 'tax chump . ' If compliant taxpayers feel like they are overpaying , some will reach a point where they resent it and stop complying or comply at a lower level . ''
If Obama wants to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars for a stimulus plan , our nation is going to need every possible tax dollar to pay it back .
New marine species may have been found in north-west Hawaiian Islands after reef exploration
Updated
New marine species may have been discovered off the north-western Hawaiian Islands after a major deep-sea exploration , scientists say .
To make the find , scientific divers descended to previously unexplored depths in the area as part of a 25-day National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) research expedition .
They have returned with specimens and photographs of new records of marine life , including sea urchins , sea cucumbers , algae and reef fish .
Chief scientist Dr Randall Kosaki said the discovery of new species is likely .
`` We discovered quite a few organisms that we can not identify . It 's very likely that many of them are new species , '' he said .
`` Now we 're back on shore , that 's when the real work begins . ''
The scientists visited French Frigate Shoals , Lisianski Island , Pearl and Hermes Atoll and Midway Atoll .
Dr Kosaki said the area and its marine life are not very well understood .
`` This area occupies two thirds of the Hawaiian archipelago but it 's largely uninhabited and very , very remote , '' he said .
`` So it 's not a place that very many people , or very many expeditions get to visit .
`` For this reason it 's not very well explored even in shallow water and the primary mission of our expedition was to explore some of the deeper waters . ''
The mission was made possible by the use advanced diving technology study coral reefs as deep as 91 metres .
Dr Kosaki said the exploration is the deepest study done in the area he calls the `` twilight zone '' .
`` We 're finding that the coral reef habitat goes deeper than most scuba divers , '' he said .
`` Most scuba diving research is done at depths of maybe five to 30 metres . We were diving at depths of 50 to 80 , or 90 metres .
The mission was made possible by the use of advanced diving technology allowing the study of the deeper coral reefs .
He said scientists will now compare the specimens found with known species in museum and university collections .
During the trip , Dr Kosaki said scientists found damage caused by climate change , including reef bleaching .
He said Lisianski Island appeared to be the hardest hit with large areas of once vibrant purple coral now white and some corals dying .
`` It 's a habitat that 's under threat from global climate change from global warming , '' he said .
`` So we stand to lose species before we even know they exist ... so there is some sense of urgency to document much of this before it 's potentially lost . ''

The New York Islanders on Friday night selected defenseman Griffin Reinhart with the fourth pick of the 2012 NHL Draft at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh .
Reinhart ( 6-foot-3 , 206 pounds ) plays for the Edmonton Oil Kings in the Western Hockey League . He 's the son of former NHL player Paul Reinhart , a defenseman for the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks . Just before the Islanders drafted Reinhart , they made a trade with the Anaheim Ducks to land veteran defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky for a second-round pick in the 2013 Draft .
NHL Central Scouting ranked Reinhart No . 10 among North American central skaters . In three seasons with the Oil Kings , Reinhart has 18 goals , 43 assists and 74 penalty minutes in 105 games . During the Oil Kings ' run to the 2011-2012 WHL Championship , Reinhart had two goals , six assists and 20 penalty minutes in 20 games . A physical specimen , Reinhart does n't have the most upside of other defensemen in the draft , but he is expected to develop into a steady two-way blueliner .

Jim Haslett and the Redskins are expected to address the safety position through the draft .
As he surveyed the talent around him during the first practices at the Senior Bowl in Mobile , Ala. on Monday , J.J. Wilcox almost did n't feel like it was all real .
A safety from Division I-AA 's Georgia Southern , Wilcox recognized his new teammates on the South team and opponents from the North team from TV – not from playing against them . He almost could n't believe he was on the same field with them .
But Wilcox quickly pushed such thoughts out of his head , and focused on the opportunity he had received .
“ I 'm soaking up every second . Just to be around these guys that you see on TV every week – coming from a small school , you do n't be on TV every day , ” Wilcox says . “ But here , you 've got [ Oregon running back ] Kenjon Barner , [ Georgia cornerback ] Shawn Williams , [ USC safety ] T.J. McDonald – guys that you see on TV . To be here , it 's a blessing , man . This is my chance to show the scouts that I can play with these guys as well . This is a big showcase . ”
Despite his lack of big-school pedigree , Wilcox was selected by the Senior Bowl committee as one of the top senior draft prospects in the country . Over the next several days of practices – during individual drills , seven-on-seven work , scrimmages and Saturday 's game – he will try to prove to coaches that he has a bright future in the NFL .
During interviews with scouts and team officials from at least half the teams in the league , Wilcox will try to say all the right things and explain his rapid rise , and that his limited experience at safety is reason for optimism rather than cause for concern .
The 6-foot , 215-pound Wilcox has played only one season of safety in college . During his first three seasons at Georgia Southern , he spent time at running back and slot receiver . His only defensive experience came in high school when he started at outside linebacker for one season .
As a senior , Wilcox moved to safety , where he ranked second on the team with 88 tackles and had two interceptions . He also returned kickoffs , averaging 25.2 yards per runback .
Wilcox believes that he finally has found his calling at safety and that continuity at that position will enable him to flourish . He sees his past as motivation rather than an excuse or limitation .
“ Having played offense is a plus , ” he says . “ Route-running , route stemming and ball skills , playing receiver and running back , you have to have great ball skills . Playing running back and receiver , you have to have that . And so , I know how to read defenses , I know how to read offenses . That definitely helps me .
“ I would love to have [ continuity ] , ” Wilcox adds referring to be able to play safety permanently rather than continually changing positions . “ It would make my game better . But at the same time , when you 're playing from behind like I am , it motivates you and challenges you more to work to show that you can play no matter what scheme you put up , no matter where you put me at , that gives me my drive . ”
Wilcox takes the fact that he is under draft consideration – and projected by some as a mid-round pick – as confirmation that NFL scouts and officials believe the same thing about him .
Having grown up a fan of the late Sean Taylor , and aware that safety ranks among the Redskins ' top offseason needs , Wilcox said he hopes Redskins talent evaluators watch him closely this week .
“ I definitely could go up there , play any position they need me to , ” Wilcox says . “ I 'm versatile , I 'm an accountable person , dependable , team player most of all . Whatever position they need me to play [ I 'll play ] it , and will make plays . Being this position after playing safety only one year shows all that . I 'm glad [ my coaches ] moved me .
Wilcox acknowledges that he still has much to learn about playing safety , but he relishes the chance to do so .
“ You can never know too much about the game . Every day I learn something new . I just want to learn how to be the best safety there is in the NFL , ” he says . “ I study all the safeties in the NFL . I was a big Sean Taylor fan , just always around the ball . Ed Reed . I love Ed Reed , just because he 's a ball hawk . Ryan Clark , I could go on . I love NFL , I sleep NFL . My TV stays on NFL Network . I can talk your ear off all day about NFL . ”
Tesla 's Wardenclyffe laboratory ,
where he tested his death ray . Tesla 's Death Ray
Given that Tesla 's inventions generally possessed an element of social conscience , of doing good for humanity , it may seem surprising that he created a number of devices with military applications . And the notion of the Tesla harnessing his mind for purposes of war may seem immensely frightening . After all , this is the man who boasted that with his resonance generator he could split the earth in two ... and no one was ever quite sure whether he was joking .
The first Tesla invention with a proposed military use was his automaton technology , with which the labor of human beings could be performed by machines . Specifically , Tesla produced remote-controlled boats and submarines . He demonstrated the wireless ship at an exposition in Madison Square Garden in 1898 . The automaton apparatus was so advanced , it used a form of voice recognition to respond to the verbal commands of Tesla and volunteers from the audience .
In public , Tesla spoke only of the humanitarian virtues of the invention : it would lessen the toils and drudgery of mankind and keep human lives out of harm 's way . But Tesla actually had his hopes on a contract with the U.S. military . In a presentation before the War Department , Tesla argued that his unmanned torpedo craft could obliterate the Spanish Armada and end the war with Spain in an afternoon . The government never took Tesla up on his offer .
Tesla then decided to pitch the automated submarine to private industry , and submitted it for the approval of J. P. Morgan . According to some accounts , Morgan offered to manufacture Tesla 's vessels , but only if Tesla would agree to marry Morgan 's daughter . Such a deal was of course anathema to Tesla , and he and Morgan would not work together until Wardenclyffe , a couple of years later .
Tesla eventually landed a successful military contract -- with the German Marine High Command . The product here was not unmanned seacraft , but sophisticated turbines which Admiral von Tirpitz used to great success in his fleet of warships . After J. P. Morgan cut off his support of Wardenclyffe , this foreign contract was Tesla 's only substantial source of income . Upon the outbreak of World War I , Tesla chose to forfeit his German royalties , lest he be charged with treason .
Nearly broke , and finding the United States on the brink of war , Tesla dreamed up a new invention that might interest the military : the death ray .
The mechanism behind Tesla 's death ray is not well understood . It was apparently some sort of particle accelerator . Tesla said it was an outgrowth of his magnifying transformer , which focused its energy output into a thin beam so concentrated it would not scatter , even over huge distances . He promoted the device as a purely defensive weapon , intended to knock down incoming attacks -- making the death ray the great-great grandfather of the Strategic Defense Initiative .
It is not certain if Tesla ever used the death ray , or indeed if he even succeeded in building one . But the following is the often-related story of what happened one night in 1908 when Tesla tested the foreboding weapon .
At the time , Robert Peary was making his second attempt to reach the North Pole . Cryptically , Tesla had notified the expedition that he would be trying to contact them somehow . They were to report to him the details of anything unusual they might witness on the open tundra . On the evening of June 30 , accompanied by his associate George Scherff atop Wardenclyffe tower , Tesla aimed his death ray across the Atlantic towards the arctic , to a spot which he calculated was west of the Peary expedition .
Tesla switched on the device . At first , it was hard to tell if it was even working . Its extremity emitted a dim light that was barely visible . Then an owl flew from its perch on the tower 's pinnacle , soaring into the path of the beam . The bird disintegrated instantly .
That concluded the test . Tesla watched the newspapers and sent telegrams to Peary in hopes of confirming the death ray 's effectiveness . Nothing turned up . Tesla was ready to admit failure when news came of a strange event in Siberia .
On June 30 , a massive explosion had devastated Tunguska , a remote area in the Siberian wilderness . Five hundred thousand square acres of land had been instantly destroyed . Equivalent to ten to fifteen megatons of TNT , the Tunguska incident is the most powerful explosion to have occurred in human history -- not even subsequent thermonuclear detonations have surpassed it . The explosion was audible from 620 miles away . Scientists believe it was caused by either a meteorite or a fragment of a comet , although no obvious impact site or mineral remnants of such an object were ever found .
Nikola Tesla had a different explanation . It was plain that his death ray had overshot its intended target and destroyed Tunguska . He was thankful beyond measure that the explosion had -- miraculously -- killed no one . Tesla dismantled the death ray at once , deeming it too dangerous to remain in existence .
Six years later , the onset of the First World War caused Tesla to reconsider . He wrote to President Wilson , revealing his secret death ray test . He offered to rebuild the weapon for the War Department , to be used purely as a deterrent . The mere threat of such destructive force , he claimed , would cause the warring nations to agree at once to establish lasting peace .
The only response to Tesla 's proposal was a form letter of appreciation from the president 's secretary . The death ray was never reconstructed , and for that we should probably all be thankful .
Tesla made one one further attempt to aid in his country 's war effort . In 1917 , he conceived of a sending station that would emit exploratory waves of energy , enabling its operators to determine the precise location of distant enemy craft . The War Department rejected Tesla 's `` exploring ray '' as a laughing stock .
A generation later , a new invention exactly like this helped the Allies win World War II . It was called radar .

The House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to look into the conduct of embattled state Rep. Robert Fisher , recently accused of being the secret creator of a misogynistic online forum .
The decision came hours after more than two dozen people rallied outside the State House calling for the Laconia Republican 's resignation .
Top party leaders , including Gov . Chris Sununu , have called on Fisher to step down ever since the Daily Beast reported the second-term representative appears to have founded “ The Red Pill ” and made online comments degrading women 's intelligence . Fisher has said his words were taken out of context and has resisted calls to resign .
He voted in favor of the inquiry Thursday , saying he is confident the matter will be resolved quickly .
“ I think the truth will be out at the hearing , ” said Fisher , before referring all other questions to a written statement he released earlier .
Though Democrats proposed the inquiry to look at Fisher 's conduct , Republicans voted to add in Democratic Rep. Sherry Frost , who has faced criticism from the right over her tweeting . Democrats bemoaned her inclusion in the probe and questioned why it had n't come sooner if there was real concern .
“ This is an absolute false equivalency , ” said Rep. Jacalyn Cilley , a Barrington Democrat . “ It seems to me that this is a bit of an eye for an eye . ”
The Legislative Administration Committee will question the members in public next week and make a recommendation to the House by June 1 . The suggested action could range from doing nothing to expelling the member , but any option would need a majority vote to pass .
Republican Speaker Shawn Jasper said the committee will only be able to look at the members ' conduct this session , which may bar most of Fisher 's comments from consideration because many were made years ago , according to the Daily Beast . The two-year legislative session began in January . According to the Daily Beast , Fisher is no longer moderator of “ The Red Pill ” forum and made his last comment on the site in October 2016 .
While the House voted 307-56 in favor of the inquiry , some critics said the chamber should n't regulate free speech .
“ This is being used as a political football , ” said Republican Rep. Keith Ammon . “ We need to have some more harmony in this body . ”
The Republican-led House added Frost to the probe in a vote largely along party lines . Jasper barred discussion about the two representatives ' conduct during the floor debate , so members could not outline specific concerns with Fisher or Frost 's behavior . In February , the New Hampshire GOP criticized Frost for tweeting “ we have a terrorist problem , all right , and they 're mostly white , Christian men . ”
Republican Rep. Victoria Sullivan , who put forward the amendment to include Frost , said it 's about fairness . “ All representatives should be held to the same standard , ” said Sullivan , of Manchester . “ This body can not pick and choose who they support and who they do not . ”
Frost questioned her inclusion in the inquiry with Fisher , but said she voted for it because she has nothing to hide . “ Hyperbole is not the same as vicious misogyny , ” she said .
More than two dozen people gathered outside the State House waving signs and calling for Fisher to step down Thursday morning . “ His behavior and attitudes toward women is deplorable , ” said Becky Cawley of Concord .
Last week , the Daily Beast reported Fisher appears to have founded “ The Red Pill ” in 2012 – two years before he was first voted into the New Hampshire House . The forum , on Reddit , quickly gained a following among men 's rights activists and now counts nearly 200,000 subscribers , the article said . The Daily Beast reported that Fisher made comments – through a number of online user names – that women have “ sub-par intelligence ” and that he is video-taped sexual encounters to protect against fake allegations of rape .
Fisher denied involvement with the forum to the Daily Beast . In statements issued after the article 's release , Fisher did n't directly address the forum but said his comments were taken out of context .
“ I never taped a sexual encounter , though I have often considered that it may be the best , or only , form of protection for men to prevent false rape accusations , ” he said in a letter to the Laconia Daily Sun . “ I 'm not interested in letting manufactured moral outrage over some out-of-context non-quotes dictate whether I 'm going to do my job in Concord . ”
So far , he 's resisted calls to resign , saying he will “ stand strong for men 's rights and the rights of all . ”
Several members of Fisher 's delegation said earlier this week they wo n't be pushing for Fisher to resign , according to the Daily Sun . “ He was freely elected and has n't broken any laws . I know him well and he 's a thoughtful guy , ” Belknap County Delegation Chairman Herb Vadney told the Sun .
Cheri Falk , a member of Wilton Peace Action who organized the Thursday rally , said the group plans to submit a complaint to the Legislative Ethics Committee if Fisher does n't step down . “ He must go , ” she said . It 's not clear if the group will follow that path given the House action Thursday .
The inquiry will be heard before the Legislative Administration Committee because it deals with member conduct , not an explicit ethics violation , House leaders said . The Committee will meet May 9 to hear from Fisher and May 10 to hear from Frost , according to House Majority Leader Dick Hinch .

HOUSTON - The wife of injured Houston police officer Ronny Cortez spoke with KPRC2 as her husband remains in the hospital after being shot earlier this week .
[ WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE ]
Sheri Cortez said Ronny , who was one of two officers shot Tuesday during a burglary investigation in southwest Houston , continues to recover in the hospital .
`` He 's doing OK . I do n't know what OK is . He 's alive , '' Sheri Cortez said . `` This is all out of my hands . I have no say here . This is all in God 's hands and we just go with it and do the best we can . ''
Cortez , a 24-year veteran of the Houston Police Department , was shot several times in the stomach and back . He was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital , where he was listed in critical condition with a bullet lodged near his spine . Cortez can move his upper extremities , according to Houston police chief Art Acevedo .
Cortez 's condition was upgraded Friday to fair condition at the hospital .
She praised the entire brotherhood of the Houston Police Department .
`` These officers have been taking care of me since the moment the shots rang out . They have been there , just letting me know they 're there and that they 're always going to be there for me , '' she said . `` It 's incredible . There 's nothing that these officers could do wrong in my eyes . ''
VIDEO : Sheri Cortez speaks out
She said she is grateful for the support from the community as well .
`` We have been flooded with well-wishes . I do n't think I 'd be able to make it through without the support , '' she said . `` Please keep the prayers coming . We are not out of the woods . ''
She said Ronny Cortez is a protector and that he was n't supposed to be at the scene of the burglary investigation .
`` He came to make sure everything was OK , to make sure the neighborhood was OK , '' she said . `` That 's the hard part ; that he came and was n't dispatched to it . And that 's really what Ronny 's always been about . He just wants to take care of everybody . ''
The Cortez family also released a statement Thursday evening that read , `` We would like to thank all of our friends , family and neighbors for the great network of support and good wishes . Ronny has been receiving the best care possible at Memorial Hermann Red Duke Trauma Institute since he arrived on Tuesday afternoon . Ronny is a protector and has always been there to help those in need . Right now we are making sure he gets the best care possible since he is the one in need . The Houston Police Department has been absolutely golden during this process and has been here for our family the entire time . In our eyes , these officers can do no wrong . We ask that everyone continue to send prayers our way as Ronny continues his recovery . We are eternally grateful for your love and support . ''
Officer Jose Munoz , a 10-year veteran of the department who was shot in the foot and leg , was released from the hospital on Wednesday .
One of the two burglary suspects , who police said broke into several homes on the day of the shooting , is dead and the other is on the run .
Earl Riley , 25 , was shot and killed by a police sergeant after exchanging gunfire with the officers . Riley , who police said is a known gang member , has an arrest history that dates back to 2009 on charges including evading arrest , burglary , trespass , drug violations and weapons violations .
Acevedo said authorities are still searching for the second man , who is believed to have been with Riley . He said Wednesday that the second man does not appear to have been involved in the shootout .
A $ 20,000 reward is being offered for information about the second man .
Anyone with information about the case should call Crime Stoppers at 713-222-8477 .

The series debut of NBC 's comedy “ Marlon ” scored the second most-watched new summer comedy premiere on the Big 4 broadcast networks in 10 years , according to Nielsen overnight data .
Airing at 9 p.m. , “ Marlon ” averaged a 1.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 5.4 million total viewers . That is one of the best premieres for a summer comedy series since CBS ' “ Creature Comforts ” nabbed 6.2 million viewers in 2007 . Earlier this summer , the Tuesday timeslot debut of ABC 's “ Downward Dog ” drew 5.7 million viewers , but that series was ultimately canceled . A second episode of “ Marlon ” at 9:30 p.m. dropped to a 1.0 and 4.1 million viewers , losing approximately 23 % of its audience in the key demo and 24 % in total viewers .
Earlier on NBC , “ America 's Got Talent ” ( 2.1 , 10.7 million ) was the highest-rated and most-watched show of the night .
On CBS , “ Big Brother ” ( 1.9 , 6.3 million ) was even . A new episode of “ Salvation ” at 9 p.m. ( 0.5 , 3.1 million ) was also even , while a second episode at 10 p.m. ( 0.4 , 2.8 million ) dipped in both measures .
ABC aired only the music special “ CMA Fest ” ( 1.2 , 5.7 million ) , which was approximately even with last year 's broadcast .
For Fox , “ MasterChef ” ( 0.9 , 3.1 million ) was even , while “ The F Word ” ( 0.6 , 1.8 million ) was up in both measures .
The CW aired only repeats .
NBC won the night with a 1.3 and 6.1 million viewers . ABC was second with a 1.2 and 5.7 million viewers . CBS was third with a 0.9 and 4.1 million . Fox was fourth with a 0.8 and 2.4 million . The CW averaged a 0.2 and 675,000 viewers .
WASHINGTON -- After denying that they are coordinating responses to Occupy Wall Street , the U.S. Conference of Mayors recently surveyed city administrations across the country about the movement .
In late November , according to documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act request , the District of Columbia mayor 's office received a request to update its answers to the survey . The questions to city officials appeared to elicit profiles of Occupy activists and answers that could help show the activists as a drain on resources .
The mayor 's conference asked via the emailed survey : What are the estimated Occupy-related costs ? What are the major issues relating to Occupy events ? Has the Occupy membership changed and if so `` describe those involved in the movement how they 've changed in terms of who they are and what their intentions for the demonstrations are . ''
In the survey , the organization also called on city administrations to share tactics . `` Please describe any strategies or tactics your city is employing in responding to Occupy-related events , including an assessment of their effectiveness if possible . ''
The U.S. Conference of Mayors has quietly led efforts to coordinate city responses to the Occupy Wall Street movement , the records show . These documents -- which comprise emails to local D.C. officials -- appear to contradict previous statements in which mayors denied any sort of group strategy sessions .
In early November , Oakland 's Mayor Jean Quan created a firestorm after admitting in an interview that she had participated in one of the group 's conference calls on Occupy . The call , she said , included 18 other cities . As one city encampment after another was razed on similar pretexts , activists charged that Quan and other big city mayors were colluding against them .
Mara Verheyden-Hilliard , the executive director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund , has obtained her own set of conference-call related documents and says the mayors ' conference is an active participant in setting the stage for the camp raids . `` These are sessions that were intended in assisting cities in creating the public pretext for the eviction of the encampments , '' Verheyden-Hilliard said . `` I think they tried to play a fairly covert role in what was an extremely significant nationally coordinated effort to shut down the occupations . ''
The participating mayors downplayed the calls as `` general information sharing . '' After the news of the Quan call broke , a spokesperson for Portland Mayor Sam Adams described one call as a mere `` therapy session '' during an interview with MSNBC .
But in promotional letters and emails obtained by HuffPost , the Conference of Mayors pitched the calls as far more substantial .
In a Nov. 10 email , Tom Cochran , CEO and executive director for the conference , hyped a follow-up conference call led by Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter . Cochran wrote that the call `` will enable more mayors and police chiefs from across the country to participate in the discussion , sharing information about the situation in their cities , their concerns , and the strategies that are working . ''
Cochran went to write that regular Occupy-themed conference calls were being arranged . `` We also agreed that the Conference of Mayors will host regular conference calls of mayors and police chiefs on the impact of the Occupy Movement in cities for as long as we need to , '' he wrote .
In his own letter outlining an upcoming session , Mayor Nutter wrote on Nov. 8 that the discussion would `` cover what has been happening in cities , costs incurred , issues that have arisen , and strategies being employed to respond . It will also provide an opportunity to discuss what cities can expect in the future , and the best ways to minimize any problems . ''
The U.S. Conference of Mayors refused comment and deferred all questions to its participating mayors .
Nutter 's office did not respond to a request seeking comment .
Pedro Ribeiro , D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray 's communications director , said he remembers city police officials and representatives from the Office of the Attorney General participating in one call in mid-November . Emails show Attorney General Irvine Nathan was on one call with Nutter .
D.C. Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump told HuffPost that Chief Cathy Lanier `` participated in many calls about this issue . ''
The U.S. Conference of Mayors may not have just been assisting with strategies , but may have also been seeking to compile evidence for the argument that Occupy cost cities . During the back and forth over the survey questions with D.C. , Occupy-related costs rose dramatically . As Verheyden-Hilliard pointed out in a piece on her organization 's website : `` The Mayor 's Office 's cost estimates rose from $ 21,000 ( as of 10/19 ) on November 15 , to $ 894,000 on November 18 to $ 1.1 million in MPD costs on November 22 to $ 1,579,000 on December 1 . ''
Verheyden-Hilliard says the D.C. numbers are bogus . `` These are not real numbers , '' she tells Huff Post . `` These are numbers that are being created because they want to dramatize the cost to D.C . ''
Ribeiro blames the steep cost increase on confusion over what was an Occupy cost versus what was a non-Occupy cost . `` The MPD was n't giving the full tally , '' he says .
In a Nov. 15 email to the Associated Press obtained through the FOIA request , Gray spokesperson Doxie McCoy wrote that the Occupy costs came to $ 21,000 as of Oct. 19 , with less than $ 1,000 spent on police overtime . But even that number may have been high . It was difficult to tell what was Occupy-related expenses and what were normal city expenses such as trash pick up and traffic control .
Of the $ 21,000 , McCoy wrote : `` These are not additional costs because city agencies are performing normal daily duties . ''
Crump repeated this sentiment to an Examiner reporter , the FOIA documents showed . `` The majority of the costs are budgeted in the local budget , '' she emailed . `` The overtime costs are manageable , at this time . ''
A week after the D.C. mayor 's office received the conference 's survey , the group emailed Gray 's office again . They 'd received the survey answers . But they had one problem . `` With calculus you gave us , DC through MPD has spent about $ 65,000 since demonstrations began Oct. 6 , '' wrote Laura DeKoven Waxman , the conference 's director of public safety . `` That seems low to me , so wanted to make sure it 's correct . ''
Average hourly real wage series from the Labor Productivity and Costs ( LPC ) program and the Current Employment Statistics ( CES ) program have evolved very differently over the past decades . While the LPC wage has grown consistently over time and become markedly more volatile since the mid-1980s , the CES wage stagnated from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s and experienced a substantial drop in volatility since the mid-1980s . These differences are due to the divergent evolution of average weekly earnings in the two data sets . Average weekly hours , by contrast , have evolved very similarly . Using information from the Current Population Survey and other publicly available data , we identify two principal sources for the divergent evolution of weekly earnings : differences in earnings concept ( employer-paid supplements and irregular earnings of high-income individuals included in the LPC data but not in the CES data ) ; and differences in worker coverage ( all non-farm business workers for the LPC data versus production and nonsupervisory workers in private non-agricultural establishments for the CES data ) . The results have important implications for the appropriate choice of aggregate wage series in macroeconomic applications .
Ever since Skeptic magazine published an investigative article on the 9/11 `` Truth Movement '' and analyzed their claims , which were found wanting , I have been hounded by the so-called 9/11 `` truthers '' because I am the editor of the magazine and therefore am supposed to be a `` skeptic '' of the official explanation for 9/11 .
In fact , throughout January I have been on a book tour for The Mind of the Market , my book on behavioral economics and evolutionary economics , and at every event during the Q & A one of these `` truthers '' pretends to ask a question about economics but then quickly shifts to a rant about what `` really happened '' on September 11 , 2001 .
At my appearance at Powell 's bookstore in Portland , Oregon , for example , someone with a video camera captured the rambling screed and posted it on YouTube the same night .
For my appearance in Seattle , my web meister , Emrys Miller , came prepared with a video camera just in case the `` troofers '' showed up . Sure enough , one did .
There was no need for a camera in Philadelphia , as the 9/11 conspiratorialists came prepared with their own recording equipment , and captured the moment here .
They subsequently appeared at my events at Books Inc. in Mountain View , California , Kepler 's Books in Menlo Park , California , and at UCLA . What 's going on here ? As Bill Maher discovered one day during the taping of his HBO series `` Real Time , '' their goal is just to be heard -- in any venue at any time under any circumstances . In spring of 2005 , for example , I gave a lecture at the Los Angeles Public Library , after which I was buttonholed by a documentary filmmaker with Michael Mooreish ambitions of exposing the `` truth '' about the 9/11 conspiracy , and he wanted to know if he could interview me . I responded , `` you mean the conspiracy by Osama bin Laden and his nineteen Al-Qaeda operatives to fly planes into buildings ? ''
`` That 's what they want you to believe , '' he said .
`` Who is 'they ' , '' I queried .
`` The government , '' he whispered in hushed tones , as if `` they '' might actually be listening in at that very moment .
`` Yeah , well , 'the government ' is a little vague for me , '' I suggested . `` Who in the government wants me to believe that Al-Qaeda did it ? ''
`` The Bush administration , '' was the by now predictable answer .
`` But did n't Osama and some members of Al-Qaeda not only say they did it , '' I reminded him , `` they gloated about what a glorious triumph it was over America and western capitalism , materialism , and secularism ? ''
`` Oh , you 're talking about that video of Osama , '' he exclaimed knowingly . `` That was faked by the C.I.A . and leaked to the American press to mislead us . There has been a disinformation campaign going on ever since 9/11 . ''
`` How do you know ? '' I inquired .
`` Because of all the unexplained anomalies surrounding 9/11 , '' he answered .
`` Such as ? ''
`` Such as the fact that steel melts at a temperature of 2,777 degrees Fahrenheit , but jet fuel burns at only 1,517 degrees Fahrenheit . No melted steel , no collapsed towers . ''
At this point I ended the conversation and declined to be interviewed , knowing precisely where the dialogue was going next -- if I can not explain every single minutia about the events of that fateful 11th day in September , 2001 , that lack of knowledge , in his mind at least , equates to direct proof that 9/11 was orchestrated by Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , and the CIA in order to implement their plan for global domination and a New World Order , to be financed by G.O.D . ( Gold , Oil , Drugs ) and launched by a Pearl Harbor-like attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , thereby providing the justification for war . The evidence is there in the details , he explained , handing me faux dollar bill ( `` 9-11 '' replacing the `` 1 '' and Bush supplanting Washington ) choc-a-block full of web sites . Where I have heard all this before ?
Fired 'Troopergate ' figure accuses Palin of lying Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska Gov . Sarah Palin is lying when she says she did not try to get her brother-in-law fired from the state 's police force then sacked the public safety commissioner who would not go along with her planned vendetta , the official at the center of the scandal says .
ABC News , which secured the first televised interview with the Republican vice presidential nominee , reports the accusations Monday : `` She 's not telling the truth when she told ABC neither she nor her husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten , '' said Walt Monegan , the Alaskan official whose dismissal by Sarah Palin is the focus of a state investigation known as `` Troopergate '' . `` And she 's not telling the truth to the media about her reasons for firing me . ''
In an exclusive interview with ABC News.com , former Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan said he resisted pressure by the First Couple to re-open an old case against a state trooper , who was in a hotly contested divorce and custody battle with the Governor 's sister Molly .
Alaskan lawmakers are investigating whether Palin and her husband used the power of the Governor 's office to conduct a personal vendetta against their former brother-in-law , whose behavior during the 2005 divorce was described by the Palin family as `` threatening . '' Monegan recently spent several hours of sworn testimony to a legislative body investigating whether Palin abused her power . The results of the investigation are expected in October , although Palin has been trying to delay the proceedings until after the election .
Palin , who came to the GOP ticket touted as an honest , reform-minded candidate , has dodged inquiries about her and her husband 's involvement in Monegan 's firing . Among 1,100 e-mails the governor 's office has refused to release in response to a public records request are dozens of exchanges among her husband and government aides regarding the public safety union that represents the state troopers .
Monegan said he thought it would be a misuse of his position to re-open an old case on Palin 's brother-in-law as he was in the middle of a messy divorce . Monegan said he tried to persuade the first couple to drop the matter . `` As a cop for 35 years I 'm pretty familiar with issues that come up in divorce cases , '' and said his argument to both Todd and Sarah was , `` if this was so egregious , why did n't you bring it up sooner ? Why did you wait until several years later ? '' While it will be some time before the full story of Sarah and Todd Palin 's involvement in Monegan 's firing becomes clear -- Todd Palin was served with a subpoena last week -- it certainly fits a pattern for the governor outlined in a separate New York Times article Monday . Sarah Palin prized loyalty and punished dissent , the paper reported . But an examination of her swift rise and record as mayor of Wasilla and then governor finds that her visceral style and penchant for attacking critics  she sometimes calls local opponents haters  contrasts with her carefully crafted public image .
Throughout her political career , she has pursued vendettas , fired officials who crossed her and sometimes blurred the line between government and personal grievance , according to a review of public records and interviews with 60 Republican and Democratic legislators and local officials . Whether voters want that governing style in the White House will remain to be seen .

“ I have always been a fan of Clarke 's extraordinary ‘ Odyssey ' series , and certainly Kubrick 's adaptation of 2001 . I am thrilled to be part of bringing that legacy to audiences and continuing the great cinematic tradition that this story and its creators deserve , ” said Ridley Scott .
“ Arthur C. Clarke is the father of modern science fiction , ” said Syfy President Dave Howe . “ We could n't be more excited to be working with Scott Free and Warner Horizon Television to bring to the screen , for the very first time , the final chapter of this extraordinary masterpiece . ”
The announcement comes on the heels of Syfy announcing the greenlight of another Arthur C. Clarke classic novel , Childhood 's End , which begins production later this year .
Persona Stalker Club Episode 8 : Thoughts And Theories On Persona 5
By Sato . October 3 , 2014 . 5:32pm
The eighth episode of Persona Stalker Club , hosted by popular Persona fans in voice actress Tomomi Isomura and freelance writer Mafia Kajita , is a special one that took place during Tokyo Game Show 2014 , which was held last month . What could they have been up to ?
[ Note : skip towards the bottom of the post for the special segment on Persona 5 . ]
The episode starts off with the two at the Makuhari Messe , where the event is held each year , and they begin out by going around looking for fans who might know about Persona Stalker Club .
Before going into the Tokyo Game Show events , the program takes a look at a few fan letters from various fans across Japan . Kajita jokes about how most of the fan mail seems oddly positive and grateful , to which Isomura says that it 's probably because of all the work that awaits .
One fan mentioned how he accidentally bought “ Persora – The Golden Best , ” an album based off the fan-favorite “ soramimi ” antics from Issochi and Kajita , instead of the actual “ Persona – The Golden Best ” album . The two hosts had a good laugh over how he fell for the gag , but he seemed grateful to have learned about the show that way nonetheless .
In the next segment at 7:20 , the duo returns to their quest of looking for fans who might be familiar with the show . However , the catch is that they 'll ask the so-called fans various questions about the show , and getting the wrong answer means having to get a taste of the meat-flavored gum .
The first person they find is an Akihiko cosplayer . He claims to be a fan from the very first episode , so they ask him what 's under Izanagi 's “ zipper ” which he got wrong , and has to suffer the taste of failure , which includes 20 % more meat for the very special occasion .
The punishment backfires , however , as “ Nikuhiko sempai ” ( niku=meat ) actually ends up liking the gum . Following him , the next group of cosplayers ends up getting their question wrong as well , and even the Chie cosplayer does her best to show how much she liked the gum .
The following group gets it right , but they choose to get a taste of the gum out of curiosity , and oddly enough , they actually like it , too… well , except for the idol in Rise .
In the next corner , the hosts answer various Persona-related questions from fans , with the first one asking what 's up with Aigis ' legs and how she manages to put on shoes and why her creator did n't make her more human-like in those parts .
According to Kajita , he 's been curious whenever he saw Aigis dressed in her school outfit , wearing shoes and socks . According to Atlus , she has a feature on her ankles that allows for optional equips . When her feet are pointy , it 's to increase movement speed and jumping power , similar to “ Bambi or a horse ” .
Isomura jokingly mentions that it was probably just because they got too lazy to draw the rest of her , so they just decided to give her straight legs .
The next question is another one is another question about Aigis , where a fan asks if her breasts and other parts are soft , because he gets the impression that they 'd be hard , considering that she 's an android .
Atlus says that she 's been provided with extra defense to be able to defend against all kinds of attacks that you would expect from fighting against Shadows , but otherwise , she was originally “ modeled ” after humans . So , it seems like it 's up to the fans to decide .
Apparently , that is also a question that is most asked by companies that create Aigis models .
The following question points out that Junpei wears a cross in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax , which resembles the one Chidori wore on her head , and asks if there 's any relation . Atlus says that it 's actually a necklace from Chidori 's favorite apparel brand , which she gave to Junpei as a gift .
Next , at 19:35 , they go around asking various fans who their favorite male and female characters are . The top three favorites for male characters went from third to first with Kanji , Adachi , and Yu . The female top three is a tie between Rise and Mitsuru for third , Chie in second place , and Nanako with the top votes .
Then , at 21:14 , they show a collection of various Persona cosplayers .
The 22:10 mark is the fan-favorite segment of “ soramimi ” with mangled lyrics to Persona songs . The first track from Persona 3 actually does n't have lyrics in the original soundtrack , so they ask singer and rapper Lotus Juice to share it over Twitter sometime .
However , it definitely sounds like it 's saying “ shoyu , gohan gawari ” ( soy sauce instead of rice ) . Staff member Matsumoto appears once again , and he even has a side of his favorite choco cornet as a side dish .
The next track is from “ Light the Fire Up in the Night ‘ Mayonaka ' ” from Persona Q , where the lyrics say “ in this vast gloomy night sky “ but it sounds like “ Iindesuka ? Sutoroberii naidesuka ? ” ( Is it okay ? Would you happen to have strawberry [ flavor ] ? )
Following , is Isomura 's original soramimi for Persona Q 's “ Light the Fire Up in the Night ‘ Kagejikan ' ” . The original lyrics say “ light that path whenever it 's dark , ” which Isomura hears as “ Rei-chan , panusto de ireba iisa ” ( Rei-chan , you should wear some pantyhose ) .
The last one is another from “ Light the Fire Up in the Night ‘ Mayonaka ' ” from Persona Q , where Isomura hears the “ gloomy night sky ” part as “ moobii , naisu taitsu ! ” ( Movie , nice tights ! ) .
In the next part of the program , the two hosts take the show live on Atlus ' stage during Tokyo Game Show 2014 , where they start out with a look at Etrian Odyssey Untold II 's latest trailer at 35:28 , followed by some gameplay . They then share a little on Persona 4 : Dancing All Night at 39:00 .
A vote was held regarding “ if you could dance with one of these characters , which would it be ? ” with the result of : Kanji ( 18.8 % ) , Yosuke ( 24.3 % ) , and Chie ( 56.8 % ) .
Finally , they end the program with the part fans have all been waiting for : Persona 5 . They start out with a look at the recent teaser trailer at the 45:00 mark , as an opportunity to share their thoughts and theories on what the game will be about .
After showing the clip , Isomura says that she 's already seen that video dozens of times , while Kajita adds that he 's seen it so much that he could throw up ( in a good way ! ) , too . Unfortunately , Atlus did n't show any gameplay as they had hoped , but they discuss the trailer nevertheless .
According to Isomura , the blue train shown at the beginning passes through an area that looks exactly like a route she takes from south Shinjuku back to Shinjuku after her voice acting training lessons . The last bit is also Shibuya , so they say that it 's safe to assume that it 'll take place in Persona version of metropolitan of Tokyo .
Kajita points out that the character who appears to be the main character of Persona 5 is shown looking at news bulletins in the train that show all kinds of atrocious news .
He continues by saying that past games of the series focused on themes like the “ Apathy Syndrome ” in Persona 3 , but judging by the messages on the train , it looks like Persona 5 might face more realistic problems , such as incidents of bullying and suicide .
Isomura also points out that the protagonist 's big glasses reminds her of the latest trend seen worn by models , and such , so it looks like he might be pretty fashion-conscious . On the subject of glasses , Kajita says that Persona 4 had a theme of glasses , so maybe this could possibly be an ongoing theme with Persona 5 , but Isomura on the other hand , believes that it did n't seem to be much of a focus , so it seems unlikely .
They then joke about saying that the protagonist could be wearing glasses to not stand out as much , but when he feels like looking good , he could take them off to say , “ can I be hot now ? ”
Next they point out the part at the end of the trailer , where they flames are reflecting on the protagonist 's glasses , with a shadow that looks evil .
Isomura 's theory is that the scene looks like it could be when he first summons his Persona , as you could see him noticing something and looks around the crowd . She says that it 's almost as if he “ found ” someone , and it could be a Shadow that was hidden within somebody in the bustling streets .
The episode then ends with the Midnight Station corner , which shows the latest of products and events of all-things-Persona , followed by a thank-you message from the show to all the fans and those who participated in the episode during Tokyo Game Show .
After a long and busy episode , Isomura and Kajita say they feel like they ranked up their Social Link with the viewers .

Here 's a good place to start . We worked with CareerBliss , an online jobs database , to find the jobs with the happiest employees in America . To come up with the ranking , CareerBliss examined 57,000 employee evaluations across more than 450 different job titles .
The final measure of job satisfaction , which CareerBliss calls a `` bliss score , '' is given on a scale of one to five ( one being the least happy and five the most ) . The bliss scores are based on eight factors : work-life balance ; relationship with coworkers ; work environment ; job resources ; compensation ; growth opportunities ; company culture ; and daily tasks .
Overall , among the positions that ranked as the happiest in the nation , employees rate their bosses and colleagues as the best part of their jobs . They also give high marks to job freedom , which generally refers to the amount of flexibility employees have in how , when , and where they get their work done . Concrete factors like human resources and compensation get more lukewarm reviews .
The jobs are n't necessarily what you 'd expect , and they 're certainly not the highest paying . But for one reason or another , employees love them anyway .

Dr Boyce Watkins : Most Americans do n't invest in the stock market and it 's a horrible thing
by Dr Boyce Watkins
I was sitting on a delayed flight to Chicago and preparing the notes for my new lecture series on how to invest in the stock market . While doing my research for the course , I ran across a startling statistic : According to a survey done by Bankrate.com , more than half ( 52 % ) of all Americans own no stock at all . This includes those who invest with their 401k and other retirement plans .
This statistic shocked , frightened , disappointed , intrigued and even excited me . I 'll explain . The shock , fear and disappointment came from the fact that those who choose not to participate in the stock market are literally missing out on massive amounts of wealth that is being created on a daily basis . The stock market has been on an ABSOLUTE TEAR over the past few years , and anyone who has invested in a large batch of stocks over any 20 – year period in American history has always ended up with far more money than they started off with .
This result intrigued me because it made me think about all of the reasons that people avoid and fear the stock market . Most of these reasons are irrational , but it 's easy to fear something we do n't understand . Also , when most Americans do n't buy stock , it only increases the gap in wealth between the rich and everyone else .
Finally , the study 's results excited me because THIS IS A HUGE opportunity for black folks . By teaching each other and our children how to get invested in the stock market , we can take the lead on other communities that have a fear of investing .
My PhD is in Finance . I can help you . I 've taught stock market investing to thousands of students in the past , many of whom are experts on Wall Street right now . My entire dissertation involved analyzing millions of bytes of data on the stock market , so I know what the heck I 'm talking about .
It 's really not that difficult to invest , and I can teach you how to buy stock by spending $ 5 and $ 10 at a time .

Turkey targets 30 % hike in military spending next year
Author : Metin Gurcan
Posted October 18 , 2017
Turkey plans to boost its military spending significantly next year , according to preliminary budget figures revealed this week .
Turkey is currently the world 's 18th-largest military spender , with an estimated 2016 outlay of $ 14.8 billion , according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 's ( SIPRI ) Fact Sheet , which was released in April . SIPRI notes the figure is an estimate because , since the attempted military coup in July 2016 , detailed data has become difficult to obtain .
But one fact is beyond dispute : The government is planning to meet an expected 30 % increase in military defense expenditures by direct taxation of its citizens and a series of price hikes to be borne by the public .
The Finance Ministry gave parliament a draft 2018 budget Oct. 16 and expects to hand legislators the final proposal Oct. 25 . Though education is to receive the largest chunk of the budget , Minister Naci Agbal told local media the huge hike in military spending reflects a `` war economy . '' He cited `` geopolitical risks and the budget increases these risks require . '' He said that of about $ 7.2 billion in extra revenues to be derived from surcharges on vehicles , fuel , real estate and personal income taxes , about $ 2.3 billion will be directly allocated to the defense industry . Turkey is expecting a $ 5.2 billion increase in 2018 defense expenditures .
According to Agbal , in 2018 a supplementary $ 7.5 billion will be transferred to Turkey 's military/defense budget . Of this new funding , about $ 2.3 billion will be allotted to the Defense Industry Undersecretariat , which procures Turkey 's weapons systems and equipment . Moreover , the Defense Ministry budget will rise by 41 % to $ 12 billion . The budget of the Interior Ministry will be augmented by 25 % , the Gendarmerie Command budget will increase by 42 % , while the national police budget will go up by 18 % and the National Intelligence Service budget will get an additional 20 % .
All told , about $ 26 billion will be spent on military defense expenditures , out of a total national budget of $ 195 billion . That amount is likely to put Turkey in SIPRI 's top 15 defense spenders in 2018 .
According to Arda Mevlutoglu , a well-placed expert on the Turkish defense industry , a new trend is visible in Turkey 's defense and security spending . He said that because of Turkey 's growth rate , rapid increases in military defense expenditures are not reflected in gross domestic product . Mevlutoglu also cited a notable increase in national manufacturers ' income , saying , “ For example , while the total revenue of the Turkish defense and aeronautic industries was $ 1.855 billion between 2006-2016 , it is now $ 5.968 billion . ”
Turkey , while updating its national defense and deterrence capacity during the past 10 years , also has been focusing on long-term investments and mobilizing national resources . There was little off-the-shelf procurement to combat security threats , as Ankara believed its defense and security resources were adequate to cope with existing and anticipated threats .
But Mevlutoglu emphasized that , especially with developments in Syria and Iraq , `` the nature and dimensions of threats in the region usually exceed the capacity of any one regional country to cope with . ''
`` This requires that a sensitive balance has to be maintained between long-term capacity development nationally '' and urgent needs to procure items from outside sources . ”
Mevlutoglu elaborated : “ In modern combat and similar operations , ammunition consumption usually exceeds all predictions . We saw examples of this in the 1999 NATO operation [ against Yugoslavia ] , 2003 Gulf War , 2011 Libya operation , Yemen operations of the Arab coalition and lately in the US-led coalition operation against the Islamic State . [ Long-running ] struggles against asymmetric threats in the combat zone [ require ] serious production and accumulation of ammunition . ... Because of the asymmetric and urban warfare requirements , the need for specific equipment and vehicles , which are usually high-cost items , exceed all expectations . ”
Although the predicted budget increases to defend Turkey 's national interests in Syria and Iraq appear high , it 's possible such amounts are still inadequate for procurement from national and foreign defense industries . In short , the additional economic burden of further military operations in Syria will be considerably higher than before .
According to the Turkish military 's latest figures , released in April , Turkey has 362,284 armed military personnel , excluding the Gendarmerie and the Coast Guard . Of that figure , 201 are generals , 25,728 officers , 64,655 noncommissioned officers , 47,167 contract sergeants , 16,018 contract privates first-class and 208,515 nonprofessional conscripts . Only 45 % of the Turkish Armed Forces can be classified as fully professional .
With this structure , Turkey has Europe 's second-largest army , if Russia is included .
According to a military source who asked to remain anonymous , about 70 % of Turkey 's military/defense spending goes toward personnel expenses . Of the remaining funds , 25 % is spent on new weapons systems and only 5 % goes to modernization and research and development projects . Obviously , Turkey has to find ways to curtail personnel expenses while transforming to its military to a professional force and reducing its size , without sacrificing operational effectiveness .
The source added that Turkey currently buys more than 60 % of its military equipment and supplies from national resources . This ratio will increase to about 70 % in three years . Local production is of vital importance for Turkey , but when compared with foreign resources , local costs are far too high . Turkey has to find new markets for its local production to ensure its defense industry 's sustained growth .
However , given the lengthy state of emergency , it 's been difficult to conduct a transparent debate in parliament and in public on how to cut the number of military personnel effectively .
That might explain why I could n't find a single reliable report , analysis or academic study during my research for Turkey 's 2016-2017 defense and security expenditures . There is simply no reliable data for the past two years . Turkey 's already-opaque defense/military expenditures are now concealed behind a screen of secrecy .
Correction : Oct. 18 , 2017 . An earlier version of this article included statements from Minister Naci Agbal identified as given to Al-Monitor . They were rather made to local Turkish media outlets .

Women 's Studies Programs Need Intellectual Diversity
New Boston Post
Carrie L. Lukas
College leaders spend a lot of time talking about the need for diversity on campus . They want to make sure that different races , ethnicities , religions , and sexual orientations are represented . To some extent , this makes sense : Colleges are supposed to expose students to a variety of perspectives . It helps to have students surrounded by people from different backgrounds .
Yet college administrators ought to remember that it 's different ideas — not just skin colors , languages and genders — that are most important . Sadly , the need for intellectual diversity is often entirely overlooked . And while this is true for universities generally , it 's particularly true when it comes to women 's issues and campus Women 's Studies departments .
When I attended the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard , one of our ethics classes was dedicated to the topic of abortion . About 60 students sat in seats that were curved around the room , in an attempt to facilitate discussion and debate . Yet on that day , there was hardly any debate at all . Almost no one was willing to make the pro-life argument . Part of the problem was there were no more than a handful of students with a pro-life viewpoint in the class . But even those who were in attendance were understandably reluctant to speak up . Not only were they outnumbered , but they knew from experience that those with pro-life positions are likely to be demonized as anti-woman , or worse .
Our ethics professor — herself a stalwart feminist , but one who truly believed in the importance of intellectual diversity and open debate — had to pry pro-life arguments out of students and offer some herself . I appreciated the effort . But it was hard to overlook that she was herself making the arguments only out of duty .
This imbalance in the class degraded the quality of education we received that day : The pro-choice students did n't hear many of the best competing arguments of the other side , and neither side learned how to defend their views and engage in passionate , but respectful debate .
Harvard certainly is n't alone in facing such imbalances . Studies confirm the obvious : Professors on campus overwhelmingly skew to the political Left . A 2012 study of full-time , professors at four-year colleges found that 12.4 percent self-identified as “ far left , ” 50.3 percent as “ liberal , ” 25.4 percent as “ middle of the road , ” and 11.5 percent as “ conservative. ” The category “ far right ” was little more than a rounding error , at just 0.4 percent . That adds up to two out of every three professors being admittedly on the side of the political Left , compared to just one in ten on the Right .
Interestingly , the female professoriate was even more lopsidedly liberal . And other studies have found that professors in humanities are the most ideologically skewed .
This data suggests that Women 's Studies departments are likely to be among the most out of balance . This makes sense because , in fact , the entire women studies discipline was created as part an outgrowth of a political movement – a movement intended to advance an ideological agenda — rather than as a traditional field of education . The National Women Studies Association , which was founded in 1977 , still proudly publicizes its relationship with the traditional , liberal feminist movement , noting on its website :
NWSA recognizes that women 's studies is broader than what happens in the classroom and acknowledges women 's centers staff as feminist educators . Campus-based women 's centers have a long history of working together with women 's studies to transform the curriculum , the campus environment , and society at large .
The “ transformation ” they seek is simple ; to move the country further to the Left . One can debate whether or not that 's a good or bad idea — but students in Women 's Studies programs ought to at least have that debate . But that wo n't happen when the professors are ideologically in agreement and are n't particularly welcoming to students with different perspectives .
Some schools , of course , recognize the ideological imbalance problem and are making efforts to correct the lack of intellectual diversity . Today , Harvard 's Kennedy School at least tries to demonstrate a respect for conservative ideas by bringing in Fellows to be a part of the school community . In fact , this spring , the Kennedy School is bringing in a Fellow who has been at the forefront of trying to correct the imbalance in Women 's Studies programs and centers on college campuses .
Karin Agness helped found the Network of Enlighted Women ( NeW ) while a student at the University of Virginia . Her campus women 's center had n't welcomed women with conservative views , so Karin and some friends started a group of their own for female students who did n't agree with the liberal orthodoxy on campus . Since then , NeW 's network has grown to 25 campuses , as well as professional network groups for young adults in Washington , D.C. , and New York City . Hers is a perspective student at the Kennedy School need to hear .
Much more needs to be done on campuses across the country to make sure that students really are hearing a diversity of opinions , learning to assess a variety of viewpoints , and coming to their own conclusions , including – perhaps especially — when the topic is women 's issues .

said the lack of diverse voices and stories onscreen led people from minority backgrounds to “ switch off and retreat to fringe narratives , to bubbles online and sometimes even off to Syria ” . Delivering Channel 4 's annual diversity lecture in Parliament , Ahmed said that in the light of the rise in racial and religious hate crimes post-Brexit , TV had a pivotal role to play in ensuring different communities felt heard , and valued , in British society . “ If we fail to represent , we are in danger of losing people to extremism , ” he said . “ In the mind of the Isis recruit , he 's the next James Bond right ? Have you seen some of those Isis propaganda videos , they are cut like action movies . Where is the counter narrative ? Where are we telling these kids they can be heroes in our stories , that they valued ? ” Ahmed 's recent roles include the HBO drama The Night Of and comedy series Girls , both American TV shows .
Speaking of rent-seeking diversitarians , from The Guardian : Personally , I saw both of those movies , along with Nightcrawler in which he plays some kind of pseud0-Chicano , and this guy made zero impression on me . I had forgotten he existed.I , Riz Ahmed , am almost as asymmetrically funny-looking as Adam Driver is , and we were both on Girls .
Yet he gets to play Darth Vader Jr. in Star Wars movies , while I 'm stuck playing Bodhi Rook .
I ask you : is that fair ?
Like Idris Elba , who delivered the lecture last year , Ahmed used the platform to criticise the fact he still had to go to the US to land major parts .
Trust me , I really wanted to spend my entire life doing Coronation Street and appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and living in a fourth floor walk-up flat . But instead I had to go to Hollywood to be in a Star Wars movie .
Because you are racist and I hate you .
“ It takes American remakes of British shows to cast someone like me , ” he said . “ We end up going to America to find work . I meet with producers and directors here and they say ‘ we do n't have anything for you , all our stories are set in Cornwall in the 1600s ' . ”
Ahmed said British television still perceived diversity as a “ frill or an added extra ” and that if it is not addressed immediately , it would create more divisions across the country .
… He added : “ If we do n't step up and tell a representative story … we are going to start losing British teenagers to the story that the next chapter in their lives is written with Isis in Syria. ” … Ahmed called on the government to act , particularly to overturn the unconscious bias in hiring that was preventing talented people from black , Asian and minority backgrounds rising up the ranks . He said public money should be tied to representation targets for broadcasters to break the cycle of top jobs going mainly to white men .
That bastard Shakespeare . Immediately ! Look how Daniel Day-Lewis gets all the good roles .
He 's always going on about how he was a discriminated-against Irishman .
But his dad was Poet Laureate of England and his mom 's dad owned a big movie studio .
That impudent dog .
He needs a good beheading to teach him submission .
Then I could star in Lincoln 2 .
On English TV , of course , not for Spielberg .
I only want to be on English TV . It 's your fault that I 'm contracted to do Star Wars movies through 2031 .

BENGALURU : Wipro 's billionaire chairman Azim Premji , the first Indian to sign the Giving Pledge , has set aside more than half of his wealth for charity by allocating an additional 18 % stake in the company to fund philanthropy.Premji , who will turn 70 this month , controls a 73.39 % stake in India 's third-largest software company , which is worth about Rs 99,500 crore ( $ 15.7 billion ) . In Wipro 's annual report for the year ended March 2015 , Premji said he has now allocated the equivalent of 39 % of the company 's shares to a trust focussed on philanthropic initiatives , mainly primary education . The additional 18 % stake forms the latest tranche of shares Premji has allocated for charity.Premji , who will turn 70 this month , controls a 73.39 % stake in India 's third-largest software company , which is worth about Rs 99,500 crore ( $ 15.7 billion ) . In Wipro 's annual report for the year ended March 2015 , Premji said he has now allocated the equivalent of 39 % of the company 's shares to a trust focussed on philanthropic initiatives , mainly primary education . The additional 18 % stake forms the latest tranche of shares Premji has allocated for charity.The Giving Pledge is an effort to invite the world 's wealthiest individuals and families to commit half of their wealth to philanthropic causes and charitable organisations . In his pledge in 2013 , Premji said he believes that those who are privileged to have wealth should contribute significantly to try and create a better world for the millions who are far less privileged . `` Over the past 15 years , I have tried to put this belief into action through my personal philanthropic work . Over these years , I have irrevocably transferred a significant part of the shareholding in Wipro , amounting to 39 % of the shares of Wipro , to a trust ( of which ownership of 21.14 % was transferred and for the balance , the trust is entitled to the beneficial interest of dividends and sale proceeds ) , '' Premji wrote in a letter to shareholders.People close to Premji said he has been quietly and steadily been transferring wealth to fund philanthropy . `` Apart from the Tata Trust , nothing comes close to the commitment made by him on this front , '' said a person who knows him well . `` And now , he has two engines to carry on philanthropy—the Azim Premji Foundation , and the newly formed Philanthropic Initiatives formed to making grants to NGOs . `` Last year , Premji hired Amnesty India head G Anantha Padmanabhan to build an organisation that will offer grants to external agencies . `` The new initiative of making grants to NGOs has just started under what we call Philanthropic Initiatives . We are continuing to look at various areas , e.g. , nutrition , water — the only area that we have decided on is support to NGOs working with the most vulnerable people — eg , street children , urban homeless , teenage girls from disadvantaged communities , women at risk of violence , '' said Anurag Behar , CEO of Azim Premji Foundation and vice-chancellor of Azim Premji University .
Gov . Jerry Brown has repeatedly said that the state has gone as far as it can to release low-level offenders and reduce crowding at the prisons , and that it is providing adequate medical care for inmates . But last month , a federal judge criticized the system for allowing potentially lethal valley fever to spread through two jails in Central Valley and ordered the state to move 2,600 inmates at risk of catching the disease .
A small group of inmates in solitary confinement at the maximum-security Pelican Bay State Prison , in a remote area near the Oregon border , called for the protest months ago . They have complained that inmates are being held in isolation indefinitely for having ties to prison gangs . Some have been held for decades without phone calls , access to rehabilitation programs or time outdoors .
Ten inmates at High Desert State Prison in Northern California began their own hunger strike last week and were being monitored by medical staff for signs of distress , officials said . Their demands , made in a letter , include cleaner prison facilities , better food and more access to the prison library . Prisoners at several other facilities also issued demand letters , which were displayed on a Web site supporting the strikers .
The organizers timed the protest to coincide with the start of Ramadan , the Muslim month of fasting , which began this week ; state officials said that would make it more complicated to determine how many prisoners were fasting out of religious obligation rather than in protest .
Prison officials said the protests had not caused any major disruptions .
“ These actions have been talked about for months , ” said Jeffrey Callison , a spokesman for the corrections department . “ We have been preparing to make sure that the rules are enforced consistently . ”
After the protests two years ago , corrections officials promised to use new criteria in placing inmates in solitary confinement and to create a process by which inmates could get out of isolation . Corrections officials say that of 382 inmates who have been screened , roughly half have qualified to return to the general population . But about 10,000 inmates remain in solitary confinement units .
Carol Strickman , a lawyer with Legal Services for Prisoners With Children who negotiated on behalf of inmates during the last hunger strike , said allies of the inmates had no way of verifying how many were taking part this time . During the last strike , officials prohibited participants from communicating with family and friends .
“ Officials have this bunker mentality , but now it 's like a house of cards is falling down , ” Ms. Strickman said . “ There have been so many problems for decades , and now they are being forced to deal with them all at once . ”

While the UN has described the latest atrocities in Myanmar on the Rohingya minority as textbook ethnic cleansing , the international reaction of shaming Aung San Suu Kyi for the Rohingya crisis is unhelpful to all parties . ASEAN should consider coordinating action to help Myanmar overcome the complex problem .
By Kang Siew Kheng *
In 1991 , the international community honoured Ms Aung San Suu Kyi with the Nobel Peace Prize while she was under house arrest . In 2015 , her party , the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , won power on a popular electoral mandate . Then , practically overnight , Ms Suu Kyi went from democracy icon to international pariah .
On 4 October 2017 , the City of Oxford , where she studied as an undergraduate , decided to withdraw an honorary title it bestowed on her in 1997 . This growing disillusionment comes from the sense that Ms Suu Kyi has been too silent too long on the Rohingya issue and not virulent enough when she finally spoke .
Competing Narratives
The scale of the humanitarian disaster is disturbing and haunting . The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has condemned the outbreak of violence in Myanmar that triggered the latest outflow of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh as “ textbook example of ethnic cleansing ” . Human rights advocates , however , seem to be engaged in a campaign to disparage Ms Suu Kyi and Myanmar .
The New Yorker named her “ the ignoble laureate ” ; Amnesty International accused her of “ untruths.and victim blaming ” . No less an icon than Desmond Tutu reportedly wrote her that “ If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence , the price is surely too steep ” .
Yet , against the backdrop of media images of what is an ongoing , overnight , crisis , the international community can not summarily dismiss Ms Suu Kyi 's counter-narrative of an “ iceberg of misinformation ” or the wider dispute about ground realities .
One story that has emerged in Myanmar social media is that the attacks on the military posts on 25 August 2017 by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army ( ARSA ) was timed to provoke precisely the kind of the harshest possible response from the Tatmadaw military ; the attacks came on the day before the release of the Report by Advisory Commission of Rakhine State .
According to this narrative , they were calculated to doom any prospects in the effort , commissioned by Ms Suu Kyi , to map “ a peaceful , fair and prosperous future for the people of Rakhine ” . For sure , no deemed past wrongs in history can justify present-day violence , but no present-day policy can bring about reconciliation until the old animosities have been addressed .
Complex and Complicated
The Rakhine situation is too complex for megaphone moral outrage . It is a particularly instructive example of bad communal dynamics , rooted in British colonial divide-and-rule strategy , reinforced by generations of politics and complicated by continuing poverty and economic deprivation that affect both the Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine .
It is easy to forget that Ms Suu Kyi 's NLD was elected to power in 2015 amid a growing tide of nationalism and communal mistrust . Ironically democracy unleashed deep-seated grievances that were more restrained by the iron hand of military rule .
Many of Ms Suu Kyi 's electoral base regard the Rohingya as a late political construct , that many of them were transient migrants on a porous and troublesome border , and were now being used to legitimise old claims for greater autonomy and independence . Significantly , in Rakhine State , the NLD did not perform as well as it largely did in the rest of the country .
Impact of Public Shaming
The international reaction to lambast Ms Suu Kyi and Myanmar is unhelpful to all parties . First , what passes for international moral outrage makes the Myanmar angrily defensive . It serves only to dull the voices of those in Myanmar that are against demonisation of a minority . Instead , it feeds the ultra-nationalist rhetoric that a democratic Myanmar faces an existentialist crisis , which Ms Suu Kyi and her party are ill-disposed to address .
Second , the end of decades of isolation and sanctions has fanned expectations of the economic boom promised by democratic rule . But there are now signs that Myanmar 's economic growth has slowed . Reform has also been slow , not least because Ms Suu Kyi was trying to do too much in too little time . If international opprobrium ends in politically-motivated moves like re-sanctions , it could derail the already very late catch-up in a country that remains one of the poorest in ASEAN .
Third , Ms Suu Kyi has the unenviable task of leading with one hand tied , not possessing all the levers of power , as even her worst critics know . Ultimately her democratically-elected government must find a modus operandi with the military leaders . She needs all the help she can get , inside or outside Myanmar .
Administering a country faced with a multitude of challenges while bringing about national reconciliation is statecraft . It requires political savviness and immense energy for protracted negotiations in a country with a history of communal uprisings that involve not only the Rohingya .
A Role for ASEAN
ASEAN finally issued a predictably anodyne Chair statement on the Rakhine situation following an ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York . Not unexpectedly , Malaysia disassociated itself from the statement . Kuala Lumpur , in early 2017 , had hosted a special session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) that issued a strong rebuke to the Myanmar government . Malaysia is , after all , host to nearly 60,000 UN-registered Rohingya refugees .
Yet , ASEAN must acknowledge that the Rohingya is no longer just a domestic problem , but has important implications for regional peace and stability . Left alone , the Rohingya will continue to be a festering wound and destabilise the entire operating environment and regional order in ASEAN .
ASEAN 's dialogue partner , India , is already threatening to deport its Rohingya refugees on the grounds of growing security concerns . Even if one doubts the hand of terrorist elements using the Rohingya as shield , the chaos and scale of humanitarian disaster is fertile ground for radicalisation and recruitment , which is something all ASEAN countries must be concerned about .
Time for Coordinated Action
It is time for ASEAN to consider a coordinated course of action , and perhaps work with vested dialogue partners like China and India , which can also engage Bangladesh . Myanmar needs a regional solution . ASEAN would do well to engage in the kind of quiet diplomacy it is best equipped to do , across the spectrum of relations , including military diplomacy .
The Myanmar who only see the Rohingya as a political construct must eventually get past the prison of history , be persuaded to put behind real and perceived historical injustices , and acknowledge the ground realities of generations of people who call Myanmar home .
Yet this conversation can not happen with the world heaping such derision on , and threats of new economic sanctions against , Myanmar and its popularly elected leader . ASEAN can work to counter the potential international isolation of Myanmar that helps neither Myanmar nor the Rohingya .

Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday attacked Bharatiya Janata Party 's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi at a rally in Bihar 's Kishanganj district .
Without naming the Gujarat chief minister directly , she claimed that some people were trying to harm the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi by dividing the nation .
`` Some people are trying to harm his ideals ( vichar ) . It is dangerous , '' Gandhi said in her speech during a public rally after laying down the foundation stone of a branch of the Aligarh Muslim University .
” We have to fulfill the dream of Mahatma Gandhi , who stood for a united and plural India , ” said Gandhi .
“ Those against the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi are trying to divide the people and society but that will not help the country . Such people only want to grab power and the chair at any cost , '' she said
“ The Congress stands for secularism and a composite culture , ” said the United Progressive Alliance chairperson .
`` We work for all sections of society -- Dalits , minorities , women and weaker sections . Our goal is inclusive development , '' she said .
She reminded people that the Congress-led UPA government had introduced the Right To Information Act to encourage the fight against corruption , as well as other flagship welfare measures such as the Food Security Bill Act , the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan .
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also attended the foundation stone-laying ceremony in Kishanganj , nearly 400 km from Patna .

Like the last time people tried busing as a solution to a socioeconomic problem , the tech busing in San Francisco has become a hot-button topic .
The Google buses , described as “ spaceships ” containing “ alien overlords ” by writer Rebecca Solnit , have become potent symbols for income inequality within the city . Beyond the transportation issues , they are now symbolic of other unwanted repercussions of the tech boom , including rising housing costs , Ellis Act evictions and a “ let them eat cake ” mentality very publicly exhibited by many tech-employed , Bay Area newcomers .
Reading articles about Google using a yacht to ferry its employees across the Bay , or hiring security guards for its commuter buses , evokes a not-so-distant dystopic future .
Thus , the city of San Francisco , which currently lets the commuter buses use MUNI stops free of charge , is scrambling desperately for a compromise . Tomorrow the seven SFMTA board directors will vote on a proposal for shared use of the bus stops . And in preparation for tomorrow 's board meeting , the Transportation Team at Google sent the following memo to its SF employees :
[ Misc-sf ] Next week 's public hearing on shuttle regulations Transportation Team XXXXX @ google.com Fri , Jan 17 , 2014 at 11:35 AM Bcc : XXXX @ google.com
IF YOU DO N'T RIDE THE SHUTTLE TO/FROM SF , YOU CAN STOP READING NOW . Dear Shuttle Riders , This Tuesday ( 1/21 ) , the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency ( SFMTA ) Board will meet to vote on the proposed shuttle regulations we told you about last week . The hearing will take place on January 21 at 1pm PT at San Francisco City Hall ( room 400 ) . While we recognized that many of you wo n't be able to make it during the workday , we encourage any interested Googlers who live in San Francisco to speak in favor of the proposal ( please RSVP here if you are planning to attend ) . While you are not required to state where you work , you may confirm that Google is your employer if you are so inclined . If you do choose to speak in favor of the proposal we thought you might appreciate some guidance on what to say . Feel free to add your own style and opinion . * I am so proud to live in San Francisco and be a part of this community
* I support local and small businesses in my neighborhood on a regular basis
* My shuttle empowers my colleagues and I to reduce our carbon emissions by removing cars from the road
* If the shuttle program did n't exist , I would continue to live in San Francisco and drive to work on the peninsula
* I am a shuttle rider , SF resident , and I volunteer at… ..
* Because of the above , I urge the Board to adopt this pilot as a reasonable step in the right direction
You can read the full press release announcing the proposal here , and we 'll keep you updated in the coming weeks as the proposal moves towards approval . Feel free to email us at transport @ google.com with any questions .
Thanks , XXXX , on behalf of the Transportation Team
The missive was then forwarded to Heart of the City , the activist organization who organized the faux Google bus performance at SF Pride and the first Google bus blockade on Dec. 9 ( though not the subsequent one in Oakland that turned violent ) . They sent it to us , and we verified it through a second source . Google has still not returned our request for confirmation .
In the email , Googlers are given boilerplate talking points to take to the board meeting , including “ If the shuttle program did n't exist , I would continue to live in San Francisco and drive to work on the peninsula . ”
It 's notable that a Google employee actually points out the heavy-handedness of the memo on the thread , mentioning that this would look bad for Google if leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle or Valleywag .
“ Am I being too paranoid ? ” the employee asked . No .
This message comes off a bit high handed and I do n't think it would be good if it showed up on the front page of the chron or valleywag . Or am I being too paranoid ? XXXX

“ They 're urging their employees to say they would drive if not for the shuttle program to keep the ‘ eco-friendly ' excuse alive and continue using SF 's tax-payer funded bus stops for virtually nothing , ” a representative from Heart of the City wrote in response to the memo . “ [ According to an SFMTA survey ] 31 % said they would n't be able to make the trip at all , which implies over 5200 people would choose to live closer to their work in Silicon Valley . ”
The survey did not include the option “ Quit Google and join an SF-based startup . ”
If voted through tomorrow , the 18-month Shuttle Partners Program pilot would mean the creation of around 200 legal commuter shuttle stops , according to the SFMTA , and charge the commuter buses $ 1 per stop , a fee that would not result in any profit for the SFMTA ( though the $ 1.5 million raised would cover the cost of the program ) .
Raising the fee to the total fines accrued for using the stops illegally or implementing a tax to bring in meaningful revenue for SFMTA , as activists propose , may require voter approval , according to SFMTA Director Ed Reiskin . Heart Of the City estimates that if the SFMTA decided to implement the $ 271 fine for each time the commuter shuttles used the stops illegally , it would add up to approximately $ 1 billion dollars .
Busing is just one element of a perfect storm brewing in San Francisco — tech workers vs. the rest of the city — where proponents of the free market come head to head with people unhappy with the loopholes in that market , i.e . the millions in tax breaks offered to tech companies like Twitter or the Ellis Act . The activist argument is that if tech companies do n't have to pay taxes ( or fines ) , they should somehow be responsible for protecting the community in other ways .
While it is a perfect storm , there is no perfect solution for the problems caused by the tech boom and no straightforward explanation as to how the busing affects the real estate crisis , though every resident has an opinion on it — usually emotionally charged . Here is a particularly nuanced one on Quora .
Should corporations feel a fiscal responsibility to a community if they 're leaning on public infrastructure — like public bus stops — to accumulate their cash piles ? My views are my own here ( not TechCrunch 's ) , and I think so , though the issue is too complex to fully dissect in this post about a leaked email .
Perhaps Google should build a Google.org focusing only on Bay Area municipal issues ? What I do know is that Google , instead of canned talking points , should be sending their employees links to both sides of the debate and increasing awareness instead of acting vaguely like Big Brother .

China already has the largest gaming market on the planet , but most of that is on PC and smartphones — especially since the country banned consoles for 15 years . Now , the television screen is about to get in on the action .
By 2020 , 21.5 million people in China will play games on their television screen using a console , an over-the-top box , or app-enabled “ smart ” TV , according to research firm Niko Partners . In 2015 , only 7.8 million people played games on their TV . Niko is predicting a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 22.3 percent over the next half decade , which would represent an enormous surge in spending . Last year , China surpassed the United States and Japan as the top gaming market with $ 21.2 billion in game-related revenues , according to intelligence company Newzoo . And the growing console and TV space could benefit already massive entities like Tencent even more .
The biggest thing that TV gaming will bring to China is a significant new avenue for spending . Niko notes that spending on TV-based console , OTT boxes , and smart TV games only amounted to $ 196.9 million last year . But the firm predicts that a 41 percent CAGR should lead to $ 1.1 billion in TV-game spending in China by 2020 .
Fueling this growth is the introduction of two microconsoles from top Chinese companies . Tencent launched its TGP box , which is a Windows 10 computer running on Intel hardware . It runs popular free-to-play games like soccer sim FIFA Online 3 , role-playing adventure Monster Hunter Online , and Tencent 's own League of Legends MOBA . The other new device is the Tomahawk F1 from Fuze . It is an Android-based microconsole similar to the Ouya that has lifted the look and interface of a PlayStation 4 . It comes with a controller that has lifted the design of an Xbox One gamepad . Like with the TGP , Fuze is promising to support a number of popular free-to-play PC games and more .
The goal for the Tomahawk and the TGP , according to Niko Partners founder and manager Lisa Cosmas Hanson , is to offer an audience that is getting into gaming because of their smartphones a way to get in on some of the bigger traditional games .
“ These consoles are based on Android but unlike any other Android-based TV-box , they have a strong focus and investment on midcore and hardcore titles and have price points lower than Xbox One and PS4 , ” said Hanson . “ They also will offer many more titles than have been approved so far for Xbox One and PS4 . ”
As for Sony and Microsoft , the growth of TV gaming in China is potentially huge — although competing against companies like Tencent might mean that potential is never realized . The PlayStation 4 has already outsold the Xbox One four-to-one in that country because it has a lower price point . Additionally , the Chinese government , which has to approve all foreign games , has given the thumbs up to more PS4 releases than Xbox One launches .
Fuze and Tencent , however , are going to nullify the PS4 's advantages . The Tomahawk and the TGP are both less expensive than Sony 's or Microsoft 's systems . The Tomahawk , for example , is about $ 140 . The PS4 sells for closer to $ 475 . On top of the price difference , Tencent and Fuze are going to have a much easier time getting games approved .
So as China finally starts turning to the television for its gaming needs , do n't expect that market and that revenue to turn into anything too significant for outside companies .
Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J . McCollum , whose scoring average jumped from 6.8 points per game during the 2014-15 season to 20.8 points this season , was named the NBA 's Most Improved Player on Friday .
McCollum , in his third season since being selected with the 10th overall pick of the 2013 draft , received 101 first-place votes and 559 points in balloting among sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the U.S. and Canada .
`` In my mind I always felt like I was a good player , so when you hear 'most improved ' you think , he was sorry , and he got better , '' McCollum said Friday . `` But now I understand that it comes from hard work . It 's based on perception , not having played , not having the body of work to show for it . ''
C.J . McCollum set career highs this season for points ( 20.8 ) , field goal percentage ( 44.8 ) , 3-point field goal percentage ( 41.7 ) , assists ( 4.3 ) and rebounds ( 3.2 ) . Sam Forencich/NBAE/Getty Images
Charlotte 's Kemba Walker was second with 166 points , while Milwaukee 's Giannis Antetokounmpo ( 99 ) was third .
Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors received seven first-place votes and was fourth in the voting for the award , which is given to honor an up-and-coming player who has dramatically improved from the previous season . According to ESPN Stats & Information , Curry is the first reigning MVP to finish in the top 10 in voting for this award the following season ( voting data became available in 1995-96 ) .
In addition to his scoring average , McCollum also set career highs for field goal percentage ( 44.8 ) , 3-point field goal percentage ( 41.7 ) , assists ( 4.3 ) and rebounds ( 3.2 ) . He is the third Portland player to have won the award , joining Kevin Duckworth ( 1987-88 ) and Zach Randolph ( 2003-04 ) .
`` A lot of great players have received it , Jimmy Butler being one of the most recent . Kevin Love , Z-Bo , Duckworth , among many others , '' McCollum said . `` Hopefully I can continue to trend upward like those guys did . ''
McCollum bided his time on the bench for his first two seasons while the Blazers had a starting lineup that featured LaMarcus Aldridge , Damian Lillard , Wesley Matthews , Nicolas Batum and Robin Lopez .
But a mass exodus last summer left Lillard as the only returning starter , and McCollum got his chance in the Blazers ' backcourt .
`` I 've felt like I 've been a good player , it 's just circumstances , '' McCollum said . `` I think there are a lot of good players in the NBA who are in a box . Maybe they 've got a lot of veterans in front of them , maybe they 're hurt , maybe the coach just does n't like to play young players . For me it was injuries , it was being a lottery pick drafted to a 50-win team . ''
His 14-point improvement is the most since Tony Campbell improved from an average of 6.2 points to 23.2 points from the 1988-89 to 1989-90 seasons .
`` This is n't the last award he 's going to get in his long career , '' Portland general manager Neil Olshey said .
With one of the youngest rosters in the league ( 24.6 years ) , the Blazers were considered to be in rebuilding mode . But Portland overachieved to earn the fifth seed in the West and a first-round playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers .
The Blazers are down 0-2 to the Clippers , but now get to return home for Game 3 on Saturday night .

cityscape What Toronto Can Learn from Montreal 's Green Laneways
More than 69 kilometers of laneways have been transformed by benches , bike parking and flower beds . If connected , they would be almost as long as the Montreal Metro
Public Works looks at public space , urban design , and city-building innovations from around the world , and considers what Toronto might learn from them
As Toronto investigates the possibilities of laneway housing , Montreal is already a leader in another approach to encouraging creative uses of the spaces behind and between buildings .
If you turn down any alleyway in a residential neighbourhood of Montreal , you may find potted plants , strategically-placed seating , and perhaps a sign saying “ ruelle verte. ” There are 346 of these “ green laneways ” throughout the city .
According to Regroupement des éco-quartiers , an umbrella organization for neighbourhood-based environmental initiatives , there are several defining features of a ruelle verte . First , it 's a community-driven endeavour led by a committee of people living or working near a laneway . Second , changes to a laneway aim to improve environmental conditions but also introduce opportunities for neighbours to come together .
To date , 69 kilometres of laneways have been transformed by benches , bike parking , and flower beds in 11 of the city 's 19 boroughs . If connected , these green laneways would be almost as long as the Montreal Metro . But with 475 kilometres of laneways in the city , there 's ample room for other residents to adopt the approach . The same could be said of Toronto , where 2,400 laneways span 300 kilometres .
The Laneway Project is a social enterprise focused on transforming Toronto 's laneways . Co-founder and director Michelle Senayah says greening laneways “ seems like an obvious opportunity . ”
Toronto 's laneways are concentrated in older parts of the city , where they facilitated deliveries by horse and cart , as well as other service functions . Research by the Laneway Project and other groups suggests that these areas are often underserved by parks compared to other parts of the city . Senayah explains : “ When you look at where laneways are and where parks are , there 's actually something of an inverse relationship . ”
In this context , laneways can play a role both environmentally and socially . The Laneway Project has produced a guide to greening laneways , which outlines several strategies to introduce plants of all shapes and sizes between garages or behind stores .
From an environmental perspective , small changes to laneways can enhance biodiversity and reduce the urban heat island effect . Representing approximately 200,000 square metres of paved surfaces , laneways can also be adapted to improve storm water management . Senayah describes the Laneway Project 's puncture demonstration as “ a meter-wide ribbon of green. ” The permeable pavers not only reduce runoff but also add playful patterns to areas that are often overlooked .
Socially , laneways are an opportunity for neighbours to come together and take responsibility for shared spaces . This approach is central to the success of Montreal 's ruelles vertes , where local committees manage each laneway .
The borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie has the most extensive network of ruelles vertes in the city . Since 2011 , 98 laneways have been transformed into gathering places that incorporate countless container gardens , 50-plus murals , and two dozen benches .
According to Senayah , neighbourhood involvement is “ how these projects live beyond their installation. ” From making sure seating is in good shape to weeding raised beds , care and attention on the part of people who pass through laneways on a daily basis is essential .
As experiences from Montreal show , residents can turn local knowledge into site-specific solutions that lower the ambient temperature , welcome urban wildlife , provide a canvas for artists and invite neighbours to get to know one another .
In Toronto , the potential to turn laneways into green spaces is all the more pressing because our back alleys may soon become the front yards of a new generation of secondary suites .
WASHINGTON -- Justices on the Supreme Court seemed to struggle Tuesday with the question of whether a private company can get out of a federal law by citing the religious beliefs of its shareholders .
Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , a Christian-owned crafts supply chain , and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. , owned by Mennonite Christians , are challenging the provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires for-profit companies to include all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives in their health insurance plans .
Hobby Lobby 's attorneys argue that the law violates the company 's constitutional right to religious freedom by forcing it to cover all forms of birth control or pay steep fines . The company 's owners are morally opposed to intrauterine devices and emergency contraception , believing it to be a form of abortion , though medical studies have debunked that claim .
The contraception mandate does include exceptions for churches and special accommodation for religiously affiliated nonprofits , such as schools and hospitals . But for-profit corporations are required to cover the full range of women 's preventative care , including birth control , intrauterine devices and emergency contraception , at no cost to their female employees .
At oral arguments on Tuesday , the women justices were the most aggressive in their questioning of Hobby Lobby 's lawyer , former Solicitor General Paul D. Clement . Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan asked whether other companies should be allowed to refuse to cover other procedures , like blood transfusions and vaccines , if employers had a religious objection to such medical treatments .
`` There are quite a number of medical treatments that could be religiously objected to , '' Kagan stated . `` Everything would be piecemeal , nothing would be uniform . ''
Kagan also suggested that corporations could challenge other federal laws , like minimum wage and family leave requirements and protections against child labor , based on their religious beliefs .
But Clement said such a `` parade of horribles '' would not actually come before a court , and no company had challenged a minimum wage law , for example , based on religious considerations .
Justice Anthony Kennedy , who many expect to be the swing vote in this case , questioned both sides aggressively . Kennedy asked Clement why the company could n't just choose not to provide health insurance at all , pay a tax and then raise salaries to allow employees to purchase health care on their own . Assuming that would be a financial `` wash , '' Kennedy asked Clement , `` Then what would your case be ? ''
`` How would we consider the rights of employees ? '' Kennedy asked . `` The employees may not believe … in the religious beliefs of the employer . ''
Justice Antonin Scalia alternatively asked why the government could n't simply pay for the `` three or four '' kinds of birth control that some religious employers consider to be `` abortifacients '' -- namely , the morning-after pill and intrauterine devices . `` That 's not terribly expensive , is it ? '' he asked .
The administration 's attorney , Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. , said federal and state laws `` do n't consider these particular forms of contraception to be abortion . '' He said the government respected different beliefs on the subject , but noted that some 2 million women who take those forms of birth control do n't believe they are `` engaged in abortion . ''
Kennedy also questioned Verrilli as to why the Department of Health and Human Services had granted accommodations on the contraception coverage rule -- but not other parts of the Affordable Care Act -- to religiously affiliated nonprofits if the government had a compelling interest in providing birth control coverage to all women .
`` It must have been because the health care coverage was not that important , '' Kennedy said .
Some justices also asked whether for-profit corporations had the right to claim religious freedom exemptions to any federal laws .
`` How does a corporation exercise religion ? '' Sotomayor asked .
Justice Samuel Alito proposed a hypothetical of whether a Jewish or Muslim butcher would be able to provide kosher or halal meats , if the butcher 's shop was formed as a corporation and Congress outlawed such techniques as a form of animal cruelty .
Verrilli said that in that case , individual customers would have standing to challenge the law , and the butcher might be able to step in in order to argue on their behalf .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it would have been `` strange '' for a large bipartisan part of Congress to pass a piece of legislation , the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , if they believed it would allow for-profit companies to be exempt from federal laws because of the religious beliefs of their shareholders . She pointed out that an amendment along those lines was rejected by the Senate .
If Hobby Lobby wins and the Supreme Court eventually rules that companies have a right to exercise religious freedom that exempts them from complying with federal law , the decision could have a far-reaching impact beyond women 's health . For instance , such a ruling could open the door to more controversial laws like Arizona 's recently debated `` religious freedom '' bill , which would allow businesses to refuse to serve LGBT people .
As Kagan suggested Tuesday and as Verrilli wrote in a brief he filed on the case this month , the ruling also has the potential to get businesses out of having to comply with minimum wage and hiring discrimination laws , Social Security taxes and vaccination requirements .
`` Allowing a corporation , through either shareholder vote or board resolution , to take on and assert the religious beliefs of its shareholders in order to avoid having to comply with a generally-applicable law with a secular purpose is fundamentally at odds with the entire concept of incorporation , '' Verrilli argued in the brief .
This time around , Kennedy potentially could return to his common role as the court 's swing vote . Kennedy wrote the broad opinion in the Citizens United case , which found that the First Amendment prevented the government from limiting independent expenditures by corporations , but he 's also been one of the court 's strongest voices for gay rights , which could be negatively impacted if Hobby Lobby gets its way .

In other words , the best friend of John Podesta , Clinton 's Campaign char , at the DOJ will be in charge of a probe that could potentially sink Hillary Clinton .
For those who missed it , this is what we reported previously :
The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October , John Podesta , Hillary 's campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends , including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs .
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta , Kadzik , superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures . The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23 , 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti , a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother , Tony Podesta . In it , Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto , a Washington D.C. restaurant . The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening , just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee .
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta 's home , another email shows . Another email sent on May 5 , 2015 , Kadzik 's son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign . – READ MORE

More about the NSA 's XKEYSCORE
I 've been reading through the 48 classified documents about the NSA 's XKEYSCORE system released by the Intercept last week . From the article :
The NSA 's XKEYSCORE program , first revealed by The Guardian , sweeps up countless people 's Internet searches , emails , documents , usernames and passwords , and other private communications . XKEYSCORE is fed a constant flow of Internet traffic from fiber optic cables that make up the backbone of the world 's communication network , among other sources , for processing . As of 2008 , the surveillance system boasted approximately 150 field sites in the United States , Mexico , Brazil , United Kingdom , Spain , Russia , Nigeria , Somalia , Pakistan , Japan , Australia , as well as many other countries , consisting of over 700 servers . These servers store `` full-take data '' at the collection sites -- meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected -- and , as of 2009 , stored content for 3 to 5 days and metadata for 30 to 45 days . NSA documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database . `` It is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world , '' an NSA briefing on XKEYSCORE says . `` At field sites , XKEYSCORE can run on multiple computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage . ''
There seems to be no access controls at all restricting how analysts can use XKEYSCORE . Standing queries -- called `` workflows '' -- and new fingerprints have an approval process , presumably for load issues , but individual queries are not approved beforehand but may be audited after the fact . These are things which are supposed to be low latency , and you ca n't have an approval process for low latency analyst queries . Since a query can get at the recorded raw data , a single query is effectively a retrospective wiretap .
All this means that the Intercept is correct when it writes :
These facts bolster one of Snowden 's most controversial statements , made in his first video interview published by The Guardian on June 9 , 2013 . `` I , sitting at my desk , '' said Snowden , could `` wiretap anyone , from you or your accountant , to a federal judge to even the president , if I had a personal email . ''
You 'll only get the data if it 's in the NSA 's databases , but if it is there you 'll get it .
Honestly , there 's not much in these documents that 's a surprise to anyone who studied the 2013 XKEYSCORE leaks and knows what can be done with a highly customizable Intrusion Detection System . But it 's always interesting to read the details .
One document -- `` Intro to Context Sensitive Scanning with X-KEYSCORE Fingerprints ( 2010 ) -- talks about some of the queries an analyst can run . A sample scenario : `` I want to look for people using Mojahedeen Secrets encryption from an iPhone '' ( page 6 ) .
Mujahedeen Secrets is an encryption program written by al Qaeda supporters . It has been around since 2007 . Last year , Stuart Baker cited its increased use as evidence that Snowden harmed America . I thought the opposite , that the NSA benefits from al Qaeda using this program . I wrote : `` There 's nothing that screams 'hack me ' more than using specially designed al Qaeda encryption software . ''
And now we see how it 's done . In the document , we read about the specific XKEYSCORE queries an analyst can use to search for traffic encrypted by Mujahedeen Secrets . Here are some of the program 's fingerprints ( page 10 ) :
encryption/mojahaden2
encryption/mojahaden2/encodedheader
encryption/mojahaden2/hidden
encryption/mojahaden2/hidden2
encryption/mojahaden2/hidden44
encryption/mojahaden2/secure_file_cendode
encryption/mojahaden2/securefile
So if you want to search for all iPhone users of Mujahedeen Secrets ( page 33 ) :
fingerprint ( 'demo/scenario4 ' ) = fingerprint ( 'encryption/mojahdeen2 ' and fingerprint ( 'browser/cellphone/iphone ' )
Or you can search for the program 's use in the encrypted text , because ( page 37 ) : `` ... many of the CT Targets are now smart enough not to leave the Mojahedeen Secrets header in the E-mails they send . How can we detect that the E-mail ( which looks like junk ) is in fact Mojahedeen Secrets encrypted text . '' Summary of the answer : there are lots of ways to detect the use of this program that users ca n't detect . And you can combine the use of Mujahedeen Secrets with other identifiers to find targets . For example , you can specifically search for the program 's use in extremist forums ( page 9 ) . ( Note that the NSA wrote that comment about Mujahedeen Secrets users increasing their opsec in 2010 , two years before Snowden supposedly told them that the NSA was listening on their communications . Honestly , I would not be surprised if the program turned out to have been a US operation to get Islamic radicals to make their traffic stand out more easily . )
It 's not just Mujahedeen Secrets . Nicholas Weaver explains how you can use XKEYSCORE to identify co-conspirators who are all using PGP .
And these searches are just one example . Other examples from the documents include :
`` Targets using mail.ru from a behind a large Iranian proxy '' ( here , page 7 ) .
Usernames and passwords of people visiting gov.ir ( here , page 26 and following ) .
People in Pakistan visiting certain German-language message boards ( here , page 1 ) .
HTTP POST traffic from Russia in the middle of the night -- useful for finding people trying to steal our data ( here , page 16 ) .
People doing web searches on jihadist topics from Kabul ( here ) .
E-mails , chats , web-browsing traffic , pictures , documents , voice calls , webcam photos , web searches , advertising analytics traffic , social media traffic , botnet traffic , logged keystrokes , file uploads to online services , Skype sessions and more : if you can figure out how to form the query , you can ask XKEYSCORE for it . For an example of how complex the searches can be , look at this XKEYSCORE query published in March , showing how New Zealand used the system to spy on the World Trade Organization : automatically track any email body with any particular WTO-related content for the upcoming election . ( Good new documents to read include this , this , and this . )
I always read these NSA documents with an assumption that other countries are doing the same thing . The NSA is not made of magic , and XKEYSCORE is not some super-advanced NSA-only technology . It is the same sort of thing that every other country would use with its surveillance data . For example , Russia explicitly requires ISPs to install similar monitors as part of its SORM Internet surveillance system . As a home user , you can build your own XKEYSCORE using the public-domain Bro Security Monitor and the related Network Time Machine attached to a back-end data-storage system . ( Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory uses this system to store three months ' worth of Internet traffic for retrospective surveillance -- it used the data to study Heartbleed . ) The primary advantage the NSA has been that it sees more of the Internet than anyone else , and spends more money to store the data it intercepts for longer than anyone else . And if these documents explain XKEYSCORE in 2009 and 2010 , expect that it 's much more powerful now .
Back to encryption and Mujahedeen Secrets . If you want to stay secure , whether you 're trying to evade surveillance by Russia , China , the NSA , criminals intercepting large amounts of traffic , or anyone else , try not to stand out . Do n't use some homemade specialized cryptography that can be easily identified by a system like this . Use reasonably strong encryption software on a reasonably secure device . If you trust Apple 's claims ( pages 35-6 ) , use iMessage and FaceTime on your iPhone . I really like Moxie Marlinspike 's Signal for both text and voice , but worry that it 's too obvious because it 's still rare . Ubiquitous encryption is the bane of listeners worldwide , and it 's the best thing we can deploy to make the world safer .

WikiLeaks is dumping hundreds of emails from Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman . Now , this new email shows Hillary Clinton trashing African-Americans .
This is outrageous :
“ The main reason behind successful immigration should be painfully obvious to even the most dimwitted of observers : Some groups of people are almost always highly successful given only half a chance ( Jews * , Hindus/Sikhs and Chinese people , for example ) , while others ( Muslims , blacks * * and Roma * * * , for instance ) fare badly almost irrespective of circumstances . ”
Here is the damning email that every African-American voter should see before election day :
BOMBSHELL Racist Hillary Clinton Calls ” Blacks , Muslims and Rom * * * Never Do Wells ” ! ! # PodestaEmails # TrumpTapes pic.twitter.com/7nJL2fZWjz — DEPLORABLE TRUMPCAT ( @ Darren32895836 ) October 8 , 2016
Remember , Hillary Clinton once referred to black gang members as “ super predators ” who need to be “ brought to heel. ” The speeh was part of her support for criminal sentencing reform in the 1990s :
As RCP reported :
During the heat of the Democratic primary she was inturrupted by Black Lives Matter activists demanding an apology for her use of the term . “ Do you want to hear the facts or do you just want to talk ? ” she asked the protesters before they were removed from the building . Bill Clinton was also confronted about the issue in April . He angrily told Black Lives Matter protesters that they “ are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter . ”
These WikiLeaks bombshells are a ticking time bomb , and this is the worst news possible for Hillary Clinton who is counting on overwhelming support from the black community one election day .

“ What the country is now being told by the White House can not be true. ” —Theodore Postol , MIT
WASHINGTON ( April 12 , 2017 ) — A renowned weapons expert and MIT Professor has issued a scathing 14-page report that pushes back against claims made by the Trump administration that the Syrian government used chemical weapons on civilians .
Leading CW expert Theodor Postol of MIT just published a 14-page document questioning WH claims that Sarin was dropped from # Syrian AF plane pic.twitter.com/kMJgxwsN8Z — EHSANI2 ( @ EHSANI22 ) April 12 , 2017
On Tuesday , the White House released a declassified intelligence brief that accused Syrian President Bashar al Assad of deploying military warplanes to drop sarin gas bombs on the town of Khan Shaykhun on April 4 , 2017 .
In reaching its conclusion , the Trump administration relied on “ a wide body of open-source material ” and “ social media accounts ” from the affected areas .
MIT Professor Theodore Postol , who previously worked as a scientific advisor to the Pentagon , reviewed the report and was far from convinced .
“ The report contains absolutely no evidence that this attack was the result of a munition being dropped from an aircraft , ” he wrote .
While there is “ very little doubt ” that “ nerve agent poisoning ” did occur , the source of contamination remains unclear .
According to Postol , evidence provided by the White House “ is more consistent with the possibility that the munition was placed on the ground rather than dropped from a plane . ”

PITTSBURGH , Pa. — Many people like to use comics to discuss science . All over the Internet , you can find articles explaining the physics behind Thor 's hammer or what real-life X-Men might be like . But one teen scientist decided to apply science to comics . Her research probed how women are portrayed in comics . And over time , women in the Marvel comic books are more often portrayed as equal to men , she now demonstrates .
Katherine Murphy , 17 , showed off her findings at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair , a competition created by Society for Science & the Public and sponsored by Intel . The junior at Hicksville Exempted Village High School in Ohio was among some 1700 students from more than 70 countries to present their science fair projects . ( SSP also publishes Science News for Students and this blog ) .
“ I absolutely love comics , ” Katherine says . When she had trouble grasping phonics and phrases in kindergarten , the combination of pictures and words in comic books helped her learn to read . As she grew older , Katherine realized how media such as comic books influence the way people think . “ People who grow up reading comic books absorb things in comic books , ” she explains . “ If the things in the comic books are toxic , such as the way people treat women , then [ readers ] absorb that . ”
So Katherine thought , “ ‘ What if I did a science project about how women are shown in comic books ? ' ” The teen admits “ I 'm not a huge science person . But I like comic books and I am really into women 's rights . ”
Katherine was lucky to live near Bowling Green State University in Ohio . The university has a popular culture library that is full of recordings of TV shows , novels and comic books . So every Sunday , the teen headed there to read comics from Marvel Entertainment , LLC . It 's the brand responsible for the Avengers , Spider-Man , X-Men and more .
A helpful graduate student at Bowling Green randomly picked comic books from Marvel for the teen to read . The earliest was from 1961 ; the latest was from 2014 . Katherine focused on seven different criteria , and ranked each on a scale from one to five . Was a woman on the cover ? How did the female characters look ? Did women in the comic book talk to each other about important issues ? Was the storyline about a woman ? Were women in positions of power ? Did they make their own decisions ? Did they have jobs ?
The maximum score that any one comic could earn was 35 . After reading 788 comics from 68 different Marvel titles , Katherine showed that over time , women have become more powerful , are involved in more important issues and get more cover art . While the average score in the 1960s was 12.2 , by 2014 it had nearly doubled to 22.5 .
Katherine hypothesizes that one reason those scores might be rising could have to do with who is developing and reading these books . “ Marvel has more women writing for it , more women drawing for it and more women reading [ comics ] , ” she explains . Female readers want to see women represented equally , the teen says , so comics publishers have been delivering that .

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the United States provides financial and arms support for terrorist groups thus hindering eradication of terrorism .
AhlulBayt News Agency - Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei , Leader of the Islamic Revolution , in a meeting with Mr. Matteo Renzi , the Prime Minister of Italy , on Tuesday , referred to good relations between the two countries in the past and welcomed further enhancement of bilateral cooperation . Ayatollah Khamenei added that the main problem and the most important weakness with the recent travels by European delegations to Iran was lack of tangible practical results after bilateral negotiations , noting : “ Our view to cooperation with Italy and your government is a different and positive one , and we hope that this visit would serve to bolster this view . ”
Ayatollah Khamenei described Italy 's behavior during years of imposed sanctions against Iran as more logical than certain Western governments , saying : “ The Islamic Republic [ of Iran ] welcomes development of relations with Europe in different fields , particularly with regard to economic cooperation . ”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also stated that the important issue with respect to visits paid to Iran by foreign officials and negotiations with them was the implementation of agreements that are concluded , adding : “ Some European governments and companies have been visiting Iran and have been in talks [ with Iran ] , but the product of these negotiations has not been tangible yet .
“ Some shift the blame for this issue onto the Americans , which such an assessment seems acceptable given their ( Americans ' ) track records and behavior , because even now they are not fulfilling the obligations [ they undertook ] through the nuclear talks [ with Iran ] as they should , and are intimidating other parties into not cooperating with Iran with their remarks and actions , ” noted the Leader of the Islamic Revolution .
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani 's first European visit to Italy in January , saying that Iran holds a positive and optimistic view of Italy . Ayatollah Khamenei added : “ Of course , we do not have this positive view with regard to certain European countries , because they only look at America to act as it dictates to them . ”
Ayatollah Khamenei described the fight on terrorism as another ground for cooperation between the two countries , saying : “ A number of European countries used to support certain violent terrorist groups for a long time , and today , the dangerous and overarching wave of terrorism has reached Europe as well . ”
Ayatollah Khamenei cited the United States ' financial and arms support for terrorist groups as an obstacle to the resolution of the problem of terrorism , adding : “ There is authentic and accurate information about America 's assistance to Daesh and certain other terrorist groups , and even now that they have formed a [ so-called ] anti-Daesh coalition , certain American organs are helping Daesh in a different way . ”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reaffirmed the Italian prime minister 's remarks about “ cultural fight on terrorism along with military and financial fight , ” noting : “ Huge propaganda machines in the world , which are dominated by Western politicians , are spreading Islamophobia under the pretext of [ countering ] actions taken by a bunch of wicked and terrorist [ elements ] , and political conspiracies behind the scenes make the job difficult in cultural campaign [ against terrorism ] . ”
During the meeting , which was also attended by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani , Mr. Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister said : “ In today 's meetings , we talked about important issues , particularly economic issues , and we have to reform and strengthen economic and financial mechanisms . ”
“ Italy is fully determined to respect agreements [ signed with Iran ] and on this basis , we believe that following the nuclear agreement the sanctions against Iran must be lifted , and we are not worried and are determined to act on the basis of our promise , ” Renzi said .
Renzi went on to highlight the spillover of terrorism to Europe , saying that the only way to counter this phenomenon is to uproot terrorist organizations through military means and to cut off their financial resources through selling oil and antiquities . He added : “ Eradication of Daesh is a priority for us and we are happy that we share views with Iran in this regard . ”
The Italian prime minister expressed regret over attempts , which aim to tarnish the image of Islam under the pretext of terrorism , saying : “ Today , when a terrorist act is committed in Europe , some officials condemn Islam instead of condemning terrorism , and for instance , America 's presidential hopeful claims in his election campaign that Islam is to blame for the issue of terrorism ! ”
Mr. Renzi described cultural work as another part of the fight against terrorism , adding : “ We have to show that [ divine ] religions are after peace , dialogue and peaceful coexistence among human beings , and His Excellency 's authority and role as the top leader of the Muslim world is of very high significance in promoting this view . ”

While there was outrage on social media after UFC 195 , the feeling at the FOX Sports 1 post-show desk seemed to be more of confusion Saturday night .
Robbie Lawler beat Carlos Condit in the main event by split decision . That 's the fact . How two of the three Nevada judges came to that conclusion was under scrutiny .
The fight was determined by the third round . Condit pretty clearly won the first and fourth ; Lawler took the second and fifth . Most people had Condit winning the third and that 's where the puzzlement reared its head .
`` A judge is always looking for something different , '' Kenny Florian said on the show . `` Sometimes they 're impressed with flashy techniques . Sometimes it 's the guy who 's moving forward . Sometimes they 're just looking for the big shots , the ones that are landing and have the most impact . It 's really tough to get a hold of what these judges are looking for as a fighter , as a coach . The only thing you can do is just focus on your game plan and going out there and winning round by round the best that you can . ''
Can you imagine an NFL analyst coming onto a wrap-up show after a close game and saying no one truly knows how a team wins a football game ? It 's insane , is n't it ?
What 's crazier is that Florian is absolutely right . And he 's not just an analyst . Florian was a pro fighter for eight years and perennial UFC contender . Now he 's regarded as one of the sharpest minds on MMA television .
Two seats to Florian 's left , UFC welterweight contender Tyron Woodley , who has a good shot at facing Lawler next , did n't provide many answers , either .
`` What about the volume ? '' Woodley sad . `` Carlos Condit landed more punches than Robbie Lawler even threw . Are they judging on damage , power shots or are they judging on actually points landed ? It 's hard to know what they 're judging . ''
Whenever we get a disputed decision like this , we hear words like `` volume '' and `` aggression '' and `` Octagon control '' bandied about . Those are all secondary methods of scoring rounds , at best . Yet we still hear fans and fighters alike using those terms as well as phrases like `` that takedown stole the round . ''
John McCarthy , the godfather of MMA officials and a man who helped pen the unified rules of the sport , teaches in his seminars that judging rounds is done by the following criteria , in descending order : effective striking and effective grappling , ring or cage control , and then effective aggressiveness . Only if the striking and grappling are equal do you then even consider the latter two items .
What defines effective striking ? There 's another misconception . Yes , it is damage . The `` d '' word is never written specifically in the unified rules , because at the time leaders were afraid state athletic commissions would shy away from the sport because of the raw terminology . Effective grappling is defined by significant submission attempts more than position . And if a fighter gets a takedown and does absolutely nothing with it , it 's not supposed to count for anything unless it 's a slam with notable amplitude .
`` What is effective striking ? '' McCarthy said . `` Well , effective striking is strikes that cause damage to the opponent in a way where they are limited in their ability to adjust to , limited in their ability to be offensive off of it and it is affecting their ability to fight effectively against their opponent . That 's what a damaging strike is or effective strike . To sit there and say a fighter is not trying to damage their opponent , it 's not being honest . ''
All of these things seem fairly straightforward . So why do so few fighters know how judges are taught to score fights ? You better believe everyone in the NFL knows a touchdown is six points and a field goal is three .
The fault , to me , lies mostly with the athletic commissions . They 're the ones regulating the proceedings and enforcing the rules . They 're the ones installing judges and referees . They should be way more proactive about informing fighters and coaches how scoring is done .
`` I 'm gon na try to do a better job of that in 2016 , on how these things are scored in California , '' California State Athletic Commission executive officer Andy Foster said . `` Probably that 's a failure on our part to not get that out to the public . ''
Part of the blame for all the misinformation lies with the promotions . The UFC has used the same words in its rules graphic for more than a decade now about effective striking , grappling , aggression and cage control . No explanation is ever made about how the former two are weighed heavier than the latter . Or what any of that even means .
`` When [ regulators and officials ] fail to offer information transparently , people 's opinions start to become fact , '' said referee Rob Hinds , a certified trainer of refs and judges . `` And the more you hear the same opinion , the more that becomes fact . ... We 've never really had anybody say , 'Here are the facts . We 're going to let every commission know it . We 're going to let every media outlet know it . We 're going to let everybody know . ' Kind of like when the NHL changes a rule -- everybody knows it . ''
The onus is not on the fighters to seek this information out . They have enough to worry about already , like preparing to climb into a cage and come to blows with another human being for a typically meager wage . Referees have meetings with fighters the day of the event to talk about in-fight rules . But never is a fighter informed by an official what judges are looking for . Coaches do n't seem to have a good idea , either , and it seems like it would be imperative on them to find out , so they can provide better instruction to their athletes .
UFC lightweight Al Iaquinta took one of Hinds ' referee and judging seminars a few years ago in New York . He called the experience invaluable and he thinks every fighter should do it to gain more knowledge about judging .
`` It could only benefit a fighter , '' Iaquinta said . `` For someone that wants to be the best in the sport , you might as well take two days out of your life and if it can help win a fight even 1 percent it 's worth its weight , to me , for sure . ''
Iaquinta is also in favor of judges gathering together at least once a year and hammering out scoring to make sure everyone is on the same page . Because that 's a problem , too . Bad judges do exist -- the ones that do n't abide by the above tenets and fall into the cage control and takedown-stealing-a-round fallacies .
Those are harder to weed out , especially since there are so many state jurisdictions . But the Association of Boxing Commissions , which oversees all the state athletic commissions , is open to conversation about scoring changes .
Sean Wheelock , the chairman of the ABC 's MMA rules and regulations committee , said his group will discuss formulating clearer rules separating a 10-9 round from a 10-8 round on a conference call this month . Language with more clarity would , in theory , encourage judges to hand out more 10-8 rounds . The current language is murky .
`` It 's so incredibly vague , '' Wheelock said . `` There 's always going to be subjectivity , but there needs to be tighter guidelines . When do I score a 10-9 ? When do I score a 10-8 ? Should we score a 10-7 ? It 's listed there . I 'm not advocating for or am I opposing , but if 10-7 is on the books , should there ever be a 10-7 scored realistically if there 's not a one-point or a two-point deduction in the round ? I think that 's a question we need to ask . ''
If a rule change is approved by the rules and regulations committee , it will then go to ABC president Mike Mazzulli , who will present it at the ABC annual meeting in August . From there , the state athletic commissions would all have to adopt it .
Changes are hard to make in mixed martial arts . There are a ton of obstacles along the way . Maybe that 's why it 's 2016 and we 're still in the dark about how judges score fights .
Even if the rules do n't change and the language stays the same , something must be done about education . The sport is still young , yes . And close fights -- and Lawler vs. Condit was certainly one -- are going to happen . All the experts I spoke to for this column were split on the winner of the UFC 195 main event and none thought it was even remotely a robbery .
But it 's incomprehensible that something as simple as the criteria for winning is constantly up for debate in mixed martial arts . That has to change .
It is not generally proper to post call-for-papers on LtU . Exceptions have been made , for broad workshops likely to appeal to many LtU readers . I hope the 2014 ML Family workshop also qualifies .
The ML Family workshop intends to attract the entire family of ML languages , whether related by blood to the original ML or not . Our slogan is `` Higher-order , Typed , Inferred , Strict '' . Designers and users of the languages fitting the description have many issues in common , from data representation and garbage collection to fancy type system features . As an example , some form of type classes or implicits has been tried or been looked into in several languages of the broad ML family . We hope the ML Family workshop is a good forum to discuss these issues .
Also new this year is a category of submissions -- informed opinions -- to complement research presentation , experience reports and demos . We specifically invite arguments about language features , be they type , garbage collection , implicits or something else -- but the arguments must good and justified . Significant personal experience does count as justification , as do empirical studies or formal proofs . We would be delighted if language implementors or long-time serious users could tell , with examples from their long experience , what has worked out and what has not in their language .
The deadline for submitting an abstract of the presentation , up to 2 PDF pages , is in a month . Please consider submitting and attending !
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A decision by the West to provide arms to Ukraine could prompt a rapid escalation of Russian support for separatists battling government forces in the east of the country , a global security think-tank said on Wednesday .
The International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) also said the kind of hybrid warfare it said Russia was conducting in Ukraine represented a “ grave threat ” to NATO as the military alliance is ill-prepared to deal with it .
U.S. House of Representative members said this week they were preparing legislation to provide arms for Ukraine , something many lawmakers have been pressing for .
This could prompt Moscow , which denies involvement in a conflict that has killed more than 5,000 people , to openly declare it was now supplying arms to the rebels , said Ben Barry , an analyst at IISS and a former senior British army officer .
“ Their behavior would be even less constrained and they can introduce additional military support much more quickly than any conceivable external supply of arms to Ukraine , ” said Barry , speaking at the launch of the think-tank 's annual assessment of global military capabilities , The Military Balance .
“ If the United States and other nations chose to supply Ukraine it would take some time to tip the military balance in their favor and could probably be overmatched by more rapid Russian escalation . ”
Key U.S. allies in Europe are much more cautious about providing arms to Ukraine . Leaders of France and Germany joined the presidents of Russia and Ukraine in the Belarussian capital Minsk on Wednesday for a peace summit as fighting flared anew in eastern Ukraine .
IISS welcomed NATO 's ‘ spearhead ' rapid reaction force , conceived to reassure member states in eastern Europe , as an important initiative . But it said strengthening military forces on the alliance 's periphery may be more important to deterring future aggression .
IISS said there was “ unease ” about possible gaps in NATO 's capacity to deal with hybrid warfare , where traditional military tools are combined with non-military such as disinformation , propaganda , provocation and cyberattacks .
“ Hybrid warfare represents a grave threat to NATO 's collective security , ” it said in the The Military Balance .
“ Some current or potential state or non-state adversaries , possibly including ... China and Iran , will learn from Russia 's recent employment of hybrid warfare ... what tactics worked and what capabilities are required to effect results . ”
Time for another ukulele rant . Well , like other rants on Got A Ukulele , actually more of a discussion piece to promote some debate and hopefully inspire someone . This time , do you want to move away from up down ukulele boredom ?
Everyone is not duty bound to play exactly the same thing at the same time . Back to the song sheet dilemma again . All you are then doing is just expanding exactly the same sound to the audience , but not filling out the sound space . Speak to the band members and talk about people doing something different . Not everyone will be comfortable , and that is just fine - having a couple of ukes on rhythm doing the basic song ( i.e . - whats on the sheet ! ) , will work if you explore other avenues with the other performers .
Think about the bass . And in that I do n't just mean the inclusion of a bass ukulele , double bass or bass guitar ( although I would heartily recommend that to offset the naturally high uke sound and fill your performance ) , but think about the bass on the ukes . That may sound odd for such a high pitched instrument , but even the inclusion of a low G on some of the instruments will add a different dynamic to you overall sound . Try having some of the band keep some basic strums to the low G and C of one of the ukes in a percussive style . Better still , why not look at a Baritone or a Guitar . They are allowed !
Picking . Often considered scary or just overlooked by those starting out , but even a very basic picked roll over the ukulele chords joined with a partner playing the same chords with strums will immediately change your sound for the better .
Lead breaks . Ah yes , release your inner guitar rock god ! More seriously , if you have multiple players then you will have 'room ' for one or more of your band to play out the melody or a blues lick over the top .
Less can be more . Not every player needs to strum like a demon on every song . The beauty of a band with multiple players , is that certain members can just accentuate certain beats and strums in songs to give them more emphasis . Sure individual players can do this too , but if two players alternate such strums on different sounding instruments you can get some cool effects .
Starts and finishes . Again , often overlooked as in many cases they are 'not on the sheet ' , but pick up any record you own and have a listen to some songs . Really , not that many start with `` 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 '' and then go straight into the song . Similarly not many end with a 'dooby dee doo ' and then stop . Work on each song and see if you can build up some longer starts and finishes . In most cases , these intros and endings will work through a repeat of a bridge / chorus or verse pattern , and there are no rules really .
Transpose / learn your Inversions . Just because the sheet says that the song is played in the key of G , does that really suit your style and your vocal ranges . Do n't try and stress the vocal chords out just to stick to the sheet - consider transposing the song to suit the majority of the band . Even when the song works and you are happy with the key , bear in mind that there are several ways to play the chords and often a chord played at a higher position can enhance your sound dramatically . There are no hard and fast rules to this - just experiment . ( Oh , and an E7 is not exactly the same as an E - just learn the E ... )
Harmonies . Firstly on vocals - it is just a simple fact that vocal harmonies between two or three people sound hugely better than those singers performing exactly the same tune . The same works for the ukes too and you can find harmonic patterns on chord sequences that will naturally work together , yet still keep the feel of the song right . The science of harmonies is too big a subject for this blog post but I would recommend you do some other reading on the subject .
Instrumentals . Another failure of many song sheets - they can often just be verse chorus throughout . As well as missing the intro and endings , they often miss out an instrumental verse . Even if they do n't miss one , there is no reason why you ca n't add one to both lengthen the song and allow some of your players to show off some chops in the song .
Look beyond the ukulele . Perhaps the one most capable of stirring the hornets nest , and the subject of the other blog post I mentioned earlier . If you really want to work on complimenting the ukulele , getting a thicker sound , then please , please , do n't be afraid of bringing other instruments into the mix . Drums , keyboards , other strings , melodicas , fiddles , whistles , brass , bass , whatever , it 's all good .
Challenge everything you do . A simple last thought . Record your performances and play them back . Does it sound 'samey ' or 'simplistic ' ? If so , at your next practice , try and work on an addition . I am not suggesting you throw everything away , but week by week if you work on adding some other interesting elements , before you know it you may have a fully fledged song on your hands .
But those are just ideas , and as I say , they are not compulsory and may not work for your band . But at the very least they should help you get some variation in your sound , and in doing so I strongly believe you will have more fun in your gigging exploits . Make notes of what you practice and then keep experimenting . We often try things out and then hate them , but often we usually find something we like and then try it out on stage . If it goes down badly we try again .
I may well get get some questions back on this such as 'but we want to be a ukulele band ' . I get that , and I am not suggesting that you stop the ukulele playing , but consider this . How many 'guitar bands ' out there consist of a range of guitars , all playing exactly the same pattern , chords in every song . Mix it up !
Have fun experimenting !

Andres Muschietti 's big screen adaptation of IT is still a week from hitting theaters and there 's already talks of a sequel and Pennywise actor Bill Skarsgard has just revealed his involvement in the project . Muschietti hopes to have a script finished by January of 2018 and anticipates that production will start after , possibly as soon as March of 2018 . That being said , the script is not complete at this time and the project has yet to be officially green lit by the studio , but that will definitely change after IT hits theaters next week .
Skarsgard recently sat down with Metro U.K. and revealed that he is attached to the IT sequel , but added that he was not able to talk about what his role will be . Skarsgard explains .
`` I am attached to it but that 's all I can say , we 're in the early stages and I 'm talking to Andy about it and figuring out what It will be . It 's a different story but I 'm excited to delve in deeper to the character as there 's more exploration for who Pennywise is . ''
The actor 's secrecy about the project is understandable since the script has not been completed . There 's even a possibility that the movie wo n't happen at all , but that possibility is getting smaller by the day as more critical praise is heaped upon IT .
Muschietti has spoken in the past about the sequel taking place in the present day with all of the kids as adults . The director has also mentioned that he will be including important scenes from Stephen King 's iconic book that did not make it into the first movie as flashbacks , which is more than likely where Bill Skarsgard will come into play . There are at least two scenes that involve Pennywise that were not used , which would make perfect sense for Skarsgard to return . It is too early to tell just how big of a role that the actor would have though , so we 'll just have to wait and see .

Comparisons are bound to come up between the new big screen adaptation of IT and the miniseries from 1990 . Skarsgard also spoke out about those comparisons , specifically those between him and Tim Curry who previously played Pennywise in the 1990 television miniseries . The actor stated that there really should not be comparisons and that they both stand-alone while emphasizing that it was important for him to do his own thing with the character . Skarsgard had this to say .
`` I sort of grew up with the Tim performance and I was very familiar with it and a huge fan as an actor , so my process of preparing for the role was , `` okay this needs to be different '' and I think we did that , I think this Pennywise is different and they can stand alone - there 's no need to compare them as you can appreciate both but it was important to me to do something new and something original with the take on the character . ''
Andres Muschietti 's IT adaptation hits screens on September 8th , 2017 , which is only a week away . Bill Skarsgard mentioned that he had nightmares about his character when he came home after wrapping production , so one can only imagine what we 're all in for when we finally get to see the movie . IT 2 is expected to have a finished script by January 2018 if all goes according to plan and production should start up right after with some more Pennywise .
Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded .
Though the sesquicentennial of his death will go largely unremarked , the German-American artist Carl Wimar died on Nov. 28 , 1862 , succumbing to the ravages of tuberculosis . Hardly recognized today , Wimar , like his mentor Emanuel Leutze , was an immigrant painter who found the promise and character of the American nation the perfect subject , even as that nation was being torn apart by war .
Though Leutze 's name and work were better known , the two worked in tight parallel . While Leutze created “ Washington Crossing the Delaware ” and decorated the Capitol building as it was being finished during the Civil War , Wimar finished his own magnum opus , comprising murals and frescoes , for the newly completed dome in St. Louis 's federal courthouse .
Wimar was born in Germany and immigrated to America when he was 15 years old . He returned to Germany , however , to attend the famous Düsseldorf Academy , where he first encountered Leutze . “ Mr . Leutze paid a visit to me in my atelier , and brought along all the Americans who are here , ” Wimar wrote excitedly in October 1854 . The academy was the locus of German Romantic painting , and the key training center for American romantic artists as well — William Stanley Haseltine , Eastman Johnson and Richard Caton Woodville all passed through there . While in Düsseldorf , George Caleb Bingham , a renowned artist from Missouri , attempted his own version of Washington and his troops on the Delaware River ; he also brought copies of Gilbert Stuart 's portraits of George and Martha Washington there to work on his commission for the Missouri state capitol .
Wimar showed some interest in history paintings , with both European and American subjects , but his true love was “ Wildwestgeschichten , ” or wild west stories . Wimar himself had never visited an American Indian encampment , but he filled so many canvases with buffalo and encounters on the emigrant trails that his colleagues called him “ the Indian painter. ” In the winter of 1858 and 1859 , Wimar returned to America , finally ventured up the Missouri River and afterward stopped depicting imagined abductions . Instead he painted stark plains landscapes , rituals of the buffalo hunt and ethnographic portraits of American Indian leaders .
The commission at the St. Louis courthouse , however , was a chance to think broadly about American history , as seen from the center of the continent , in a border state bitterly divided by the Civil War . In this context , Wimar chose a telling narrative of the past , present and future American unity , one that emphasized the history of St. Louis for the success of the nation .
Wimar 's message balanced an argument about the centrality of St. Louis to American history with the needs of the nation at war . For accuracy of detail , he consulted Wilson Primm , a longtime St. Louis resident and author of an early history . Three panels , to the north , south and east , showed past highlights : the 1541 “ discovery ” of the Mississippi by the Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto , the 1764 founding of St. Louis by the French trader Pierre Laclède and a 1780 attack on St. Louis by Indian tribes allied with the British during the American Revolution .
Selecting a minor-to-forgettable skirmish from the American Revolution became a natural choice during the Civil War : the battle scene demonstrated when , once before , St. Louis had repulsed amassed forces comprising former friends and allies . By attaching his name to the federal courthouse , of course , Wimar was also making a political comment : that German-Americans would stand steadfast beside the Union .
Wimar 's work at the courthouse included allegorical figures of “ Law , ” “ Justice , ” “ Liberty ” and “ Commerce , ” as well as small portraits of George and Martha Washington , the former Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton and Edward Bates , a conservative Missourian and former slaveholder who served as Lincoln 's attorney general . These were not random or incidental choices for Wimar . Each had a symbolic importance to his vision for America 's past and future , at his adopted city 's place within it . As the founding general and the first president , George Washington remained revered on both sides of the conflict ; at Washington University in St. Louis and beyond , the image of Washington remained a symbol of national promise .

At the very top of the dome , Wimar 's fellow German-American artist August Becker continued the theme of reunification by marrying the agricultural products of the nation : corn and wheat , the leading produce of the North and Midwest , joining pineapple and sugar cane , icons of Southern hospitality and trade , to symbolize the reunited national harvest .
The return of national markets , the completion of the transcontinental railroad — Wimar painted images the resonated with the hopes of the Union in the continuing war , but that spoke to the timeless dreams of the American nation , as understood by a German immigrant . As part of his work at the courthouse he painted a large canvas titled “ Westward the Star of Empire Takes its Way ” — nearly the same title that Leutze gave to one of his works at the Capitol . But while Leutze painted a wagon train and the water entrance to California 's Golden Gate to symbolize the West , Wimar saw the future in Cochetopa Pass , Colo. , “ the natural gateway of the Central Pacific railroad , ” which he dreamed would reach from St. Louis across the West to the Pacific .
Wimar was n't alone in his vision of St. Louis as the new heart of a postwar , reunited country . After the war another visionary , the journalist , Logan Uriah Reavis , called for St. Louis to replace Washington as the nation 's capital , perfectly balancing the interests of North , South and West . In the end , of course , neither his nor Wimar 's vision came to pass : the transcontinental railroad went farther north , through Chicago , Omaha and the basins of Wyoming , and the national capital remained in Washington , what Reavis called “ a distant place on the outskirts of the country , with little power or prestige . ”
Still , it is a vision worth recalling , both for its faith in the future of a nation made whole and its identification of the country 's vast middle as an unending source of wealth . Walking through the Old Courthouse today , part of the National Park Service 's Jefferson National Expansion Memorial , next to the Gateway Arch , one can appreciate the power of a space where Thomas Hart Benton called for a transcontinental railroad to unite the nation ; where Dred and Harriet Scott filed their claims for freedom ; where Virginia Minor argued for her right to vote , under the equal-protection clauses of the 14th Amendment — and where , in glorious images , Carl Wimar gave his last efforts to paint images of union during the Civil War .

Hillary Clinton Has Yet to Land the Coveted Susan Sarandon Endorsement
Hey , look , I get it . Sometimes it 's hard to make up your mind about who to vote for , so you turn to people you trust for their guidance . And we all have different standards for deciding whom we should trust , so some of us turn to business leaders ; some of us turn to environmentalists ; some of us turn to a friend who still gets a physical newspaper subscription ; and some of us turn to Susan Sarandon .
No shade ! Susan 's great . Really . Not only have I never not enjoyed her in a movie , but for real she is a funny , smart , exciting progressive speaker .
That having been said , she probably could have chosen her words a little more carefully the other night on MSNBC when she appeared to be telling Democrats they could stay home instead of voting for Hillary .
Oh , Susan .
`` There 's growing concern that the folks that are into Bernie Sanders have come to despise Hillary Clinton or reject Hillary Clinton and that should she be the nominee , which is as yet undetermined , they will walk away , '' said host Chris Hayes , who is a 37-year-old man but at a glance looks like Harry Potter at around year three .
`` That 's a legitimate concern , '' Sarandon said , and went on to point out two of Hillary 's liabilities with that crowd : she 's taken money from tons of rich people , and she 's been less than enthusiastic about raising the minimum wage .
Susan was trying to make the point that Bernie would draw more of a turnout than Hillary . ( And although there 's no telling the future , she may be right : some polling shows Bernie beating Trump by a larger margin . )
But she went a little further , and said that a lot of Bernie supporters might not be able to bring themselves to vote for Hillary , and then potentially placed herself in that camp : `` I do n't know , '' she said . `` I 'm going to see what happens . ''
Sarandon does know a thing or two about disrupting the status quo during elections : in 2000 , she was co-chair of Ralph Nader 's steering committee , but then in 2004 she urged Nader to get out of the race so Kerry could defeat Bush . ( Oh well . )
To be fair : she never said she was voting for Trump , and she did n't even say she would n't vote for Hillary . `` I 'm going to see what happens '' is the kind of polite dodge one might use to avoid an invitation to see a mime , so who knows what Susan 's real plans are .
And TBH she 's at least a little bit right . If you 're the kind of person who does n't trust the system , who seldom/never votes , and who sees Bernie as the only possible solution , well yeah , you might be like `` oh well , Bernie 's out , I guess I am too . '' ( Data indicate that the number of Bernie supporters who would actually do this is pretty small , though , so nice try , Susan . )
And now a few other political luminaries have had some harsh words for Susan :
I respect but disagree with @ SusanSarandon . A possible support of Trump over @ HillaryClinton is dangerous 2 women , minorities & immigrants .
— Jamie Lee Curtis ( @ jamieleecurtis ) March 29 , 2016
2- the idea that Susan Sarandon would say that NOT supporting Hillary in a HRC/Trump race is a legitimate choice for Democrats , is insane .

There you have it , hopefully those tweets from the stars of A Fish Called Wanda and The Mysteries of Laura have answered any lingering questions you might have about how you should vote .
I previously wrote about the gamification of social media services in a piece entitled : You 're Being Played By Twitter . The article touched on the use of engagement statistics and feedback loops in order to draw users deeper into the services provided . Essentially , Twitter , Facebook , Google+ , etc all manipulate the egos of users in order to drive them into further interaction with the system ( for a deeper explanation of ‘ gamification , ' see the previous article ) . While the article addressed how these systems were put in place , it did n't explain why they worked at a fundamental level .
Gamers as Guinea Pigs
Game systems are just now being woven into the everyday lives of most people through social media and other gamified systems ( loyalty reward cards , etc. ) . But gamers have been exposed to these systems for decades and provide examples as to why these systems are so compelling . In a recent article entitled The Psychology of Looting , Dr. James Madigan provides an insight as to why gamers seek out virtual “ loot ” or rewards in games .
It 's undeniable that gamers get a huge high out of finding new stuff , be it a gun with higher accuracy , armor with fire resistance , or a night-vision scope for our catapult . This can mean engaging in activities that appear absurd to outsiders , like meticulously searching the recently murdered corpses of countless foes and opening every single chest , box , barrel , crate , footlocker , cabinet , desk , and vending machine we come across in the hopes that this time we 'll find something really awesome .
Numerous games are built around finding or scavenging for items , colloquially referred to as “ looting ” by gamers . The most popular online game currently is World of Warcraft ( “ WoW ” ) . Tens of millions of users log in every day in order to find better equipment or gear for their avatars ( in-game characters ) .
Beyond hardcore gaming such as WoW , there are now millions of people playing casual social games such as Farmville on Facebook and other sites . People are spending more and more time immersed in services with game systems at their core – all the while seeking more and more “ loot. ” And not by any small measure . The projected global revenue for virtual goods in 2010 was $ 7,300,000,000 .
All this for items you can not touch . You can not taste or smell . But you can see them . And more importantly , so can other people .
“ Like ” Your Lizard Brain
Just as gamers desire to find more “ loot , ” users of social media services become conditioned to seek more “ likes , ” and “ re-tweets , ” and “ plus ones. ” People become enthralled by the engagement statistics they receive by interacting with the system . But why ? What is it that drives people to seek validation through these systems ? And is it really about getting the “ loot ? ”
German born neuroscientist Wolfram Schultz was conducting research at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland on the relationship between the chemical dopamine and Parkinson 's disease when he almost accidentally started a line of research that can be used to explain gamers ' love of loot . Dopamine is a collection of just twenty two atoms that plays a huge role in regulating human decision making , particularly goal oriented behavior and the pursuit of pleasure . When we encounter something we like –say a patch of berries or a goretusk liver– our brain releases dopamine . Brain cells that are sensitive to that chemical go bananas when it 's present , which makes us feel good –maybe even euphoric . Dopamine neurons in the brain also help us predict good things in life . Schultz and his colleagues discovered that presenting a lab monkey with a bit of fruit caused the creature 's dopamine neurons to light up . They also discovered that when they repeatedly preceded the treat with a light or a sound , the neurons would start to fire when the monkey saw the light or heard the sound , but then remain relatively inactive when the fruit showed up . The system they had discovered was , at its core , about anticipation and trying to predict rewards based on what was happening in the environment .
So it is not so much the activity of being re-tweeted ( or liked , etc . ) that users enjoy , but rather the anticipation of being re-tweeted . Beyond the general anticipation of what reaction a user will receive from engagement statistics – is the anticipation of the unknown . How many people will “ like ” this update ? What if people ignore it ? Will people comment on this photo I posted ? While our brains enjoy the anticipation of rewards – our brains really light up at the anticipation of unexpected and unpredictable rewards .
‘ The brain is programmed , at a very fundamental level , to seek out surprising and unexpected rewards , ' says author Jonah Lehrer , who writes about neuropsychology in his book How We Decide and in publications such as The New Yorker and Wired . ‘ One can see this phenomenon in action by looking at the response of dopamine neurons , which get much more ‘ excited ' when exposed to an unexpected reward than when exposed to a reward they can predict in advance . ' Surprising pleasures , it turns out , are the most joyous of all because they highlight failures in our predictive predilections . It 's like the dopamine neurons were sitting up and yelling , ‘ Hey ! There 's something really good here ! Let 's obsess over that until I can figure out why I did n't see it coming ! '
So after being conditioned by the feedback loops of social media services , when your finger hovers over your mouse , cursor floating above the “ post ” or “ tweet ” button , your brain is firing chemicals off left and right . Your lizard brain in deep anticipation mode . Will this be ignored ? Will someone comment ? Will I get new followers ?
Always in Search Of Something
The unpredictability of the feedback provided by these systems are what makes them so compelling . We know something is going to happen – but we do n't know what . So why is it people enjoy Twitter so much ? Or Facebook ? Or Google Plus ? It 's that they provide us means of having new and unexpected experiences within our social networks – without ever having to leave our desks . The engagement statistics light up our brains when we see a flood of likes or re-tweets .
It also explains why new social services pop up every month . Some sub-set of users burns out on the feedback provided . They 've gamed the system , they know the reponse they will receive . So they leave MySpace for Facebook . Facebook for Twitter . Twitter for Google Plus .
They move on to the next great thing , always looking for something new to trigger that dopamine release – searching for validation over fiber optics and LCD screens .

A Cranford High School student who caused widespread panic by falsely reporting a threat at the high school has pled guilty to a third degree charge of creating a false public alarm .
The 15-year-old Cranford teenager admitted to using the social media app , Yik Yak , to post a message alluding to a threat against Cranford High School students last October , acting Union County Prosecutor Grace H. Park announced Wednesday .
The message , which was posted on Oct. 30 , alluded to a `` big surprise '' at Cranford High School the next day . The social media post advised students to `` watch your backs '' shortly before 11:30 a.m. , Union County Prosecutor 's Office Juvenile Unit Supervisor Susan Gleason .
Yik Yak allows subscribers to anonymously post messages that are accessible only by other Internet or mobile phone users within a small geographic radius of where the messages were originally sent , the Prosecutor 's Office reported .
The Cranford Police Department was notified of the suspicious message shortly after it was posted on Yik Yak , Gleason stated . The Union County Sheriff 's Office K-9 Units were dispatched and a complete sweep of high school was conducted , but no explosives , firearms , or otherwise dangerous substances or objects were located .
A subsequent joint investigation by the Prosecutor 's Office Juvenile Unit and the Cranford Police Department identified the juvenile defendant as a suspect , and he was located at his home .
Under the terms of a plea agreement , the defendant , who was 14 at the time of the incident , was placed on probation for 12 months and now must complete 40 hours of community service with the Elizabeth Police Department , the Prosecutor 's Office stated .
The student also must pay restitution in the amount of $ 2,000 and attend school with no unexcused absences , tardiness , or suspensions for the duration of the current school year .

A teacher at Samuel Slater Junior High School in Pawtucket was charged Thursday with assaulting a seventh-grade student , apparently over a cookie .
Richard Koster , 49 , of Cranston , was arraigned in District Court on a count of simple assault and released on personal recognizance .
Pawtucket police said Koster is accused of grabbing a student , lifting him off the floor and pinning him against a wall while yelling at him in a classroom on March 18 . According to a police report , Koster was upset the student brought a cookie into his classroom against school rules .
`` Another student actually handed him a piece of a cookie and he shoved it in his mouth . The teacher told him he was not supposed to be eating in class . And as he left the classroom , another child thought it was funny to tell the teacher , 'Hey , that student just made a funny face at you , ' '' the child 's aunt told NBC 10 News . She did not want her named used .
Koster surrendered at the Pawtucket Police Department Thursday . There was no answer at his home .
The Pawtucket superintendent said Koster is on administrative leave . The student has returned to school .
Well , it 's not like she could be a professional venture capitalist anymore . Or a Reddit CEO .
Ellen Pao has turned to the one thing she has proven effective at — talking loudly about diversity . This week , the former Reddit CEO , famous for a failed gender discrimination lawsuit against VC firm Kleiner Perkins , launched Project Include , a new Silicon Valley advocacy group to make life miserable for meritocrats .
According to their website , Project Include will urge companies to “ improve opportunities for all employees , including all underrepresented groups ( gender , race , class , age , religion , disability , education , sexual orientation , and others ) . ” They call for “ multiple , sustained efforts , a comprehensive approach , and a long-term commitment . An effective solution covers all aspects of a company — its culture , its operations , and its teams . ”
Many Silicon Valley companies , known for the hyper-progressiveness of their CEOs , already take such a “ comprehensive approach. ” Intel , for example , has been running so-called “ MicroInequities ” training for its employees for years .
Still , Pao is likely to enjoy success in her new initiative . Despite her track record of failure , which included a disastrous lawsuit against her former employer Kleiner Perkins , and her resignation as CEO of social news site Reddit after the worst series of user rebellions in the site 's history , she remains a darling of the progressive media .
They 're even content to ignore some of the disturbing facts that emerged in the course of her trial , including her bullying of colleagues at Kleiner Perkins and her husband 's history of vexatious discrimination lawsuits . Commentators were also content to ignore that Kleiner Perkins , who Pao said discriminated against her , had one of the best track records of hiring women in Silicon Valley .
Tech journalists are still content to ignore this , with WIRED calling her “ one of the most prominent faces of Silicon Valley 's diversity movement . ”
It seems Pao 's quest to profit from the tech industry 's paranoia about diversity is only just beginning .

Greece . DO you remember how close it came to plunging the world into an economic maelstrom ?
If the Greeks had n't voted in favour of austerity then the euro zone would have split asunder and the world economy lurched into a prolonged recession . I can recall writing a breathless piece myself , implying economic doom was nigh if those ungrateful Greeks did n't do the right thing .
Ironically , the IMF has just admitted it went way too far with its austerity . Sorry about that , Greece .
Sunday Star-Times columnist and business commentator Michael Wilson .
This year has been Cyprus 's turn . Its debt problems were insurmountable and therefore it would inevitably be forced out of the euro zone . This would produce a contagion effect for the rest of Europe and before you know it , global ruin .
In the past few weeks Slovenia has turned up as yet another possible cause of economic disaster . Can it avoid a bailout ? Will it be the next domino that pushes the world over the abyss ? It 's never-ending , is n't it , this wretched global recession ?
Or is it ?
Have a look at this recent headline : `` OECD Cuts World Economic Growth Forecast to 3.1 per cent . '' Now I am sure some of you are thinking that this ca n't be right . The world economy is in recession , therefore it ca n't be growing at all . And you would have every reason to think so , if you absorbed all the hysterical coverage Europe has generated over the past few years .
Europe is in recession , but the world is not . Far from it .
While we were stressing about that economic giant Cyprus , population 1.1 million , a much larger country north of New Zealand has been growing faster than China .
The Philippines , population 94 million has just announced annual GDP growth of 7.8 per cent . Myanmar , or Burma , population 48 million , has notched up growth of 6.3 per cent , and the consultants McKinsey predict it will quadruple the size of its economy over the next 20 years .
I could go on about Indonesia , population 242 million and its growth rate of 6 per cent , or Cambodia , with its 14 million and 6.5 per cent growth rate . But the point is , New Zealand , like most Western countries , is very euro-centric . If Greece , population 11 million , is in trouble , then it means the world economy is doomed . If it 's an Asian country , other than China , then we are not remotely interested .
The problem with the over-emphasis of things European and the lack of interest in things Asian , is we create a distorted view of the world economy .
We assume because Europe is struggling - and the biggest economy of them all , America , is growing very slowly - then overall the world economy must be in deep trouble . And there is no denying the post GFC environment is still fraught with danger . But through all this angst the world economy has been growing solidly since its nadir in 2009 .
Depending on which international agency you refer to those global growth rates have been around 5 per cent for 2010 , 4 per cent in 2011 and 3.5 per cent in 2012 . An unspectacular pace , and one which is trending down , but are n't such growth rates quite respectable under the circumstances ?
The reason the world economy has kept ticking over is primarily because of those Asian economies mentioned . And , of course , China . Fortunately the Middle Kingdom does get the attention it deserves . After all , it is our largest export destination now . However , I maintain the analysis of China is a little skew-whiff at times and persistently negative .
The constant message we get about China is that it is slowing down and this is a very bad thing . Certainly slower growth in China is having a global impact . But I consider it is overstated because there is insufficient understanding that because China is now such a large economy , a 7 per cent growth rate is perfectly reasonable and desirable .
A simple bit of maths can show this . An economy that grows 10 per cent a year doubles in size every seven years . So if we give the Chinese economy a value of 100 in 1998 it will grow to a value of 200 in 2005 and 400 in 2012 . A 10 per cent growth rate in 1998 means China grew 10 points that year and in 2005 by 20 points . A slower 7 per cent rise in 2013 , when the economy is now worth 400 , will mean growth of 28 points . . . still well in excess of the levels of 1998 and 2005 .
For family reasons I have been to China regularly over the past 15 years . My impression is it can not keep growing at 10 per cent and it is highly desirable that it aims for 7 per cent or even less so it can ease back on its congestion and pollution problems . And , as that little bit of maths above shows , a 7 per cent growth rate for such a large economy is still highly respectable .
The other factor to consider is China will benefit from the growth of the Southeast Asian countries mentioned . The region is likely to be a dynamic one for many years to come . So remember , despite the insistence of Travolta and Newton-John , Greece does not need to be The Word . Try Philippines or Indonesia for a change .

Once upon a youthful time , the phrase “ cheesy bread ” brought me thoughts of Little Caesar saying , “ Pizza ! Pizza ! ” But when I began my first job as a bread baker , those days were long gone . Suddenly , my world was filled instead with onion rye rolls sprinkled with sharp cheddar , paneer-stuffed naan , and crusty sourdough studded with pockets of melty asiago . As if my individual , deep loves of cheese and bread alone were n't enough , I managed to discover exactly how awesome these two are combined . Every corner of the world seems to have something to offer in this department ( open call for your favorites in the comments below ) . I have half a mind to leave it all behind , buy an AirStream and drive it around as a cheesy bread food truck . And the star of my menu would always be : khachapuri .
Khachapuri hails from the country of Georgia . It 's made from a soft yeasted dough that 's shaped in an oval , leaving a crater in the center . And what could possibly fill that crater ? You guessed it , cheese ( and lots of it ) . Then , you tear off pieces of the surrounding dough and dip it into that melty goodness . Often , you throw an egg or two on top , nestled right inside said cheese and the yolk stays runny and adds to the dipping bonanza . If you 're feeling creative and non-traditional , you can start going crazy and adding anything you want . I have three favorite versions ( one classic , two curveballs ) . Read on for all the details .
Here 's what you need to know :

The dough .
Khachapuri is made from a highly enriched dough , meaning in addition to the classic bread ingredients ( flour , yeast , salt , water ) , you 're likely to find things like milk , butter , and a little bit of a sugar . These enrichments keep the finished dough soft ( perfect for dipping ) , but they also help it brown beautifully—this is one of those perfect doughs that gets evenly golden brown all over . The dough is mixed to pretty full gluten development ( about 4 minutes on low speed and another 2-3 on high speed ) . This makes it nice and stretchy , but also strong enough to hold up to plenty of filling . It 's easy to work with and shape , and , in general , I just ca n't say enough great things about it . Even if you 're not a big bread baker , give khachapuri a try .
Rise time .
It 's important to remember that enriched doughs often take longer to rise— these enrichments really up the ante in the flavor and color department , but they can seriously slow yeast activity . That said , it 's important not to rush and allow the appropriate amount of rise time , which will take about 1 1/2 to 2 hours after mixing , and another 30 minutes to 1 hour after shaping . This fermentation is responsible for the lovely yeasty flavor of the dough , as well as the light and soft final texture of the dough . Allow yourself plenty of time , and remember that enriched doughs do n't always physically rise as high as lean doughs ( baguette , ciabatta , pizza dough , etc . ) so the dough may not double in size , though it will increase noticeably .

Shaping part one .
Khachapuri dough is pretty forgiving and very easy to handle , so it 's pretty simple to get it into its signature oval/boat shape . Divide the dough into even pieces . You can divide the dough into whatever size you want , depending on your desired end result . Dividing it in two will create two large , sharing-size khachapuri . Dividing the dough in quarters will make four smaller , individual-size khachapuri . Divide the dough as desired , then lightly flour your work surface . Start by pressing the dough into an oval shape with your hands . Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out , maintaining the oval shape . This is super easy if you start with the rolling pin in the center of the dough , and apply gentle , even pressure as you move upwards . Then , return the rolling pin to the center and repeat the process , this time applying gentle , even pressure as you move downwards ( towards yourself ) .
Shop the Story
Continue this process until the dough is about 1/3-inch thick . This is thicker than making pies , tarts , or thin crust pizza—you want it thick enough that it 's a pretty sturdy base , and it will rise a bit more after you shape it ! When the dough is about 1/3-inch thick , lift it from the ends and gently transfer it to a parchment-lined baking sheet . I like to gently stretch the dough a bit from the ends as I do this to help exaggerate the oval shape .

Filling .
Traditionally , Khachapuri is filled with a Georgian brined cheese called sulgani . This cheese has a relatively light flavor , save for the tanginess and sourness imparted by the brine . The texture is extremely elastic and it melts into a gorgeous , oozy mass of deliciousness . I totally recommend using sulgani if you can find it , but if you ca n't , a blend of goat cheese ( for the tanginess ) and fresh mozzarella ( for the elasticity and meltiness ) works well . I crumble the goat cheese onto the base of the dough , then top it with diced mozzarella ( I 've found dicing it into chunks makes it melt perfectly come bake-time ) . The cheese is added before the final rise time , so you can finish shaping the bread . Be sure to leave about 1-inch around the edges of the dough uncovered to allow plenty of room to finish shaping later . Other toppings are often added just before baking . Another common khachapuri topping is eggs , which are cracked directly onto the surface of the cheese before baking ( or partially through baking , depending on the size of your khachapuri , and your desired level of runny yolk ) . But traditional is n't the only way to go . I did a meaty version , topped with prosciutto and fresh rosemary , both of which crisped up in the oven and made an awesome textural component . Or you can add additional flavors to the cheese itself . My green khachapuri has tons of fresh herbs and scallions added to the cheese mixture , and is probably my favorite of the bunch !
Shaping part two .
Once you 've filled the khachapuri , you 're ready to finish shaping it . This is super easy : Work your way around the dough , folding the excess dough from the edges ( about 1-inch all around , if you recall ) , over the cheese . This creates a little wall of dough all around that encases the filling . You really just need to fold the dough over , like you would fold pie dough over fruit when you make a galette , but I advise pressing a little at the ends to make sure it 's pretty well-sealed . Once you 've finished shaping , cover the bread with a piece of plastic wrap you 've sprayed with nonstick spray , and let it rise for 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking .
Baking .
Bake the khachapuri in a 375°F . I like to give the dough a quick brush with egg wash all around the edges to help it reach that perfect golden-brownness . Bake the khachapuri until the dough is evenly golden brown and the cheese is melty and lightly browned on the surface . For larger khachapuri , this takes 40 to 50 minutes . For smaller ones , it takes 30 to 35 minutes . ( Note : If you want to add eggs , it 's safe to do it just before baking for smaller khachapuri . For larger ones , add the eggs about 15 to 20 minutes into bake time . )
Serving .
Let the khachapuri cool for 5 to 10 minutes before you serve it , just to make sure you do n't burn yourself on delicious , scalding hot cheese . Rip off pieces of the outer bread and dip it into the center . Once it cools off a bit , go at it as you will .

LV-223 is one of three known moons of the gas giant Calpamos , located in Zeta2 Reticuli . The moon has a large system of mountains , deserts , and valleys .
Contents show ]
Climate
The atmosphere is composed of 71 % nitrogen , 24 % oxygen and 3.7 % carbon dioxide , with traces of argon and other gases . The air on LV-223 is nearly identical to Earth 's atmosphere , but contains a much higher concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) making it toxic for humans to breathe outside ( Earth levels of CO2 currently average about 0.04 % for comparison ) . One of the crew mentions that a human will only survive for two minutes without the necessary equipment to be outside .
Species
It is uncertain if there were any existing life forms before the Engineers arrived . However , at some point , a group of them constructed an outpost on the planet . It is suggested by Janek that it was some type of military base set up by the Engineers to build biological weapons , before an incident compromised their operation . There is also a worm-like lifeform found within which is speculated to have been indigenous to the planet . After going through a mutation process similar to Fifield 's , it 's believed the worm-like lifeforms become the lethal Hammerpede .
Over a century later , a lush jungle had grown over the moon , containing many new species , including monkey-like creatures , Deacon Sharks , and mutated factions of ants . In 2179 , Xenomorphs arrived at the planet with the Onager and quickly adapted to the role of apex predator .
History
At some point approximately 2,000 years before , the Engineers established a temple on LV-223 and initiated a plan to wipe out humanity for reasons unknown by releasing a pathogenic agent known as Chemical A0-3959X.91 – 15 . However , they apparently lost control of it and led the Engineers there to die off . Multiple surviving Engineers preserved themselves hypersleep pods ; four of them took refuge within the Hypersleep Chambers of one of their ships , but only one of these four survived while only a few others were known to be hidden across different sections of the planet .
In 2089 , archeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discovered a star map among several unconnected ancient cultures within a cave during their expedition on the Isle of Skye . They interpreted this as an apparent invitation from the Engineers . Shaw then contacted Peter Weyland , the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation , for a proposal in order to gain enough funding for an expedition to follow the star map . Weyland agreed with the proposal and funded the creation of the scientific vessel USCSS Prometheus to follow the map that led them to LV-223 .
[ The following comic book references can not be viewed as official canon since it has been long-established in Aliens that all the colonists from Hadley 's Hope -save Rebecca `` Newt '' Jorden- were dead , with Carter Burke being responsible for all 157 of them : `` But they will now about it . From me . Just like they 'll know that you are responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists . You sent them to that ship . I just checked the colony log , directive dated 6/12/79 , signed Burke , Carter J . You sent them out there and you did n't even warn them . Why did n't you warn them , Burke ? '' -Ripley , from Aliens . ] In 2093 , after the Prometheus finished its two year voyage , the ship arrived on LV-223 . The Prometheus crew explored the moon 's surface where they came across the Engineer 's structure . The crew entered the structure and discovered the bodies of some Engineers , as well as several Steatite Ampule urns stored within the structure . The crew 's interference caused the pathogen stored within the urns to melt . A few crew members were exposed to the pathogen , and in the ensuing chaos most were killed . The android David successfully found the last living Engineer and informed Weyland , who was secretly aboard the ship the entire time ; he had intended to make contact with the Engineers , hoping that with their advanced technology , they could satisfy his own obsession with searching for immortality . Weyland and his team went to the Engineers ' ship to commune with the last Engineer . However , upon waking , the Engineer decapitated David after a brief conversation and killed Weyland along with the entire party , save Shaw , who managed to escape .
The Engineer reactivated his ship and headed for Earth to carry out his original mission to wipe out the human race . The remaining crew later sacrificed themselves and the Prometheus to destroy the Engineer 's ship . The angered Engineer survived and attacked Shaw within Prometheus ' lifeboat . Shaw released the Trilobite she had extracted earlier from her womb as the result of having sex with Holloway who was infected by the pathogen , which restrained and impregnated the Engineer while Shaw escapes . Shaw recovered David 's remains from the crashed Engineer ship , the two activated another Engineer ship and left LV-223 for the Engineer Homeworld . In the crashed lifeboat , the impregnated Engineer died , birthing a Deacon . In the years that followed , the Steatite Ampules aboard the Engineer ship containing Chemical A0-3959X.91 – 15 spread across LV-223 , accelerating the development of the world 's ecosystem , introducing a ubiquitous assortment of organic life and a breathable atmosphere .
In 2179 , eighty-six years after the Prometheus incident , a Xenomorph outbreak took place on another of Calpamos ' moons , LV-426 , the creatures having been stored away in egg form aboard another Engineer vessel that crashed there long ago . The creatures proceeded to wreak mass havoc on the native human terraforming colony of Hadley 's Hope , and during the chaos , a group of colonists fled in a haste aboard a cargo freighter , the Onager . They did n't realize until much later that they had unwittingly brought several Xenomorph stowaways with them . Because of the ship 's minimal flight range , the colonists were forced to set down on LV-223 . The Xenomorphs on board the Onager subsequently massacred the escapees over the course of several days . The Xenomorphs were then given free reign over the world , and quickly adapted to their new environment .
About forty years later , a second human vessel , the Geryon , arrived at LV-223 as part of a documentary film expedition , with the ulterior motive by the expedition 's captain , Angela Foster , to discover the fate of Peter Weyland and the Prometheus . Setting down on the moon in a number of smaller ships , the team was almost immediately besieged by Xenomorphs , and the situation was further complicated by the infection of the Construct known as Elden by Chemical A0-3959X.91 – 15 , transforming the synthetic into a form of Engineer-hybrid organism which developed an empathic link with the Xenomorphs . Soon after , a clan of Yautja arrived in the system , drawn to the chaos , and ambushed the Geryon and stranded the remaining humans on LV-223 . The conflicts between the different species continued to escalate , during which the two of the surviving Engineers were awakened from stasis and began attacking the other groups , intent on continuing their mission to wipe out humanity .
Eventually , one of the two Engineers was killed and only four humans ( including Foster ) remained alongside a Yautja , Ahab , who formed an alliance with them , remained . The five individuals braved the Xenomorphs and the rogue Elden for a time until they managed to reach temporary safe distance , after which they set up an encampment until a possible rescue .

Two Gas Turbines That Will Boost Power Generation By 50 % Are on Their Way to Egypt
Amidst all the chaos and frustration that followed Egypt 's transitional phase , finally progress and a better future is on the horizon . Siemens has taken one step forward towards delivering on a promise to the great people of Egypt for a better energy infrastructure that will improve the quality of our life .
Following an initial meeting between Egypt 's president , Abd El-Fattah El-Sisi , and Siemens CEO , Joe Kaeser , the global powerhouse and largest engineering company in Europe promised to deliver electricity to Egypt in order to minimize Egypt 's need for new investments as it will utilize and raise the capacity of existing power generation units .
Two H-class gas turbines for the power plant project in Beni Suef have been loaded onto a barge at the Berlin Westhafen port , from where they will be shipped to the Rotterdam seaport to be transported to Beni Suef .
These turbines are the largest in the world and once installed in the combined cycle power plant , Beni Suef will supply over 21 million people with electricity to ensure a better quality of life . Siemens plans on improving the current situation by next year after the three new combined-cycle power plants ( Beni Suef , New Capital and Burullus ) start generating power for the national grid .

Clippers sixth-man Jamal Crawford sat on the bench Friday and watched as J.J. Redick broke his franchise record for 3-pointers made . Crawford 's mark of 161 was set in 2013-14 . Redick now has 164 after sinking 4 of 7 in the 113-99 victory over the Washington Wizards at Staples Center .
Crawford was wearing a suit , not his Clippers uniform , because he was missing his ninth consecutive game with a strained right calf . Coach Doc Rivers said before the game that Crawford has shown improvement . But afterward , Rivers was taken to task about just how uneasy he is regarding Crawford 's status .
“ Well , I 'm concerned , ” he said . “ I mean , make no mistake about that . I mean , I was pretty confident that Blake ( Griffin ) would be back at some point , so I did n't have concern on that . But I do have concern with Jamal ; I 'll say that . ”
Rivers was then asked the million-dollar question : Is it possible Crawford may not return at all this season ?
“ There 's a chance , ” said Rivers , whose team today at 12:30 p.m. plays host to the New Orleans Pelicans . “ You know , I do n't know right now because he 's improved , but not enough , I can tell you that . He 's nowhere near , in my opinion , playing . So we just have to hope he gets better . ”
Crawford is the NBA 's two-time Sixth Man of the Year . He turned 35 Friday , but he 's having a solid season averaging 16.4 points per game .
Speaking of Redick
Redick has now made 164 of 384 from 3-point range this season . That is a terrific 42.7 percent , sixth-best in the league . He was stoked to set the new record , more so because the old one belonged to his pal .
“ I knew I was getting close , ” Redick said . “ I did n't know I was that close , that I was one away ( when the game began ) . Jamal had mentioned something to me two or three weeks ago , when I was at 130-something .
“ It 's cool to break Jamal 's record – a good friend , and a guy I love playing with . Hopefully , I will have many more seasons with the Clippers and challenge this record . ”
Redick admitted he likes having his name in the record book .
“ There is no question , ” he said . “ Any time you ever hold a franchise record , it is a positive . ”
Griffin feeling good
The Clippers ( 45-25 ) are 3-1 since the return of Griffin , who sat out 15 consecutive games with a staph infection in his right elbow . He has averaged 17.7 points , 9.5 rebounds and 5.2 assists in those four games . He 's averaging 22.2 points , 7.7 rebounds and 5.2 assists this season , meaning only his scoring is down some .
Griffin talked about his numbers . But he made it clear that winning is the most significant part of the equation .
“ Stats sometimes can be a little fickle and not tell the whole story , ” he said , “ but the best part is being 3-1 . Winning games , especially this time of year when we only have a handful of games left , I think that is what is most important . But I could be better , so it 's great that we are winning games while I am getting back into it . ”
Scouting the Pelicans
New Orleans enters with a record of 37-32 , having lost its past two games at Phoenix and at Golden State . The Pelicans are ninth in the West , two games behind Oklahoma City . The Clippers were fifth before Saturday 's slate of games .
Star forward Anthony Davis leads New Orleans in scoring , rebounding and blocked shots with respective averages of 24.6 , 10.4 and 2.9 . Davis missed the games at Phoenix and Golden State , however , with an ankle injury . Consider him questionable .
The teams have split two games . The Clippers won 120-100 at Staples Center on Dec. 6 , but the Pelicans – sans Davis – defeated the Clippers 108-103 on Jan. 30 at New Orleans .
Burzum 's Varg Vikernes has been arrested in France , accused of plotting a massacre , according to reports .
Le Monde writes that Vikernes was taken into custody early this morning ( July 16 ) at his farm near the town of Salon-la Tour in the Corrèze département . The arrest was made by the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence , who say they suspect him of `` preparing a massacre '' . According to the press , Vikernes ' French wife and three children live with him on the farm , which is currently being searched for weapons and explosives . UPDATE : apparently Vikernes ' wife is a member of a shooting club , and recently legally purchased four rifles . Reuters reports that officials started investigating Vikernes after the mass murderer Anders Brevik sent him a copy of his manifesto . `` `` That was at the origin of the investigation ... There were several suspicions that made the services fear he could possibly carry out a violent act , '' an official said .
Yet in a vile , anti-Semitic post called War in Europe : Part V in late 2012 , Vikernes ranted in criticism of his actions : `` To Breivik I can only say I hope you do kill yourself .... you have made a big mistake . '' He also writes : `` As long as there are true Europeans alive they will continue to fail , and our European blood makes sure that we can at any time revive the true European spirit and turn Europe into our Elysium again . Today we are on the offensive . For the first time in many decades . The final solution to this problem is not to kill anyone , but to raise our children with European ideals and values , and a European world view , and make sure that Christianity dies out when our coward parent generation dies out . ''
A proposed city charter released Thursday includes new rules allowing Edmonton and Calgary to raise taxes on derelict or polluted properties , cut red tape and create tribunals for parking and transit tickets .
Alberta 's two largest cities have been working with provincial governments since 2012 to develop a charter allowing them to address issues such as transit , affordable housing and climate change .
“ What it actually talks about is positive benefit for generations of Calgarians and Edmontonians , ” Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi told a news conference Thursday in Edmonton .
“ It is , in fact , the most significant change that we have made to municipal-provincial relations in the history of the province . ”
The draft version contains 38 regulations aimed at improving services and attracting investment as well as plans to collaborate on joint concerns and develop an infrastructure funding system based on provincial revenues that Nenshi said will save hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments .
This “ fiscal framework ” would also make cities more accountable for debt and improve administration of the voluntary tourism marketing fee charged by some hotels , but Finance Minister Joe Ceci stressed there are no new taxes or taxation powers .
“ ( The discussions ) have always been around no new taxing powers , ( but about ) being more efficient , having the decision-making closer to the people who are delivering the service . ”
While most of the proposals are intended to clarify laws or improve efficiency , there are recommendations that would let the cities boost maximum fines for serious bylaw offences to $ 100,000 from $ 10,000 and lend residents money for affordable housing projects or energy efficiency upgrades .
Other regulations would let them :
• Use electronic signs to reduce speed limits on busy roads in bad conditions , require drivers to yield to buses , allow back-in angle parking and make other moves not permitted under the Traffic Safety Act .
• Ensure affordable housing agreements remain on a property when it 's sold to make clear that the agreement continues .
• Establish more stringent environmental and energy conservation requirements than existing building codes .
• Send out assessments , tax notices and school support declarations electronically rather than by mail for people who opt in to the system .
• Alter bar operating hours so they close earlier or at staggered times to avoid trouble from throngs of late-night revellers ; however , the hours ca n't be outside the 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. opening times set by the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission .
The draft document is available for public comment until Oct. 10 and is expected to be implemented this fall
The civic ticket tribunals are seen as a way to divert cases away from busy provincial courts . They could find different ways of dealing with infractions than fines , which can create hardship for repeat offenders who ca n't afford to pay .
Officials have for years been seeking ways to pressure owners to clean up or redevelop vacant houses and contaminated brownfields , and the draft rules would allow councillors to create an assessment class for these sites under which they could face higher taxes .
Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson said this power could be used against speculators with rundown or dirty properties that cost the city more for enforcement and maintenance than they pay in taxes .
“ If you have a polluter who 's sitting on a site and refusing to clean it up , and benefitting from the fact that pollution makes it next to worthless … then you need to charge a differential rate . ”
He welcomed a deal he called a significant milestone , which he thinks will eventually be extended to smaller municipalities once all the details are worked out .
“ This agreement fundamentally changes the dynamic between our governments and establishes a more mature working relationship . Edmonton and Calgary are being entrusted with more flexibility , more accountability . ”

Scientists at CERN have today announced that they 're 99.99 % sure that they 've found a new sub-atomic particle , and that it is likely to be the elusive Higgs boson – often referred to as the “ God Particle ” . That 's all well and good , but what does it all mean ? Let 's break it down…
What is the Higgs boson ?
The Higgs boson is a type of particle which is a part of what 's called The Standard Model of particle physics . This is a set of rules that lays out our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the universe .
Dr. Andreas Krassnigg , a physicist with the University of Graz in Austria , explains : “ This Standard Model describes a set of particles from which we can attempt to build the universe as we know it . In addition , it helps us understand what happens in the universe by having a precise picture of the smallest building blocks of matter and their interactions . ”
However , one glaring problem to date has been the lack of proof of the existence of the Higgs boson – this is a key part of the Standard Model and scientists have simply had to assume it exists . If this new particle is the Higgs boson , it will help explain why particles have mass and validate the Standard Model as a true explanation for how the universe is put together .
This video by PHD Comics does a good job to explain the basics of what the Higgs boson is , how it 's been looked for it using CERN 's Large Hadron Collider , and why physicists care so much .
Why is it important ?
Essentially because it proves that our understanding of the basic workings of the universe is correct . If the Higgs boson did n't exist , the Standard Model would be proved incorrect . Its importance led to the “ God Particle ” nickname . Physicist-cum-startup entrepreneur at PeerReach , Nico Schoonderwoerd says that it 's “ A major milestone for the standard model , ” as it validates all the work done , and all the money poured into its discovery .
Krassnigg elaborates : “ Picture the Standard Model as a car . Then you could imagine the Higgs boson to be , or provide , the wheels of that car . It had to be decided experimentally whether or not the car ( our view of particle physics ) actually is as we expected it to be , i.e. , whether it actually does have wheels or not .
“ For our car this is a question of central importance , since it determines what the car can do and how . While not having wheels would not have been a bad thing automatically – there are other fancier ways to move a car around - , it has now turned out that the wheels seem to be there and that this is the way the car moves . ”
Where do we go from here ?
So , if it is the Higgs boson that has been discovered , what does that mean for the future ? CERN 's own announcement noted : “ Positive identification of the new particle 's characteristics will take considerable time and data . But whatever form the Higgs particle takes , our knowledge of the fundamental structure of matter is about to take a major step forward . ”
Krassnigg continues his comparison of the Higgs boson with a car to explain what 's next : “ Measurements and data analysis will continue , since physicists still need to find out in the months and years to come what the wheels are like : everything standard ( i.e . as expected ) or extra-large rims or something even more unexpected ( perhaps on fire ? ) . ”
Just because the Standard Model appears to be validated , does n't mean there is n't a lot more to discover in the field of particle physics , too , as Schoonderwoerd explains : “ The standard model does n't explain gravitation at all . So physicists have been trying to unify the gravitation theory with the Standard Model in advance models with names like Supersymmetry. ” He says that many of the people investigating these theories hope that accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider will continue to run at increasing energy levels , uncovering new particles that may explain how gravity works in a way that fits into the Standard Model .
But how does it affect the rest of us ?
This is all very good for theoretical physicists – but will the discovery affect our every day lives ? While it 's impossible to say if new fields of technology will open up as a result of the discovery of the Higgs boson , Krassnigg points out that “ In addition to the beauty of the process of discovery itself , which is a very rewarding experience , in my opinion the biggest difference to the world we live in are spin-offs coming from CERN or other high-energy physics laboratories with regard to technology. ” Take the World Wide Web , for example , developed at CERN by Sir Tim Berners Lee . Consider the huge amount of work done to develop the Large Hadron Collider – that research could well have uses outside the realm of physics .
Another real-world benefit is people , says Dr Simon George , who is involved in the ATLAS experiment using the Large Hadron Collider ; “ The highly trained PhDs who get snapped up by the private sector , and enthused children who will become our scientists in the future . ”
Whether or not we see technological advancements as a direct result of today 's announcement , perhaps that 's not important . Krassnigg is hugely positive about the wider effect of the work behind it . “ I consider these latest results an excellent and reassuring confirmation of our ( meaning we as a global society ) target-oriented ability to make use of and invest in science and technology . In particular , a lot of amazing work , time , strategic thinking , skill , and creativity were needed to arrive at today 's ‘ state-of-the-art ' announcement . Congratulations to all who contributed ! ”
We agree – congratulations – it 's a good day to be a particle physicist .

Crusader Kings 2 models the hopes , jealousies and paranoid plotting of around 30,000 unique actors , scattered throughout the troubled hierarchies of medieval Europe . From their varying positions of power , they marry , breed , wage wars and bump each other off with splendid selfishness . It 's a pioneering sort of grand strategy soap opera , and it 's about to get thousands of extra cast members .
CK2 's sixth expansion , Rajas of India , will grow the map by 50 % and add 400 new provinces , each with their own cabal of commanders , advisers , vassals children to be traded for political advantage . The rulers of India are mapped to three regional religions , which convey unique socio-economic boons upon their adherents , affecting their war-readiness , stability , and research competence . There 's a new set of regional events to reflect the local festivities of the era , new jungle terrain and , inevitably , war elephants . It 's plenty to be getting on with , but the most impressive thing about the expansion so far is how much of its Paradox are giving away for free .
That massive map increase will be free to everyone with a copy of CK2 , for example . You wo n't be able to play as the new leaders and factions , but you will be able to meet , barter with and assassinate them . The free update also expands Africa with additions to Abyssinia and Nubia - the remnants of a planned future mini-expack that the designers decided to release as a bonus . That 's in addition to Steam Workshop support , Steam multiplayer support , and smaller fixes that the CK2 community have been asking for , like a borderless windowed mode .
Evidently , Paradox are keen to keep their players playing - it 's one of the reasons they love making big , brainy sandbox strategy games with lots of replayability . The free stuff encourages further playthroughs , which encourages more stories , which are inevitably shared online , creating a positive wave of word-of-mouth endorsement from which Crusader Kings 2 has particularly benefited . `` We want to maintain interest in this game , '' says designer Henrik Fåhraeus , `` keep it alive , keep it evolving and see what we can do with it . ''
India was a natural evolution for CK2 , he explains . The feudal systems of medieval Europe fit comfortably with India 's politics at the time , which made it easier to adapt existing systems to the new nation . There are differences , of course . The expansion should offer a more stable and peaceful starting scenario than central Europe . `` The really cool thing about India is that it 's such a pluralistic and tolerant society for its time , '' says Fåhraeus . `` Even in these medieval times with the holy warring going on in the rest of the world , these three old religions of india , the Jain , the Buddhists and the Hindus . They were used to living together , and had been living together for a thousand years , basically , in more-or-less peace . ''
The Nair are the most peaceful of all . Harmonious internal relations make up for a lack of battle-nous . Hindu territories , meanwhile , are good in a ruck and have access to a wide range of creative Cassus Belli ( land and title claims that are used to instigate wars ) , but are hampered internally by the warrior caste 's relationship with the ruling classes . Buddhism 's progressive musings on the nature of the soul and infinity manifests as a potent research boost that 'll let you grow your society quickly .
To reflect India 's tolerant nature , you 'll be able to flit between religions more easily than the vanilla game . `` I might want to start out as a Hindu ruler and conquer stuff , '' Fåhraeus suggests , `` and then I switch over to become a Buddhist to research , and I might end up with the Jain to have a peaceful , stable realm , so my vassals love me . ''
The Buddhist belief system also introduces reincarnation , a particularly interesting addition given CK2 's focus on succession . `` I want to do really cool things about reincarnation , but I 'm not sure how much we 're going to be able to do , '' Fåhraeus says .
`` I want a kid to be born , and people will think he 's the reincarnation of a previous ruler , probably one of the better ones , and then maybe he will actually take on some of those personality traits . ''
I ask if there will be room for players to fabricate reincarnation claims to bestow advantage on your offspring , but the team are worried about presenting the concept in such cynical , power-grabbing terms . `` It 's a little bit dangerous , we 're always stepping on toes . Hindus and Buddhists take this really seriously . I 'm not sure if we want to do that . ''
CK2 's rapid expansion - compounded by fantastic community mods - makes it an all-consuming pastime for avid fans . It was a tremendous story generator on release way back in 2012 , and all the expansions have had to do is add neat new story beats to play with . Rajas of India 's religions should do that nicely , and the extra map space will only make the formerly-squashed Eastern factions more viable . It 's out in Spring .
Netflix talk show host and leftist activist Chelsea Handler stepped up her attacks on White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders this weekend by posting a video featuring an impersonator mocking Sanders 's appearance .
In the video , posted to Handler 's Twitter account , comedian Fortune Feimster wears a wig in an attempt to resemble Sanders as she runs through an exaggerated beauty routine .
“ I used to not know what foundation was , but our great president was kind enough to take me to a Sephora , and he said to the boy , ‘ Hey , you see that fella over there ? Make him a woman , ' ” Feimster-as-Sanders says in one of many digs at the press secretary 's looks in the short clip .
The video comes just a few days after Handler — who recently announced her intention to dedicate herself full time to political activism after Netflix canceled her talk show — first attacked Sanders by calling her a “ harlot ” who wears “ whore lipstick . ”
Handler 's video drew strong condemnation on social media from users who accused the talk show host of hypocrisy , for regularly claiming to be a feminist while denigrating another woman 's appearance .
“ Glad to see how much of a strong feminist you are , by promoting positive body image of other females , ” one user wrote to Handler .
“ This woman deserves to be taken down . She is pure evil , ” Handler replied .
Handler also lashed out at Sanders 's father , former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee , telling her he “ raised a liar . ”
A feminist @ GovMikeHuckabee is someone who supports other women . A feminist is someone who believes the accounts of 15 different women who have similar stories about our President . A feminist does n't discount other women . Your daughter is not a feminist . You raised a liar . — Chelsea Handler ( @ chelseahandler ) December 7 , 2017
This woman deserves to be taken down . She is pure evil . — Chelsea Handler ( @ chelseahandler ) December 8 , 2017
Huckabee appeared on Fox News over the weekend to comment on the attacks on his daughter , explaining that Handler was likely “ jealous ” that Sanders is a “ balanced ” person .
“ She seems to be just in a rage . The sad thing about it , she boasts about the two abortions she had at 16 . I think in many ways she 's jealous of my daughter , ” Huckabee said .
“ My daughter has a husband who loves her and is wonderful to her . My daughter has three delightful children . She 's a happy balanced person , ” he added . “ My daughter has enjoyed life . She 's a pretty straightlaced person . She goes to church and lives a life Chelsea Handler has never known . ”
Handler has regularly used her social media account to attack President Donald Trump , his family members , and administration officials .
Earlier this year , the comedian mocked First Lady Melania Trump by saying she could “ barely speak English , ” and in March , attacked Trump 's then-unborn grandchild in a mocking tweet , misspelling the word , “ genes . ”
She previously described Trump as “ everything that 's wrong in the world . ”
Handler was back to attacking the president on Saturday , calling Trump a “ fraud on the American public . ”
You are a fraud on the American public . You are the least trusted and worst president this country has ever seen . Stop attacking people who tell the truth . You would n't the know the truth if Russia told it to you . # fake election https : //t.co/WMy2l2BVop — Chelsea Handler ( @ chelseahandler ) December 9 , 2017

Qualcomm announced its flagship chipset in the beginning of December at the Snapdragon Technology Summit . According to the latest leak from Weibo , the chipset company from San Diego is preparing three more SoC platforms for 2018 - Snapdragon 670 , Snapdragon 640 and Snapdragon 460 .
The SD670 comes as a successor of the SD660 . The biggest change is the process it is built on - it will be 10nm so it will be more power-efficient . The CPU will have eight cores - 4x Kryo 360 at 2 GHz and 4x Kryo 385 , clocked at 1.6 GHz . The GPU will be Adreno 620 and dual 14-bit Spectra 260 ISP . It will support smartphones with one camera up to 26 MP or a dual setup of 13 MP + 13 MP .
The modem of the Snapdragon 670 is expected to be X16 LTE Cat.16 with a maximum download speed of 1 Gbps and upload speed of 150 Mbps . This chipset might be targeted at upper midrange phones but with such specs , it might act as a sub-flagship platform .
The CPU of the lower tier Snapdragon 640 , will have 2 powerful Kryo 360 cores at 2.15 GHz and six more at 1.55 GHz . GPU will be Adreno 610 , but the ISP will be the same as in the 670 . The modem is listed as X12 LTE with up to 600/150 download/upload speed .
Snapdragon 460 is sharing the same modem as the 640 . Most likely aimed to power the most affordable smartphones , the CPU of the 460 has eight Kryo 360 cores - four at 1.8 GHz and four at 1.4 GHz . The memory has no system cache and the camera could be up to 21 MP with a Spectra 240 ISP . Unlike the other two , this chipset will be built on the 14 nm process technology .

California may be traditionally progressive with a history of protecting reproductive rights , but Imperial County has become a new front in the anti-choice movement 's effort to erode abortion access well outside the confines of GOP-controlled red states .
Imperial County sits on California 's southeastern corner , bordering Arizona and Mexico . Go west and you 'll hit San Diego ; north , and you 'll hit Palm Springs . About 80 percent of the county 's households identify as Latino and 65 percent speak predominately Spanish at home , according to the last census .
Despite its desert landscape , Imperial County has wide swaths of farmland thanks to irrigation fields fed by the Colorado River on its eastern border and the Hoover Dam . Jobs in agriculture account for about a quarter of all employment in the county , and even though the state is in a historic drought , water for the area is all but guaranteed because of local politics .
The same can not be said for reproductive health care , as national anti-choice activists have focused their attentions on a Planned Parenthood health-care facility opening in the valley 's El Centro , California .

“ Imperial Valley statistically is now rated fourth highest in the state for teen births , ” Tracy Skadden , general counsel for Planned Parenthood of Pacific Southwest , told Rewire in an interview . “ It has one of the highest rates of unemployment in California ; the high schools sometimes have day care centers . ”
Skadden said Planned Parenthood agency members spent about five years on the ground in Imperial Valley meeting with members of the community and local organizations to get an understanding of the area 's unique health-care needs before putting together the effort required to open a new facility .
“ We know that they do n't have any reproductive health-care access specifically as it relates to abortion services , ” Skadden said . “ We know that they have very long waits to get in to see a doctor . A lot of the men and women who come to see us , because they do n't have any insurance coverage they really do n't go to doctors very often . ”
“ Some of the women in their 30s and 40s who come to see us have never had a pap smear , ” she continued . Through the Planned Parenthood facility , “ they get wellness checks , they get their cholesterol checked , possibly they get screened for diabetes . We do n't treat those things , but we do refer them to other health-care clinics that can . ”
The El Centro facility is the only one to provide abortion care anywhere in Imperial County . Still , despite a chronically underserved population in need of comprehensive reproductive health care , Planned Parenthood faced what Skadden described as opposition that was “ unprecedented for California ” in opening the new facility in El Centro , the heart of Imperial Valley .
After funds for the new facility had been raised , architectural plans were approved by government officials , and all necessary permits were obtained , Planned Parenthood broke ground and finished building the facility this spring .
Then the protests started .
“ The thing that triggered the protesters from the very beginning was our ‘ now hiring ' sign that we put up under our logo , ” Cita Walsh , vice president of marketing and communication , said in an interview with Rewire . “ When we put the sign up we had hundreds of people apply for jobs at our health center . ”
While the facility applied for a standard transfer agreement for patients with the city-owned El Centro Regional Medical Center , an area church organized about 500 protesters to come to the hospital 's board meeting and complain that by signing the transfer agreement , local officials were “ authorizing abortions to occur in Imperial Valley . ”
The city , in response to the anti-choice backlash , agreed to hire a third-party law firm to review the transfer agreement . That law firm told the city council the transfer agreement was legal and there was no reason the center should not open .
Walsh said that harassment escalated after the transfer agreement was complete , with more than 2,000 anti-choice protesters complaining to the El Centro city council about the opening of the health-care center .
“ The National Right to Life Movement inserted themselves as outsiders into the Imperial Valley in an attempt to embed Imperial County and ignite the local churches and help them organize , ” Walsh said .
National anti-choice activists , from former Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R ) to Alveda King , came to the Valley to raise funds for efforts to stop the clinic 's opening .
“ They brought in people from out of state to try and get the Imperial Valley Coalition for Life funded in order to teach them how to use the Texas playbook , ” Walsh said . The Texas playbook , as described by Walsh , is centered on pressuring local officials into endorsing TRAP ( targeted regulations of abortion providers ) measures .
“ It starts with you try to stop them with transfer agreements and then you have a lot of protesters , ” Walsh said . “ It felt a little like Mississippi or Texas , but right here in California . ”
Days before the facility was set to open , after city officials had told Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest to invite trained staff in to begin setting up , El Centro city officials denied Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest its occupancy permit on the grounds that the building had been improperly classified and would need significant , additional upgrades before opening .
No other comparable facility in California is subject to the more burdensome requirements city officials want to impose on the El Centro facility .
The decision to reclassify the building just prior to its opening was made by El Centro Fire Chief Kenneth Herbert . Herbert explained to Rewire in an email that architects made the initial occupancy classification , but that “ [ b ] ased upon conditions observed , ” he decided the building needed more stringent requirements and denied fire clearance .
Herbert declined to elaborate on what conditions he observed that prompted his decision that the facility needed a more stringent classification . He told Rewire that since the initial permit denial , there have been changes made to the building in an attempt to comply with the “ occupancy classification B requirements. ” After a five-week delay , the city issued the facility a temporary certificate of occupancy .
In other words , the state-of-the-art health-care facility meets all the health and safety requirements it was required to all along .
In signing the licensing document , however , Herbert put in special conditions for their license to remain in place , Skadden said . One condition provides the fire chief with the authority to revoke the document pending a review of the building code by the state 's Fire Marshall Department . Herbert has requested from the State Fire Marshall 's office “ a formal interpretation of the occupancy based on the use of the building. ” That process could take up to 90 days .
“ We complied with all the building , fire , and safety requirements for licensure , but the City of El Centro fire chief made an arbitrary and unilateral decision to deny our final documentation , ” Skadden said . “ The dispute is over a California building code . But it was clear this was about our abortion services . ”
Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest successfully fought back this round of challenges to providing reproductive health care in Imperial County , but more challenges lie ahead . The Imperial Valley Coalition for Life reported on its Facebook page that “ friends ” of its organization purchased the property right next to the new Planned Parenthood clinic .
The anti-choice group charged that the property is now “ available to our prayer warriors from the 365 days for life to park and to pray and it will be available for sidewalk counseling also . ”
Meanwhile , those opposed to legal abortion care continue to protest outside the El Centro facility . “ We 've had some vandalism already , but we are very vigilant with our security and our number-one priority is to the safety of our patients and staff , ” Skadden said . “ California has a long history of protecting reproductive rights , which , thankfully , we were able to rely on our safety and health codes and our California Constitution and other laws that do protect reproductive health care . ”
The hope for Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest is that the political fight to provide reproductive health care in Imperial Valley is over . “ We intend [ to ] provide health care in Imperial Valley and to work with the city , ” Skadden said . “ We all have a mutual goal of increasing the health outcomes of the community in Imperial Valley . ”
BOSTON ( CBS ) — Tom Brady has found another way to etch his name into the record books .
With three touchdowns and zero interceptions on Sunday 's victory in Miami , Brady increased his season totals to 28 touchdowns and just two interceptions . In doing so , he set a new record for the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the history of the NFL .
That record applies to quarterbacks with at least 20 passing touchdowns .
Nick Foles previously held the record , having thrown 27 touchdowns and two interceptions back in 2013 for the Philadelphia Eagles .
Brady now has the best and third-best seasons with regard to TD-to-INT ratio , as he threw 36 touchdowns and four interceptions in the 2010 season .
The Patriots ' quarterback missed the first four games of the 2016 season , forced to sit out due to his alleged role in the “ DeflateGate ” controversy . But since returning to action in Week 5 , he 's performed at arguably the highest level of his Hall of Fame career .
On Sunday in Miami , Brady completed 25 of his 33 passes ( 75.8 percent ) for 276 yards , three touchdowns , and no interceptions . He threw the three touchdowns to three different receivers — Martellus Bennett , Michael Floyd and Julian Edelman .
The touchdown to Floyd pushes Brady closer to setting another record , as it was the 65th receiver to catch a touchdown from Brady . Vinny Testaverde owns the NFL record for the highest number of different receivers to catch touchdowns with 70 .
With the win , Brady and the Patriots secured the No . 1 seed in the AFC and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs .
In addition to Brady 's personal record , the Patriots set a team record for the fewest interceptions thrown in a season ( with a minimum of 500 pass attempts ) . Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett combined to throw 118 passes without throwing an interception this season . With Brady 's and Garoppolo 's passing touchdowns combined , the Patriots ' team TD-to-INT ratio of 32-to-2 is also a new record .
Brady also passed Dolphins legend Dan Marino on the all-time passing yards list , moving into No . 4 all time with 61,582 yards .

Netflix is paving the path for next-generation pay-TV . Late last year , Netflix cemented a deal with Disney , which will give its streaming media service exclusive rights to Disney 's content for at least three years starting in 2016 . The deal effectively yanked the rug out from under pay-TV service , Starz , putting it in direct competition with similar services such as HBO and Showtime . Now , a recent statement from Netflix confirms that it has more rug-yanking planned as it has now inked a similar deal with The Weinstein Company ( TWC ) .
According to the statement , the deal is similar to Netflix 's deal with Disney in that it will get exclusive rights and quick access to first-run movies from TWC . Previously , this exclusive deal belonged to pay-TV service Showtime , an arrangement which began in 2009 .
Netflix already has some of TWC 's content available now , including titles such as Academy Award winning Best Picture , The Artist , and Best Documentary Feature , Undefeated . But beginning in 2016 , Netflix will become the exclusive pay-TV portal through which TWC 's first-run films can be viewed . Forthcoming TWC titles include The Grandmaster , Salinger , and Vampire Academy .
Lest there be any question around Netflix 's intentions to dominate the pay-TV space , Ted Sarandos , Chief Content Officer for Netflix stated , “ We look forward to reinventing the pay TV window with the Weinsteins. ” But these recent deals are just part of Netflix 's overall strategy to redefine TV amid the company of some highly-resistant Stalwarts of media . Netflix 's efforts to produce original content are also bearing serious fruit . Both Orange Is The New Black , and House of Cards are being met with critical acclaim , and the latter of the two has racked up nine Emmy nominations .

By
By now , Green Bay Packers receiver Ty Montgomery thought he would be back on the football field , a place he misses an awful lot .
Montgomery , once a promising rookie , has done a lot of standing and watching over the past 10 months . He still has n't returned from ankle surgery late last season , a procedure that knocked out his entire offseason program . Montgomery said he was “ hopeful ” to return for the start of training camp , but instead was one of six players on the physically unable to perform list .
“ That 's what I was pushing for , ” Montgomery said , “ but at the end of the day , my body has the final say . If it 's not looking quite right or quite the way where they want me to be , then just take it day by day . And then whenever I 'm ready , I 'm going to be ready to go . ”
The ankle feels “ great , ” Montgomery said . He used the word “ precautionary ” to describe his appearance on the PUP list . Regardless , if the second-year receiver was able to practice , he would .
Montgomery , a 2015 third-round pick , has already missed a critical chunk of time for his development . Coach Mike McCarthy often discusses the improvements a player can make from his first to second season . Perhaps the biggest reason is second-year players benefit from going through the team 's entire offseason program for the first time .
This spring , Montgomery was forced to stand and watch through the entire offseason program . Limited physically , he could n't get the same benefit . At least not in a traditional sense .
Montgomery tried to compensate in different ways . A “ key component , ” he said , was living in Green Bay permanently . He rehabbed with trainers , lifted weights , even took up boxing for cardiovascular workouts .
“ Just being around the facilities , ” Montgomery said , “ being around the trainers . I see the coaches every now and then . Being around some of the guys really just kept me mentally with Green Bay . Because I 'm here every day , I 'm always thinking about plays . I 'm always thinking about how we do things . I 'm always thinking about what I can do to make myself better .
“ Training here , I think , was probably the best thing for me . ”
Montgomery admitted his rookie season was frustrating . Before his ankle injury , he had two touchdowns in his previous three games . He was earning a role for himself in the Packers offense . Building chemistry with quarterback Aaron Rodgers . Flashing his potential .
Now , he hopes to pick up where he left off – whenever he returns .
Montgomery said there 's no target date for when he 'll be back on the practice field . On camp 's first day , coach Mike McCarthy said he expects each of his PUP members to return during camp . Whenever he 's back , Montgomery will be in the midst of an intense position battle . He 's one of seven receivers who could make the 53-man roster . Usually , the Packers keep five .
No wonder Montgomery misses the field so much . Still , Montgomery said , he remains patience . No matter when he returns , he knows the most important thing is being healthy .
“ Physically , I feel like the work I put in this offseason , ” Montgomery said , “ is going to allow me to be ready . I will say that the guys that are able to practice right now fully , those guys are the ones building rhythm . They 're building some chemistry . That 's not something that needs months or anything .
“ I 'm still here . I 'm in meetings , I 'm talking to everyone every day . I 'm just not really practicing with them . I 'm seeing things , so I do n't think it 's going to be that big of an issue . ”
Guelph City Council has officially rejected online voting for the next municipal election .
At a meeting that started Monday night and lasted over six hours , council voted 7-6 against a motion to have online voting available for the advance polls in 2018 .
It echoed a 7-5 vote at a Committee of the Whole meeting several weeks ago , a meeting that Mayor Cam Guthrie could n't attend .
Guelph had online voting available for the first time at the advance polls in 2014 election .
Voting against online voting were councillors Bob Bell , Karl Wettstein , Leanne Piper , Phil Allt , James Gordon , June Hofland and Mike Salisbury .
Voting in favour were councillors Cathy Downer , Christine Billings , Mark MacKinnon , Dan Gibson , Andy Van Hellemond and Mayor Guthrie .
Monday 's meeting included 15 delegates , 13 of them speaking against online voting at this point .
Those delegates included the usual rogue 's gallery of council-watching regulars , but they also included two individuals with a much more in-depth knowledge of cybersecurity and online voting issues .
Aleksander Essex , a Western University professor with an expertise is online voting , told council that “ we are all in uncharted territory here ” when it comes to online voting .
He said there are “ insufficient advances in the technology to implement it at this time . ”
“ I ca n't tell you what to think , ” Essex said . “ You are faced with an unenviable balancing act . ”
Dave Suffling , who works for a private cybersecurity company , also spoke out against online voting at this time .
“ I would like to tell you what you want to hear , but I have to tell you what you need to hear , ” Suffling said in speaking against online voting .
Others also spoke out against online voting .
“ Can we be assured that ( online ) voting is a level playing field ? ” asked George Kelly .
Lin Grist said she is opposed to online voting “ at this time . ”
“ Voting in an election is not like shopping for groceries , ” she said , saying it 's about protecting the democratic process , not convenience .
Former city councilor Maggie Laidlaw said council was “ naive ” when it gave the go-ahead to advanced online voting for the 2014 municipal election .
“ Guelph has been ahead of the pack with many innovative ideas , but online voting should not be one of them , ” Laidlaw said . “ It will come , but not yet . ”
Hugh Whiteley spoke of the lack of community engagement on the issue before decisions were made .
Not all delegates were in favour of no online voting .
Jason Dodge , speaking on behalf of the Guelph Accessibility Advisory Committee ( GAAC ) , urged council to provide online voting in 2018 . He said to remove the option will put up a barrier for those people .
“ In the 2014 election people with a disability were thrilled to be able to vote online , ” Dodge said , adding that there is an element of risk no matter what the voting method .
Brad Howcroft , chairperson of the GAAC , said fraud is possible no matter what the method .
“ There 's so many people that need this system , ” said Howcroft , who later admitted that he would be willing to look at other options .
“ Small things to you guys are huge to us , ” Howcroft said in stressing the importance of being allowed the voting accessibility that online voting allowed .
Laura Root , who has a disability , also asked that online voting by maintained .
She said those opposed seem centred on “ what ifs . ”
“ My right to vote is so much more important than ‘ what if ? ' ” Root said .
Mayor Cam Guthrie opened Monday 's meeting with an apology for remarks he made two weeks ago in which he accused some councilors in a GuelphToday article of “ suppressing ” voters by taking a stand against online voting .
Downer pointed out that 97 municipalities in the last election chose to use online voting .
Downer also asked city clerk Stephen O'Brien why he was so confident about online voting .
“ We recognize that there are potential risks in a paper ballot process like there are in online voting process and we try our best to mitigate those risks , ” O'Brien said .
“ I truly believe that our job is to understand the risks and do our best to mitigate those risks . ”
Coun . Dan Gibson believes internet voting was part of the reason Guelph saw a 10 per cent increase in voter turnout in the 2014 election over the previous one .
“ I 've seen that the voter turnout increased and I 'm fearful that we 're going to go back to the days of 34-35 per cent ( voter turnout ) , ” Gibson said .
Coun . Christine Billings said not having online voting “ would be an injustice ” to those with accessibility issues .
“ The only valid argument for online voting that I have heard is the issue of accessibility for those that need it , ” Coun . Bob Bell said . “ For me , what 's important is that we protect the integrity of the process . ”
Coun . James Gordon said that those that have expressed caution regarding online voting “ did the research . ”
Coun . June Hofland said the democratic process was much more important than the convenience of online voting .
“ I believe we need to maintain the integrity of our voting process and I believe that internet voting compromises that integrity , ” Hofland said .

Essential Reading :
Within days , emergency services were gearing up for a threatening east coast low . Last Friday , long-time coastal engineer and adviser Angus Gordon was on the phone to Stokes , warning , `` Rob , I hope I 'm wrong , but I think 1974 is coming . '' He was referring to the monster storm that battered the NSW coast including Sydney four decades ago . Collaroy 's beach front houses were among those hardest hit by this year 's big storm . Credit : AAP By Sunday , Stokes - as with many across eastern Australia - was fending off rising water levels from the deluge , later telling 2UE : `` The full ferocity of nature was just hurled at us and everyone is reeling from it . '' In his usual low-key manner , Stokes would join hundreds late into Tuesday night laying sandbag defences around exposed homes along Collaroy-Narrabeen 's battered shore as the high tide and huge swell persisted . Storm surprises
Coogee Surf Life Saving Clubhouse hit by massive waves during the storm . Credit : Peter Rae Others with an even longer view of the coastal risks , such as Bruce Thom , a professor emeritus at Sydney University , were also out on Sunday , but trying to glean lessons about east coast lows rather than mopping up . NSW typically has seven or eight of the storms forming just off the coast and , depending on how they move , they can expose vulnerabilities - both physical and social . Thom , a coastal geomorphologist , has been accumulating knowledge about the impact of the worst of the tempests since his childhood when an event blew out windows of a nearby school in 1946 . Still , last weekend 's storm that caused flooding and coastal erosion in a huge arc stretching from south-east Queensland to even New Caledonia and all the way south to Tasmania , bore some surprises too .
Out photographing damage , Thom was impressed by the height of the storm surge within Sydney Harbour that revealed risks facing even relatively secluded coves such as Watsons Bay . `` Boats were being pushed onto the shore , '' he said . Also unexpected was the damage to the Surf Life Saving Club at Coogee , which was built on a rock ledge considered to be out of reach of wave strikes . So , too , the landslip at Waverley Cemetery . `` None of us had thought of that , '' said Thom , who has advised policymakers at all levels for decades including the Baird government , which just last month passed the first overhaul of the state 's coastal management laws since 1979 . The new act - and the supporting coastal maps and State Environment Planning Policies that Stokes will most likely release later this year - will no doubt receive greater scrutiny after the scale of devastation wrought this week .
Of interest too will be the emerging threat to estuaries , with the Georges and Hawkesbury river mouths among those likely to get more attention . Analysts within Planning and the Office of Environment and Heritage say initial assessments of the damage suggest there is little need to adjust the 15 known hot spots facing coastal erosion from events such as east coast lows . In Sydney they are Collaroy-Narrabeen , Mona Vale and Bilgola Beach . The hotspots are defined as areas where five houses or more , or a public road , are at an immediate risk from a major storm , according to a 2010 assessment .

Despite the media focus on the strip of houses crumbling into the sea at Collaroy and Narrabeen on Sydney 's northern beaches - and the subsequent red-hot blame game over an approved sea wall that was n't built - the focus of the impact was one of the least of the surprises from the tempest if not perhaps for some of the residents . `` The areas where the worst erosion occurred in the June 2016 storm event were within coastal erosion hot spots , '' the OEH told Fairfax Media . In fact , the Narrabeen-Collaroy beach is among the most studied parts of the Australian coast because of its peculiar combination of vulnerability and settlement patterns . Coastal engineer Ian Turner , director of the Water Research Laboratory at the University of NSW , says there was `` absolutely no surprises '' about the damage the high tides , fanned by the storm system , had wreaked on the beachfront properties . The beach had been monitored for about 40 years , more intensely than any other in Australia , he said .
Giant event Collaroy beach narrowed by 50m . Credit : Peter Rae The forces of nature on show were remarkable . The Narrabeen-Collaroy beach narrowed by as much as 50 metres and surrendered about 400,000 cubic metres of sand to the seas . Although the known erosion hotspots account for just 30 kilometres of the state 's 2000-kilometre coastline - and perhaps 200 high-risk properties - the damage bill can still be huge . And as OEH told Fairfax Media , the frequency , intensity and duration of storm events are predicted to increase due to climate change , so threatened areas are likely to swell in number and size even before expected population growth along our much-loved coasts .
`` Wherever there are houses sitting on the sand dunes in Sydney , it 's just as likely to happen [ as last weekend 's storms ] , '' Turner said . `` It 's up and down the whole Sydney coast - wherever there is infrastructure , be that roads or surf clubs or power lines . '' Wettest day on record Homes and public assets certainly came in for a huge hammering , not least from the the sheer volume of rainfall dumped along Australia 's coast . `` It looks like , on an area-averaged basis , eastern NSW had its wettest day on record [ for the 24 hours to 9am on Sunday ] , '' Blair Trewin , a senior climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology , said . Of NSW 's 20 coastal river catchments , 19 recorded at least 70mm of rain on Sunday alone , with only the Hunter flowing into Newcastle spared .
`` It thinks it would be highly unusual , perhaps unprecedented , '' Trewin said , adding that most east coast lows generate more tightly centred storms , affecting a 200-300-kilometre range at one time . Trewin noted warmer than average sea-surface temperatures increased the amount of moisture available for the storm to tap , creating sub-tropical conditions quite abnormal for early winter . Indeed , sea-surface temperatures for May in the Tasman Sea were unprecedented . ( See bureau chart below of temperature deviation from the long-term averages . ) Temperatures on land were also exceptionally warm during the height of the storm , with Sydney 's 16.3-degree minimum on Sunday likely to be among the city 's 10 warmest on record for June .
Further south , Launceston , Hobart and a slew of other Tasmanian sites notched record warm overnight temperatures on Monday , Trewin said . Climate researchers , such as Acacia Pepler , a PhD student focusing on east coast lows , say that a warming planet will most likely reduce the number of such storms at least during winter . That 's because conditions for their formation will be less favourable as parts of the atmosphere become more stable . However , as the atmosphere can hold about 7 per cent more moisture for each degree of warming , rain from storms is likely to become more intense when they do form , scientists say . Storm surges The weekend 's storm had other special features that amplified its impact . Though spawning less powerful waves than the 1974 blast , the damage was made worse because the recent storm coincided with the highest tides of the year , Alex Zadnik , a meteorologist with Weatherzone , said .
The seven-metre swell generated by the storm as winds piled the waves up was topped up by the 2.05-metre tide , as well as a roughly 25-centimetre storm surge linked to the low pressure . ( Each drop of 1 hectopascal of atmospheric pressure lifts local sea level about one centimetre . ) The direction of the waves from the north-east - including the longevity of the event - was also unusual . ( See chart below showing how the swell 's generation zone extended approximately 1500 kilometres from the Coral Sea to the NSW coast . ) `` The north-east to easterly waves observed over the weekend are the largest ever recorded from those directions offshore of Sydney , which has one of the most extensive long-term records of directional waves in the world , '' David Taylor , managing director of engineering firm Baird Australia , said . While the nor'easterly winds and waves were unusual , their impact on beaches such as Collaroy-Narrabeen was much as might be expected , said Angus Gordon , an engineer who oversaw beach replenishment efforts after the 1974 storm and has advised Stokes on the new coastal management plans .
An offshore kilometre-long sub-sea reef about five to eight metres high `` serves as a very large lens '' to refract the waves onto known parts of the nearby beach , Gordon said . `` The community memory fades … we do n't have regular disasters , '' Gordon said , likening the tendency to building in areas known to be at threat from floods or bushfires . `` It 's one of those societal problems - people just believe the risk does n't exist . '' 'Wicked ' problem NSW Planning Minister and the member for Pittwater Rob Stokes . Credit : Steven Siewert Stokes has sought to address a range of those issues as architect of the new coastal bill , which subtly replaced `` protection '' from the 1979 act 's title with `` management '' .
The minister brought notable expertise to the role . As a former planning lecturer at Macquarie University , he wrote papers on the `` wicked '' planning problems facing areas such as Narrabeen in 2003 and 2011 and has lived much of his life in the area . `` If you went back 100 years , none of these houses would have been here [ knowing what we know now ] '' , he told Fairfax Media . The new act , which passed Parliament without a division , is ambitious . For the first time anywhere in the world , Gordon and Thom said , the act takes into account both the offshore sand and other sediment formations , and the natural beach fluctuation . The coastal strip will also be mapped to identify vulnerable areas as well as vital assets such as remnant rainforests and wetlands that must be conserved - ideally done well before another major storm . Councils will have access to $ 83.6 million over five years to develop management programs that will be audited by an expert panel reporting to the planning minister .
Importantly , the plan will also extend to estuaries - where the number of homes at risk from floods linked to east coast lows is at least 10 times the 200-plus houses known to be at direct threat from coastal erosion . Climate change will amplify those threats too . `` In the past , we never had cost-benefit analyses underpinning the decisions , '' Stokes said . `` Now [ councils ] will have to do them . '' That means , for instance , if a community wants a sea wall it will have to determine who benefits and who pays , including for the beach replenishment likely to be required over time . Sometimes - but not always - benefits of a wall , including added protection to local residents and key public assets such as roads , will outweigh the distorting effects on waves that would potentially expose other areas to risk . Past errors
What the government wants to avoid is repeats of past errors when , particularly after a major storm , locals threw up poorly designed structures or even deposited boulders or sandbags that merely turned into hazards in the next tempest . Thom , for instance , recalls councils in the 1970s dumping hundreds of car bodies in futile attempts to protect the beach , only to introduce beach hazards that can remain for decades . For Collaroy resident Garry Silk , the changes have come a couple of years too late . Silk said that , when he bought his waterfront home in 2013 , he was aware of the risks but hoped a uniform sea wall would soon be installed by the council . By midweek , Silk had not been able to examine the full extent of the damage to his property but knew his garden was destroyed and his balcony left hanging after the high tides . There is no sea wall in front of Silk 's home and he believes the individual barriers that residents had built over past decades had increased the impact of the tides on his property . He had been willing to contribute to a new wall if councils and residents had been able to agree . `` I 'm upset , but the past is the past . Clearly we would have liked it to be done before but the reality is it has n't and now is the time to act , '' Silk said .
Cluster risk Time may become an issue in other ways that could expose the state 's vulnerabilities . East coast lows are most frequent in June , and another big storm in coming weeks is possible before beaches naturally recover and flood-hit catchments dry out , raising the risks to known or unknown threats . Sydney 's reservoirs are also sitting at about 97 per cent full , including the giant Warragamba Dam .
`` This is the time of the year when we are mostly likely to have a big east coast low , '' Pepler said , noting June 2007 had five such events , including the storm that sent the Pasha Bulker ship ashore near Newcastle . `` If we saw another storm of [ last weekend 's ] intensity in the next couple of weeks we would have some significantly serious issues right along the NSW coast , '' Geoff Withycombe , Sydney Coastal Councils Group executive officer , said .

New England Patriots safety Nate Ebner will make his return to rugby in the Hong Kong 10s as he looks to secure a spot in the USA Sevens side for Rio 2016 .
Ebner has taken a leave of absence from his NFL duties at the Patriots to focus on rugby as he chases his dream of competing in the Olympics . He has been in training with the USA Sevens team but will play his first competitive action in a 10s tournament at the Hong Kong Football Club which takes place across Apr . 6-7 .
He will play for the Samurai side in the centres in a team including four England sevens players -- James Cordy-Redden , Cameron Cowell , Ben Foley , John Brake -- and Canada 's Hubert Buydens , who captained the side in the recent Americas Rugby Championship .
`` We have a great relationship with [ England Sevens head coach ] Simon Amor and England Sevens that has rolled over from my days as team manager and we 're so pleased that he agreed to release a few of his contracted players for us for the GFI HKFC 10s , '' Samurai boss Terry Sands said . `` To then get a call from [ USA Sevens head coach ] Mike Friday to confirm that Nate Ebner was available was the icing on the cake for us in our 20th anniversary year . ''
It will be Ebner 's first competitive rugby action since 2012 when he was drafted by the Patriots . Prior to that he featured for the USA Sevens side and played XV rugby in international age-grade tournaments .
The Hong Kong 10s has a rich history of featuring some of the biggest names in the sport . Seven of the All Blacks squad that won the 2015 World Cup have played in the competition while the likes of Wallabies legend Joe Roff , the great Jonah Lomu and Sevens master Waisale Serevi have all run out in the Hong Kong 10s since the inaugural tournament in 1986 .
As hobbies go , knitting is hardly the one we 'd most like to take up . Yeah , it 's neat to be able to see a glove or a sweater take shape through your own handiwork , but here 's the thing : Western society has , for Cthulhu-knows how long , classified it as one of the most un-macho activities ever devised . It is a notion that could not be drummed into our collective head more emphatically if the reanimated-by-a-caffeine-burning-fission-reactor corpse of Keith Moon was thumping the skins .
However , that ca n't stop us from appreciating the work that goes into knitted and crocheted creations . But clothing is n't very exciting , is it fellas ? Not exciting like , say , the giant Ferrari tribute seen here .
Created by British artist Lauren Porter , this roughly life-sized replica of an F355 Berlinetta ( one of our favorite V8 Ferraris of all time , it must be said ) is actually made from 240 knitted squares that are pieced together over a metal frame . All told , about 12 miles ( ! ) of yarn were used , but not an inch went to waste , as this Fauxrrari has all the correct badges , lights , five-spoke wheels , and even the windshield wipers of the real car .
Porter , for her part , is well aware of knitting 's reputation as a dull , feminine hobby . In fact , as she explains , she made this Ferrari ( over the space of 10 months ) to challenge that stereotype :
“ I created a Ferrari because it is instantly recognisable and the opposite of what people expect from something that is knitted . Bringing binary opposites together results in the work becoming appealing to a mixture of audiences . I want as many people as possible to see and enjoy my work — including those who would n't ordinarily go to an art gallery . ”
Well , we can honestly say that we do n't usually go to art galleries , but we would for this thing . Heck , we 'd love to see a museum dedicated solely to car art . Just do n't hire the blokes from Top Gear to run it , ‘ kay ?

It is a fact that Luis Suárez is banned from playing official matches until the end of October , but he 's now allowed to train with Barcelona . He can also play friendlies . There 's one in the schedule , now .
Barça coach Luis Enrique scheduled a practice match against Barça B on Wednesday afternoon to give Suárez a taste of competition , instead of just training until he 's able to play an official match . All first team players who did n't travel with their national teams will play , except for Lionel Messi , Andrés Iniesta and Thomas Vermaelen , still nursing injuries .
Along with Suárez , goalkeeper Marc-André Ter Stegen could get a few minutes , now that he 's been given the green light by team doctors to resume full activity with the squad .
Enrique plans to schedule other friendlies in the future to give Suárez more playing time . Luisito is expected to make his official Barcelona debut in El Clásico against Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabéu , on October 26 . Until then , his coach wants to make sure that the Biting Machine is as ready as possible .
A nursery worker from Little Diamonds was attacked in the street ( Picture : Ggogle Street View )
A nursery worker was slashed after being attacked by three women who shouted ‘ Allah will get you ' , a colleague has said .
The woman was set upon as she travelled to work at a nursery in Wanstead , north east London .
Homeless man doused in water by rail staff is a convicted killer
Karrien Stevens , who runs Little Diamonds in Hermon Hill , said the attackers ran away when someone approached them .
She said : ‘ When she got to work we could n't believe it and called the police straight away . It 's terrible . I 'm absolutely horrified . '
A colleague , who did not want to be named , said the victim had ‘ three Asian girls behind her chanting the Koran , and saying ‘ Allah ' .
She added : ‘ They pulled her to the ground , punched her , kicked her . One of them pulled out a knife and cut her arm from her wrist to her elbow .

‘ The police turned up , the ambulance cleaned her wounds up . '
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they were called at 9:36am on Wednesday to reports of an assault in Hermon Hill .
He said : ‘ Officers and London Ambulance Service attended and found a woman , aged in her 30s , with a slash wound . Her injuries are not life-threatening .
‘ She has been taken to an east London hospital as a precaution . The suspects fled the scene prior to police arrival in an unknown direction .
‘ No arrests have been made . Enquiries continue . '
‘ Counter-terror officers are aware of the incident but it is not being treated as terrorism at this stage , ' the Met spokesman added .
The victim , described as a white woman , was attacked by three women ‘ dressed all in black ' less than 10 minutes ' walk from the nursery at around 9.30am , her colleague said .
She insisted the incident was not related to the nursery or their work .
Asked about her colleague 's condition , she added : ‘ She 's okay , considering . Obviously it 's a shock , she 's in shock . She was in tears and she had a cut right up her arm .
‘ Her stomach was hurting , she had marks all over her , her hair was pulled out . '

In France , there wages a ( bizarre and perhaps unintentional ) war among the country 's anti-gay groups . In this war , there is apparently a race to to be , at once , more homoerotic and more homophobic than the next anti-gay group . Today we meet La Manif Pour Tous , who decided a bunch of very fit shirtless men straddling a giant pole is the best way to flaunt their anti-gay stance .
`` Shirtless guys ... on top of one another ... clutching a giant pole ... in pink shorts and those guys are protesting gay marriage ? This has to be some kind of joke , '' your brain is probably telling you . But we kid you not . Those men are holding the logo La Manif Pour Tous , an anti-gay group in France , and are featured on the group 's Facebook page . And while those boys look like an ad for a gay adult summer camp , this trend of homoerotic homophobia is actually going on in France .
France legalized same-sex marriage this past May , and has seen a bevy of protests and clashes between supporters and opponents . That big gay vs. anti-gay battle has been punctuated by protests from the anti-gay group Hommen , whose members look rather like the gay men they 're protesting against :
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) said Sunday that Congress ' upper chamber would give President Barack Obama expedited authority to negotiate major trade deals `` later this week , '' despite strong opposition from members of the president 's party .
The Senate voted to open debate on trade promotion authority last week . The issue is shaping up to be the most significant intra-party battle of Obama 's second term , but the president has found support for his trade agenda among the Senate 's Republican leadership . Fast-track authority would allow Obama to present the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and other deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote , meaning legislators could n't offer amendments . The TPP is a proposed free trade arrangement among 12 countries bordering the Pacific rim .
`` The president has done an excellent job on this , '' McConnell said in an interview with ABC 's `` This Week . '' `` I point out to my members who are somewhat squeamish , as you can imagine , giving the president the power of any issue , given his expansive view of his powers on so many other issues . But this is a trade promotion authority not just for President Obama , but for the next president as well . This is a six-year trade promotion authority bill that will give the next president an opportunity to enter into additional trade agreements with other countries around the world . ''
McConnell had previously described his coordination with the president on trade as `` an out-of-body experience . ''
Fast-track authority faces a significantly more difficult path in the House . Nearly all Democrats are opposed , as is a strong contingent of Republicans , who are hesitant to hand Obama a victory .
And yet Rep. Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , was confident Sunday that the measure would pass the lower chamber .
`` We will have the votes , '' Ryan said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` We 're doing very well . We 're gaining a lot of steam and momentum . ''
Presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has so far remained quiet on TPP . While progressive groups want Clinton to come out against the trade deal , other Democrats want her to support it .
A 57-year-old Italian conman was recently arrested and charged with fraud and document forgery , after its was revealed that he had been posing as a member of the Montenegro Royal Family for years . His con was so elaborate that he had even managed to fool many real royals and celebrities .
The man , whose real identity has not yet been revealed , called himself “ His Imperial and Royal Highness Stefan Cernetic , Hereditary Prince of Montenegro , Serbia and Albania ” , and claimed to be a descendant of the Roman emperor Constantine , and the head of the Montenegrin royal family . He travelled all around Europe in a black Mercedes sporting Montenegrin flags and fake royal insignia , and stayed in luxury hotels , free of charge . To make his claims even more believable , Cernetic set up a website and several social media accounts , where he regularly posted photos of him alongside known royals , like Prince Albert of Monaco , and members of famous aristocratic families , like Savoy , Hapsburg and Hohenzollern .

On his website , Prince Cernetic described himself as “ the head of the family that ruled Montenegro , Albania and Serbia from the XIV century to the second half of the XVIII century , ” and published “ family trees , photographs and illustrations of medals , seals , coats of arms and legal rulings ” . It all looked very impressive , but according to Italian police officers who had been investigating him for more than a year , it was all just “ nonsense ” .

However , his elaborate con proved very effective for many years . He attended receptions organized by real royal families – just two weeks a go , he shared a table with Princess Irena of Greece and Denmark , in Athens – met with bishops at the Vatican , and attended lavish parties on yachts . Emilio Morani , mayor of the Italian town of Monopoli , even through a reception in his honour , a while back , after Cernetic promised to promote the town to businessmen in his country . But perhaps his greatest achievement was getting Pamela Anderson to kneel before him .

In June 2015 , Prince Stefan Cernetic awarded Anderson the title of “ Countess ” in a solemn ceremony that saw the Hollywood actress kneel before the Montenegrin prince to receive the honour . She was also named “ Great Lady of Montenegro ” and her children received the title of knights . “ Your Majesty , I 'm truly honoured and grateful for this recognition of the Imperial house of Montenegro and I am moved by your generosity , ” Pamela Anderson said .

To convince people that he was royalty , His Imperial and Royal Highness Stefan Cernetic even had an Honorary Consul , who travelled around Europe as an ambassador of the Royal House of Montenegro . His name was Maurice Andreoli , and like Cernetic , he was a total fake . But you could n't tell by looking at his formal attire and forged documents . He was a very believable character , and even got coverage in a major French newspaper , in April of this year , as “ the honorary consul of a slave prince ” .

“ The truth is he is not from the Balkans , but from Trieste and his parents were Italian , ” Italian police said about Cernetic , after his arrest . “ But he was just amazingly good at playing the part . He was getting paid to attend public events and even had his own brand of wine . ”
Photo : Prince Stefan Cernetic/Facebook
Indeed , everything was going great for the fake royal , but it all started crashing down last year . Cernetic had been staying in the luxurious Italian resort of Fasano , where he had set up an account with a hotel . At his instructions , they forwarded the bill to the embassy of Macedonia in Italy , but got this response – “ Do not send us the bills , we do n't have a prince , and we certainly do n't share one with Montenegro. ” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was alerted about the situation , and an investigation into the dealings of Stefan Cernetic began in August 2016 .

Police recently raided the homes of both the fake Montenegrin Prince and his ambassador , and found several fake titles and awards issued by the Royal House of Montenegro , diplomatic permits and even a royal seal . Both men were placed under arrest and now face several charges .
Photo : Prince Stefan Cernetic/Facebook
It 's unclear why the police took almost a year to arrest Stefan Cernetic , since all they had to do was contact Montenegrin authorities and confirm his royal status . Actually , it was even simpler than that – all they had to do was search his name on Google . I did , and found this little gem on a blog called Fake Titles and Orders . This article dates back to 2014 , and provides clear evidence that the “ prince ” is nothing but “ a liar and a fake ” .
Photo : Prince Stefan Cernetic/Facebook
“ Stefan Cernetic , if that even is his real name , is a liar and a fake . His claimed links to European Royalty are obscure and not to be relied upon . He is by no means a member of any Royal or Imperial House , let alone is he the head of one , ” the author of the blog post writes . “ He has no connections to the Royal Houses of Montenegro , Serbia , or Albania whatsoever . The titles and Orders he bestows upon those foolish enough to believe his arrant nonsense are just as bogus as his own . His companions seem to be just as deluded and this writer would advise anyone to come into contact with him or his supporters to avoid them like the plague . ”

I bet Pamela Anderson wishes she had read this before kneeling a fake prince to receive a title that was apparently available to pretty much anyone who made a “ small ” contribution to the Royal House of Montenegro .
A brand new study1 has brought to light the astonishing fact that the intestinal microbiota of gout patients , is highly distinct from the intestinal microbiota of healthy individuals . Traditionally gout has been diagnosed using a blood test . However , this study raises the suggestion that intestinal bacteria could become a major diagnostic criterion for gout , and may even be more accurate .
Gout is a painful condition affecting the joints
So what is gout ?
Gout is a very uncomfortable , essentially inflammatory condition , which can cause an attack of sudden burning pain , stiffness and swelling in the joints . This can go on to be harmful for your joints and tendons if left untreated . Fundamentally , gout is caused by a disorder in purine metabolism . Purines are found in many foods we eat , and when broken down get turned into uric acid . This uric acid is usually efficiently excreted so does n't cause a problem . However , when uric acid is not expelled properly the levels of it become high in the blood stream resulting in it being deposited as uric acid salt crystals in joints and surrounding areas , which in turn can lead to excruciating joint pain .
Presently the two symptoms - high uric acid levels in the blood , and joint pain due to deposits of uric acid salts , are the two main clinical diagnostic criteria used when deciding if a patient has gout or not . However , according to this study , the uric acid levels index which is used when diagnosing is not accurate , and in fact , using blood samples is n't really sensitive enough to accurately ascertain the presence of gout . This is because , as described in this research article , gout patients are largely in a stressed state . When someone is stressed the body produces the adrenocorticotrophic hormone . This hormone actually stimulates the excretion of uric acid , so in fact there will be no significant rise of uric acid in the blood stream for most early-onset gout patients . Hence gout can often be left undiagnosed for a while .
So how does this study fit into this picture ?
Uric acid is known to be excreted in two ways . 70 % is excreted through the kidney , and 30 % is excreted by the intestine . Intestinal bacteria are known to have a large role in the metabolism of purine and uric acid . Targeted enzymes are excreted by particular bacteria , which in turn break down the uric acid . It was found that enzymes known to break down uric acid , were particularly prevalent in those with high populations of Lactobacillus and Pseudomonas.2 This led the researchers to question whether this could be used as a way of diagnosing gout , or even giving a prognosis .
To test this idea , the study looked at the intestinal bacteria of 33 gout patients and 33 healthy individuals of an 83 member Chinese cohort . The taxonomic structure ( used to classify organisms ) of the bacteria was determined using a gene sequencing technique , and in doing so they were able to put together a ‘ functional profile ' of the corresponding microbiome . What they discovered , was that the ‘ microbial taxonomic and functional features ' , i.e the type of bacteria , were ‘ profoundly different ' between gout and healthy individuals . In fact once they established a microbial model on which to test subjects , they could diagnose gout with 88.9 % accuracy . It was also found that those who could not be accurately diagnosed using the traditional blood sample method , could be diagnosed using this microbial model .
The bacteria Bacteroides caccae has been linked to gout and IBD .
Interestingly , the researchers also looked into the correlation between the microbiota prevalent in gout patients , and those that had already been found to be prevalent in the guts of patients with other metabolic diseases . It was found , for example , that Bacteroides caccae were enriched in gout patients but had also previously been recognised as a biomarker of IBD3 . Therefore the increased level of these bacteria in gout patients could also potentially lead to an inflammatory response . Additionally it was noted that there was significantly less presence of the bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in gout patients . This particular bacterium is noted for its butyrate production . Butyrate protects the gut in many ways , such as by providing nutrition for the intestinal mucosa , enhancing intestinal immunity , promoting growth and repair of the villi on the gut wall , and also helping to keep the gut bacteria in balance . Its overall effect is very anti–inflammatory , and significant for gut health . Interestingly it has been reported that these bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , is found in distinctly reduced numbers , not only in gout patients , but also in those with liver cirrhosis and Type 2 diabetes . This suggests that the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii could become an indicator of intestine health and associated diseases .
This study therefore suggests that it now may be very important to consider your gut microbiota when coping with gout . Although more research is needed in this area , this is also not the first study to make the exciting suggestion that a catalogue of genes in the human gut microbiome , could become crucial for the analysis , diagnosis and prognosis of many more diseases .

We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives . It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices , often not felt to be such by those concerned , to prevent our being swamped with incompetence .
Oliver Wendell Holmes ( 1927 )
The majority of our teachers are hardworking and effective . But the previous estimates point clearly to the key imperative of eliminating the drag of the bottom teachers .
Eric Hanushek ( 2011 )
One common strain of modern education reform has a direct , yet familiar logic : An education crisis persists despite more spending , smaller classes , or curricular changes . We have ignored the major cause of student achievement : teacher quality . Seniority and tenure have diluted the pool of talented teachers and impeded student learning . Reformers such as Michelle Rhee have acted on this assumption , implementing test-based accountability measures , merit pay , and lesser job protections . Unfortunately , the current educational reform movement shares its logic with the early-twentieth-century American eugenics movement , which in efforts to improve our gene pool , wrote a horrific chapter in our history .
In suggesting this provocative comparison , I hope to guide readers through three shared errors . Both eugenics and modern school reform view education too deterministically , share a faith in standardized tests , and exaggerate the fixedness of traits . Considering this comparison requires a reconsideration of early eugenics , not as merely precursors to Nazis , but as an optimistic and Progressive movement . What is now disdained as pseudoscientific racism was once widely accepted . To learn from history , however , we must not dismiss our ancestors as evil or senseless . Recognizing the noble intentions of the past allows us to compare it to the present and find the same misguided assumptions about human nature .
Left : Oliver Wendell Holmes
What was eugenics ? In the decades after Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species ( 1859 ) loud protests became acceptance , and many hoped to combine Darwin 's findings with newly re-discovered genetic mechanisms of inheritance . Scientific research satisfied a collective urge for deterministic explanations ; if our genes determine our intelligence , our personalities , and our futures , this knowledge could be used to improve humanity . How could a society use these discoveries to improve livestock , but refuse to use them for the betterment of society ?
The first error of the eugenicists , and of the school reformers , is a deterministic view of a complex and uncertain process . The eugenicists began with Darwin 's animal models and findings that diseases run in families and jumped to the conclusion that genes determine everything from criminality to genius . Today 's school reformers begin with the finding that the teacher is the relatively largest in-school predictor of academic achievement as measured by test scores , and quickly jump to : `` . . . the single most important factor determining whether students succeed in school is not the color of their skin or their ZIP code or even their parents ' income -- it is the quality of their teacher . '' Without a doubt , teachers matter . But to argue that a child 's teacher is the single most important factor in school success writ large is an unsupported leap from suggesting that certain test scores are more influenced by good teaching than by other conveniently measured variables .
If good genes singly cause success , and good teachers are responsible for student learning , then how do we define `` good '' ? Many eugenicists and school reformers dismiss the problem . Darwin 's cousin , Francis Galton wrote , `` There is a sufficient consensus of opinion as to what kind of human beings are desirable in an ideal state , so that we need not trouble ourselves about further details for some time to come . '' The school reformers agree : We all know the difference between a great teacher and a poor one ; we can worry about the details later . A great teacher imparts great learning , a poor teacher does n't .
The second common error becomes apparent once the need arises to concretely measure quality . Both eugenics and modern school reform share an overabundant faith in standardization , and in testing in particular . Eugenics arose just as the first intelligence tests were being created . Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman , who adapted a pioneering French intelligence test into the IQ test , was an early supporter of eugenics . Many statistical techniques now used by Stanford economist Eric Hanushek to measure teacher quality through student achievement were invented by Francis Galton , Karl Pearson , and Raymond Cattell , all pioneers in intelligence testing , and often supporters of eugenics ideas . Of course , `` achievement '' is now used instead of intelligence , as if the tests are entirely different from intelligence tests of days past . The tests have changed , but the unbounded faith in testing has not .
Right : Alexander Graham Bell
I do not wish impugn the statistical techniques themselves , or doubt progress in measuring what we aim to measure . However , in each moment , a refinement of the science of testing has been mistaken for readiness to apply to public policy and specific individual cases . A strong general relationship between conveniently measurable variables becomes riddled with errors when applied to individual personnel decisions . As these tools leave the lab ( or the economist 's model ) and enter policy reality , the uncertainty magnifies the bias and corruption that science is supposed to prevent . Whether using early IQ tests to reject immigrants at Ellis Island , or using Value-Added Measures ( VAM ) scores to fire or reward teachers , policymakers convinced they are using the latest microscope , are later seen holding a distorted mirror .
The third error is a belief that important traits are fixed rather than changeable . Eugenics advocates regarded many human traits as fixed and hence sought to manage reproduction . Early supporters of eugenics began positively , by encouraging society 's winners . Galton 's book Hereditary Genius documented how genius ran in families , using the latest statistical techniques ( some of which he invented ; his contributions to statistics were impressive ) . `` Positive '' eugenics found acceptance among Progressives eager to use the tools of science improve their country 's future . Contests for `` Fitter Families '' and `` Better Babies '' were a staple at state fairs from 1915 through the 1920s . Another example of positive eugenics was a bonus ( bankrolled by a conservative , segregationist organization ) given to Air Corps officers . Some officers were offered a $ 4,000 bonus for fathering a child in 1940 .
Although these relatively harmless positive eugenics efforts remained limited , negative eugenics became the most popular aspect of the eugenics movement , `` successfully '' promoting involuntary sterilization . Tens of thousands of poor women in mental institutions were involuntarily sterilized . In the Deep South , the `` Mississippi appendectomy '' was part of a systematic effort to reduce the `` undesirable '' population . These efforts were only accepted because of the premise of rigid and unchanging genetic traits ( race , but also intelligence ) .

School reformers are not so stark or broad . For example , involuntarily sterilization is different from telling someone to find another job . Further , overt racial resentment and competition is mostly absent from the current wave of education reform . But their writings and policies make it clear that reformers often regard good teaching as a permanent trait . This position is evident in the priorities of standard-bearer Teach for America , which places far more emphasis on recruitment and selection than on their five-week training program . Rhetoric that refers to `` teacher talent '' instead of `` teaching effectiveness '' reflects different assumptions about the possibility of improving teaching skills . These assumptions suggest improvement through performance bonuses and firing as opposed to support for training or classroom resources . Modern reform hopes to shape teacher selection , not behavior in the classroom . While suggesting `` lowering barriers to entry '' by reducing certification requirements , many reformers seek to improve the teacher corps through selection pressures , via increased competition from better teachers .
Both sets of reformers share good intentions . Just as many of the current school reformers consider themselves to be progressive , American eugenics was considered a progressive movement , and was often couched in terms of concern for the children and for the future of society . Like modern school reform , eugenics supporters included billionaire philanthropists ( John D. Rockefeller ) , government luminaries ( Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , President Theodore Roosevelt ) , non-profit activists ( birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger ) , and eminent scientists ( Alexander Graham Bell , Francis Galton , and several Nobel Prize winners ) .
Stephen Murdoch discusses IQ testing at Ellis Island :
I contend that policy efforts urgently focused on improving through selection , rather than supporting all who have chosen a profession , are doomed to fail . Despite confidence that we know the right people , and that science can reliably identify them , science has taken only small tentative steps using convenient measures . There is some genetic basis for intelligence . Teacher quality does matter . But the uncertainty and flexibility of both intelligence and teachers makes policy applications counterproductive . A few bold scientists , hoping to apply limited findings to solve social problems , make ridiculously confident assertions ( e.g. , `` Getting rid of the bottom 8 % of teachers would be worth 100 trillion dollars for our economy '' ) . A few wealthy individuals , eager to use their fortunes for social good , support these assertions .
The three errors above are human errors , often stemming from sympathy and a desire to see a simple yet hidden lever to alleviate injustice in our society . We see a monster guarding that lever , behaving poorly as we try to move it . Yet despite our noble intentions , we will not be remembered as heroes or Supermen , striking down a monster . We will be not be saluted for our urgency . The monsters in our society are not unintelligent degenerates or teachers unions . When teachers are fired in front of crowded classrooms , escorted out by security guards , when standardized scores are printed in the newspaper to shame `` ineffective '' teachers , when we say that Hurricane Katrina was the best thing to happen to education in New Orleans , we will not be remembered for putting students first . When we agree that we need a dictator to slay those monsters keeping us from greatness , we are the monsters . And as our children get older , if they are n't too busy taking a reading test to read a history book , they will look at us with uneasy shame and ask us why we did n't do anything to stop it . :

Facing criticism for its frothing lakes and potholes on roads , the Karnataka government on Sunday launched the Bengaluru city logo , the first Indian city to do so , in a bid to resurrect its image as a tourism destination . With this , it joins cities like Amsterdam in The Netherlands and New York in the US to have its own logo .
The logo was designed by Nammur , a design start-up , which won a contest and received prize money of Rs 5 lakh from the government .
Speaking to HT , state tourism minister , Priyank Kharge , said although the city was a brand in terms of investment , it was not so for tourism . `` We wanted to remedy this and portray the rich history and culture of the city , '' he said . It was his idea to come up with the logo .
Kharge said the government wanted to bring the city on par with Amsterdam and New York as a brand to attract tourists and showcase its cosmopolitan nature . This , he said , was highlighted in the logo , where ‘ Be ' and ‘ U ' in Bengaluru are highlighted in red . “ This represents the welcoming character of the city , where people of all identities will be respected , '' he said .
Nammur 's Vinod Kumar said the challenge in the design was to incorporate the city 's rich cultural heritage and yet show how it is changing . “ It is for this reason that some of the English letters have been designed to look similar to characters in the Kannada script , ” he said.The logo was also designed to subconsciously teach Kannada , he said . The company has also launched merchandise that will represent Bengaluru .

In a not entirely great move , Bandai Namco has decided to release Gundam Versus in the West on September 29 , which is the same day as the release of the SNES Classic Edition .
Considering that the Gundam Versus series has n't really had a fair chance in the West , it seems strange that Bandai Namco would single out September 29 to release the latest game in the series .
This is because during the last console generation both Gundam Extreme Versus and Gundam Extreme Versus Full Boost were ported from the arcades to the PS3 but were only available in Japan .
Obviously , die-hard fans imported the games , as the PS3 was region free , but the games never really got a chance to shine in the West .
So when Bandai Namco announced they were bringing the latest installment on the PS4 Westward later this year , I had hoped the game would have had a decent launch window .
However , having Gundam Versus released on the same day as the SNES Classic Edition will likely mean the game will get buried in terms of its PR and marketing , which is a shame .
Despite all this , there are some nuggets of good news tucked away here .
The first is that the Western release of the game will include the Gundam Virtue and Nadleeh set from Gundam 00 . In the Japanese version , this mobile suit will be a DLC release but for those that pre-order the game in the West , they will get it free .
The second piece of good news is that Bandai Namco will be hosting an official side tournament at EVO 2017 , as part of AnimeEVO . Considering that the Gundam Versus games are a thoroughbred series of arcade multiplayer titles in Japan , this official inclusion at EVO is very much overdue .
Gundam Versus is released on September 29 for PS4 in the West . The Japanese version will be released earlier on July 6 and I will be covering that once it is out here .

Disney is now selling a Mickey Mouse T-shirt on its webstore inspired by -- no fucking joke -- Joy Division . ( Thanks to WPRB DJ Maria T. Sciarrino for pointing it out . )
The listing on the Disney Store website reads : `` Inspired by the iconic sleeve of Joy Division 's Unknown Pleasures album , this Waves Mickey Mouse Tee incorporates Mickey 's image within the graphic of the pulse of a star . That 's appropriate given few stars have made bigger waves than Mickey ! '' The shirt is `` created especially for Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort . '' We are not making this up .
Uhhhhhhhhh .... Does Disney know that the singer of this band hanged himself ? ! Do they know where the name `` Joy Division '' comes from ? ! Do they know how stupid this guy looks wearing this T-shirt ? :

October 5 , 2017 , Cleveland : In a newly published study , Cleveland Clinic researchers have uncovered differences in the bacterial composition of breast tissue of healthy women vs. women with breast cancer . The research team has discovered for the first time that healthy breast tissue contains more of the bacterial species Methylobacterium , a finding which could offer a new perspective in the battle against breast cancer .
Bacteria that live in the body , known as the microbiome , influence many diseases . Most research has been done on the `` gut '' microbiome , or bacteria in the digestive tract . Researchers have long suspected that a `` microbiome '' exists within breast tissue and plays a role in breast cancer but it has not yet been characterized . The research team has taken the first step toward understanding the composition of the bacteria in breast cancer by uncovering distinct microbial differences in healthy and cancerous breast tissue .
`` To my knowledge , this is the first study to examine both breast tissue and distant sites of the body for bacterial differences in breast cancer , '' said co-senior author Charis Eng , M.D. , Ph.D. , chair of Cleveland Clinic 's Genomic Medicine Institute and director of the Center for Personalized Genetic Healthcare . `` Our hope is to find a biomarker that would help us diagnose breast cancer quickly and easily . In our wildest dreams , we hope we can use microbiomics right before breast cancer forms and then prevent cancer with probiotics or antibiotics . ''
Published online in Oncotarget on Oct. 5 , 2017 , the study examined the tissues of 78 patients who underwent mastectomy for invasive carcinoma or elective cosmetic breast surgery . In addition , they examined oral rinse and urine to determine the bacterial composition of these distant sites in the body .
In addition to the Methylobacterium finding , the team discovered that cancer patients ' urine samples had increased levels of gram-positive bacteria , including Staphylococcus and Actinomyces . Further studies are needed to determine the role these organisms may play in breast cancer .
Co-senior author Stephen Grobymer , M.D. , said , `` If we can target specific pro-cancer bacteria , we may be able to make the environment less hospitable to cancer and enhance existing treatments . Larger studies are needed but this work is a solid first step in better understanding the significant role of bacterial imbalances in breast cancer . '' Dr. Grobmyer is section head of Surgical Oncology and director of Breast Services at Cleveland Clinic .
The study provides proof-of-principle evidence to support further research into the creation and utilization of loaded submicroscopic particles ( nanoparticles ) , targeting these pro-cancer bacteria . Funded by a grant from the Center for Transformational Nanomedicine , Drs . Grobmyer and Eng are collaborating with investigators at Hebrew University to develop new treatments using nanotechnology to deliver antibiotics directly to the bacterial community in breast cancer .
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women ( after skin cancer ) in the United States , where 1 in 8 women will develop the disease in their lifetimes .
The study was funded by a Clinical Research Mentorship Award from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation , The Society of Surgical Oncology Foundation , Cleveland Clinic 's Taussig Cancer Institute , Earlier.org , and Randy and Ken Kendrick . Dr. Eng holds the Sondra J. and Stephen R. Hardis Endowed Chair of Cancer Genomic Medicine at Cleveland Clinic .

food2vec - Augmented cooking with machine intelligence
Building a recommendation system for food & exploring the world 's cuisines .
TL ; DR : Check out the tools demo to explore food analogies and recommendations , or scroll down for an interactive map of a hundred thousand recipes from around the world .
I have n't eaten in five days . I dream of food . I study food . Deep in ketosis , my body has adapted to consume itself : I am food . There is no better time to dig into modeling grub .
Machine intelligence has changed your life , from how you listen to music through Discover Weekly playlists , consume news through Facebook , or talk to your hand computer 's friendly digital assistant . But why has n't it changed how we eat ? Can we modify the ingredients of language processing algorithms to get insights about food ? If you tell me what you want to eat , can I recommend complementary foods , much like Spotify recommends complementary songs ?
Word embeddings are a useful technique for analyzing discrete data . Say we use words from the Oxford English dictionary . We can represent each word ( such as “ food ” ) as a vector as follows : a list of zeros , with a single at the location of the word in the vocabulary . In our case , “ food ” may be at location near other words beginning with the letter f. Then the vector for “ food ” would look like :
However , this is inadequate for comparing words . To compare documents and get useful insights from our data , we need to aggregate over dimensions for each word , which takes far too long . Can we do better ?
Embeddings let us reduce the dimensionality of the problem , and give us a powerful representation of language . We can build a model of language where we assign a hundred random numbers to each word . To train the model , we use these hundred numbers of each word to predict their context . The “ context ” of a word consists of its surrounding words . This is the main idea : the context means that words that occur in similar contexts should have similar meanings . We tweak the numbers assigned to a word to make them better at predicting words in the context . Initially , the random numbers assigned to a word will be bad at predicting words in the context . But gradually , through this process of tweaking the model 's predictions of surrounding words , we get a hundred numbers that are far from random . The hundred numbers representing each word will capture part of its meaning : similar words will cluster together because they occur in each other 's contexts , and words with different meanings are pushed far apart ( out-of-context ) . By representing each word as an embedding in dimensions , we have reduced the dimensionality more than a thousandfold from and gained a better representation of language .
For modeling food , we have a collection of recipes . We can define the context of an ingredient in a recipe to be the rest of the foods in the recipe . This demonstrates the flexibility of embeddings : by making a small change in the definition of the context , we can now apply it to a totally different kind of data .
Food similarity map
After training the embedding algorithm on a collection of recipes , we get -dimensional embeddings for each food . Humans ca n't visualize high dimensions , so we use an approximation technique to visualize similarity between the foods in two dimensions .
Here is a similarity map of the ingredients used in the recipes . Hover over a point to see which food it represents :
The map of foods is reasonable . Ingredients from Asia cluster together , as do ingredients used in European and North American cooking .
Recipe embedding map
We can generate an embedding for a recipe by taking the average of its ingredients ' embeddings . Here is a map of recipes from around the world . Hover over a point to see the recipe , and click on the cuisine legend on the right to show or hide certain regions :
IMPORTANT : you are about to download 15MB of data . Click here to access the map , zoom in , and discover new flavors . Is this the fastest way to browse 100k recipes by similarity ?
Interesting patterns emerge . Asian recipes cluster together , as do Southern European recipes . Northern European and American foods are all over the place , maybe because of transmission of recipes due to migration , or over-representation in the data .
Food similarity tool
Access the tool at this link . We can calculate food similarity by looking at which food is closest in the high dimensional space in the embeddings .
These mostly make sense - foods are closest to other foods they appear with in recipes :
Cheese is closest to macaroni
Sesame oil is closest to egg noodle
Milk is closest to nutmeg
Olive oil is closest to parmesan cheese
Food analogy tool
Access the tool here . Food analogies , like word analogies , are calculated with vector arithmetic . For the analogy “ Food A is to food B , as food C is to food D ” , the goal is to predict a reasonable food D. We can do this by subtracting food B from food A , then adding food C. For example , calculating in embedding space will yield an embedding . The closest embedding to this is in our model of food . The classic example from word embeddings is . Is this intuitive ? King is to man as woman is to queen makes sense in natural language , but food analogies are less clear . With practice , we may be able to train our taste detectors and devise hypotheses to test in the realm of food . I also included cuisine embeddings by representing them as the average of their recipes ' embeddings .
Some of these are more plausible than others :
Egg is to bacon as orange juice is to coffee .
Bread is to butter as roast beef is to sage .
Smoked salmon is to dill as lamb is to asparagus .
South Asian is to rice as Southern European is to thyme .
Rice is to sesame seed as macaroni is to pimento .
Roasted beef is to green bell pepper as pork sausage is to fenugreek .
Recipe recommendation tool
Access the tool here . We can use our model of food as a recommendation system for cooks . By taking the average embedding for a set of foods , we can look up foods with the closest embeddings .
For example , I am a lifelong aficionado of peanut butter jam sandwiches . I entered my usual favorite : white bread , butter , peanut butter , honey . The top recommendation was : strawberry . I 've never tried that , and it 's pretty good ! I happily broke my fast with it . For the recipe of lamb , cumin , tomato , the top recommendation is raisin - also reasonable and interesting . Other recommendations are a bit wackier , so best of luck .
If you end up adding an ingredient to your food based on these tools , I 'd love to hear how it tasted : ping me on Twitter or email !
What 's next ?
Figuring out the right user interface to explore these models . The code for the plots and recommendation tools is on github . It would be great to make these mobile-friendly and test other ways of presenting recommendations from the model to users .
word2vec is not the best model for this . Multi-class regression should work well , and I added a working demo of this to the repo . This is a rare case where the vocabulary size ( number of ingredients ) is very small , so we can fit both models and compare them . This could reveal idiosyncrasies in the non-contrastive estimation loss used in word2vec and provides an interesting testbed .
Scaling up the data : Do you have a larger dataset of recipes , or do you know how to scrape one ? I 'd love to check it out . This would also fix bias in the data as the majority of the recipes are currently North American .
Testing out recipe analogies combined with food analogies : this may be more intuitive for us humans . For example , “ pancakes are to maple syrup , as an omelette is to cheese ” could be easier to think about than analogies with individual ingredients .

A would-be Lib Dem MP who describes himself as a feminist has been filmed repeatedly trying to touch a naked lap dancer .
Married father-of-one Maajid Nawaz asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London .
Footage shows the prospective parliamentary candidate – who calls himself an advocate of women 's rights – attempting to touch her arms and thighs , which is against the venue 's policy .

Up close : Would-be MP Maajid Nawaz with a scantily-clad lap dancer in the club in east London
Seedy : The married father-of-one asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London
Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘ outrageous ' .
In the film , Nawaz – a convicted former extremist – can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him in a private room during two £20 lap dances .
Manager Jay Shah , who witnessed Nawaz 's behaviour , said he was ‘ very drunk ' and bouncers threatened to throw him out several times .
‘ He was asking her to touch him and he was touching her , ' he said . ‘ In general he was quite persistent with her , asking to take her out and for her number . '
A rising star of the Liberal Democrats , 37-year-old Nawaz is also a leading figure in the Muslim community and head of anti-extremism charity the Quilliam Foundation , which he set up .
Rising star : The prospective parliamentary candidate with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg
A regular guest on BBC News programmes , he declared on Newsnight in 2013 : ‘ I consider myself a feminist . ' He once wrote on Twitter : ‘ You do n't need to be a woman to stand for women 's rights . '
He often throws his weight behind gender issues such as the campaign against female genital mutilation and paints himself as a role model for young Muslim men at risk of radicalisation .
But Abdul Malik , the club 's owner , said he wanted the video to be seen by the public because of the way Nawaz portrays himself as a feminist and a family man . ‘ He 's always talking about religion on TV and I thought , what a hypocrite , ' he said .
He claimed ‘ arrogant ' Nawaz acts like a ‘ spokesman for Islam ' – but visited the club during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘ outrageous '
The full strip club footage , obtained by the Mail , clearly shows Nawaz receiving two five-minute lap dances an hour apart .
He and two friends paid £10 entry to the small ‘ gentleman 's club ' in Whitechapel and were seen drinking heavily . He left the club alone in the early hours of the morning .
During the first session – in which the dancer gets naked – she has to repeatedly remove his hands from her body and pushes him away at one point .
During the second dance with the same woman , he also spends time chatting to her – whispering into her ear and trying to touch her hair .
Newlywed : Nawaz 's second wife Rachel Maggart
She later informed the manager , who told security to ‘ keep an eye on her ' .
Club boss Mr Shah claimed Nawaz had been ‘ bragging ' but the dancer later told him : ‘ Who does he think he is ? '
Tory MP Nadine Dorries last night called for Nawaz to quit his candidacy . ‘ In politics , you ca n't advocate one cause or manner of behaviour then act differently in your personal life , ' she said .
Labour MP Khalid Mahmood added : ‘ The message this sends to women is not one of respect . '
British-born Nawaz was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir .
On his return to England in 2006 , he renounced his views and quickly established himself as a spokesman on extremism issues .
He has been selected by party leader Nick Clegg to fight the London marginal seat of Hampstead and Kilburn and has been married to US-born writer and artist Rachel Maggart , 29 , since October .
They were engaged and believed to have been living together at his West London home when he visited the club on July 9 last year .
He has a young son from his previous marriage to Rabia Nawaz – who is also known to have supported Hizb ut-Tahrir .
A spokesman for Nawaz said he denied touching the dancer ‘ inappropriately ' and added that his reputation for advocating women 's rights was ‘ in the context of Islamic extremism ' .
He said he had not been warned about his behaviour , and was not ‘ out of control ' through drink or breaching the rules .
The spokesman said : ‘ The evening you refer to was our client 's stag night before his marriage .
‘ His best man took him to the gentleman 's club with the full knowledge of our client 's then future wife ( now his wife ) . '
Nawaz can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him
SPOKANE , Wash. / CALGARY , AB – The Spokane Chiefs were recognized today as the Western Hockey League 's 2015-16 Scholastic Team of the Year . The honor was announced as part of the WHL Awards Luncheon in Calgary .
The yearly honor is given to the WHL team that achieves the highest overall academic performance throughout the regular season . This is first time the Chiefs have won the award .
The Chiefs ' Education Advisor , Joe Everson , was on hand in Calgary to accept the award on behalf of the organization .
“ We set the academic bar high every season , and the last few years our guys have performed at an exceptional level in the classroom , ” Everson said . “ We were close last year , so from the first school meeting in August , the players knew that our goal was to win the Scholastic Award . There were no stragglers , and that made my job easy .
“ The biggest challenge for every player in the WHL , especially the high-school guys , is achieving at a high level when they 're on the road so much . This year , for example , they were gone almost 25 % of the time , and no one is taking any easy courses . To be successful , players need to be exceptionally organized : getting assignments ahead of time , doing them on the road , working hard in study hall and with our team tutor .
“ They have to be as committed in the classroom as they are on the ice . ”
The Chiefs were one of the youngest teams in the WHL during the 2015-16 season , with nine players attending Ferris High School in Spokane , completing coursework while still representing Spokane on the ice . Leading scorer Kailer Yamamoto attended his hometown Mead High School . They earned an 86 % average mark and completed four Advanced Placement courses . Additionally , nine other players completed post-secondary work through Athabasca University 's online program , earning a head start on their college degree .
“ WHL players truly are scholar-athletes , ” Everson continued . “ Winning the Scholastic Award is an endorsement of the organization 's philosophy that character is revealed as much at school as it is at the rink .
“ Not every Chief is going to be a professional hockey player , but every one of them can use his WHL scholarship to enroll in a post-secondary program . ”
The Chiefs will choose their next class of players in the 2016 WHL Bantam Draft on Thursday morning in Calgary , with the first pick announced around 8 a.m. PDT . Fans can watch the first round of the draft live online at www.whl.ca beginning at 7:30 a.m. PDT . Live results of the entire draft will be available via the WHL Mobile App and online at www.whl.ca/prospects .
Ticket packages for the 2016-17 regular season are already on sale ! With packages starting as low as $ 110 , there 's a plan for any budget . Visit the Chiefs ' Ticket Office in person at the southeast corner of Spokane Arena or call 509-535-PUCK for more information .
Mariah Walton is 20-years-old and permanently disabled . She has pulmonary hypertension and has to carry an oxygen tank in order to breathe . There have been times where there had to be screws in her bones to anchor in her breathing device . A heart and lung transplant may soon be in her future .
Things did n't have to be this way . When she was an infant , a small defect in her heart could have easily been treated before the damage was irreversible . The problem was that her fundamentalist Mormon parents did n't believe in doctors .
Living off the grid in Idaho in a fundamentalist Mormon sect is n't ideal if you 're in need of urgent medical care . But having parents who refuse to seek out that care is an unimaginable nightmare . According to The Guardian , as Mariah 's condition worsened , her parents would prescribe her a steady regimen of prayer and “ alternative medicine. ” When she finally left home two years ago , she did n't have a social security number or a birth certificate .
“ Yes , I would like to see my parents prosecuted , ” Mariah told The Guardian . “ They deserve it… And it might stop others . ”
Had they been in neighboring Oregon , her parents could have been booked for medical neglect . In Mariah 's case , as in scores of others of instances of [ preventable ] death among children in Idaho since the 1970s , laws exempt dogmatic faith healers from prosecution , and she and her sister recently took part in a panel discussion with lawmakers at the state capitol about the issue . Idaho is one of only six states that offer a faith-based shield for felony crimes such as manslaughter . Some of those enjoying legal protection are fringe Mormon families like Mariah 's , many of whom live in the state 's north . But a large number of children have died in southern Idaho , near Boise , in families belonging to a reclusive , Pentecostal faith-healing sect called the Followers of Christ .
Idaho Republicans , who 've enjoyed a long-standing majority in the state house , do n't seem interested in reforming laws that protect such practices , arguing that “ religious freedoms ” must be protected through exemptions . When Democratic legislator John Gannon proposed reforms of which he “ never thought would really be that controversial. ” The chairman of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee , Lee Heider , “ refused to even grant it a hearing , effectively killing it . ”
“ Republicans did n't feel the need to change the laws . We believe in the first amendment to the constitution . I do n't think that states have a right to interfere in religions , ” Heider said .
When pressed by The Guardian on the fact that children are dying because of these religious exemptions , Heider made this odd comparison :
“ Are we going to stop Methodists from reading the New Testament ? Are we going to stop Catholics receiving the sacraments ? That 's what these people believe in . They spoke to me and pointed to a tremendous number of examples where Christ healed people in the New Testament . ”
From The Guardian :
While Idaho legislators stonewall , children in faith-healing communities continue to suffer . According to coroners ' reports , in Canyon County alone just in the past decade at least 10 children in the Followers of Christ church have died . These include 15-year-old Arrian Granden , who died in 2012 after contracting food poisoning . She vomited so much that her esophagus ruptured . Untreated , she bled to death . The other deaths are mostly infants who died during at-home births or soon after from treatable complications , simple infections or pneumonia .
There 's still hope . Bruce Wingate at Protect Idaho Kids is coordinating a new campaign called “ Let Them Live ” to pressure lawmakers to take action , and John Gannon plans to reintroduce his bill next year .
“ It 's not going to go away , ” Gannon said . “ Dead children do n't care about the First Amendment . ”

20 . Victor Arboleda , Portland Timbers 2
The 19-year-old Colombian was signed by the Timbers this offseason and has shown glimpses of the potential he has to offer with a pair of goals in his 14 appearances for T2 this season . A former Colombia U17 international , Arboleda has been slightly hampered by injury over the season , but goals like this against the Swope Park Rangers in June highlight what he can be capable of when fully fit .
TopDrawerSoccer.com Scouting Report
A hybrid forward/winger type , the Colombian 's blend of speed and ability makes him one of the most exciting younger players in the USL . Arboleda is a quick , fleet-footed attacking force , with the strength that belies his 5-foot-6 frame . Most effective when he 's running onto the ball in space or lingering on the shoulder of the last defender , an injury has limited his goal output during this season . If he continues to add to his defensive game and can stay healthy , there 's every reason to believe he could be one of the best in USL .
Elon Musk denied being the mysterious creator of bitcoin known as Satoshi Nakamoto .
‘ Not true ... ' Elon Musk on speculation he is bitcoin 's mysterious creator
Musk felt compelled to respond in a late-Monday tweet to an earlier blog post that said a onetime employee at Musk 's Mars-focused SpaceX has made the bitcoin claim about his former boss .
Satoshi Nakamoto is the nickname used by the unknown person or people who created bitcoin 's original reference implementation and devised the first blockchain database . The blog post made note of Musk 's knowledge of C++ and compared Musk to U.S. inventor and founding father Benjamin Franklin , who also published under a pseudonym .
Musk , the chief executive of Tesla Inc. TSLA , -0.30 % , also tweeted that he was gifted bitcoin once , but does n't know what he did with it .
Not true . A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years , but I do n't know where it is . — Elon Musk ( @ elonmusk ) November 28 , 2017
Bitcoin had the $ 10,000 milestone within its grasp Tuesday , according to CoinDesk , after the cryptocurrency 's 2017 rally accelerated over the Thanksgiving weekend . Bitcoin BTCUSD , -0.16 % has surged more than 50 % over the past month alone . It is now up nearly 900 % this year so far .
Opinion : The chance of a bitcoin crash is greater than 80 % , says Mark Hulbert

Let there be indoor light .
That , in a nutshell , is the gigantic promise that new Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi has made to the country : by 2019 , he wants every home in India to have at least one light bulb and have that the light bulb be powered by clean solar energy .
It 's a political promise with a lot of appeal and a massive opportunity for solar and LED providers . India is starved for power . An estimated 300 million plus people are n't connected to the grid in India and demand for power is anticipated to double to 2020 , according to various estimates . An estimated 27 % of the country 's power gets lost through theft and technical failure , while blackouts reduce the country 's GDP by 1.5 % annually , according to the World Bank . A blackout in 2012 plunged 700 million into darkness for two days .
To top it off , power in India is n't cheap . A substantial portion of the power in rural areas comes from diesel generators .
Lighting likewise is also in short supply . An oft-cited study from Paul Waide at the International Energy Agency noted that an average North American consumes 101 megalumen-hours of electric light each year while the average inhabitant of India uses only 3 megalumen-hours . In rural communities , lighting often comes from dirty , dangerous oil lamps .
While Modi specifically did not say an LED bulb in every house , it 's hard to imagine solid state lighting not playing a leading role . LEDs consume far less power than standard lights and can be coupled with networking to save even more power : some companies have reported savings of over 90 % in industrial settings . Worldwide , lighting consumes more power than is provided by nuclear plants .
Modi has also experienced the appeal of solar before . As the Chief Minister of Gujarat , he was instrumental in developing a solar program that has already put 900 MW of solar capacity in the ground .
India is a challenging country for many businesses . The bureaucracy is legendary for inefficiency and a trade dispute is already brewing over solar panel imports . Land disputes for solar farms no doubt are on the horizon .
Still , it 's hard to imagine politicians not understanding the appeal of bringing power to the people : every time they turn on the lights voters will be reminded of the BJP . I once visited a village school outside of Mumbai that had built a computer lab with old car batteries , a small solar array and a diesel generator : it was a point of pride . Several of India 's conglomerates like Tata have also invested in renewables . Relieving grid congestion would also help IT companies by stabilizing the grid .

Pittsburgh Penguins Offseason Poll : What Would Your Priority Be This Summer ?
Pittsburgh Penguins Offseason Poll : What Would Your Priority Be This Summer ? by Mike Necciai
Pittsburgh Penguins General Manager Jim Rutherford made a splash earlier this season when he landed sharp-shooting winger David Perron from the Edmonton Oilers , sending Rob Klinkhammer and a first-round pick to the Oil in the deal .
While Perron looked like an absolute steal early on , scoring 5 goals over his first six games with Pittsburgh , the winger 's play dropped off significantly as the season wore on , and Perron 's subpar postseason performance saw him drop from the first line to the third by the end of Pittsburgh 's only playoff series .
When it was all said and done , Perron finished with 12 goals and 22 points in 43 regular season games for Pittsburgh , failing to score in any of the team 's final 12 contests .
In five playoff games , Perron registered only one assist and 12 shots while finishing as a -1 .
Perron still boasts a wealth of natural skill and , at only 26 years old , a significant opportunity to form some strong chemistry with Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin .
Yet his lacklustre play down the stretch begs the question of whether the Pens were justified in giving up a first-round draft pick to acquire him .
It 's no mystery that the Penguins are in need of some youth ,
While they 're certainly not old and busted , they 're also not the same fresh-faced phenoms that took the NHL by storm back in 2009 .
The club needs to infuse some more quality youth into the lineup , just as they did with defenseman Derrick Pouliot .
A first-round draft pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft would have been extremely valuable in this case , as the 2015 draft class is said to be one of the deepest groups in recent memory .
While North American young guns Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel lead the pack , the scouting world has been abuzz lately with the depth of talent that will fill out the rest of the first round .
The Pens will have no part of said talent , however , as their first round draft pick went to Edmonton – the club that will almost certainly select McDavid first-overall – as part of the Perron exchange .
Perron may still yet return to form and prove to be a valuable addition to the Penguins , but if he remains playing at the level he showed during Pittsburgh 's postseason run , it will certainly be difficult to justify missing out on the type of quality young player the Pens could have nabbed late in the first round .
There are certainly gems to be had late in said round , as can be seen by the last several drafts .
Talented Pens forward prospect Kasperi Kapanen was taken 22nd overall in 2014 . Three picks later came Bruins forward David Pastrnak . In 2012 , Pittsburgh snagged their own first-round gem in Olli Maatta at 22nd overall .
The 2010 draft serves as the most evident example of this , however , as the lower half of the first round features 6 players currently playing in this year 's Stanley Cup playoffs – Vladamir Tarasenko ( 16th ) , Riley Sheahan ( 21st ) , Kevin Hayes ( 24th ) , Evgeny Kuznetsov ( 26th ) , Emerson Etem ( 29th ) , and Brock Nelson ( 30th ) .
A wealth of talent will almost certainly exist in the 2015 NHL draft class as well , but the Pens will be barred from taking their pick , instead remaining hopeful that Perron will improve his consistency next season .
On the heels of Viber 's big update for the platform , the popular collaborative tool Slack is getting a highly requested feature on it 's Windows phone app .
The company has added a threaded messaging feature to its app , something its users have been asking for . It has faced stiff competition from Microsoft Teams , an in-house workspace for Office 365 users , which released in November last year offering threaded conversations since day one .
Slack 's founder had an interesting reaction to its new competition , publishing a full-page ad on the New York Times welcoming its challenger . But the company has been picking up its slack , recently launching its desktop app on the Windows Store using Project Centennial . While the app stayed in beta on Windows phones for over a year , this update came only days after it arrived on other platforms .
The changelog for the feature update is :
Features Support for our new Threads . Did we mention we have threads now ? We have threads now . They 're rolling out over the next week , so if you do n't have them yet , you soon will . FIXED The experience had some visual wrinkles here and there so we ironed them . Everything is so smooth now .
There were a couple of issues with the delivery of push notifications . Now they 'll show up as expected : Fresh and hot .
Along with the much-awaited feature , it also brought a couple of fixes that make notifications more reliable and `` irons out some visual wrinkles '' . It is still rolling out for users and will be available over the next week . Download the new update here .

For the last couple of years , Neo4j has been increasingly popular as the technology of choice for people building real-time recommendation engines . Having been at the forefront of the graph movement through client engagements and open-source software development , we have identified the next step in the natural evolution of graph-based recommendation engines . We call it Graph-Aided Search .
Recommendations Everywhere
At first glance , it may seem that graph databases are only good for social networks but it has been proven over and over again that the variety of domains and industries that need a graph database to store , analyse , and query connected data could not be any wider .
Similarly , recommendation engines go far beyond retail - the most obvious industry . We 've seen real-time recommendations with Neo4j applied to finding :
matches on dating sites ( Dating , Social )
people one may know in professional networks ( Social )
ideal candidates for clinical trials ( Pharma )
fraudsters ( Banking , Insurance , Retail )
criminals ( Law Enforcement )
events of interest ( Event Planning )
and many more…
Real-Time Recommendations
The reasons for wanting to implement a system that serves recommendations in real-time and for choosing a native graph database to do that have been well understood and written about . Once the technology choice has been made , there are three main challenges to building such a recommender . The first one is to discover the items to recommend . The second is to choose the most relevant ones to present to the user . Finally , the third challenge is to find relevant recommendations as quickly as possible .
Typically , the input to the recommendation engine is an object ( e.g . a user ) for which we would like to determine the recommendations . Such an object is represented in the graph as a node , so the whole process is effectively a traversal through the network , finding paths from the input node to other nodes , some of which will be deemed as the most relevant ones and served as recommendations .
Last year , GraphAware built an open-source recommendation engine skeleton that runs as a Neo4j extension and provides a foundation to address the three challenges outlined above . It does so by allowing developers to plug in their ( path-finding ) business logic into a best-practice architecture , resulting in a fast , flexible , yet simple and maintainable piece of software . The architecture imposes the separation of concerns between the plug-in components that :
discover all possible recommendations
recommendations apply a score to the identified recommendations
filter out irrelevant/blacklisted recommendations
optionally record why and how fast the recommendations were served
The skeleton is responsible for sorting by relevance , performance optimisations , thread-safety , and other “ frameworky ” features .
Since its first release , the GraphAware Recommendation Engine has been used by teams all around the world to build production-ready recommendation functionality into their applications .
Search
The vast majority of websites and other systems today provide some sort of search capability , allowing users to find what they are looking for very quickly . Lucene-based search engines , such as Elasticsearch and Apache Solr are the leading technologies in this space .
Like recommendation engines , search engines also serve results in real-time , sorted by decreasing relevance . However , the input to these systems is typically a string of characters and the results are matching documents ( items ) . Without adding extra complexity , the user performing the search is not taken into account . Hence , two users searching for the same thing will get the same results .
Graph-Aided Search
For the same reasons people are interested in personalising recommendations , they also want to personalise search results . To see an example of such personalisation in practice , just head to LinkedIn and type the first name of one of your connections into the search box . Your connections will appear on top of the results . Not because they are the most important person with that first name on LinkedIn , but because they are most likely the person you are looking for .
One can treat such functionality as a recommendation engine with all candidate recommendations provided by an external system ( search engine in this case ) , as opposed to discovered by the recommendation engine itself . Applying the “ right tool for the job ” philosophy , we can use the search ( S ) and recommendation ( R ) engines together to achieve what we call Graph-Aided Search :
discover all matching recommendations ( S )
recommendations ( S ) apply a score to the recommendations based on textual match ( S )
apply a score to the recommendations based on the user 's graph ( R )
filter out irrelevant/blacklisted recommendations ( R )
This way , the power of both systems can be used to build personalised search functionality .
Learn More at GraphConnect
At GraphAware , we are currently finalising the development of enterprise-ready extensions to Neo4j and Elasticsearch for bi-directional integration of the two systems , so that they can be easily combined to provide Graph-Aided Search . We will launch and open-source both extensions at this year 's GraphConnect in San Francisco .
If you are interested in real-time recommendations , personalising search results , or integrating Neo4j with a search engine such as Elasticsearch , come see my presentation at GraphConnect , starting at 2.20pm .

WASHINGTON — When President Donald Trump tried anew to reach out to young people following his much WASHINGTON — When President Donald Trump tried anew to reach out to young people following his much criticized speech to the Boy Scouts this week , his words connected with a daughter of Nigerian immigrants sitting in the crowd .
Trump congratulated the high school-aged participants in the American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation and American Legion Boys Nation leadership programs on their scholastic achievements .
“ Never quit . Never give up — always do what you love , ” the president told the gathering in the Rose Garden on Wednesday .
“ He believes in us and all the work that we put our hearts to , ” Osaretin Ogbeide said .
 Oti Ogbeide in front of the Washington Monument on Capitol Hill .  Kendall Madsen / American Legion Auxiliary
The child of Nigerian immigrants , Ogbeide hopes to learn more about the American political system and , maybe , one day be a part of government .
Topics such as lowering the cost of living and education around health — specifically the opioid epidemic — are at the top of her list of changes .
“ I want them to get the help that they need , to get the best education , to be aware of the rights that they have and liberties that are granted to them , ” said Ogbeide , one of 100 state “ senators ” the American Legion Auxiliary sent to the national conference in Washington , D.C. this past week .
The young women attended senate sessions , learned about the creation of and debated diverse bill topics and polished their campaigning skills .
The girls created bills and resolutions including the Equal Service Act — which ensures that all persons are required to register and be included in the U.S . Select Service System . They also worked on measures that support veterans .

Alumni from the program include Kristen Soltis Anderson , an American pollster named on TIME magazine 's 30 Under 30 Changing the World ; U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Michelle D. Johnson , the first woman to lead the U.S. Air Force Academy ; Jane Pauley , a TV journalist ; Susan Bysiewicz , the former Connecticut secretary of state ; Ann Richards , the former governor of Texas ; and Susan Porter-Rose , former chief of staff to First Lady Barbara Bush .
Ogbeide , or “ Oti ” as she likes to be called , hopes to join their ranks .
“ I think the girls who come to this program are informed . Whether or not we are in the [ political ] climate ... these are cream of the crop from each state . And they take it upon themselves to be knowledgeable about what 's going on around the world , ” said Kirsten Baker-Geczy , a spokeswoman with the organization .
Ogbeide 's desire to lead in her community stems from her family 's message : if you want to see change , you have got to take part in it .
Twenty years ago , Ogbeide 's parents — a tourism and hospitality professor and a nurse — immigrated to the United States from Nigeria .
“ They found each other , fell in love and began their start , ” in the land of the free , Ogbeide said .
“ My dad came here literally with 20 dollars in his pocket , ” she said adding that her parents stressed the importance of a strong work ethic .
“ My parents were very traditional , ” Ogbeide said adding that they taught her to pound yams and make a soup called Egusi . “ They wanted us to have a western upbringing but not forget where we came from . ”
Ogbeide saw first-hand the challenges and adversity her parents faced toward gaining a better education and standard of living .
“ To me being a first generation American is to combine both what your family has come from and also what you learned in America to combine those to become the best person you can be , ” Ogbeide said .
Ogbeide said she was surprised to find she had so much in common with young women from across the country who have similar hopes and aspirations .
“ I see all this passion , straight passion for policy , for government . I am not looking at you for how much money you make , how much money your family makes , ” she said . “ The color of your hair or your eye color or your skin color , the way that you speak , the way that you walk or your body . ”

We can all be brave in a crowd . The true brave is brave alone . Next month we celebrate the 20th anniversary in 1994 of the first free election in South Africa , one of the few times in history that a minority has voluntarily handed power to a majority in conditions of relative peace .
The two `` saints '' of the occasion , Nelson Mandela and the outgoing president , FW de Klerk , will have their tributes . So should a third – Helen Suzman , who died in 2009 , and whose biography by Robin Renwick appears this week . She had no Nobel prize , no memorial . She is ignored by Mandela biopics . As she predicted , political correctness would `` airbrush white liberals from anti-apartheid history '' .
For an astonishing 36 years Suzman was a flickering flame of white conscience in apartheid South Africa . For 13 of those years she carried that light alone , a one-woman party in a parliamentary sanctum of hostile men . While some came to admire her , most loathed her , and tried to drive her from their presence . They jeered her interventions with sexist , antisemitic , domineering abuse . The anti-apartheid activist Helen Joseph wrote that `` even house arrest '' must have been less lonely . Suzman 's resistance must be among the most courageous parliamentary careers ever .
Covering South Africa at the time , I was fascinated by what made Suzman tick . From comfortable Jewish stock , married to a doctor and with no need to worry herself with politics , in 1953 she became MP for Johannesburg 's `` silk stocking '' Houghton district . She could have settled into the English-speaking United party , in fake opposition to the apartheid nationalists . Later , even as a solitary Progressive , she could have `` done a Sinn Féin '' , and boycotted the system as a gesture .
She did none of this . Britain 's oddest legacy to white South Africa was a robust if minority parliament . In 1960 Suzman remarked that it was , ironically , `` the last forum of free speech in the country '' . If the Nationalists pretended to respect that freedom , she would test it to destruction . She exploited an MP 's right to ask questions , table amendments , demand votes , say what she pleased and go where she wanted . She read out Mandela 's entire defence speech in parliament so it could be reported . She visited townships , argued with police chiefs , dared them to silence her . She stuffed obscene letters in a file marked `` Fan Mail '' .
Suzman 's use of her right of access was , Mandela said later , crucial in securing prisoners books and education and links to the outside world . She befriended prisoners ' wives , including Winnie Mandela , and never turned a supplicant from her house . Mandela said prison conditions always improved in advance of a Suzman visit . He adored her and paid her the greatest compliment , that such was her tenacity he almost sympathised with the regime .
The most lethal weapons in the political tool kit are anger and humour . Suzman deployed both . She was perpetually furious . On my visits she would thrust at me some document of appalling injustice and ask how I could just stand there without getting down to write . When a minister complained that her questions were embarrassing South Africa abroad , she said it was his answers not her questions that were embarrassing . When another said she should be more careful in her friends , she shouted : `` No , only in my enemies . ''
Suzman undoubtedly benefited from being a woman . Her femininity nonplussed Afrikaner backwoodsmen , whom she nagged and infuriated . One said : `` If you were my wife , I know what I would do with you . '' She guffawed . Her gallows humour was anything but ladylike . After a day of hearing Afrikaners tell anti-black jokes , I was shocked to hear her telling dreadful anti-Afrikaner ones . She famously told John Vorster , the prime minister , to his face that he should some day visit a township , `` in heavy disguise as a human being '' . When a minister complained of the murder rate in his constituency , she advised him not to go there `` or it will rise by one '' .
Dissident whites living under apartheid appeased their consciences by voting for ( and financing ) Suzman 's party – opening them to accusations of appeasement . She opposed sanctions ( other than on sport ) , seeing no point in impoverishing black workers simply to make western liberals feel good . Western disinvestment merely shifted economic power from foreign firms to less liberal Afrikaner ones .
Suzman held that effective opposition to apartheid was internal , from black activists , unions , and the undermining of Afrikaner self-confidence – in which she played her part . I witnessed Suzman in London tearing into Mandela for supporting sanctions , which black leaders such as Desmond Tutu at first opposed . Evidently embarrassed , he muttered about Americans wanting them .
Suzman never compromised and would have been dreadful in office . To the end she prayed , `` Let no one say I mellowed . '' I followed her on the 1994 election day , when she was inspecting polling stations in Soweto . I thought it would be an elegiac victory tour through the dusty streets of a lifetime 's struggle . No way . Suzman was in a perpetual rage at the queues and official incompetence . `` Do n't worry , Mrs Suzman , '' people said . `` We have waited 46 years . We can wait four hours.We are happy . '' She replied : `` Nonsense . Find me the returning officer . ''
No one could singlehandedly end apartheid , but millions buried their heads and awaited the judgment of history . They refused an orange and called it action . Suzman 's legacy to liberalism was to abandon the armchair , to exploit the vulnerabilities of even the cruellest regime . Challenge its petty powers , exploit its tiniest freedoms , endure its pains , nudge it however painfully towards the gate of freedom . She of all people deserves her memorial .
A changeover is changing the set-up of a process from one product to the next . Reducing changeover times is a common and popular way to decrease inventory or to increase available work time ( see SMED ) . Ideally , the changeover time should be zero , allowing true one-piece flow . In reality , however , it is often not zero . This post looks in more detail at the different phases of a changeover to help you understand the process better and to reduce your changeover times .
Introduction
You may think that the duration of a changeover is simple . At one point you stop the process and the changeover starts . A bit later you start the process again , and your changeover ends . While there are processes that have such changeovers , there are also many more processes where the changeover is more complicated .
The changeover process is a disruption of your normal way of working . You could also call this unevenness ( or Mura ) . This disruption can actually be seen from two angles : First , you lose parts that could have been produced otherwise . In other words , you produce fewer parts than if you had had no changeover . Please resist the temptation to do fewer changeovers , as per my last post What to Do with SMED . Also , realize that you may lose parts not only during the full stop , but also before and afterward during the ramp up and ramp down . Generally speaking , the changeover duration is from the last part at full quality and production speed to the first new part at full quality and production speed .
Second , you spend additional work on the changeover that your people could have used otherwise . You have to prepare , do the actual changeover , wrap up afterward , and potentially do more work on quality checks after the changeover .
Loss of Production
Let 's first look at the parts that could have been produced but were not due to the changeover . The image below shows the overview of these phases . Please note that not all processes and not all changeovers go through all of these phases . Please also note that I simplified the ramp down and ramp up as a linear change , whereas in reality the line may be more curved or even have erratic peaks and valleys .
Ramp Down
Initially , the process is running at full speed and quality . Depending on the details of the process , the changeover could start with a ramp down of the process . In most cases this will go rather quick . However , there are also situations where it could take more time . It is possible that the production rate decreases slowly . It is also possible that the quality problems may go up during the ramp down because the process is no longer operating at full capacity .
Examples are found in processing industries , where the process may run slower while emptying material . The produced goods may also be of inferior quality compared to normal production . It depends heavily on the process if there is actually a ramp down , how long it takes , and its impact on quality .
Stopped
The main part of the changeover is the time when the process is actually stopped . During this time , nothing is produced .
Ramp Up
The ramp up is more common than the ramp down . It often will take some time before the process produces good parts at full speed again . This may be for a number of different reasons .
It is common , for example , for production lines to need time to fill up again . Hence , when the line starts working again , it will take some time until the first part exits the line again . ( Note : This can sometimes be avoided with a running changeover , more on this in a subsequent post . )
Another cause is that after a changeover , the settings of the process may have to be fine-tuned . During this time , there may be more frequent quality checks , adjustments to the process , and also a higher likelihood of inferior or defective parts .
Overall , you produce fewer good parts than during normal production , hence this is part of the production losses due to changeover .
Work Spent on Changeover
You can also see the changeover from the point of view of the work needed for the changeover . As per the SMED approach , you should do as much as you can before or afterward so that the actual changeover and the actual number of non-produced parts is minimal . An overview of the different tasks is shown in the image below .
Preparation
During the preparation phase , the changeover is prepared . You should have all the tools , the equipment , and the needed manpower ready before you start to ramp down .
Changeover
The actual changeover is commonly measured as the time from the last part at full quality and production speed to the first new part at full quality and production speed . This includes the ramp downs and ramp ups .
Wrap Up Changeover
After the process is running good parts at full speed again , the changeover is completed , and we can now wrap up the changeover . Return tools and equipment to their storage places , maybe do the maintenance on them or set them up already for the next changeover – these are all things you can do after the machine is running again .
Quality Checks
What many people often overlook , but what is also often necessary , is an increase in quality checks to make sure the process runs smoothly again and produces good parts . These quality efforts usually start when the machine is not yet at full speed , but when the machine just started to produce the first part . This actions often go hand in hand with the changeover to fine-tune the process settings . The increased quality checks may also extend beyond the duration of the changeover to catch quality problems caused by the changeover but happening infrequently . The details depend on your actual process , and again not all processes have this increased quality check phase .
Summary
Overall , there are quite a few steps during the changeover . To reduce waste and unevenness , you can look at all of them for improvement . The image below is the combination of the two graphs above , showing both the phases causing loss of parts and the work steps for the changeover . And again , not all changeovers go through all phases .
In any case , I hope this article helped you to understand your changeover better . Now , go out , reduce changeover times , and organize your industry !

Announced on 4 September in Berlin , Samsung 's third generation Galaxy Note will be released starting on 25 September in more than 140 countries across the globe . Ahead of the market roll-out , Android 4.3 Jelly Bean test build for the Galaxy Note 3 has leaked .
According to Sammobile , Android 4.3 test firmware with build version XXUBMH1 has leaked for the international LTE version Samsung Galaxy Note 3 bearing model number SM-N9005 .
As the device has not been released yet , users will not be able to flash the firmware except Samsung employees . The primary reason behind releasing the test firmware is to allow third part developers to port features from the Galaxy Note 3 to other devices . However , users would be able to flash the firmware once the device becomes available .
Firmware details
Model : SM-N9005
Country : Open Europe
Version : Android 4.3
Changelist : 1287056
Build date : 3 August , 2013
Product code : OXX
PDA : N9005XXUBMH1

I typically do lists on unexplained mysteries which have little scientific proof of existence , such as hauntings . While these tales are a fun read and may even send a shiver or two up your spine , to me the greatest unexplained mysteries of all are about things that we actually know to exist – and which defy everything we know to be possible .
I am a scientist by trade , so it 's absolutely fascinating to me when I run into something that we ca n't comprehend , despite the vast amounts of knowledge available to us today . Outer space houses the majority of these real mysteries : What is dark matter , and dark energy ? Is there life on other planets ? This list will look at 5 scientific mysteries contained within the night sky . Enjoy !
5 The Impossibility The Star That Should n't Exist
The star in question is called SDSS J102915 +172927 . For the record , I much prefer simply-named stars as opposed to ones named like this one . The odd names do serve a purpose though , as they are typically coordinates for where the star can be found in the sky.In 2011 , a team of European astronomers discovered this star in the constellation Leo . It is a small star – only about 80 % the size of our sun – and is believed to be around 13 billion years old . Since the universe as we know it is itself thought to be around 13.7 billion years old , this is considered one of the oldest surviving stars . Nothing is particularly unusual about this star … except that according all of our theories , it should n't even exist . The star is made up of 99.99993 % hydrogen and helium , elements that are too light to condense and form a star on their own . When these figures are put into any star formation super computer simulation , the result always comes back that such a star is not possible . Astronomers are puzzled as to how such a star could have formed without the aid of heavier elements – research is ongoing .

FARMINGTON — The Farmington Police Department released video footage Thursday that depicts the violent struggle on Sept. 6 between Officer David Rock and Heriberto Nava-Martinez at San Juan Regional Medical Center moments before the officer shot the man .
The footage , which is from Rock 's body camera , shows the officer conversing with Martinez in Spanish outside a hospital room shortly after 10 p.m. Sept. 6 , less than an hour after Farmington police arrested Nava-Martinez on allegations he crashed a stolen pickup truck through the front gates of a Farmington business and then drove it erratically up and down East Main Street .
Nava-Martinez , 23 , was transported to San Juan Regional Medical Center after the incident due to health concerns and to have his blood tested for drugs and alcohol .
Shortly after the conversation with Rock , the video appears to show Nava-Martinez lunging at the officer , and the men wrestle while Rock calls for help .
The video shows Rock firing three rounds at Nava-Martinez in two separate incidents as Nava-Martinez alternately charges at the officer and then runs away from him .
`` Stop ! Stop ! '' Rock can be heard yelling in the video , after shooting Nava-Martinez once . `` You can not go for my gun ! Get down ! Get down ! ''
Nava-Martinez eventually drops to the floor while screaming and is handcuffed by Rock , who then calls for a doctor . An activated taser can be seen in the video on the floor near Nava-Martinez .
Nava-Martinez has been criminally charged in connection to the fight with Rock and the brief car chase with law enforcement officers that preceded it . His attorney , Ruth Wheeler , did not respond Thursday to a request for comment .
Farmington police Chief Steve Hebbe said Thursday that the video was shown to two of Nava-Martinez 's relatives before it was released to the media .
Police shootings bring up concerns about officer safety , training and public perception , Hebbe said .
`` Today , it is even more heightened , with the reaction of the community , the reaction of the suspect 's family , when something like this happens , '' he said .
San Juan County Chief Deputy District Attorney Dustin O'Brien said Thursday that he is still waiting on certain medical records before determining whether to criminally charge Rock in the shooting .
But he said he does not expect those records would change his current opinion , which is that Rock was justified in shooting Nava-Martinez .
`` I do n't see anything in the medical records that would change what you see and what you hear in the video , '' O'Brien said .
Hebbe said Nava-Martinez 's blood test was positive for both methamphetamine and marijuana .
O'Brien said the evidence suggests Nava-Martinez was only shot twice , once in each side of his torso . Nava-Martinez was in critical condition for several days after the shooting , despite receiving almost immediate medical attention . It also took detectives several days to identify Nava-Martinez , who is a Mexican national .
Before the shooting , Nava-Martinez was transported between hospital rooms in a wheelchair , according to the video footage . The video appears to show Rock attempting to handcuff Nava-Martinez to the chair but the officer is unable to do so .
“ I do n't see anything in the medical records that would change what you see and what you hear in the video. ” San Juan County Chief Deputy District Attorney Dustin O'Brien on whether Officer David Rock will be charged in September shooting
`` The hospital is locked , so even if you try to run , you ca n't get out , '' Rock tells Nava-Martinez after the attempt the video . `` OK ? So do n't try and run . ''
O'Brien confirmed the wheelchair 's armrests were connected only to the back of the chair , and not the seat , so it was not possible to handcuff Nava-Martinez to the chair .
Since the shooting , Hebbe said he has had conversations with hospital officials about when it is appropriate for officers to handcuff a suspect .
`` We are going to be far more cautious going forward on whether prisoners are handcuffed or not , '' Hebbe said .
Hebbe said the shooting was difficult for both Rock and his family . He said the officer met with a psychiatrist after the shooting and has since been medically cleared to return to active duty .
Nava-Martinez is expected to be arraigned in district court on Dec. 14 on charges of assault with intent to commit a violent felony , attempted armed robbery , vehicle theft , two counts of felony vandalism and disarming a peace officer and other , lesser offenses .

A kitten that was accidentally trapped in a washing machine on a 60C cycle has made a full recovery .
Lisa Keefe , of the Meadows in Nottingham , did not realise her Bengal crossbreed Bobby had climbed inside the appliance for a nap .
She raced to get him out after hearing `` a loud thudding noise '' from inside the appliance .
A vet at the clinic who treated him said : `` In my 15 years as a vet , I 've never seen a case like this . ''
Owner 'petrified '
Nine-month-old Bobby was taken to Nottingham Pet Hospital on the verge of collapse and needed IV fluids to treat shock .
His brush with death has seen him nominated for a PDSA ( People 's Dispensary for Sick Animals ) Pet Survivor award .

Ms Keefe , 47 , said Bobby was known to climb in the machine and she had put him outside before putting in a new load .
But she said the curious puss must have snuck back in and hidden under a duvet before she switched on the appliance .
`` As soon as I heard the noise I rushed to the machine and could see the colour of his fur mixed in with the quilt . I was petrified and raced to get him out , '' she said .
The kitten was in the washer `` for about two minutes '' , vet James Kellow said .
`` Bobby has learned his lesson the hard way , he does n't go anywhere near the washer any more '' , his owner added .
Vet Tamsin Thomas said : `` Bobby was on the verge of collapse as his body was soaked through and his temperature was dangerously low .
`` We gently dried him out , kept him warm and gave him IV fluids to treat shock . ''
Mr Kellow , who treated Bobby , said the kitten had sore eyes from the detergent , but within a couple of hours was `` as right as rain '' .

Since the launch of the 1.0.6.0 to the community beta , we 've been doing a lot behind the scenes and we 've had a bit of a shift in position . A lot has changed since the last update already and there is more to come . We 've been much quieter than we had previously been ( which , despite how it may feel , is actually a good thing ) and I will explain that .
A Little Background
Since release , we 've all ( the TFDi team ) come to realize that we were looking at the state of the aircraft the wrong way . In the professional software world , releasing an initial iteration of a program and adding features over time is not only acceptable but standard . This is exactly what we did . That said , that method of approaching it is unreasonable for something like an aircraft . You would n't make a car without air conditioning and windshield wipers but promise them later – that is more how our release happened ( but not what we intended ) . That leads to our shift in position – along with the community beta , which gave us a place to test things before we throw them into the official release , we 're working on not band-aiding bullet holes .
First , what 's new ( so far ) .
The REF System
In the spirit of more meaningful updates and permanent solutions , we started by revising the MCDU , page by page , and correcting/finishing it . So far , we 've added the entire REF system ( minus one page , which is pending a change in another system ) . Here are some images of it .
The REF system , although it may not be the seemingly the highest priority , was the foundation for another feature that plays a big role during particular approaches – place/bearing/distance ( PBD ) waypoints . Here 's an image of that working .
We also revisited the system that handles pilot waypoint entry , which allowed us to support latitude/longitude waypoint entry and brings both PBDs and latlon waypoint support to the FIX , REF , DIR INTC , and FPLN pages all at once .
The MCDU Annunciators
Along with the improvements to the MCDU , we 've also added the annunciator lights for various scenarios .
The 2D Popups
For those of you not participating in the Community Opt-in Beta ( COB ) , we 've added the ability to hide the yokes and 2D popups for the 6 display units , the standby display , and both MCDUs . We 've also improved their default size and position since 1.0.6.0 , as seen by their new default position below .
Here is the 2D MCDU .
VMIN/Approach Performance
Further improvements have been made to the autothrottle system and FADEC/engine response since 1.0.6.0 . We 've also redone the VMIN calculation which will allow the aircraft to properly fly its approach speeds ( and the autothrottle can actually be trusted to fly that close to VMIN now ) .
Stability/Bug Fixes
In addition to a slew of fixes between 1.0.6.0 ( for those not in the COB ) and 1.0.6.1 , we 've fixed one of the major issues not covered by other systems – the sound spool down during takeoff . The sounds work as they should during takeoff and climb now . We 've also launched our advanced crash debugging system to help us isolate and solve the remaining CTDs . Performance remains an issue for a handful of users and we 're still looking at it , but just as we focused on performance/stability initially , now we 're focusing on the airplane as a whole before polishing it again . It 's a process but we 're on the right side of it now .
What 's Pending Code/Systems-Wise
We 've got a lot of big items on our to-do list and some that are in progress . Here are a few major items that I ca n't show off quite yet but will make it into the next release .
Significantly improved NAV magenta line tracking ( including through turns )
ETE ( and possibly EFOB )
Automatic turn coordination
Mouse wheel acceleration for AFS knobs
In addition to those , we 'll be continuing through the MCDU and finishing it , both in terms of stability and functionality . Once the MCDU is at a place we 're happy with it , we will begin the same process on the autoflight system to squash the rest of its bugs . Once both of those are complete , along with the rest of the bugs we 'll fix and requests we 'll honor , the aircraft will be borderline unrecognizable from its initial release in December .

Visual Updates
While improvements have been made to the systems , I 've been working on a ton of enhancements to the exterior .
To give some background , the original artists who did the modeling/texture work on both the exterior and interior left a lot to be desired . Over the last two years of development , I 've done a ton of work on the cockpit to bring it up to our standards and to represent the real aircraft as closely as possible . As we approached the end of development , we ran out of time to revisit the exterior .
Since release , I 've been working to bring the quality of the exterior up to that of the cockpit . It was for this reason that we have continued to hold the release of the paintkit to the public . Since many of the changes made have been to the textures ( and there have even been a few mapping changes ) , we did n't want to release the paintkit , only to end up releasing an update that would break all repaints .
What 's New/Improved
Improved/optimized materials
New environment map for better-looking reflections
Fixed loss of reflections when turning on logo light
Redid cargo bay textures
A few screenshots showing the new environment map :
As well , here 's a before and after of the cargo bay textures .
What 's Still Being Worked on
Redo of all seams/rivets on the fuselage and wings ( very inaccurate/generic before , and lots of missing details )
Redo of all normal maps ( rivets were way too big/pronounced before )
Paintkit being made in 4K to enable painters to optionally offer 4096×4096 versions of their liveries ( not ideal in a 32-bit environment for VAS reasons , but good for future-proofing or for those with few addons )
Various improvements to textures in general ( more dirt and details , along with better coloring of certain parts )
New alpha channels ( some parts are reflective , but should n't be , etc )
Cabin illumination at night
Exterior lights will illuminate the surrounding parts ( ex . beacon will illuminate the top of the fuselage )
For the sake of comparison , here is a before and after of the nose .

Timelines
We 've been quiet while we were working this time . We 've been focusing primarily on getting the improvements done and plowing through the prerequisites to pave the way to permanent answers . Rest assured , although you have n't heard as much from us , we have n't retreated away . We will release 1.0.6.1 to the COB when it 's in a good place , but we 're reworking some areas at the moment . We highly encourage anyone interested in helping us polish the aircraft to participate in the COB . Our goal is to have the aircraft essentially complete before the next major non-beta release .
Closing
I encourage you to check out our changelog here and the development tracker here to stay up to date with our changes and have your feedback heard .
After potentially serious back-to-back laboratory accidents , federal health officials announced Friday that they had closed the flu and anthrax laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and have halted shipments of all infectious agents from the agency 's highest-security labs .
The accidents , and the CDC 's emphatic response to them , could have important consequences for other laboratories engaged in efforts to produce dangerous viruses and bacteria .
If the CDC — which the agency 's director , Dr. Thomas Frieden , called “ the reference laboratory to the world ” — had multiple accidents that could , in theory , have killed both staff members and people outside , there will undoubtedly be calls for stricter controls on other university , military and private laboratories that handle pathogens .
In one accident , which occurred last month , as many as 75 CDC employees may have been exposed to live anthrax bacteria after potentially infectious samples were sent to laboratories unequipped to handle them . Workers who were not wearing protective gear ended up moving and experimenting with samples of the highly infectious bacteria that were supposed to have been deactivated . All the workers were offered vaccine and antibiotics , and the agency said that no one was in danger .
In another episode , disclosed Friday , a CDC lab accidentally contaminated a relatively benign flu sample with a dangerous H5N1 bird flu strain that has infected 650 people since 2003 , killing 386 of them . Fortunately , an Agriculture Department laboratory realized the strain was more dangerous than expected and alerted the CDC .
In addition to those mistakes , Frieden also announced Friday that two of six vials of smallpox recently found stored in a National Institutes of Health laboratory since 1954 contained live virus capable of infecting people .
All the samples will be destroyed as soon as the genomes of the virus in them can be sequenced . The NIH will scour its freezers and storerooms for other dangerous material , he said .
“ These events revealed totally unacceptable behavior , ” Frieden said . “ They should never have happened . I 'm upset , I 'm angry , I 've lost sleep over this , and I 'm working on it until the issue is resolved . ”
The anthrax and flu labs will remain closed until new procedures are imposed , Frieden said .
At the CDC , Frieden said , staff who knowingly failed to follow procedures or who failed to report dangerous incidents would be disciplined . A committee of experts will be convened to revise procedures .
A new study has found that Wikipedia entries on the costliest medical conditions contradicted the latest medical research 90 % of the time .
A team of U.S. scientists said they found “ many errors ” in Wikipedia articles concerning the 10 costliest medical conditions . The researchers cross-checked Wikipedia entries on coronary disease , lung cancer , hypertension and back pain , among other ailments , against the latest research from peer-reviewed journals .

Nine out of 10 entries analyzed on the crowd-sourced encyclopedia contained assertions that were contradicted by the peer-reviewed sources . Only the entry on concussions escaped the review error free . The authors noted that the article appeared to have contributors with a greater degree of expertise , mimicking the peer-reviewed process .
“ Health care professionals , trainees , and patients should use caution when using Wikipedia to answer questions regarding patient care , ” wrote the study 's authors in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association .
The authors laid particular stress on medical professionals ; a recent study found that 50 percent of physicians admitted using Wikipedia as a reference source .

Jeb Bush actually went easy on the Senate last month when he described the chamber 's schedule as a “ French workweek . ”
When no crisis is imminent , the Senate 's rhythms are as relaxed as a beachcomber 's in July : On Monday night for a vote , hit a few party lunches and committee hearings , vote a few more times , then head home Thursday afternoon .
Story Continued Below
And with a presidential election looming , things are about to get even less rigorous : The Senate next year will take its longest summer break in two decades , a quirk of the presidential party conventions that will give lawmakers off half of July plus all of August . When they finally return , it wo n't be for long . The chamber is slated to be in session a total of five weeks during the final three months of the year .
“ It 's unbelievable . It 's awful . I do n't even know how to respond , ” rookie Sen. David Perdue ( R-Ga. ) said after perusing next year 's calendar .
Applying the seemingly straightforward observation that “ most people work five days a week , '' Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) vowed when he took over as majority leader that a Republican Senate would mean `` working more '' and an end to the jet fumes schedule of his Democratic predecessor Harry Reid . More time in the Capitol , McConnell reasoned , would only help the deadlocked Senate find consensus .
McConnell 's Senate has indeed put in more days ( 150 as of Monday ) than Reid 's chamber put in in all of 2014 , and the chamber will soon surpass the 2013 workday total , too . But the Senate is scheduled to be in session just 31 weeks next year , while the House is scheduled to work only 28 weeks .
As for Bush 's comparison to the French , which he used in a failed attack on his presidential rival , the often-truantSen . Marco Rubio ?
The French get only five weeks of paid vacation a year and use 35 hours per week as their baseline for overtime pay . Their parliament , though , is limited to working no more than 120 days per year , with some exceptions . By contrast , through the first 10 months of the year the Senate clocked 146 days in session over 917 hours , which works out to just under 3.5 days in session per week and 6.2 hours per day . The House worked 10 fewer days and 250 fewer hours over that period .
“ I do n't know what a French workweek means , ” said Rep. Tom Rooney ( R-Fla. ) . “ Literally do n't know what they do over there [ in the Senate ] . ”
Of course , time is measured differently on each side of the Capitol : One bill in the Senate can take nearly a week to pass , while House leadership can jam through several bills in a day , without that pesky filibuster hurdle and other arcane regulations .
Given the constraints of the Senate , more days in session can translate to more production , and McConnell has moved more legislation this year than last . This week is a good example : The Senate is set to adjourn on Tuesday for the rest of the week . But McConnell is threatening to call the chamber back to work after Wednesday 's Veterans Day holiday if senators do n't finish work on a veterans spending bill .
This is precisely what McConnell meant when he said his Senate would work more , said spokesman Don Stewart .
“ Reid used to threaten weekend votes all the time . He said that dozens of times . He did it once , '' Stewart said . `` Threats have to be believed . ”
Still , newer senators are amazed at how little is getting accomplished .
“ I do n't object to having time off in the Senate if we 're getting our work done . But we 're not getting our work done , ” said Sen. Mike Rounds ( R-S.D . ) , a former governor and state Senate majority leader . Deadlines to finish bills , he added , `` would help . ”
Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , who 's facing a potentially tough reelection race next year , took a different view .
“ Good ! ” McCain said of the long pre-election recess . “ Sounds good to me , as long as we get our work done . ”
Though the Senate majority leader sets the schedule , the natural inertia of the chamber points toward fewer days in session no matter how valiantly a new leader tries to change it . The vast majority of senators live in their home states , not Washington , and for Western lawmakers the trip home is a serious slog . ( Rounds said his commute is 22 hours round trip , each week . )
Then there are campaign demands , which are about to become a lot heavier — between the multiple senators running for president and nearly 30 up for reelection to their current jobs .
“ It 's fairly traditional in an election year , ” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , who helps run the floor as GOP whip , said of the light 2016 schedule . “ I 'm going to be working seven days a week , maybe just not all here . ''
If the Senate was operating as originally envisioned , it would work relentlessly for bursts of time and then send lawmakers home to mingle with constituents , said Sen. Ben Sasse ( R-Neb . ) , who is trying to disrupt the Senate 's bad habits .
“ This model does n't work very well , back and forth every week . Some people move here , I 'm not here to beat them up , but I 'm not doing that , ” Sasse said . “ There are really only two full work days per week … I do n't think it 's enough , but I do n't think we should be in session year-round . ”
Kristen Orthman , a spokeswoman for Reid , said next year 's calendar is evidence that `` Republicans ' rhetoric was bankrupt all along . ''
`` Faced with their own inability to govern , Republicans are giving up and scheduling a two-month recess , the longest in the recent history of the Senate , '' Orthman said .
But the retiring Democratic leader , having spent a long time in McConnell 's shoes , declined to go there himself .
“ It 's not easy to set a schedule , ” Reid shrugged in an interview . “ I 'm not going to complain about it . ”
Pierre Briançon , a Paris-based POLITICO correspondent , contributed to this report .
The Sunday Independent has n't changed one bit since William Martin Murphy used it to vilify Jim Larkin and the locked out workers of 1913 . These days , the anti-working class rag , now owned by Denis O'Brien 's Independent News and Media group , uses it 's influence to attack anti-water charge protesters .
Today 's front page could n't be topped for sensationalism , `` Attack on democracy '' screams the headline . Yesteryear , Jim Larkin was `` Looking for Trouble '' . Both headlines legitimise state violence against protesters . Both headlines present opponents of the state and big business as a danger to society .
The real attack on democracy however , is the implementation of a water charge that no government has a mandate to introduce ; It is the ripping up of streets to install water meters against the wishes of communities ; It is the use of state police and private security to threaten , intimidate and assault protesters ; and it is the control of the means of mass communication by a small group of super wealthy individuals .
In reality , the anti-water charge protests are a defence of and deepening of democracy . People power is only an attack on oligarchy , on the rule of the rich . The birth of any new democracy always involves some element of illegality . Next year , those who accuse us of attacking democracy will be part of the celebrations of one of this country 's revolutions . The paper that called for James Connolly to be `` dealt with '' , two days before his execution , will have colour spreads on the festivities . Let 's honour our revolutionary past another way , by fighting for real democracy , for the ideals of liberty and equality , even if that means breaking the law and attacking the rule of oligarchy .

After the outbreak of the scandal pertaining to the expired cancer drugs sold to patients , people took to social media platforms to comment on the issue , questioning whether they lost their loved ones because of the actions of Mona al-Baalbaki .

Al-Baalbaki has been sacked by the General Disciplinary Council for stealing a quantity of Health Ministry-donated cancer medicines from the hospital and selling them for hundreds of millions of Lebanese pounds .
She also replaced the medicine with other expired ones that were given to children and women patients , a forgery believed to be the reason behind their deaths .
LBCI continued investigation into the case , revealing that the period during which al-Baalabki committed her crimes extended from 2006 to 2009 , when she was the head of the pharmacy department at the hospital .
In 2009 , doubts were raised by some employees at the department , prompting internal investigations within the hospital , leading to the suspension of Mona al-Baalbaki .

“ We 'd love to share our message in far more places if only the mainstream media would stop keeping the Libertarian viewpoint from Americans , ” Benedict said . “ Almost everybody thinks Fox News is biased toward Republicans and CNN is biased toward Democrats . For Americans too dense to figure out that RT is biased towards Russia , registering as a foreign agent wo n't help. ” The United States has its own government-funded media operations that broadcast in many other countries throughout the world .
“ The hypocrisy of the Justice Department 's strong arm tactics is mind-boggling , ” Benedict said . “ The Voice of America has been broadcasting news in Russian and 40 other languages since 1942 . I 'm sure that Russia considers those VOA broadcasts to be propaganda . ”
According to political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University the United States attempted to influence foreign elections at least 81 times between 1946 and 2000 , and it did not stop then . In 2014 , while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state , a high-ranking State Department official named Victoria Nuland was caught in a taped conversation with the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine , Geoffrey Pyatt , conspiring together on how to affect an election in that country .
The U.S. Justice Department 's violation of freedom of the press for RT will not only set a terrible precedent for the rights of Americans , there will undoubtedly be retaliatory consequences elsewhere , including censorship of American news outlets in Russia . According to Russian State Duma Chair Vyacheslav Volodin , the Russian legislature will probably extend regulations on foreign agents in Russia to include news media organizations .
“ Less consumer choice in news in both the United States and Russia is a lose-lose proposition for the people of both countries , ” Sarwark concluded .

Image caption Canola , a modification of rape , is widely grown across North America for its oil
Researchers in the US have found new evidence that genetically modified crop plants can survive and thrive in the wild , possibly for decades .
A University of Arkansas team surveyed countryside in North Dakota for canola . Transgenes were present in 80 % of the wild canola plants they found .
They suggest GM traits may help the plants survive weedkillers in the wild .
The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Pittsburgh .
Over time , the build-up of different types of herbicide resistance in feral canola and closely related weeds could make it more difficult to manage these plants Professor Alison Snow , Ohio State University
`` We just drew 11 lines that crossed the state [ of North Dakota ] - highways and other roads , '' related research team leader Cindy Sagers .
`` We drove along them , we made 604 stops in a total distance of over 3,000 miles ( 5,000km ) . We found canola in 46 % of the locations ; and 80 % of them contained at least one transgene . ''
In some places , the plants were packed as closely together as they are in farmers ' fields .
`` We found herbicide resistant canola in roadsides , waste places , ball parks , grocery stores , gas stations and cemeteries , '' they related in their Ecological Society presentation .
The majority of canola grown in North Dakota has been genetically modified to make it resistant to proprietary herbicides , with Monsanto 's RoundUp Ready and Bayer 's LibertyLink the favoured varieties . These accounted for most of the plants found in the wild .
Two of the plants analysed contained both transgenes , indicating that they had cross-pollinated .
This is thought to be the first time that communities of GM plants have been identified growing in the wild in the US .
Similar findings have been made in Canada , while in Japan , a study in 2008 found substantial amounts of transgenic rape - a close relative of canola - around port areas where GM varieties had been imported .
State-wide
What surprised the Arkansas team was how ubiquitous the GM varieties were in the wild .
`` We found the highest densities of plants near agricultural fields and along major freeways , '' Professor Sagers told BBC News .
`` But we were also finding plants in the middle of nowhere - and there 's a lot of nowhere in North Dakota . ''
Image caption The GM seeds seem to be competitive , allowing a plant community to survive
Canola seeds are especially prone to dispersal , through blowing in the wind or through falling from trucks , as the seeds weigh just a few thousandths of a gram .
Professor Alison Snow , an authority on gene flow from Ohio State University who was not involved in the research , said that authorities had anticipated the existence of GM `` volunteers '' - plants growing in the wild outside fields - but did not consider it a problem .
`` Regulatory agencies in the US have acknowledged that volunteer populations of GM , herbicide-resistant canola are expected to occur , as well as populations of inter-specific hybrids , '' she told BBC News .
`` Over time , however , the build-up of different types of herbicide resistance in feral canola and closely related weeds , like field mustard , could make it more difficult to manage these plants using herbicides . ''
US policy is not to place a GM crop under any special regulatory regime unless there is a demonstrable difference between it and its conventional equivalent . The varieties in use here were deregulated in 1988 and 1989 .
This is very different from the regime that has existed for a decade in the European Union .
But the European Commission recently recommended that nations should now be allowed to make their own decisions on whether to allow the crops or not , once they have passed health and environmental impact assessments at EU level .
Authorisations at EU level have been issued for GM potatoes , sugar beet , soya bean , oilseed rape , cotton and maize products .

Court documents said the family went to the United States for the mother 's work and a holiday in August last year . The father returned to Canberra in September expecting his children to return soon after , but the mother delayed the homecoming . Court papers said the mother considered taking a short-term job in the United States , but the father wanted the children to come home in time for the start of school in February . In December , he discovered the woman had started a relationship with a US citizen and he demanded the children 's return . The mother then moved to Colorado and filed for divorce , while the father sought orders , under the Hague Convention , to have the children returned to Australia .
She opposed his application on two grounds , arguing he had consented to the children 's removal and that they would be exposed to harm – in the form of domestic violence – if they moved back to Canberra . The mother alleged a number of instances of violence and neglect by the father . He denied the allegations . In court , the woman conceded she had never contacted the police or child protection , or sought medical attention as a result of the alleged incidents . The court found the woman had not proven that the father had consented to the children staying in the United States , or that they faced a grave risk if returned .
In making the findings , the judge noted that , despite the allegations , the woman had left the children alone with their father a number of times during the family holiday . `` Such conduct is simply inconsistent with [ her ] allegations that she had witnessed numerous instances of [ the father ] being physically abusive to the children in the past year , '' the decision said . The judge ordered the woman pay the father 's legal costs . In a separate decision , the divorce application was thrown out because the woman had not lived in Colorado for the required 91 days before lodging paperwork . The judge also rejected evidence put before the court , including details of house hunting and an alleged business venture .
`` The court does not find the petitioner to be credible . I think this based on the evidence she presented herself today . It appears to be more of a set-up . It hurts her credibility , '' the judge wrote . The judge said that the case made it clear the mother wanted a divorce and that she had thought about a split for some time . `` [ The ] petitioner came to this country and decided 'now 's the time , ' and she did n't really convey that to respondent in any way that respondent understood . `` The petitioner testified that she could have pursued a divorce in Australia or California . I think she forum shopped to get a divorce in a hurry . ''
A schoolteacher who narrowly avoided a prison sentence for seducing one of her pupils has told a court she is 'fully co-operating ' with social workers after her 'ten days of madness ' .
Married Bernadette Smith , 35 , escaped a jail sentence after she was convicted of kissing and cuddling 16-year-old schoolboy Gary Ralston at his home in Cowie , Stirlingshire , and at a park in Falkirk .
The mother of three , who was sacked from her position at Bannockburn High School in Stirling over the incident , said she kept a tiny vest top on and did not have sex with the boy when she stayed over at his house in September last year .
Married Bernadette Smith , 35 , ( pictured outside court left ) escaped a jail sentence after she was convicted of kissing and cuddling 16-year-old Gary Ralston ( right ) at his home in Stirlingshire and at a park in Falkirk
At a review hearing at Stirling Sheriff Court today , Smith ( pictured outside with friends ) was said to be 'fully co-operating ' with the case management process and was told she was n't required to attend court again
She admitted her wrongdoing in February and was sentenced to a two-year supervision order and ordered to sign the sex offenders ' register .
Today , she appeared at Stirling Sheriff Court , for a community payback order review , and told the judge she was putting her life back in order after the scandal .
The court was given a report prepared by officials responsible for her supervision and her lawyer , Alistair Milne , said she was fully co-operating .
He said : 'The report is , in my submission , fully favourable , and there is a clear recommendation to allow the order to run its course .
'There has been a full level of co-operation on her part . '
Smith , of Denny , Stirlingshire , who appeared in the dock today wearing a black and grey skirt , a black top and high-heeled ankle boots , avoided jail in February after Sheriff Robertson told her that her conduct was at the lesser end of the scale for the type of sex offence with which she was charged .
At the time , the court heard how she told police and colleagues that she was 'in love ' with Gary , who she had taught and also given after-school tuition .
The affair started in Smith 's classroom when she confessed her feelings to 16-year-old Gary and the pair later went to the park and kissed . That night , she went to his house and stayed over but did not have sex with him
The 16-year-old schoolboy ( pictured in his bedroom ) later said Smith was his favourite teacher and that he 'could n't believe she was with me ' . He said ' a lot of the boys fancied her ' and said : 'She did me no harm '
The court had heard how the affair started in Smith 's classroom where she confessed her feelings to the boy , who has since waived his anonymity , before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss .
That night , Smith visited the house Gary shared with his father , Richard , and she and the schoolboy spent the night together in Gary 's bed .
The pair were caught after Gary 's grandmother found out and told the school , which suspended Smith immediately . At the time , Gary 's father admitted to being ‘ a bit ' proud of his son for catching the teacher 's eye .
Prosecutor Ann Orr said : 'She admitted she met him on two occasions outside school and kissed him on the mouth and neck .
'She also admitted meeting at his home and told his father about her feelings and she stayed overnight in the boy 's bedroom and that she had been wearing her jeans and a bra .
'She said during the interview that she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together . '
Smith had claimed in court that her behaviour was sparked over her husband Brian 's continued deceit over an affair .
The English and history teacher claimed she started her affair after trying to be a ‘ positive influence ' on Gary and said it evolved after she poured her heart out to him about her problems at home .
Sentencing her , Sheriff Robertson told her : 'Some of course may say that had it not been detected it could have led to more serious activity towards the other end of the scale , but that is speculation .
'You have lost your reputation , your job and your career , and your marriage is at an end .
'You have caused distress to your immediate family , and with the media attention that this case has attracted , I suspect that your humiliation is complete . '
Smith , 35 , blamed her husband Brian 's ( together above ) continued deceit as the reason for her behaviour
Gary 's father ( above ) admitted to being ‘ a bit ' proud of his son for catching the attractive teacher 's eye ( right )
In light of the incident , Smith was struck off by General Teaching Council for Scotland .
After pleading guilty , Gary said Smith was always his favourite teacher and added : ' A lot of the boys fancied her . I could n't believe she was with me .
'It was the last thing I expected . She said she thought she was going crazy but could n't help the way she was feeling .
'She did me no harm and I 'm fine .
'Looking back , I wish it had n't happened . It was exciting but it was n't worth it - not for her anyway . '
During today 's review hearing , Sheriff Wyllie Robertson said the order could now continue without any further court appearances .
He told Smith : 'The purpose of this review was to ensure that there has been full and complete engagement with the order and I 'm reassured in the terms of the report that you are participating fully in the case management process .
' I will allow the order to continue without any further review . '
After canning its Android-powered Nokia X smartphone range , Microsoft has unveiled the Lumia 530 , a Windows Phone 8.1 device with a price that undercuts popular low-end Android devices like the Moto G .
The new four-inch display handset , which bears some resemblance to the now abandoned Nokia X devices , will become Microsoft 's new entry-level device for consumers , expected to cost around €85 ( $ 144 ) when it hits stores this August .
The device 's launch follows disappointing fourth-quarter Lumia sales . In its latest set of financials , Microsoft yesterday announced a quarter-on-quarter decline from 8.2 million Lumias sold when Nokia still owned the devices unit to just 5.8 million under Microsoft 's ownership . Year-on-year , sales would appear to be down around 20 percent : for the same quarter last year , Nokia sold 7.4 million Lumias . However , the numbers are not like for like : Microsoft has only counted the number of Lumias sold since it took control of Nokia 's devices unit in April .
As was the case under Nokia , Lumia sales under Microsoft are not being driven by high-end Lumia devices but cheaper devices like the Lumia 525 , which costs around €95 , and €129 Lumia 630 .
The newly-launched Lumia 530 seems to sit somewhere between the scrapped Nokia X , Nokia 's S40-based feature phones and Asha touchscreen ranges . The 530 notably comes in both single SIM 3G and dual SIM 3G versions — with the latter feature often found in devices aimed at chiefly at users in emerging markets .
The 530 may also help Microsoft bring some direction to its mobile business after its recent decision to phase out the X , S40 and Asha product lines , despite its earlier arguments that they would act as a gateway to its Windows Phone 8 handsets .
As Microsoft 's devices chief Stephen Elop recently noted in a memo announcing the end of its Nokia X experiment , Microsoft is planning `` to deliver additional lower-cost Lumia devices by shifting select future Nokia X designs and products to Windows Phone devices '' .
Indeed , the curved edges of the Lumia 530 take a bigger lead from its Nokia X devices than the Lumia 520 . On the specs front , the Nokia X is quite similar too . The new low-end Lumia will have a 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor , 512MB of RAM , 4GB of storage and a MicroSD slot that supports up to 128GB . The Lumia 530 's camera has a five-megapixel sensor , while the FWVGA display has a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels . It also comes with a removable 1430 mAh battery .
On price too , the Lumia 530 pairs up neatly with the X 's starting price of around €89 , which helped Nokia offer a more affordable smartphone in India .
Of course , unlike the Nokia X , the Lumia 530 will ship with Windows Phone 8.1 , which means that it will include the Cortana voice assistant where it 's available , and Microsoft 's new Action Center for notifications and all of Microsoft 's apps .
The device will be available in orange , bright green , white , and dark grey , and goes on sale globally in August .
Despite keeping Nokia 's trademark colours , Microsoft is gradually fading out the Nokia branding . In most of the marketing materials , including press releases and a post on the Conversations blog , the device is referred to as the Lumia 530 , with mention of the Nokia name confined to the device 's product page .
`` Lumia 530 underscores our commitment to making affordable smartphones for everyone , '' Jo Harlow , corporate vice president of Microsoft Devices Group , said on the company 's blog .

Detroit Red Wings forward Johan Franzen says he 's still dealing with symptoms of the concussion that ended his season prematurely last winter , but his goal remains being cleared for the 2015-16 opener next month .
The 35-year-old joined his teammates for an informal skate Wednesday , and said afterward that , although he has setbacks every week , he 's aiming to play in Detroit 's season opener , according to Brad Galli of WXYZ-TV Detroit .
The Red Wings have made no guarantees to Franzen , who was limited to 33 games in 2014-15 after suffering a concussion in January .
Franzen said he 's making progress every week , but the 10-year veteran also told reporters he had to go home and sleep for the rest of the day following a four-hour workout last week .
The 2004 third-round pick has n't considered the possibility of retirement .
`` Never got there , '' he said . `` I want to go out on my terms . ''
General manager Ken Holland said last month that he expects Franzen to be cleared when he takes his physical at training camp .
Issue 41 I 'm hopping will see Optimus Prime with his body back . Thought I am sure it ca n't be that easy . So before we dive in and see what happens lets check out this fantastic cover art !
You Can Get This Vitruvian Optimus Prime T-Shirt from 80sTees.com !
Holy crap ! Just look at this cover ! I do n't think you could fit any more Transformers on a single cover if you tried ! The cover is set in space with Autobots on one side and Decepticons on the other getting ready to battle it out on the surface of the moon . In the background of the stary space sky you can make out the planet Earth and what I think is the Milky Way .
The first panel of the first page is a dramatic scene with Autobot Leader , Optimus Prime exploding into peaces . The crew aboard the Steelhaven have been trying to build their leader a new body . All attempts thus far have failed . This is not helped by the fact that the resources available to the Autobots on the ship are extremely limited . Thanks to Hotrod 's efforts the Ark has been located and Fortress Maximus decides to approach Grimlock and the Autobots from Earth for help .
Upon their encounter , Grimlock wants no part of helping Fortress Maximus and he demands that crew of the Steelhaven handover Goldbug who is a fugitive . Fortress Maximus refuses , but to prevent a fight , Goldbug ends up surrendering . Grimlock believes there can be only one Autobot leader and so challenges Fortress Maximus to a battle for control of the Autobots . He sights an archaic ‘ Code of Combat ' .
Inside the Ark 's brig , Goldbug discovers Blaster , who is strapped to a energy-sucking chair . Blaster 's spirit is broken from having been jailed and wasting away . Goldbug talks him into fighting in place of an injured Fortress Maximus .
In another location , Soundwave has been tracking the Steelhaven . Ratbat sees this as a chance to take out the Autobots of earth and the Steelhaven all at once . A very energy efficient mission .
Both the Ark and the Steelhaven land on the move and the crews from both ships step out to watch the historic fight between Grimlock and Blaster .
As the two Autobots fight , they whined up far away from the rest of the Autobots . It is during their battle that the Decepticons attack . During the assault on the Autobots , Bonecrusher and the rest of the Constructicons infiltrate the Ark and retrieve several Decepticon Prisoners .
Due to a lack of any real commander , the Autobots are losing the fight . Fortress Maximus orders Goldbug to take the small crew aboard the Steelhaven and leave .
As Grimlock and Blaster are still fighting off some distance , it is Blaster who notices the epic battle going on back at the moon 's landing location . Grimlock and Blaster settle their differences and the two Autobots join the battle going on . As the two work together they manage to force the Decepticons to retreat .
Grimlock because more accepting of the idea of working as a team as a result of how effective he and Blaster were working together . With all the damage taking by the Autobots and the Ark , repair work is very important . Fortress Maximus states that the Steelhaven will be unable to help . Siting the need for a great leader he tells everyone that he sent the ship to Nebulos . It 's the one place with the technology to rebuild Optimus Prime .
My Thoughts On This Issue
I am going to save the best part for last because I think it is so cool . But for now , lets talk about the problems this issue has in my eyes .
Out of nowhere several of the characters start acting like their cartoon counterparts . Most notably is Grimlock and how he starts talking like an idiot . Granted , Grimlock is not a favorite character with comic book fans so far in the run . He has been cruel and unworthy of the leadership roll he was given . In this issue however , he is colossally one sided and it 's almost comical the change in his personality to mimic is cartoon counterpart . This change , along with other Transformers that start speaking like their cartoon alternatives , it 's an eye soar to the reader and one that really pulled me out of the story .
The best part about this issue was the epic battle that took place on the moon . Something strange was going on that I could not put my finger on . At first it seems ridiculous how the Transformers where ignoring near by battles and even the Deceitpcon invasion of the Ark . It was not till the end of the battle that I came to realize/remember that sound does not travel in space . So there was no way Transformers could hear battles going on directly behind them . It 's why it took Grimlock and Blaster so long to observe the attacking going on back at the landing site . It was a pinch of realism that I thought was amazing !
Transmission Letters This Issue
Dear Transmissions ,
I have only one question . How many times are you going to kill poor Bumble-eh-Goldbug ? Do n't you think he ever gets tired ? Think about it : you mess him up real bad in issue # 1 , then all the Autobots take a powder in issue # 5-8 . You knock him silly again in issue # 16 , have him scrapped by the Joes in G.I . JOE VS . THE TRNASFOMERS # 1 , and then overhauled in GIJ VS TF # 4 . You give him the Scraplets in issue # 29 , and now in issue # 37 his body is crushed to a pulp and his mind is squeezed into a tiny battyer-powered toy car . Come on , guys ! Leave Goldbug/Bumblebee/any-other-names-he's-got alone !
By the way , I spoke with Shingo a few months ago , He wanted me to tell you that he thinks Transformers are cool .
Eddie Smith
Green Belt MD
Eddie , with all the other things the TRANSFORMERS will be going through in the next few months , there wo n't be any time to trash Goldbug much . You can let Shingo know that we will soon be sending out a search party of Deceitpcons to find out why he has n't written back yet . With Shockwave and the other ‘ Cons a bit upset lately . . . well , we 're not responsible for the consequences .
Dear Transmissions ,
I 'm a big fan of the TRANSFORMERS ( and have been for five – no , six months ) , and i 've bought nearly every issue . I 'm glad you dumped Grimlock as leader of the Autobots , although he was an interesting change of pace , and I 'm also happy to see more of Blaster .
I ; ve just finished issue # 37 , and it 's nice to see that there are some humans with brains enough to realize that there are two different Transformer Armies – now how about some more humans who can actually tell the difference between the Autobots and the Decepticons ?
Enough of the usual blab . I have one single complaint : are n't there any female Transformers ? I especially want to see some female Autobots . Until Grimlock learns the meaning of the word “ grammer , ” Make Mine Marvel !
Emily Stweart
Fort Worth , TX
Emily , You 're not alone ! We receive hundreds of letters every month asking for female Transformers . Of course , you and most people who write us assume two things : first , that Transformers are either male or female , and second , that unless a Transformer is explicitly female , the Transformer is male . And hey , what about Arcee ? She 's a female Transformer from the year 2005 . You can read more about her in the TRANSFORMERS : THE MOVIE comic book , and in the TRANSFORMERS UNIVERSE . Also , Grimlock knows perfectly well what “ Grammer ” means , “ Grammer is a fleshling wife to Grandfather. ” Unh , yeah , Grimlock , sure .

Rochester , NY – The historic , 150-year-old horse chestnut tree which stood in front of the National Susan B. Anthony Museum & House ( Anthony Museum ) died over the past winter , and was felled by the City of Rochester Forestry Department for safety reasons on June 14 . Because of the tree 's significance , Deborah L. Hughes , President and CEO of the Anthony Museum persuaded the City to save the logs . With the collaboration of the City of Rochester Forestry Department , Bill Morse/Wm . B. Morse Lumber Co. , Becky Wehle , President of Genesee Country Village & Museum ( GCV & M ) and Shawn Havranek of Sodus , NY , the logs from this tree will be milled , dried , and stored for future use .
The sawing and piling for drying will take place Saturday , October 27 from 9am–4 pm at GCV & M . The milling event is free and open to the public , and the Anthony Museum will have representatives on hand to discuss the tree 's history and significance . Those interested in observing the milling process can check in at GCV & M Admissions for instructions and directions to the location . GCV & M is also planning its annual Trick-or-Treating celebration that day from noon–4 pm . Admission is $ 8 for youth ages 1–17/ $ 5 for member youth . All children under the age of 1 and adults that are accompanying children are free . Tickets are available online or at the door for Trick-or-Treating , and are separate from the log milling .
GCV & M will provide space in their historic village to pile the lumber on traditional foundations to naturally air dry for the next couple of years . Becky Wehle expressed that they are , “ pleased to be able to help preserve this important 19th-century tree using historic drying methods and look forward to it having new life when the process is complete. ” At that time , the lumber will be used for projects yet to be determined .
Why is this tree important ? This iconic tree was mature at the time Susan B. Anthony lived at 17 Madison Street , and was witness to many key events in the life of the noted suffragist , including her arrest for voting in 1872 , and the crowds that gathered at her house on her death in 1906 . This tree was recently featured in the book , Wise Trees by Diane Cook , Len Jenshel , and Verlyn Klinkenborg , and published by Abrahms .

Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated that coffee drinking is associated with reduced mortality of cardiovascular disease . However , its precise mechanisms remain to be clarified . In this study , we examined whether single ingestion of caffeine contained in a cup of coffee improves microvascular function in healthy subjects . A double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study was performed in 27 healthy volunteers . A cup of either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee was drunk by the subjects , and reactive hyperemia of finger blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry . In an interval of more than 2 days , the same experimental protocol was repeated with another coffee in a crossover manner . Caffeinated coffee intake slightly but significantly elevated blood pressure and decreased finger blood flow as compared with decaffeinated coffee intake . There was no significant difference in heart rate between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake . Importantly , caffeinated coffee intake significantly enhanced post-occlusive reactive hyperemia of finger blood flow , an index of microvascular endothelial function , compared with decaffeinated coffee intake . These results provide the first evidence that caffeine contained in a cup of coffee enhances microvascular function in healthy individuals .

Though YouTube has terminated the Toy Freaks channel , the man behind that channel can take solace in the fact that he will not face criminal charges . One week after authorities in Missouri and Illinois announced an investigation into Greg Chism , they announced that the controversial videomaker will not be tried for child abuse .
On the Toy Freaks channel , Chism starred in videos alongside his two daughters , Victoria and Annabelle . These clips were often dark and uncomfortable ; in some , Victoria and Annabelle simulated vomiting and physical pain . For whatever reason , these acts proved popular . Prior to its termination , it had more than 8.5 million subscribers .
Toy Freaks was one of the channels James Bridle cited in a widely-shared article that discussed inappropriate content in the children 's section of YouTube . “ many , many viewers feel [ Toy Freaks videos ] border on abuse and exploitation , if not cross the line entirely , ” Bridle wrote .
In response to the pressure it faced after the publication of Bridle 's article , YouTube terminated more than 50 channels aimed at kid viewers , including Toy Freaks . A week after Chism lost his channel , he became the subject of a criminal investigation carried out by police departments in both Illinois ( where Chism used to live ) and Missouri ( where he lives now ) .
Ultimately , law enforcement officials determined that Chism 's case required no child abuse charges . “ In a cooperative effort with the Granite City , Illinois , Police Department , and after consulting with prosecutors in Illinois , Missouri , and the US Attorney 's Office , it has been determined there were no criminal violations , ” a spokesperson for the St. Charles County , Missouri , Police Department told BuzzFeed . “ St . Charles County Police Department is not investigating Mr. Chism or the Toy Freaks YouTube channel . ”
Had he been charged , Chism would not have been the first creator to get into legal trouble related to the treatment of his children . Last year , the Maryland parents behind the DaddyOFive YouTube channel received five years probation and lost custody of two children after prank videos targeting those children were determined to constitute child neglect .
A message posted by Omar Hussain said all non-believers ‘ must be hated '
A BRITISH recruiter with Isis in Syria is grooming youngsters through secret internet messages featuring kittens with bombs and by claiming it is a Muslim 's duty to hate all non-believers .
Omar Hussain , who has been linked to a man who was convicted of a Remembrance Day beheading plot , has been using an encrypted smartphone app to draw in hundreds of impressionable followers with cute images of cats paired with poisonous online lectures .
Hussain , 28 , recently posted a photograph of a kitten curled up inside a suicide explosives belt . Alongside it he wrote : “ Come closer and I 'll blow the entire house down ! ”
Another disturbing picture featured a cat called Bint Lucy snuggled up against a hand grenade .

The Spartans will play a pair of exhibition games at home against Pacific Union College ( Nov. 1 ) and Cal State East Bay ( Nov. 6 ) before regular season action begins .
Three nonprofit advocacy groups that were denied tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service were all units of Emerge America , an organization devoted to cultivating female political leaders for local , state and federal government .
The I.R.S . denied tax exemption to the groups — Emerge Nevada , Emerge Maine and Emerge Massachusetts — because , the agency wrote in denial letters , they were set up specifically to cultivate Democratic candidates . Their Web sites ask for evidence that participants in their training programs are Democrats .
News of the I.R.S . decision , which surfaced in heavily redacted denial letters to the groups that were posted to the agency 's Web site last Thursday , raised concerns among advocacy groups , known as 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations after the section of the tax code that governs them , at large .
Crossroads GPS , a conservative advocacy organization with ties to Karl Rove , the Republican strategist , sent an e-mail to supporters on Tuesday , assuring them that it was not one of the three groups denied exemption .

Karen Middleton , president of Emerge America , acknowledged on Wednesday that the three state organizations had been denied an exemption . She said the groups were in the process of converting into 527 organizations , which are also tax-exempt but disclose their donors , unlike 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups .
The same thing happens to me several times every year come spring and summer . I 'll sidle into an establishment with a limited craft beer selection and have to make A Hard Choice . Sure , most places have at least a Sam Adams tap nowadays , and usually that 's the old standby in such situations .
Well , as long as it 's Boston Lager .
Sometimes , though , the establishment in question only carries the seasonal Sam offerings . And therein lies the problem , at least for me .
I just do n't like Sam Adams Summer Ale .
Now , I 'm not saying you should n't like it . No , no , no . I very much hope you enjoy it . But to my palate , there 's something about he concoction of lemons , wheat , and grains of paradise that leaves my tongue and throat feeling like they 're coated in hair , and soury-tasting hairs at that .
I know , sounds tasty , right ?
So , what do I do when I find myself in a Summer Ale situation and no other craft offerings are available ? Do I swallow ( my rather prodigious ) craft beer-drinker pride ? No , I look around around for a familiar 3-sided white handle emblazoned in blue .
Yes , I look for Blue Moon . There , I said it .
I always feel a little guilty about it , too . You know , because Blue Moon is a Coors…err , well , MillerCoors subsidiary . And I think that means that as a craft beer-lover , I 'm not supposed to like Blue Moon . You , know because it 's from The Man . And because it 's from The Man , it 's not considered real craft beer , I guess .
But here 's the thing : it seems like craft to me . For all the research I 've been able to do on Blue Moon ( again , I 'm pretty lazy and not really a journalist of any stripe , so my “ research ” boils down to an 5-minute session of Googling ) , it seems to me that the company—the Blue Moon Brewing Company , that is , not the Mega-Industrial-Global-Brew-Corp parent company—puts their attention on brewing before marketing . They seem to use quality ingredients rather than corner-cutting with cheap adjuncts , and the truth is , I believe I can taste that in the final product .
Well , as long as the bartender does n't mess things up with an unnecessary orange slice . But I 've already beaten that horse pretty solidly .
Either way , people are fond of saying that Blue Moon is n't a real craft beer . And I suppose if we 're determined to define “ craft ” based on an arbitrary measure like the number of barrels produced annually , it probably does n't qualify . But I 've decided I 'm sticking to my own definition here ; defining something as “ craft ” based on volume is kind of dumb .
Do n't believe me ? Look , I can make a half dozen grey , lifeless ceramic ashtrays from a few blocks of kindergarten clay using an old shirt as apron , but that certainly does n't mean I crafted anything .
To me , craft beer is one brewed with a focus on the end result , using quality ingredients and ( mostly ) traditional processes .
In other words , I 'm not going to let myself be prejudiced anymore about any beer . For months now I 've been casting a weary eye at every Goose Island 6-pack I see , certain that those bottles held a travesty of corporate-megabrewing swill intended to pilfer some unsuspecting former Goose aficionado out of his or her $ 9 . But you know , what ? Every Goose I 've had since A…B… , A…B… , um , that big conglomerate bought the company has been as tasty as the years before .
Now , obviously , there are always going to be questions of the marketing leverage of giant corporations that by and large controls distributors . I get that . The fight for shelf space will rage for as long as the three-tier system plague us . But that 's a different post altogether .
For now , when it comes to individual brews , I 'm going to let my palette make the decisions about what I like and do n't like , not my preconceptions .
And I 'm not going to feel guilty about it .

While most Calgarians continued to climb into a car or truck before heading off to work , those hopping onto a saddle and pedalling to the salt mines has more than doubled over the past five years .
The city 's 2016 census , released last week , shows 67 per cent of respondents drives to work alone while another six per cent carpool — that 's far more than the 6,798 or 1.75 per cent who cycle .
But the number of Calgarians commuting by bike is up significantly since 2011 when the city census takers began collecting mode of transportation data and found just 0.87 per cent , or 2,923 , pedalled to work . ( By comparison , 1.3 per cent of the roughly 15.4 million Canadians who commute said they cycle , according to the 2011 National Household Survey . )
Still , the citywide figure does n't tell the whole tale . We 've dug down and mapped out the percentage of bike commuters by neighbourhood using the city 's 2011 and 2016 census data and spotted some dramatic shifts in or near communities where bike infrastructure has been built or improved over the past five years .
( Note : The various bikeways shown on both maps is from 2016 and not all , such as the downtown cycle track , existed in 2011 . )
2011 Calgary Bike Commuters by Community
Here are the Top 10 bike commuting neighbourhoods in 2011 ( compared to city average of 0.87 % ) :
Point McKay — 5.78 % West Hillhurst — 5.06 % Parkdale — 5.01 % Mount Pleasant — 4.66 % Wildwood 4.51 % Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill — 4.30 % North Haven Upper — 3.87 % Ramsay — 3.55 % Hillhurst — 3.47 % St. Andrews Heights — 3.45 %
For example , compare Rosedale where just half a decade ago just 1.69 per cent of said they commuted by bike . The latest census shows that rate has shot up to 9.51 per cent . Similar , though not as pronounced , increases are seen in Capitol Hill , Rosemont , Mount Pleasant , and Cambrian Heights .
So , what common factor would trigger the increases in those communities ? Arguably the 10th Street bike lane , which the city installed in the fall of 2011 ( several months after the census takers came a-knocking ) , sparking outrage among motorists and residents — most of which has since dissipated .
That said , it 's probably inaccurate assign any increase to a single piece of bike infrastructure as the primary motivating factor . Rather , the more likely explanation being the expansion of a network that not only gets people to the edge of the city core but through it more safely via the cycle track network .
2016 Calgary Bike Commuters by Community
Here are the Top 10 bike commuting neighbourhoods in 2016 ( compared to city average of 1.75 % ) :
West Hillhurst — 10.62 % Wildwood — 9.58 % Rosedale — 9.51 % Sunnyside — 8.25 % Hillhurst — 7.64 % Inglewood — 7.61 % Ramsay — 7.41 % Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill — 7.16 % Elbow Park — 7.00 % Scarboro — 6.88 %
The build-it-and-they-shall-come trend appears in other communities along or near newer bike infrastructure , such as the 5th Street S.W . cycle track or the extension of the 9th Avenue bike lane .
The number of Cliff Bungalow residents who chose to hop on their bike and cycle to work jumped from 2.44 to 5.83 per cent between 2011 and 2016 census years . The newest figures show , respectively , 7.41 and 7.61 per cent of Ramsay and Inglewood residents commute by bike — up significantly from 3.55 and 2.14 per cent .
Other standouts were Eau Claire , from 0.28 to 5.99 per cent ; Wildwood , from 4.51 to 9.58 per cent ; and Sunnyside with 8.25 of respondents now saying they commute by bike compared to 3.11 per cent in 2011 .
Let us know if you spot any other trends or suggestions how , or where ( take a look at the northeast quadrant , for example ) , the city could encourage more people to cycle to work .

2014 Summer League rosters – Boston
O.D . Anosike – Anosike played in summer league last year with the Nuggets , then split last year between Italy and France . He started in Italy with Pesaro , and averaged 14.3 points and a league leading 13.1 rebounds in 35 minutes per game . He then bought himself out of his contract in May and finished the season with Strasbourg , where he did little in six games , averaging only 4.5 points and 3.3 rebounds in 19 minutes per game . The 6 ' 7 Anosike is self-evidently an extremely proficient rebounder – strong , relentless , a decent athlete and a tireless worker , he uses his strength and determination to clean the boards , box out and rebound out of his area . The offensive skills , however , are lacking – Anosike posts little , shoots less , has no range and a very poor free throw stroke , good for some occasional pick and roll action but a finisher in the paint at best , and even then not the best one . Given his size , the fact that he is exclusively a paint player and the fact that he does not protect the rim , Anosike has few hopes of joining the NBA level . But Italy will have him back for many a year to come .
Chris Babb – Babb started the season with the Celtics and also ended it there . He is signed through 2017 , albeit all unguaranteed from here on out , and played 14 games with the team down the stretch . He did n't play them well , exclusively casting up threes and missing most of them , but he played them nonetheless . In the time in between , Babb played 33 D-League games with the Maine Red Claws and averaged 12.0 points , 6.1 rebounds and 3.3 assists in 37.5 minutes per game . As effective of a role player as Babb is – demonstrating good IQ , moving the ball around , throwing the occasional nice pass , rebounding a bit , and of course catching and shooting – it is a bit odd why the Celtics see so much in a player who just is n't that productive and who is merely a decent shooter on low volume , wide open attempts . They clearly like his chances of being a quality defensive player at the two guard position , despite being slightly small for the position and not a great athlete . It 's a generous projection . But given that Babb contributes a bit of everything ( save for penetrating the first line of a defense or contributing any offense inside the arc ) whilst making strikingly few errors and playing hard , it 's easy enough to see what they like . They might run out of roster spots , though .
Dairis Bertans – Davis 's brother is smaller at 6 ' 4 , older at 24 , and is a slightly undersized ( for the NBA ) shooting guard instead of a forward . He is something of a classic Eastern European guard , a pick-and-roll role player who runs around a lot but does n't leap , who defends by rotating and fouling ( they 're told to ) rather than being able to lock anyone up , and who shoots well without being exceptional at it . Save for his occasional secondary ball handling and pick and roll action . Bertans only really contributes as a scorer , prepared to go into the trees off a screen with a decent change of speed but struggling against size while in there , and even more prepared to pull up for a jumper or catch and shoot from long range , whilst taking a few more than he should in the process . It might translate to the NBA if he was bigger , but it 's not going to at a grounded 6 ' 4 .
Daniel Coursey – Coursey is the type of summer league discovery that makes you glad you take notes on absolutely everybody you watch , even when that somebody is just a 10ppg power forward from Mercer . Mind you , there were n't many of them . Here they are quoted verbatim .
Very good shotblocker , team 's only one . Good rebounder . Efficient , no range . Lefty . Not powerful . Finisher . Lefty hooks out of the post but not much from down there . Great timing from the help side . Very lefty . Bites on perimeter fakes .
Colton Iverson – The Celtics ' draft pick from last season , Iverson turned down a training camp invite to go to Turkey with Besiktas , to continue the strong legacy of Iversons with that team . In 29 games of Turkish league play , he averaged 6.2 points , 4.3 rebounds and 2.3 fouls in 14.9 minutes per game , shooting 51 % from the field and 49 % from the line . Iverson is in to fulfil a role – offensive rebound , putbacks , finish around the rim and push everybody around . It 's a limited if useful role , but without being much of a rim protector and with very limited scoring talent and range , it 's likely not an NBA one .
Edwin Jackson – Long since on the NBA radar , Jackson went undrafted in 2011 , and this is his first time in any summer league . The 6 ' 3 French-American combo guard has become one of the best players in his domestic league , averaging 18.0 points and 2.3 assists in 32 minutes per game , and is certainly an NBA calibre scorer . He 's also an NBA calibre athlete , undersized for the shooting guard position but with long arms and good speed , adept at finishing around the rim ( and getting there ) despite his size and able to shoot over everybody . The knock on Jackson has always been that he takes too many jump shots , and he still does – he is a good not great shooter who could see a spike in his percentages once he realises an improvement in his shot selection . Nevertheless , the guy really knows how to score , in a Leandro Barbosa type of way . It 's a translatable skill , easily , and he has a chance at the NBA .
Chris Johnson – Johnson is also signed through 2017 and being taught to become the next Keith Bogans . Corner threes , catch and shoots , decent if slightly overstated man to man perimeter defense , and the like . He misses quite a lot of open shots from the corner and the wing so it 's going swimmingly so far .
Mike Moser – Moser is a fairly quirky player who apparently has decided that he wants to be a three point shooter . Historically , he has not been good at this , but an uptick as a senior to 37.8 % at least justifies it a bit . now . Not strong or wide , the 6 ' 8 Moser is not built to play the traditional power forward spot at a professional level that he has done so much at the collegiate level , but he nonetheless is a good rebounder with a motor and some athleticism .
What Moser could be is a face-up four in a small forward 's body . He likes to get out in transition and is a good athletic finisher , who finishes looks on offense rather than creates them . He catches and shoots despite his flat footed release , he finishes around the basket , and he gets a few off of putbacks . Moser 's shot selection is not the best , especially with the jumpshot he continues to adore , but he can put the ball on the floor against flat footed opponents ( especially after up-faking a closing-out defender ) , utilises a spin move , can pass off the drive , and somewhat makes up for poor defensive effort with his nose for the ball .
All of which is going to make him a solid Israeli league player .
Devin Oliver – As a senior , Oliver averaged a solid but unremarkable 11.9 points , 7.7 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game , but certainly enjoyed the benefits and was a big part of Dayton 's tournament run . He has spent the last couple of years adapting his versatile game to being more perimeter centric , as that is what his 6 ' 6 , 225lbs frame is catered for . He has added a catch and shoot three , which is much improved and which should translate , even though he barely jumps on it . He is still not the best ball handler , at all , especially with the right hand , but he can straight line drive it and cut to the rim off the ball . And while his perimeter defense is a bit unproven given the amount of time he spent defending the paint , he ought to be fast enough to keep up there . If the versatile and high IQ Oliver can become more of a full time perimeter player , then his strong post-up offensive game becomes a big mismatch weapon .
Kelly Olynyk – Save for the fouls and turnovers , Olynyk had a decent rookie season . He rebounded , played his high IQ game , shared the ball , and scored if not entirely efficiently on offense . He might not be fast enough to play the stretch four spots , and although he has bulked up , maybe he 's never going to be big enough to play the five spot . Projecting a position for him defensively is n't easy . But he 's plenty solid enough .
Phil Pressey – Pressey is an excellent passer out of the pick and roll . Very excellent . And his overall floor game continues to develop – an assist to turnover ratio of nearly three to one is good from anyone and very much so from an overmatched rookie . But overmatched is the big word there . The small Pressey just looked like he could n't make a shot at the NBA level , even though he continues to try , a great passer and terrible scorer who still tries to score . He still takes ones he ca n't make , and while it is understood he needs defenses to respect the jumpshot so as to be able to penetrate them , he ca n't shoot and it hurts the team when he tries . With two other non-shooting point guards in the fold next year , Pressey 's position and his unguaranteed contract are under threat . Best get them shots up in practice .
Marcus Smart – Smart ca n't shoot , that much we know . He 's not a half court point guard , either , not even especially close to what John Wall was at this age , back when John Wall was n't much of a half court point guard either . As much as he attacks , throws himself to the rim and gets to the line , he also drives into trouble without knowing why at times , looks to score before he looks to pass , and seems to not have the best offensive IQ . Smart 's physical stature allows for some slightly quirky usage as a point guard , not just driving around screens but also setting them , which might be fun to see with Olynyk down the road , but at this point his passing vision , consistency and understandings of time and score all need a lot of work , work that comes through experience . He seemed to struggle much more against better quality competition , which does n't bode well , and was pretty inconsistent . The biggest thing Smart could do to help himself is to stop taking overconfident jumpshots early in the clock , many of which would be bad shots even for good shooters , which he certainly is not . Maybe he learns , maybe he does n't . His offensive skill set in the half court is a legitimate concern and needs a lot ot work .
However , ignore that for the moment . Look at the defensive play . Smart has greater size , greater athleticism , terrific lateral quickness and a high motor . He should dominate the point guard position on defense . Smart is disruptive , persistent and energetic , an absolute harasser on that end . He is strong , he is fast , and he gets to the spot before the defender . Smart takes charges , flops egregiously ( which is sort of a virtue , however noxious ) , and has chase-down blocks in a way that no other point guard really does . He is not ready made on this end , and will probably make some rookie mistakes with fouls and missed rotations in the early days . But he is so , so projectable on that end .
There 's a long way to go on offense . But just being as athletic as he is be half the battle won .
James Young – Young came into his freshman with a great reputation , one partly born out of his supposed offensive instincts . But they were n't on show . Players with offensive instincts should not look as lost and motionless as he did when off the ball . They should move , cut , get open , and not just stand there . Players with offensive instincts should not jump to pass several times a game like Young did . Players with offensive instincts should n't drive into traffic relentlessly without knowing why they are doing it , without it being the percentage play , without there being any real chance of getting to the rim or drawing a foul because the defender got into position about half an hour before the drive even started . But Young did all these things all year young , showing only slight improvement by the year 's end . His fundamentals were weak , his IQ low , his passing vision and decision making poor . He rarely used screens or fakes , threw it away so often , and his shot creating abilities involved either the aforementioned drives to nowhere or just raising up and shooting .
Mind you , he 's been drafted low enough to get away with it . Because the potential is there . Young is a big wing with fluid mobility and an extra gear at times , who could be an excellent shooter and an excellent defender . The jumpshot form is decent enough , and the results mostly good – if he hones it further , improves his consistency , improves his selection and learns how to create better looks like fakes , jab steps and the like , he could be one of the league 's better shooters . And with his size and quick release , it will be tough to block . Young is confident , we 'll give him that , and is no shrinking violet which will help his shooting prowess . His handle is sloppy and he ought never be expected to be a regular slasher to the rim , but if he can better recognises what is already a decent pull-up jumpshot , that will give him some effectiveness inside the arc too . He can run the court and finish at the rim , which would suffice as an offensive package were he never to develop much of a slashing game or learn how effective dive cuts can be . The same package is true of his defensive projection , where his size , long arms and mobility bode well , although he needs to plug in all the time and want to attack the glass . He is of course young and in a situation where he can develop , so there 's plenty of scope for improvement , and plenty of reason to expect it .
But , meh . Long way to go . Long long way to go .
When you sign up for telecom services — some combination of TV , broadband , and/or phone — from your cable company , you 're told you 'll pay something like $ 49 or $ 99 a month… and yet the price you actually pay can be as much as 40 % or more on top of that , thanks to a heap of sometimes confusing charges and fees . Which ones should you blame the government for , and which are made up by your cable company ? One cable company at a time , we 've been using real customers ' bills to break it down . In previous installations we 've gone through Comcast , DirecTV , Charter , and TWC ; now , it 's Verizon 's turn .
The below bill was provided to Consumerist by a real-life Verizon FiOS customer who subscribes to a triple-play TV , broadband , and phone package for a stated rate of $ 129.99 per month .
The customer has a promotional discount , but also pays various taxes , surcharges , and fees . In the end , of their total $ 149.31 bill , $ 39.92 — about 26 % — comes from add-ons outside of the stated package price .
To better understand each of these fees , we 'll go through the bill line-by-line :
FiOS TV , Internet & Phone Bundle
1 . ) FiOS bundle price
This is the quoted price for the service bundle you subscribe to . In this case , the consumer subscribes to a triple-play bundle that includes the Preferred HD level of TV service , 50 Mbps internet , and a home phone line .
As of March , 2016 , the closest advertised bundle on Verizon 's website actually has more services for a lower cost , but they advertise it like so :
This is the price you expect to pay , and the one you sign up for .
Additional Services , Equipment & Discounts
2 . ) ( Rent ) : HD DVR
When the FCC says that cable companies make too dang much money from anticompetitive set-top box fees , this is the kind of fee they mean .
This particular $ 16.99 fee is for one single HD-enabled , DVR-enabled box . Other fees we 've seen on Verizon customers ' bills range from $ 12 for a single HD , non-DVR box to $ 34.99 for a bundle of four HD-enabled , non-DVR boxes in four rooms .
In other words , charges will vary based not only on what services you get and how many devices you have , but also on what bundle terms you subscribe to , and where and when you signed up for service .
3 . ) Extended Savings 24 Mo . Discount
Verizon creates their bundle prices by promising “ discounts ” over their standard , non-bundle pricing for each of the services included in your package . The discount line is how they reconcile that . On this bill there 's only the one line-item , however on a different customer 's bill , Verizon laid out their pricing rationale like so :
Fees & Other Charges
4 . ) State and Local Sales Tax
They do say death and taxes are the certainties in life , right ?
Basically every jurisdiction in the country has some kind of state and/or local sales tax imposed on telecommunications services . Verizon bundles all of theirs into one single line item . This particular subscriber lives in an area where both their municipality and also their state charge sales tax on telecommunications services .
Googling “ [ state name ] communications tax ” should be the fastest way to find the pay-TV or voice line service tax rates in your state . Rates may also vary based on the county or city where you live .
5 . ) Telecommunications Relay Service
This subscriber 's home state imposes a small fee on all phone lines to cover the cost of providing relay services for consumers who are deaf or hard of hearing .
6 . ) E911
The state where this subscriber lives imposes a charge on every phone line — landline and wireless — to contribute to financing the state 's Enhanced 911 services . The vast majority of states impose a similar fee .
7 . ) Federal Universal Service Fee
The FCC 's Universal Service Fund pays for programs like Lifeline that expand phone and Internet coverage to include more rural and/or low-income Americans who would otherwise be unserved .
The Universal Service Fund is paid into by telecom operators , who are permitted — but not obligated — to recoup that cost from consumers . But much like the Regulatory Recovery Fee , almost everyone directly pushes this one through . This is Verizon 's pass-through line-item for recovering its USF contributions .
8 . ) [ State ] Gross Receipts Tax Surcharge
Although Verizon lists this as one of their fees , it is in fact a tax imposed by this consumer 's state government ( according to the state government 's website ) , and is the same flat fee across all phone plans and providers . Similar charges in other states may or may not meet the same qualification .
9 . ) Video Franchise Fee
Franchise agreements between states , counties , and/or municipalities and pay-TV companies generally say that the company owes the franchising authority a regular fee — usually , though not always , equal to 5 % of their revenues — in exchange for being able to operate in that area .
Most franchise agreements say that cable companies may recover the fee directly from customers . ( A few here and there actually do say “ shall. ” ) This subscriber 's locality has one of those “ may ” agreements , and so Verizon passes that per-subscriber , per-year fee on through in the monthly bill .
10 . ) Regulatory Recovery Fee – Federal
The FCC collects annual fees from cable operators ; that 's part of where the FCC gets its operating budget from .
The FCC rules permit — but do not require — cable operators to recover the regulatory fees from subscribers in monthly installments . Technically speaking , Verizon , or anyone else , could pay this fee without passing it through to consumers . That said , literally every company whose bills we 've dissected passes this fee through to consumers .
11 . ) Fios TV Broadcast Fee
The Broadcast TV Surcharge has become a favorite way for cable providers to increase your bills without just outright increasing your TV or bundle package price . TWC , Charter , and Comcast all charge a variation on this fee now , too .
Verizon started adding this fee to FiOS customers ' bills back in 2010 . Theoretically it 's to offset the costs of negotiating carriage rights with broadcast operators in your local area . Realistically , it 's a way to pass those costs through to you without cutting into the profit Verizon makes from your bundle price , which nominally includes the price of programming .
12 . ) Regional Sports Network Fee
This , like the broadcast TV fee , is a way for cable providers to pass along the costs of content carriage agreements through to you , while claiming not to raise prices and while avoiding damage to their bottom line . Rather than applying to local broadcast networks ,
Verizon began adding their fee in 2013 , at which time it cost $ 2.42 .
Verizon points out on their website that the fee is only assessed on customers whose channel bundles include regional sports networks . However , customers who provided their bills and do n't watch sports have told us that those channels can be difficult to avoid when selecting packages of preferred networks they do actually watch .
13 . ) FDV Administrative Charge
According to Verizon , this FiOS Digital Voice charge is to “ defray account servicing costs associated with providing voice services. ” Do n't know what that means ? Neither does anyone else , really . It 's effectively a $ 1 increase on the phone portion of your bill , and the money presumably goes into Verizon 's internal “ phone stuff ” budgets .
Verizon started adding the $ 0.99 fee in the summer of 2014 .
Not pictured : Different states and localities impose different service fees on their telecommunications bills . PEG fees , municipal rights of way , CATV fees , school fund fees , or other varying charges would also appear under this header as needed . Verizon 's website has a list including some of the others you might be likely to see ; barring that , googling “ [ state name ] [ fee name ] ” is usually going to be your best bet for tracking those down .
Verizon not your cable/Internet/phone provider ? No worries ! Previous installations of this feature of covered Comcast Charter , and TWC , and future editions are yet to come !
Editor 's Note : This article originally appeared on Consumerist .
In an interview with the Charlotte Observer , Hornets coach Steve Clifford said among lost free agents , the team is most likely to miss Jeremy Lin , mostly because of his versatility ... on the defensive end . Clifford said the new Nets point guard can defend both point guards and shooting guards . It was one reason , he said , the Hornets finished top 10 in defense last season .
It was n't the first time Clifford had praised Lin 's D. At the end of last season , he told the New York Times that Lin had a `` terrific year . '' and specifically accented his defense .
`` He 's a much , much better defender than people realize , '' Clifford said . `` He competes hard every night , and he 's a very serious player . ''
So where does he stand ?
Defense has always been a rap on Lin , going back to Linsanity with the Knicks . And just this summer , the New York Post quoted a Knicks source as saying New York was n't interested in Lin because his defense was `` too gaping . ''
Lin ranked No . 20 among point guards in ESPN 's Defensive Real Plus-Minus last season , ahead of Kemba Walker and way ahead of Jarrett Jack who ranked last in the NBA —40th — before he went down . So , that 's already an improvement .
Beyond his coach , there are those who noticed Lin 's improvement last season . Scott Rafferty of the Sporting News wrote in June ...
[ Lin ] turned himself into an impact player on that end of the floor by using his speed and quickness to his advantage . He 's not necessarily going to shut down the Stephen Currys or Damian Lillards of the world , but he 's proven the ability to hold his own .
Rafferty included a number of videos , like this one , to prove his point .
One underrated part of Lin 's defense is blocked shots . Last season , he was second among point guards in blocks per game and per 36 minutes , behind only John Wall . Do n't underestimate that stat . Jason Kidd and Dwyane Wade regularly led the NBA in that category .
Defense will be key to the Nets success . Kenny Atkinson , who played a big role in the Hawks ' defensive improvement the last two years , has said it . During his talk with CNLS , the Celtics blog , Ian Eagle noted that Atkinson is a big believer in team D. `` Trust me , '' Eagle said , `` that will be a major , major point of emphasis for this team . ''
On offense , Clifford also told Rick Bonnell of the Observer , `` The one thing we 'll lose without Jeremy is a lot of penetration . That 's why he was a good fit for us . '' Offense , or at least penetration , has long been seen as a Lin 's strength along with his BBIQ and toughness . Defense not so much .
Saturday marks the official beginning of the Summer Universiade . From now until the end of this month , Taiwan will be responsible for the safety of more than 7,500 athletes from 141 countries .
The ability to quickly and efficiently share potential security threats , information about unwanted individuals , and lost and found information with other nations would be invaluable .
Interpol 's database would provide just that . Unfortunately , Taiwan is one of very few nations denied access to that database .
Interpol , which is based in Lyon , France , aims to provide its 190 member nations ( out of the world 's 196 countries ) with effective and real-time communication between their police forces .
One particularly useful Interpol service is its I-24/7 global police communications system , which allows members to share sensitive and urgent police information year-round , day and night .
Another useful resource to have access to would be the Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database .
In a recent interview , Representative to France Zhang Ming-zhong ( 張銘忠 ) said that if Taiwan is to ensure the safety and security of the athletes participating in the Universiade , it must be able to share intelligence with other nations . Taiwan made numerous requests to access information from the I-24/7 database , but was rebuffed , Zhang said .
Each inquiry is met with the same response : Any request must be made via Beijing .
It is crazy that the nation is being excluded from such an important international organization . Not just because of what Taiwan can get from it , but also because of what it could contribute — as with global health issues and the WHO , so with law enforcement and Interpol .
Zhang was quite clear about the problem 's cause : Interpol is too concerned about what Beijing thinks .
He has a point : Since November last year , Interpol 's president has been Chinese Deputy Minister of Public Security Meng Hongwei ( 孟宏偉 ) . His term ends in 2020 .
Meanwhile , since Taiwan is excluded from accessing Interpol 's database , we have to rely on information provided by the US and Japan , Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je ( 柯文哲 ) said on Saturday .
As with many of Taiwan 's troubles participating in international organizations , this exclusion is the direct result of pressure from Beijing . It is also due in no small part to the insistence of the Chinese Nationalist Party ( KMT ) that Taiwan still represents the true government of China , under the name of the Republic of China ( ROC ) .
Interpol was formed in 1923 . The ROC became a member state in 1961 , but withdrew for all practical purposes , in 1984 , when the People 's Republic of China joined .
As part of its application for Interpol membership , China demanded that the Taiwanese delegation change its name to “ Taiwan , China , ” that Interpol cease referring to the delegation as “ ROC , ” and that ROC membership could only continue as a sub-bureau of China , thereby losing its right to vote in plenary sessions .
Then-president Chiang Ching-kuo ( 蔣經國 ) could not accept these conditions , and so Taiwan essentially withdrew from Interpol .
Attempts to participate , even as an observer nation , failed last year , despite support from the US , which last year signed into law legislation requiring the US secretary of state to develop a strategy to obtain Interpol observer status for Taiwan . Further attempts are unlikely to succeed as long as Meng is Interpol 's president .
Sometimes there 's a level of irony that goes beyond the normal boundaries of ordinary irony and simultaneously creates a tear in the space-time continuum of DC hypocrisy ; this is one such example .
Representative Frederica Wilson , a devoted member of the professional grievance club , has been at the epicenter of a story surrounding the death of Sergeant La David Johnson in Niger ever since Wilson politicized the bereavement call of President Trump , and the bereavement of Sgt . Johnson 's widow , her constituent , Myeshia Johnson .
Representative Wilson has also claimed she was unaware of why we are carrying out military engagements in Niger , and has called the mission “ President Trump 's Benghazi “ .
Given that level of expressed outrage it might surprise people to know that it was Representative Frederica Wilson who personally constructed H.R . 3383 / S.1632 , joint House and Senate legislation that directs the State Department and Dept of Defense to execute military missions in Niger . Yes , in 2016 Wilson demanded military campaigns in the same place Wilson claims not to know about in 2017 .
From her own 2016 press release : Washington , D.C.– In a long-awaited victory , the U.S. House of Representatives today by a voice vote passed H.R . 3833/S . 1632 , legislation introduced by Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson ( D-Florida ) and Senator Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) to help combat Boko Haram .
The measure directs the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense to jointly develop a five-year strategy to aid the Nigerian government ; members of the Multinational Joint Task Force created to combat Boko Haram ; and international partners who 've offered their support to counter the regional threat posed by the insurgents . [ … ] “ Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to ISIS and continues to commit terrible acts of brutal violence against civilians in Nigeria as well as in Chad , Cameroon , and Niger , ” said Senator Collins , who authored and originally introduced the bill . “ Rep . Frederica Wilson was a willing and able partner in the effort to pass this bipartisan legislation , which requires a five-year strategy to pursue Boko Haram and will bolster U.S. efforts throughout the region . I urge the president to immediately sign this bill into law ” , said Wilson . [ … ] “ Boko Haram captured my attention and the headlines when the terrorist group kidnapped 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from their dormitory rooms 968 days ago . For most of the world , the Chibok girls symbolize the horror that is Boko Haram , but the damage its members have wrought goes far deeper , ” said Congresswoman Wilson .
Yes , if the irony was n't thick enough already , that press release is directly from the office of Representative Frederica Wilson . Additionally , Mrs. Wilson goes on to demand the U.S. take every possible action against Boko Haram to include their pursuit .
That means Representative Frederica “ wacky ” Wilson was a key and central figure in establishing congressional policy that directed the Department of Defense to carry out the very mission that killed her constituent Myeshia Johnson 's husband , Sergeant La David Johnson .
Sad and pathetic irony .
Enough said .
Our military deserves a better congress .

The world 's most influential players must now bow to the one and only Lionel Messi of Barcelona as we conclude our series
10 ) Edinson Cavani ( Napoli and Uruguay )
What on earth are Manchester City and Chelsea waiting for ? With 94 goals in 192 matches since his arrival in Serie A five years ago , the Uruguayan international is in his prime as a world-class goalscorer . Cavani is also good news at the box office : first in Palermo and then in Naples the passionate fans responded to his feats , swooning at the sight of a player whose nickname in Italy , Il Matador , does justice to his swashbuckling style and lethal finishing . He was the star of the club 's run in last season 's Champions League , scoring three goals in two games against City in the group stage and once against Chelsea in the last 16 . Richard Williams
9 ) Yaya Touré ( Manchester City and Ivory Coast )
He is one of those players who have defined a position during his generation . `` There is n't another Yaya , '' says the Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini . His physique and athleticism make him a heavyweight opponent . But for a big man to possess such refined technique , and the ability to use it at pace once he gathers speed on the run , makes him an absolute marvel . He was something of a slow burner , having flitted between clubs before arriving on the highest of stages at Barcelona . Since his switch to City , Touré has established himself as one of the most effective players in the Premier League and been voted African Player of the Year . Amy Lawrence
8 ) Andrea Pirlo ( Juventus and Italy )
Somehow , the mature beard that he has recently been cultivating only adds to the air of wisdom and thoughtfulness that has always been at the heart of Pirlo 's football . He plays with an alluring capacity to buy himself time , as if he enjoys a metaphorical moment to stroke his new facial adornment while he weighs up what clever touch he intends to execute . Italy 's playmaking kingpin was majestic during the European Championship , as central to the team 's heartbeat as he was when the Azzurri won the 2006 World Cup . The cool of his Panenka penalty , scooped over Joe Hart , was classic serenity under pressure . Amy Lawrence
7 ) Robin van Persie ( Manchester United and Holland )
Even in 2004 , when Robin van Persie had gone from being a tempestuous outcast at Feyenoord to an important Arsenal squad member , it was difficult to predict where his career would take him . Back then , he had a reputation for being a troublemaker , having fallen out with Bert van Marwijk , Pierre van Hooijdonk and Paul Bosvelt at Feyenoord , and collecting far too many cards for Arsène Wenger 's liking .
Then , one day , he was at Arsenal 's training ground and noticed Dennis Bergkamp , who was practising passing with an academy player . Van Persie watched Bergkamp for 45 minutes – and the Dutchman did not miss a single pass . Van Persie thought to himself : `` I am not a bad passer . I am a good player . But I still have a long way to go before I get anywhere near that level of dedication and focus . '' That 's when the Van Persie we see today started to emerge .
The 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons were interrupted by injuries but when he returned , and Thierry Henry had left , the Dutchman was the main striker at Arsenal . This summer Sir Alex Ferguson paid £24m for him and said : `` He wanted the challenge of coming to the biggest club in the world . I think that is fantastic . '' Marcus Christenson
6 ) Radamel Falcao ( Atlético Madrid and Colombia )
They call him the Tiger and he is an insatiable predator , a perfectly honed hunter , stalking the pitch looking for chances to pounce . When he does he is devastatingly effective : right foot , left foot , head , from inside the box and out , this is a guy that does not miss .
Arguably the world 's best No9 at the moment – his goals-by-minute ratio currently surpasses that of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – he has racked up over 50 goals in just a year and a half at Atlético Madrid , winning the Europa League and destroying Chelsea in the European Super Cup with a first-half hat-trick .
The Europa League triumph was his second in a row after success with Porto , and the second in a row in which he finished top scorer and with goals in the final .
Everybody is after him right now and just how good he is can be defined by the buy-out clause in his Atlético contract . It currently stands at €60m and here is the thing : it does not even seem that expensive . Sid Lowe
5 ) Zlatan Ibrahimovic ( Paris St-Germain and Sweden )
A physically imposing maverick with a potent mixture of subtlety in his feet and audacity in his head , Zlatan – his first name suffices – has always been eye-catching . The Swede has enjoyed an eventful 2012 , leaving Serie A for the second time , on this occasion for the nouveau riche of Paris St-Germain .
His record-breaking salary initially caused some consternation in France , but that became a side issue for one reason only : Zlatan has been at his brilliant best . His leadership , as well as his talent , has made critics eat their words . His run of titles ( eight straight league wins with five different teams ) may have ended but he looks determined to get that back on track .
He was also exceptional for Sweden in the Euros – a deserving pick for team of the tournament . The national icon won global recognition for his quartet of glorious goals against England . His power , wit and imagination make him a defender 's nightmare . A genuine maestro . Amy Lawrence
4 ) Andrés Iniesta ( Barcelona and Spain )
Sergio Ramos describes Andrés Iniesta as the `` enlightened one '' , a man `` touched with a magic wand '' . There is something different about him . The touch is so smooth , so soft , almost imperceptible at times , that he can do things that other players simply can not , from incredible dribbles to jaw-dropping assists .
This summer , a photograph did the rounds : Iniesta surrounded by seven Italian defenders . He describes it as a coincidence but it was appropriate somehow : he 's the man they fear the most and the man who draws the most pressure on himself . Why ? Because he trusts his ability to overcome it .
Always in control , he is the creative fulcrum of the Spain team , and the man who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final . It was not just about the goal , either : his performance in extra time in South Africa is worth watching again and again . Sublime barely does it justice .
Injuries have been a constant problem in Iniesta 's career but look back over the last three tournaments , all of them won by Spain , and his influence is startling . He won three man of the match awards at Euro 2012 , more than anyone else . There were another three at the World Cup , including the final . And one at Euro 2008 . In 18 games across three tournaments – more than any other player – he has been man of the match seven times . Over a third of his games .
In a game where control has become the obsession , defences have become more populous and space harder to find , Iniesta offers that most important of qualities : inspiration . `` He imposes so much respect on the pitch , '' Ramos says . `` As a football lover , I am proud to have played with him . He makes the difference and does things that no one else can do . '' Fernando Torres adds : `` I 've been playing with him since we were 15 and I have never , ever seen him play badly . '' Sid Lowe
3 ) Xavi ( Barcelona and Spain )
Xavi Hernández admits that a few years ago he felt like a player under threat of extinction . Everywhere , muscle mattered , height mattered . His game was different . Now , five years later , he is the model , the ideologue behind a different approach – a style that has led him to win everything for club and country .
Luis Aragonés decided to build the Spain side around Xavi , to adopt a game based on possession and control , and it has worked . At the same time , Pep Guardiola took over as coach at Barcelona and did much the same . Xavi was revitalised .
For each of the past five seasons , the world 's most significant footballing trophy has been won by the team that had Xavi in the heart of its midfield : two European Championships , two European Cups and a World Cup .
Xavi describes his game as the constant search for spaces . `` It 's hard when you 've got a bloke behind you who 's six foot tall and powerful , and he 's right on you , '' he says . `` You have to think quickly , you have to look for spaces . That 's what I do : look for spaces . All day , I 'm looking . Here ? No . There ? No . Always looking for the space . Space , space . A man comes towards you , over there . Is there one here ? Or there ? ''
Xavi invariably finds it . Over the past five years no player has completed so many passes : he has averaged – averaged ! – more than 100 a game . And it is passes that lie at the heart of the success of Spain and Barcelona . This summer , he admitted that he had not enjoyed the Euros as much as previous tournaments . He played a little further forward , where play is more cramped .
But then came the final and Xavi was suddenly everywhere . That Spain produced their best performance was not entirely coincidental . Xavi may well go down as the best player in Spain 's history , even if Dani Alves says he `` plays in the future '' . Sid Lowe
2 ) Cristiano Ronaldo ( Real Madrid and Portugal )
One story springs to mind . It is March 2007 at Old Trafford and a Ronaldo-inspired Manchester United have just thrashed Bolton Wanderers 4-1 . Henrik Pedersen , assigned the job of trying to stop him , is so befuddled he is substituted after 28 minutes .
Afterwards , a reporter from the Bolton Evening News asks the visiting manager , Sam Allardyce , whether Ronaldo 's performance could leave his players with psychological scars . `` Scars ? '' Allardyce replies . `` We 're going to need a fucking plastic surgeon after that . ''
Ronaldo can do that to the opposition . Nobody – maybe not even George Best – tormented players as he did for United and , if anything , he has just got better at Real Madrid . A blur of improvisational brilliance , running at the opposition , driving towards goal , his only thought being to score . Worried about nobody , absolutely nobody .
His ego is considerable and , deep down , it must gnaw away at him that Lionel Messi denies him the right to be known as the most extravagantly gifted footballer on the planet . Yet he has already done enough to establish himself as one of the genuine greats .
He scores at a prolific rate , from any distance and any angle . He conjures up shots that dip at the last moment , like someone firing a beach ball in the wind . He flicks the ball with the outside of his boot , while looking in the opposite direction . He goes three or four games without scoring and it is described as a `` drought . ''
Gary Neville , his former Old Trafford colleague , described him recently as `` an absolute bully '' because of the ordeals to which he subjected opposition defenders . `` He would prey on the weak . '' Better than Messi ? Not quite – but what is also very clear is that Ronaldo , scoring at a rate of more than a goal per game , is determined to prolong the argument . Daniel Taylor
1 ) Lionel Messi ( Barcelona and Argentina )
There was only one name and one position on which all 11 members of the panel were in unanimous agreement : the world No1 , Lionel Messi . How could we not choose him ?
The debate has moved to another plane : it is not so much a question of whether Messi is the best player in the world right now , as whether Messi might just be the best player there has ever been .
He has been making the extraordinary look ordinary for four years now , producing astonishingly brilliant performances with a regularity that has made them no longer astonish . That is just what he does : another great goal from Messi .
These days , if Messi scores a brilliant goal , no one talks about it for weeks , because usually within a few days he has probably gone and scored one that is just as good . Or two . Or more .
Last season he scored 50 league goals , making him the top scorer in La Liga history . He has been top scorer in the Champions League for four seasons in a row , twice scoring in the final . He has scored in the final of the Copa del Rey , the Club World Cup and the European and Spanish Super Cups .
It is not just about the goals either : in 2012 , Messi scored 90 goals at a rate of a goal every 4.1 days , and also provided 29 assists . At the time of writing , he had one game left in the year to score more .
It is hard to find sufficient superlatives for him . He can do everything : control the game , slow it down , speed it up and , above all , win it . Pep Guardiola encouraged everyone not to try to describe him because it was an impossible task and instead just to enjoy him : `` Do n't write about him , '' the former Barcelona manager said . `` Watch him . ''
Carlos Bilardo , who coached Diego Maradona in 1986 , reckons Messi has an extra bone in his ankle : `` The ball . '' It never seems to leave his foot .
`` I do n't think we 'll ever see a player like him again , '' said the Barcelona manager , Tito Vilanova . Gerard Piqué insists that there is no point in counting him as human : he is , instead , an `` extra-terrestrial '' .
`` I do n't want to even compare anyone else to him , '' Xavi Hernández once said . `` Because it 's not fair – on them . '' Sid Lowe

Comcast is hoping to bring “ cord nevers ” into the pay-TV fold with Xfinity Instant TV : The stripped-down bundle of broadband-delivered channels , which starts at $ 18 per month for a tier of local broadcast networks , is now available in select areas .
A Comcast rep declined to disclose where the Xfinity Instant TV beta is currently available but said the cable operator expects to have it rolled out across its national footprint within the next two weeks .
It 's the cable giant 's response to the flood of “ virtual ” pay-TV services in the market , aimed at consumers loath to buy into a traditional fat package of television channels . One of Comcast 's selling points for Instant TV : Customers do n't need a set-top box , and they can sign up , add or remove programming bundles , or cancel their service at any time — without a contract or incurring cancellation fees . It 's also offering a 30-day free trial to new subscribers during the beta period .
For now , Comcast is offering Xfinity Instant TV only to current broadband customers , and they can only watch the full live channel lineup over their home Wi-Fi connection . Ultimately , Comcast is banking on a portion of the broadband-only households it 's targeting will simply decide to upgrade to full-fledged Xfinity X1 service — with the operator viewing Instant TV as a kind of on-ramp for its video biz .

The $ 18 core package may appeal to the cost-conscious — but it 's limited to broadcast channels like ABC , CBS , The CW , Fox , NBC and PBS as well as public , educational and government channels , and just a few cable channels like C-SPAN , QVC and HSN . Also , Univision and Telemundo are included in most markets .
To get ESPN , CNN , Fox News , MSNBC or CNBC , you 'll have to pay an additional $ 30 per month for the “ sports and news ” add-on pack . The $ 15 monthly “ entertainment ” pack includes A & E , AMC , Comedy Central , Discovery , Food Network , TBS , TNT and USA , while the $ 10 “ kids and family ” option includes Cartoon Network , Disney Channel , MTV , Nickelodeon and TLC .
HBO or Starz are available , but you 'll have to pay $ 15 and $ 12 extra , respectively , for the premium channels .
Comcast has actually been testing the internet-only service in Boston and Chicago for two years — and in those trials , HBO was included as part of the base package for just $ 15 per month . The prior iteration of the service was called “ Xfinity Stream TV , ” but Comcast changed the name because it was confusingly similar to Xfinity Stream , the name of its video-streaming app . Separately , Comcast also sells Internet Plus , a double-play bundle of high-speed internet service coupled with broadcast TV and HBO ( delivered via a conventional set-top ) , which it first launched in 2013 .
Xfinity Instant TV is available on the web and through Xfinity Stream apps for Roku players and iOS and Android devices . Comcast says it 's working on support for Xfinity Stream for additional smart TV platforms and other streaming devices . Instant TV includes network-based DVR , with storage to record up to 20 hours of HD ; as with Comcast 's regular Xfinity TV service , users can also download the DVR recordings to watch them on the go .
Other details : Xfinity Instant TV initially wo n't let users rent or purchase VOD titles or subscribe to pay-per-view events . However , they 'll be able to access Xfinity On Demand shows and movies from networks included in their TV package . Instant TV provides two simultaneous streams per account , so that will let them record up to two shows at once or record one show and watch another .
Here 's the full lineup of option channel packages available through Xfinity Instant TV :
Sports and News ( $ 30 per month ) : CNBC , CNN , ESPN , ESPN2 , ESPN News , ESPNU , Fox Business , Fox News , Fox Sports 1 , Golf Channel , MSNBC , NBC Sports , NFL Network and regional sports networks based on market .

Updated with MIT info .
Kanako Miura , 36 , a visiting scientist at MIT 's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , died this afternoon when she was struck by a dump truck , MIT and Stanley Staco report .
Boston Police report the victim was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after the 3:30 p.m. incident .
A mangled silver and black bicycle , believed to be hers , was found several blocks away on Bay State Road at Silber Way , Brian D'Amico reports .
According to MIT , Miura had come to Cambridge last fall from Japan 's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology . She had been working in Prof. Russ Tedrake 's Robot Locomotion Group .
Video demonstrating one of the projects she worked on in Japan .
`` Our hearts go out to her friends and colleagues at MIT , and especially the Miura family , who must absorb this terrible loss from so far away , '' MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote to MIT students and staff in e-mail tonight .
Islamist parties are expected to control Cairo 's parliament by the spring with the Muslim Brotherhood projected to be in the driver 's seat .
Judges overseeing the vote count in Egypt 's parliamentary elections say Islamist parties have won a majority of the contested seats in the first round . The judges spoke on condition of anonymity because official results are expected to be released later Thursday .
They say the Muslim Brotherhood could take 45 percent of the seats up for grabs . The liberal Egyptian bloc coalition and the ultra-fundamentalist Nour party are competing for second place .
Together , Islamist parties are expected to control a majority of parliamentary seats by March . This week 's vote was the first of six stages of parliamentary elections that will last until then .
Continued success by Islamists will allow them to give Cairo 's government and constitution a decidedly Islamist character . It could also lead Cairo to shift away from the West towards the Iranian axis .
It will also diminish the influence of Cairo 's caretaker junta , which has sought to maintain the Mubarak-era status quo and keep US foreign aid dollars – running into the billions per annum – flowing .
Analysts say Islamists may also seek to annul the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty , which could prompt Israel to seize the Sinai Peninsula for the fourth time in its history to create a strategic buffer zone .
After reaching the Suez Canal in 1967 and controlling the Sinai for twelve years , , Israel ceded Sinai to Egypt under the 1979 treaty on condition it remains demilitarized .
The Muslim Brotherhood , which birthed the virulently anti-Israel Hamas terror militia , might also seek to effectively annex Gaza . Should Hamas be triumphant in future PA elections , they would also gain a foothold in Judea and Samaria .
With Assassin 's Creed : Revelations being the third Assassin 's Creed release in as many years , a fear of trepidation that the series would be back with diminishing returns is n't unfounded . Look at what an annual release schedule did to the once-great Guitar Hero : it takes time for developers to create and implement new gameplay systems and features . I went into Revelations skeptical and expecting to be unimpressed—and being wrong never felt this good .
The first Assassin 's Creed came out in 2007 and felt like a proof of concept . Regardless of how beautiful the Crusades-era Holy Land setting was , the game 's mission structure and environments were monotonous and bland . It was the video game equivalent of a supermodel serving you plain oatmeal . But it had potential . In the two years between the release of Assassin 's Creed and Assassin 's Creed II , developer Ubisoft hammered out the template for sequels to come .
With AC II , all that remained from the previous excursion were the big-picture elements . Rote missions and boring combat got the axe while a large go-anywhere parkour-anything historical environment—this time , Renaissance-era Italy—and the ongoing war between an ancient order of assassins and the Knights Templar stayed . And this is where it gets a little tough to explain .
Backstory—or lack thereof
In the first game , you played as shamed assassin Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad . From AC II through Revelations you 're playing mainly as Ezio Auditore , an Italian assassin . They tie together through Desmond Miles , a twenty-something bartender kidnapped by modern day Templars . Desmond is the descendant of Ezio and Altaïr , and the Templars access genetic memories stored in his DNA via a machine called the Animus . This technology has a dark side : the Animus is destroying his mind .
The fiction is dense , and Revelations assumes you 've played the three games before it . There are no recaps at the the story 's outset nor during the lengthy campaign . While the narrative of last year 's Brotherhood was a grind , taking too long to get anywhere or do anything interesting , Revelations is much more focused and personal . Flashbacks to Altaïr 's life break up Ezio 's quest and bring a tale of redemption to the table .
When we first met Ezio in AC II he was 17 . Now pushing 65 , he 's searching for the Masyaf Keys that unlock the library in the Altaïr 's deserted Syrian base . Ezio is hoping that whatever is inside will bring him peace and give meaning to his life . His age comes across not only in his voice and awesome new beard , but in his movements ; in Revelations , he 's weary and battle-hardened . Before , Ezio struggled to put weight behind his blows—here he eviscerates enemies almost effortlessly .
This is a game with two heroes . As a character who spent the Crusades putting hits on Muslim and Christian leaders , Altair suffered because he was trapped in a bad game . It was n't until his re-emergence in AC II that I took interest in him . It 's sad , because , until this point , his role was underutilized in the series . While I was fully invested in Ezio 's story , I could n't wait to get back to controlling Altair at each scheduled interval . This is as much the fault of being slightly tired of running around as a randy Italian for the past few games as it was wanting to see how Altair 's story connected with Ezio 's .
New tools like the hookblade and grenades make for killer additions to enemy encounters . With the former , you can pull a guard 's head down and then shoot him in the face with your wrist-mounted pistol . You can craft a stink-bomb out of skunk oil and other ingredients to stun a group of enemies so you can sneak by undetected . The hookblade also replaces the series ' ill-named jump glove , making movement a much smoother affair both horizontally and vertically .
The third dimension
When I ascended my first roof in Constantinople and began running around , a sinking feeling started setting in : I was definitely playing another Assassin 's Creed game , only this time the setting was a dusty brown and yellow . But as I progressed , the city 's idiosyncrasies revealed themselves . What separates this setting from previous environments is its density of buildings and lack of verticality . The reason for very few tall structures is explained in the story , but from a gameplay perspective , this makes the treks to the tops of mosques and Templar towers all the more memorable , especially in 3D .
I 've played a majority of the stereoscopic 3D games available and Revelations is the best I 've seen . Usually playing a game in 3D results in sacrifices in visual fidelity , as fine details melt away and jagged edges appear on what should be straight lines . Not here . Climbing to the top the Galata Tower and looking down induced a sense of vertigo and brief nausea I have n't felt since climbing the Agency Tower in Crackdown . 3D makes finding your way up spires easier , as every brick and detail juts out of the background at you .
In my 20 hours with the campaign , I only took my 3D glasses off once , and that was to navigate a nearly pitch-black cavern . 3D glasses make everything a little darker , but to be fair , even in 2D I had to max out the game 's brightness to see where I needed to go .
It 's possible to just run along roofs in a straight line with little getting in the way or breaking the flow of your movement . For me , the parkour always felt staccato in previous games ; just as I would hit a groove , the game would stop me and I 'd fumble over a ledge or hit a dead end . Locomotion here feels less abrupt , especially when scaling a vertical surface . The world is much more empowering .
This is important , as you are given control of a team that will kill for you . Curating your personal assassin hit-squad is better this time out , and earning their allegiance is n't always as simple as stopping guards from picking on themt . Sometimes I had to tail a pickpocket while others I freed from captivity . Your posse is more important to the narrative , as well . Using them is always a treat : you target an enemy and they pop out of nowhere and to kill them . When the target is dead , they disappear into the shadows . As in past games , you get to level up these side characters , giving you a sense of control and ownership .
Revelations ' biggest achievement is n't what it introduces to the franchise , it 's how well it polishes everything it carries forward , story included . The hours melted away while I was playing , and I kept wanting to go further to see where the story would take me next . I was still playing at 5 am this past weekend not because I was on a deadline , but because I did n't want to stop—I felt like a kid on Christmas Eve forcing myself to sleep . When the credits rolled , I had enough closure for the story so far , but was left with just as many new questions . On the plus side , I only have to wait a year for those answers .
Assassin 's Creed : Revelations is out now on the PS3 and Xbox360 . The PC version will be released on November 29 .
Not to be confused with the asteroid called 106 Dione

Dione ( dy-OH-nee ; Greek : Διώνη ) is a moon of Saturn . It was discovered by Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1684 . [ 7 ] It is named after the Titaness Dione of Greek mythology . It is also designated Saturn IV .
Name [ edit ]
Giovanni Domenico Cassini named the four moons he discovered ( Tethys , Dione , Rhea and Iapetus ) Sidera Lodoicea ( `` the stars of Louis '' ) to honor king Louis XIV . Cassini found Dione in 1684 using a large aerial telescope he set up on the grounds of the Paris Observatory . [ 8 ] The satellites of Saturn were not named until 1847 , when William Herschel 's son John Herschel published Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope , suggesting that the names of the Titans ( sisters and brothers of Cronus ) be used . [ 9 ]
Orbit [ edit ]
Dione orbits Saturn with a semimajor axis about 2 % less than that of the Moon . However , reflecting Saturn 's greater mass ( 95 times that of Earth 's ) , Dione 's orbital period is one tenth that of the Moon . Dione is currently in a 1:2 mean-motion orbital resonance with moon Enceladus , completing one orbit of Saturn for every two orbits completed by Enceladus . This resonance maintains Enceladus 's orbital eccentricity ( 0.0047 ) , providing a source of heat for Enceladus 's extensive geological activity , which shows up most dramatically in its cryovolcanic geyser-like jets . [ 10 ] The resonance also maintains a smaller eccentricity in Dione 's orbit ( 0.0022 ) , tidally heating it as well . [ 11 ]
Dione has two co-orbital , or trojan , moons , Helene and Polydeuces . They are located within Dione 's Lagrangian points L 4 and L 5 , 60 degrees ahead of and behind Dione respectively .
Physical characteristics and interior [ edit ]
Size comparison of Earth , the Moon , and Dione .
At 1122 km ( 697 mi ) in diameter , Dione is the 15th largest moon in the Solar System , and is more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined . [ 12 ] About two thirds of Dione 's mass is water ice , and the remaining is a dense core , probably silicate rock . [ 13 ]
Data gathered by Cassini indicates that Dione has an internal liquid water ocean ( a situation similar to that of its orbital resonance partner , Enceladus ) . [ 14 ] Downward bending of the surface associated with the 1.5 km high ridge Janiculum Dorsa can most easily be explained by the presence of such an ocean . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Gravity and shape data points to a 99 ± 23 km thick ice shell crust on top of a 65 ± 30 km thick internal liquid water global ocean . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Neither moon has a shape close to hydrostatic equilibrium ; the deviations are maintained by isostasy . Dione 's ice shell is thought to vary in thickness by less than 5 % , with the thinnest areas at the poles , where tidal heating of the crust is greatest . [ 18 ]
Though somewhat smaller and denser , Dione is otherwise very similar to Rhea . They both have similar albedo features and varied terrain , and both have dissimilar leading and trailing hemispheres . Dione 's leading hemisphere is heavily cratered and is uniformly bright . Its trailing hemisphere , however , contains an unusual and distinctive surface feature : a network of bright ice cliffs .
Scientists recognise Dionean geological features of the following types :
Chasmata ( chasms ; long , deep , steep-sided depressions )
Dorsa ( ridges )
Fossae ( long narrow depressions )
Craters
Catenae ( crater chains )
Ice cliffs ( formerly 'wispy terrain ' ) [ edit ]
Fractures bisecting older craters on Dione . Those running from upper right to lower left are the Carthage Fossae , whereas Pactolus Catena runs more horizontally at lower right .
When the Voyager space probe photographed Dione in 1980 , it showed what appeared to be wispy features covering its trailing hemisphere . The origin of these features was mysterious , because all that was known was that the material has a high albedo and is thin enough that it does not obscure the surface features underneath . One hypothesis was that shortly after its formation Dione was geologically active , and some process such as cryovolcanism resurfaced much of its surface , with the streaks forming from eruptions along cracks in Dione 's surface that fell back to the surface as snow or ash . Later , after the internal activity and resurfacing ceased , cratering continued primarily on the leading hemisphere and wiped out the streak patterns there .
This hypothesis was proven wrong by the Cassini probe flyby of December 13 , 2004 , which produced close-up images . These revealed that the 'wisps ' were , in fact , not ice deposits at all , but rather bright ice cliffs created by tectonic fractures ( chasmata ) . Dione has been revealed as a world riven by enormous fractures on its trailing hemisphere .
The Cassini orbiter performed a closer flyby of Dione at 500 km ( 310 mi ) on October 11 , 2005 , and captured oblique images of the cliffs , showing that some of them are several hundred metres high .
Linear Features [ edit ]
Dione features linear 'virgae ' that are up to hundreds of km long but less than 5 km wide . These lines run parallel to the equator and are only apparent at lower latitudes ( at less than 45° north or south ) ; similar features are noted on Rhea . They are brighter than everything around them and appear to overlay other features such as ridges and craters , indicating they are relatively young . It has been proposed that these lines are of exogenic origin , as the result of the emplacement of material across the surface by low‐velocity impacts of material sourced from Saturn 's rings , co‐orbital moons , or closely approaching comets . [ 19 ]
Craters [ edit ]
Dione 's icy surface includes heavily cratered terrain , moderately cratered plains , lightly cratered plains , and areas of tectonic fractures . The heavily cratered terrain has numerous craters greater than 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) in diameter . The plains areas tend to have craters less than 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) in diameter . Some of the plains are more heavily cratered than others . Much of the heavily cratered terrain is located on the trailing hemisphere , with the less cratered plains areas present on the leading hemisphere . This is the opposite of what some scientists expected ; Shoemaker and Wolfe [ 20 ] proposed a cratering model for a tidally locked satellite with the highest cratering rates on the leading hemisphere and the lowest on the trailing hemisphere . This suggests that during the period of heavy bombardment , Dione was tidally locked to Saturn in the opposite orientation . Because Dione is relatively small , an impact causing a 35 kilometer crater could have spun the satellite . Because there are many craters larger than 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) , Dione could have been repeatedly spun during its early heavy bombardment . The pattern of cratering since then and the bright albedo of the leading side suggests that Dione has remained in its current orientation for several billion years .
Like Callisto , Dione 's craters lack the high-relief features seen on the Moon and Mercury ; this is probably due to slumping of the weak icy crust over geologic time .

On April 7 , 2010 , instruments on board the unmanned Cassini probe , which flew by Dione , detected a thin layer of molecular oxygen ions ( O+
2 ) around Dione , so thin that scientists prefer to call it an exosphere rather than a tenuous atmosphere . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The density of molecular oxygen ions determined from the Cassini plasma spectrometer data ranges from 0.01 to 0.09 per cm3 . [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
The Cassini probe instruments were unable to directly detect water from the exosphere due to high background levels , [ 22 ] but it seems that highly charged particles from the planet 's powerful radiation belts could split the water in the ice into hydrogen and oxygen . [ 21 ]
Exploration [ edit ]
Dione was first imaged by the Voyager space probes . It has also been probed five times from close distances by the Cassini orbiter . There was a close targeted flyby , at a distance of 500 km ( 310 mi ) on 11 October 2005 ; [ 24 ] another flyby was performed on 7 April 2010 also at a distance of 500 km . [ 25 ] A third flyby was performed on 12 December 2011 at a distance of 99 km ( 62 mi ) . The following flyby was on 16 June 2015 at a distance of 516 km ( 321 mi ) , [ 26 ] and the last Cassini flyby was performed on 17 August 2015 at a distance of 474 km ( 295 mi ) . [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
In May 2013 , it was announced that NASA 's spacecraft Cassini had provided scientists with evidence that Dione is more active than previously realized . Using topographic data , NASA teams deduced that crustal depression associated with a prominent mountain ridge on the leading hemisphere is best explained if there was a global subsurface liquid ocean like that of Enceladus . [ 15 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The ridge Janiculum Dorsa has a height of 1 to 2 km ( 0.6 to 1.2 miles ) ; Dione 's crust seems to pucker 0.5 km ( 0.3 miles ) under it , suggesting that the icy crust was warm when the ridge formed , probably due to the presence of a subsurface liquid ocean , which increases tidal flexing .

Constantin Braun 's late goal in the third period powered Germany to a 4-2 win over Hungary . With the win , Germany is officially through to the quarter-finals .
Germany last reached the quarter-finals in 2011 .
To their credit , Hungary gave Germany all they could handle . Hungary was strong on the puck in the first period , generating key chances . Istvan Sofron and Istvan Bartalis both enjoyed fine individual performances as Hungary worked to make something happen .
`` You always try to stay focused when you find out that you 've qualified , '' Korbinian Holzer said . `` We knew they were going to come out hard and we wanted to match their intensity . I think in the first period , we kind of lacked a little bit of a work ethic , which is unusual for us . ''
Sofron had the first best chance with a partial break on the German net but shot the puck just wide . Then as Sinan Akdag tried clearing the puck out of the German zone , he whiffed on his pass to create a chance for Daniel Koger . Thomas Greiss was there as the firewall in net . For Greiss it was his third consecutive start since arriving in St. Petersburg fresh from the NHL playoffs .
Sofron scored to put Hungary up 1-0 with a quick recovery of a loose puck . Bartalis gained the zone but lost the puck is trying to gain some space as he headed to the net . Sofron received the puck and deked backhand to forehand in finding the net . The goal came as both teams were playing in a 4-on-4 situation . Each side has a man in the box .
Bartalis worked to generate a few more chances , including a drive to the net that hit the post . In the period shots were almost even . Germany outshot Hungary 9-8 .
Balint Magosi was called for hooking near the end of the first period and carried into the second . With seconds remaining on the Magosi penalty , Patrick Hager showed patience and scored to tie the game .
He waited , trying to see how things unfolded as he skated towards the net . Hager sent the puck across the slot where it hit Marton Vas in the leg as he was skating backwards trying to defend . The puck bounced off Vas 's leg and in the net to even things .
Miklos Rajna was an important factor in the second period as Germany stepped up its attack and put 14 shots on goal . Germany began sending waves of pressure that kept the Hungarian defencemen on their heels . Rajna had several key saves and a German shot hit the post but the score remained 1-1 . German overwhelmingly outshot Hungary in the second period 14-3 .
Germany took the lead at 1:22 of the third when Denis Reul scored . A loose puck squirted back towards the point to Reul who slapped it high and over Rajna for a 2-1 lead .
Kevin Wehrs brought Hungary level when he sent a rocket of a shot on net that found its way past Greiss . The ever-enthusiastic Hungary fans in the building erupted and the game was once again tied .
Germany kept the pressure on as well . When Hungary could not clear the puck out , Germany 's relentless pressure led to Braun 's goal at 17:24 . Leon Draisaitl chased the puck before it cleared the blueline and sent a pass to Akdag whose backhanded pass went to Braun at the point for a shot and a goal .
`` I think in the third we kind of sat back instead of pressuring them , and we were not shooting enough . '' Bartalis said . `` We let them take too many shots . ''
Marcel Goc added an empty netter at 19:27 .
Germany finishes with 13 points and a third place finish in Group B. Marco Sturm 's first World Championship behind the bench as head coach of Germany has been revived optimism and enthusiasm for his nation 's hockey program .
Hungary can hold their heads high . With a win , some driven performers and fan support , this Hungary 's World Championship experience can be considered a successful journey to Russia . Hungary must now hope for a Belarus loss to France in regulation time tomorrow to stay in the top division .
`` It 's tough because we had everything in our hands , '' Bartalis added . `` We could n't achieve the points we wanted to . So we 're cheering for France . ''
BEDFORD ( CBS ) – About thirty ambulances were put on standby at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford Saturday afternoon for a potential emergency involving an incoming Air Force plane .
WBZ NewsRadio 1030 's Kim Tunnicliffe reports
Air Force Plane Diverted
Lt. Col. James Bishop , the Chief of Public Affairs at Westover Air Reserve Base in Chicopee , told WBZ-TV a C-5B military transport plane traveling from Ramstein Air Base in Germany was heading to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware when there was a loss of cabin pressure over the Atlantic Ocean around 11 a.m .
The plane was flying at 34,000 feet at the time .
“ When this happened they came down to 25,000 feet and then down to 10,000 feet and all the oxygen equipment deployed , ” U.S. Air Force Master Sgt . Andrew Biscoe told WBZ-TV
“ When this incident developed today , ( the crew ) knew exactly what to do . They got the checklists out and they brought that airplane down safely and quickly . ”
Bishop said there was no in-flight emergency . But a decision was made to land the plane at it 's home base in Westover . Hanscom and Pease Air National Guard Base in Portsmouth , New Hampshire were put on alert as a precaution .
The plane landed safely at Westover at 2:29 p.m .
There were a total of 25 people on board the aircraft – 15 passengers and 10 crew members .
Shortly after the flight landed , a little girl was helped off the C-5 and taken to an ambulance and a local hospital .
The Westover public affairs office later said in a statement she had “ a minor injury . ”
No other injuries were reported .
Experts say losing cabin pressure can be fatal .
“ What happens is initially you have an incredible pain in the ears , almost indescribable pain because of the pressure differential on the inner ear . You can have some nosebleeds or you can get unconsciousness. ” Steve Cunningham , the owner of Nashua Flight Simulator , a training center in New Hampshire , told WBZ .
The C-5B aircraft is assigned to the 439th Airlift Wing at Westover .
The plane will be put through a full safety check before it is put back into service .
There 's no word yet what caused the loss of cabin pressure .

Silicon Valley shuttle buses have become a symbol of San Francisco 's gentrification anxiety – Facebook , eBay , Genentech , Yahoo , and most famously Google all have their own private bus lines shuttling workers in and out of the city , hiding them behind tinted glass and bathing them in free Wi-Fi so the riders can have a productive commute .
My home happens to be placed along one of Apple 's commuter bus lines , and the giant , silver buses have long felt like a constant presence on the residential street , powering up and down the hill , plowing past my window , honking a polite warning as they pass while I double-park to unload groceries . Apple workers have seen me in pajamas , stepping outside to get the paper or throw a dirty diaper in the trash . They 've seen me chasing my kids into the car for the morning for the ride to school . In the evening the Apple Bus sometimes sees me waiting in my car for it to pass , so I can open the door without losing it to the bus 's grill .
Last week , it occurred to me that I might start monitoring the local Wi-Fi environment to determine how often the Apple Bus really comes by . My wife guessed 10 times a day . I 'd have said 20 .
After a week of reverse-wardriving , it appears the Apple Bus passes my house an average of 36 times a day , and is uncannily punctual , especially in the a.m. , when the first bus reliably pops up on my Wi-Fi radar between 6:23:33 and 6:23:56 every morning .
The second bus passes four or five minutes later , the third 25-minutes after that , another at 6:58 , give or take a minute . By 10 a.m. as many as 15 more Apple buses have passed . After that they become infrequent , and die out entirely a few minutes after 2:00 p.m. , before they return in force at 5:00 p.m. – presumably taking Apple workers home . The last bus registers at about 10:15 at night .
On Monday , the busiest day , 21 buses pass before noon , 20 after . Based on the MAC addresses , I 've seen 49 different physical buses in a week . The trusty B4 : C7:99 : DF:72:10 is the most frequent on my route , popping up 16 times during the week .
Apple is n't the only one . I also catch an eBay bus at 8:10 a.m. , returning at 6:22 p.m. , and I 've seen the Google Bus twice .
The tech commuter buses have come under heavy fire recently , seen as the embodiment of skyrocketing rental prices and other tech-boom gentrification woes . Demonstrators waving signs have encircled and blocked Google and Apple buses . In July , a pilot program enacted by San Francisco 's transportation authority will start forcing the companies to document their buses and routes , and pay $ 1 every time they use a city bus stop .
These buses are huge , intimidating , Greyhound-sized affairs , many of them double-deckers , that feel outsized on a relatively quiet street of single-family homes . I have n't stockpiled much umbrage over them , but some of my neighbors who 've lived here longer hate the buses . There 's something disconcerting about having your street turn into a major artery in the transportation infrastructure of a company 45 miles away , without so much as a mailer ( “ Hi ! We 're Apple . We 'll be using your street for a while. ” ) .
In fact , among the commuter buses , Apple 's are particularly stealthy and anonymous . There 's not a mark on them that indicates they 're Apple 's . They might well be commuting to Area 51 . Even their Wi-Fi is stealthy . eBay broadcasts as “ eBay Bus. ” Google as “ GBUS ” . Apple ? “ CommuteWiFi ” .
I know it 's Apple , because there are unofficial maps in circulation that show which companies are operating on which streets – my house is squarely on one of Apple 's routes . As supporting evidence , I picked up three of the riders on the unmarked buses who tethered their iPhones , which turns them into mobile Wi-Fi hotspots that broadcast the full name of the employee in the SSID . A LinkedIn search verifies they 're on their way to Cupertino . Hi Bart ! Hi Craig ! Hi Marco ! Good to see you . Please do n't mind the pajamas .
The FBI has released a statement regarding the use of stingrays , which apparently claims the opposite of what its nondisclosure agreement ( NDA ) with local law enforcement actually says .
According to The Washington Post , which quoted from but did not publish the statement on Thursday , the FBI does n't actually prevent local law enforcement from disclosing stingray use .
Ars received a copy of the statement from the FBI early Friday morning and is publishing it in full here for the first time .
Among other things , it says :
The NDA should not be construed to prevent a law enforcement officer from disclosing to the court or a prosecutor the fact that this technology was used in a particular case . Defendants have a legal right to challenge the use of electronic surveillance devices , and not disclosing their use could inappropriately and adversely affect a defendant 's right to challenge the use of the equipment .
Not only can stingrays , or cell-site simulators , be used to determine location by spoofing a cell tower , but they can also be used to intercept calls and text messages . Once deployed , the devices intercept data from a target phone as well as information from other phones within the vicinity . For years , federal and local law enforcement have tried to keep their existence a secret while simultaneously upgrading their capabilities . Over the last year , as the devices have come under increased scrutiny , new information about the secretive devices has come to light .
The statement comes just days after Washington state 's governor signed into law a new statute that not only requires that cops get a warrant before using a stingray , but that they fully describe its capabilities to judges in that warrant application and agree to provisions to minimize and destroy data captured from non-target phones .
Within the last year , there have been examples of prosecutors who have dropped cases—even after receiving guilty pleas—rather than offering disclosures on stingray use . The statement says that this provision has never been invoked by the FBI .
“ Shall not… use or provide any information ”
In April 2015 , the New York Civil Liberties Union won a lawsuit filed against the Erie County Sheriff 's Office ( ECSO ) in Northwestern New York , where that agency was compelled to produce its NDA with the FBI , the first time one had been released in fully unredacted form . Similar agreements are believed to exist between the FBI and many other law enforcement agencies nationwide .
The newly revealed sections state :
7 ) The Erie County Sheriff 's Office shall not , in any civil or criminal proceeding , use or provide any information concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology , its associated software , operating manuals , and any related documentation ( including its technical/engineering description ( s ) and capabilities ) beyond the evidentiary results obtained through the use of the equipment/technology including , but not limited to , during pre-trial matters , in search warrants , and related affidavits , in discovery , in response to court ordered disclosure , in other affidavits , in grand jury hearings , in the State 's case-in-chief , rebuttal , or on appeal , or in testimony in any phase of civil or criminal trial , without the prior written approval of the FBI . 8 ) In addition , the Erie County Sheriff 's Office will , at the request of the FBI , seek dismissal of the case in lieu of using or providing , or allowing others to use or provide , any information concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology , its associated software , operating manuals , and any related documentation ( beyond the evidentiary results obtained through the use of the equipment/technology ) , if using or providing such information would potentially or actually compromise the equipment/technology . This point supposes that the agency has some control or influence over the prosecutorial process . Where such is not the case , or is limited so as to be inconsequential , it is the FBI 's expectation that the law enforcement agency identify the applicable prosecuting agency , or agencies , for inclusion in this agreement .
`` The FBI 's concern is with protecting the law enforcement sensitive details regarding the tradecraft and capabilities of the device , '' Christopher Allen , an FBI spokesman , said in the statement provided both to the Post and to Ars .
Previously , Allen declined to answer direct questions from Ars about the circumstances of stingray use . Last year , Allen sent Ars an affidavit from a top FBI official outlining the agency 's position on why so little information has been publicly disclosed .
`` The FBI routinely asserts the law enforcement sensitive privilege over cell site simulator equipment because discussion of the capabilities and use of the equipment in court would allow criminal defendants , criminal enterprises , or foreign powers , should they gain access to the items , to determine the FBI 's techniques , procedures , limitations , and capabilities in this area , '' Bradley Morrison , chief of the tracking technology unit at the FBI , stated in the affidavit .
`` This knowledge could easily lead to the development and employment of countermeasures to FBI tools and investigative techniques by subjects of investigations and completely disarm law enforcement 's ability to obtain technology-based surveillance data in criminal investigations , '' Morrison said .
Earlier this month , the Department of Justice , which oversees the FBI , announced that it would be reviewing its stingray policies .
On Friday , Allen did not immediately respond to Ars ' specific questions .
Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize
Sudan offered up the terrorist and data on his network . The then-president and his advisors did n't respond .
As an American Muslim and a political supporter of Clinton , I feel now , as I argued with Clinton and Berger then , that their counter-terrorism policies fueled the rise of Bin Laden from an ordinary man to a Hydra-like monster .
The silence of the Clinton administration in responding to these offers was deafening .
Among those in the networks were the two hijackers who piloted commercial airliners into the World Trade Center .
President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir , who wanted terrorism sanctions against Sudan lifted , offered the arrest and extradition of Bin Laden and detailed intelligence data about the global networks constructed by Egypt 's Islamic Jihad , Iran 's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas .
From 1996 to 1998 , I opened unofficial channels between Sudan and the Clinton administration . I met with officials in both countries , including Clinton , U.S. National Security Advisor Samuel R. `` Sandy '' Berger and Sudan 's president and intelligence chief .
I know because I negotiated more than one of the opportunities .
President Clinton and his national security team ignored several opportunities to capture Osama bin Laden and his terrorist associates , including one as late as last year .
Realizing the growing problem with Bin Laden , Bashir sent key intelligence officials to the U.S. in February 1996 .
The Sudanese offered to arrest Bin Laden and extradite him to Saudi Arabia or , barring that , to `` baby-sit '' him -- monitoring all his activities and associates .
But Saudi officials did n't want their home-grown terrorist back where he might plot to overthrow them .
In May 1996 , the Sudanese capitulated to U.S. pressure and asked Bin Laden to leave , despite their feeling that he could be monitored better in Sudan than elsewhere .
Bin Laden left for Afghanistan , taking with him Ayman Zawahiri , considered by the U.S. to be the chief planner of the Sept. 11 attacks ; Mamdouh Mahmud Salim , who traveled frequently to Germany to obtain electronic equipment for Al Qaeda ; Wadih El-Hage , Bin Laden 's personal secretary and roving emissary , now serving a life sentence in the U.S. for his role in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya ; and Fazul Abdullah Mohammed and Saif Adel , also accused of carrying out the embassy attacks .
Some of these men are now among the FBI 's 22 most-wanted terrorists .
The two men who allegedly piloted the planes into the twin towers , Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi , prayed in the same Hamburg mosque as did Salim and Mamoun Darkazanli , a Syrian trader who managed Salim 's bank accounts and whose assets are frozen .
Important data on each had been compiled by the Sudanese .
But U.S. authorities repeatedly turned the data away , first in February 1996 ; then again that August , when at my suggestion Sudan 's religious ideologue , Hassan Turabi , wrote directly to Clinton ; then again in April 1997 , when I persuaded Bashir to invite the FBI to come to Sudan and view the data ; and finally in February 1998 , when Sudan 's intelligence chief , Gutbi al-Mahdi , wrote directly to the FBI .
Gutbi had shown me some of Sudan 's data during a three-hour meeting in Khartoum in October 1996 . When I returned to Washington , I told Berger and his specialist for East Africa , Susan Rice , about the data available . They said they 'd get back to me . They never did . Neither did they respond when Bashir made the offer directly . I believe they never had any intention to engage Muslim countries -- ally or not . Radical Islam , for the administration , was a convenient national security threat .
And that was not the end of it . In July 2000 -- three months before the deadly attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen -- I brought the White House another plausible offer to deal with Bin Laden , by then known to be involved in the embassy bombings . A senior counter-terrorism official from one of the United States ' closest Arab allies -- an ally whose name I am not free to divulge -- approached me with the proposal after telling me he was fed up with the antics and arrogance of U.S. counter-terrorism officials .
A student who introduced Jeremy Corbyn at a campaign launch posted a series of racist and ant-Semitic tweets in which she talked about blacking up and used the n-word .
Bethany Barker has apologised for the 'disgusting ' tweets and quit as general secretary of Nottingham Labour Students Committee after the messages were uncovered .
Ms Barker introduced Mr Corbyn at his local election campaign launch in Newark , Nottingham last month and the revelations are a major embarrassment to Labour .

Mr Corbyn appeared alongside the student at Labour 's local election campaign launch in Nottinghamshire last month
In one tweet she wrote : ' I cooked brandon chicken and rice , supporting the n * * * * * race . '
In another she wrote : 'My dad just said I 'm going to black myself up for my birthday tomorrow and be a n * * * * for a day . '
In another she said : ' I hate bbc one f * * * ing c * * * s black f * * * ing b * * * * I hate everyone # mayday . '
In another she describes a skull cap as a 'jew cap ' and says the Norwegian far right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik - who killed 77 people in an armed rampage in 2011 - should 'go get slaughtered by a bunch of muslims and get forced to live in a synagogue ' .
The tweets were posted by Ms Barker , who describes herself as a 'feminist and pino grigio enthusiast ' , between 2012 and 2014 from an account which has now been deleted .
University of Nottingham Labour Students said they condemned the messages .
In a statement , Ms Barker said : 'As some of you may have seen online , some anti-Semitic , homophobic , and racist tweets have resurfaced from my old Twitter account from 2012-14 '

Wind power certainly has its detractors , but they rarely let facts get in the way of their criticisms . There have been a spate in the media in recent weeks , pushing the line that renewable energy costs too much , does n't work , destabilises the energy grid and so on .
Miranda Devine wrote a long rant which has been reprinted in several Murdoch tabloids , entitled “ Turbine Hype is a costly myth “ . She has been ably ( and more concisely ) answered today by the Clean Energy Council 's Kane Thornton .
Randall Bell of the Landscape Guardians made the case more bluntly in the Geelong Advertiser earlier , on September 20 .
He mentions “ three European studies ” that claim every job in renewable energy ( of all kinds ) causes “ nearly three ” job losses elsewhere .
There have been several such studies by right-wing think tanks in Europe , some with links to fossil fuel companies like Exxon . But the political bias of the authors , and poor research methodology , have substantially discredited those studies . Think Progress reports here .
Reviewing one of these studies in August 2009 , the US government National Renewable Energy Laboratory wrote that “ the primary conclusion made by the authors – policy support of renewable energy results in net jobs losses – is not supported by their work. ” ( click here for the NREL 's report in PDF format ) .
A 2003 Australian study found wind farms have about 40 % Australian content and create 2-3 times as many local jobs per kWh generated as coal power .
Still in Australia , South Australia in the 2010/2011 year generated 20 % of its power from electricity . According a draft report released by the Australian Energy Market Operator AEMO ( which is not an ideologically motivated think tank ) , gas and coal generators have not increased their share , while SA 's imports of Victorian electricity have decreased .
Most of SA 's new generation capacity is from wind . They have not built the same amount of gas capacity to back up the variable output of the wind farms . Simple grid management ( which manages a highly variable electricity demand every day ) can easily integrate their level of wind energy .
Not surprisingly , South Australia is also reducing its carbon emissions as a result . The AEMO report says “ The trend shows a decline in emissions over the last few years due to the increased wind generation . ”
If you 're a climate change denier like Bell , you may not care . But here 's the best bit . Wind energy is actually helping to keep energy costs down . Not because it 's the cheapest form of energy – it is n't – but because it 's keeping peak prices down by supplying a big slab of power at a cost much lower than peak levels .
Most of our electricity price rises are due to rising peak demand ( driven by aircon ) , and the need to upgrade the network to cope , not renewables . That 's the conclusion of the Australian Energy Market Commission – also not a biased think tank .
Bell makes some ridiculous factual errors . He says turbines stop operating over 30°C . Over 40° would be more accurate , and it 's a very hot day when it 's over 40° at 70-80m up , the typical tower height in Australia . And there you go again . Bell says the towers are “ 150-metre-plus high ” . Even including the blade length above the tower , most here are about 130-140m tall .
If it were just a matter of a few shoddy arguments in an article , I would n't care . But wind energy has now been practically banned from new development in Victoria . The only justification seems to be the campaign waged by Bell and his colleagues .
Where 's the justice , as wind farms are banned within 2km of a house ( 5km from regional towns ) , yet Anglesea residents live within 1km of a coal mine and power station ?
Geelong company Austeng has been in the news with a new turbine design they are trialling . The new wind laws will make it hard to put their turbine up anywhere in the state . What 's threatening jobs in that case ?
Passwords are a constant headache , a headache that will one day grow so bad that—if infomercials can be believed—your grandmother will pound a table in frustration . How to manage them ? Early this year , one of the largest as-seen-on-TV companies produced its innovative answer : the Password Minder .
Despite the grandiose name , the Password Minder is a blank notebook . It has a black cover . You write all your passwords in it . It costs $ 10 ( plus shipping and handling ) .
“ Who can remember all those tricky combinations ? ” the infomercial asks . “ You 'll never lose critical computer settings again ! ” it exclaims as a green “ Safe Computer Guarantee ” appears on the screen .
The product was mocked mercilessly . The infomercial was posted to Youtube in January , highlighted for ridicule on Infomercial Hell in March , and then savaged by comedian and talk show host Ellen Degeneres in April . Security guru Bruce Schneier saw the Degeneres video and called it `` pretty good , '' while a Sophos security researcher thought the product so dumb he questioned whether the informercial was even real . `` As Ellen amusingly asks , would n't it be cheaper to save money and write all your passwords on a $ 5 bill ? '' he asked .
`` This is actually real , saw one of those in a bookstore the other day , '' wrote a commenter on Schneier 's site on April 24 . `` A nice looking , large in length size , made out of suede cover . ''
Naturally we had to seek out such a product . But when we went to purchase our own Internet Password Minder , it proved impossible to find—it was n't even offered on the website of Telebrands , which had produced the infomercial . Was this thing `` actually real '' ?
If they buy it , we build it
Telebrands is a massive—and massively successful—company that generates many multimillion dollar products ( like the PedEgg with 40 million sold or the “ view-sharpening ” AmberVision sunglasses , which achieved $ 150 million in sales ) . The company is responsible for most of the late night infomercials advertising products that range from creative to the dubious to the nonsensical . Telebrands products originate from a range of sources including pitches from individual inventors , but Telebrands would only tell us that Internet Password Minder came from a mysterious “ company . ”
Yes , the idea was real . So was the infomercial . One of the ways Telebrands tests its products is by generating a commercial to gauge interest , a Telebrands PR representative told Ars . “ In this case , the company created a test infomercial to determine interest in the product , '' the rep said . `` Since there was minimal interest , the product was not produced for public distribution . ''
While the Password Minder was widely mocked for providing poor security , writing your passwords in an offline notebook is n't the worst thing you can do so long as the notebook is stashed in a private location ( do n't keep it at the office ! ) , your home is n't burgled , and you do n't have snooping friends and family . It 's certainly a better approach than using a single , easily crackable password on every site you visit—as many nontechnical users still do . As Schneier noted the Password Minder `` is—if you think about it—only slightly different than Password Safe , '' his own encrypted database for storing passwords on your computer . Most problems come from online hacking , not bad guys grabbing notebooks full of passwords .
Of course that 's no excuse for an informercial that shows an actress stashing the Password Minder in her purse for a day on the town . ( And if you are burgled , you 're in trouble . )
The phone number for Internet Password Minder is now defunct . The GetPasswordMinder.com domain now redirects to Telebrands ' main site where you can still pick up items like the SlimAway girdle , Pasta Boat , and FlipJack Non-Stick Pancake Flipper .
The sun has set on the Password Minder , which at least taught us that the world does not want an overpriced , alphabetized notebook to store its passwords . Still , we got to laugh at terrible footage of an old woman gently pounding her fist at a blue screen . And that 's got to be worth something .
Wednesday night on NBC 's The Tonight Show , host Jimmy Fallon had Michelle Obama on as his guest for one of her final television appearances as First Lady . Fallon is known for being very friendly towards his guests but his interview with Mrs. Obama was completely out of the ordinary in gushiness .
The show began with a really weird segment in which a few “ regular Americans ” are asked to go backstage and stare at a painting of Michelle Obama and tell her “ what she meant ” to them . Michelle then showed up to surprise each person while they were giving their emotional tributes , complete with shrieking , sobbing and hugs . Somehow , no one on The Tonight Show thought having people talking to a painting and telling it how much they mean to them is in any way creepy or unusual .
When it came time to do the interview , Fallon began by being as over-the-top gushy as possible , by introducing Michelle as “ way smarter , cooler and more accomplished ” than the rest of America . Fallon and Obama reminisced over the sketches they had done over the past several years and Fallon begged her to come back on the show after she left the Oval Office .
The late-night host then asked what made her “ get choked up ” during “ her event last Friday ” ( presumably the White House celebrity-filled farewell party . ) Michelle replied , “ kids ” before going on to make an insinuated reference to Trump :
FALLON : I never see you -- we never see you get that emotional . What is it that choked you up ? What made you start -- OBAMA : Talking about kids . Talking about the future . I mean , kids are my heart . FALLON : Yeah . OBAMA : You know ? When I think about the fact that some of them are afraid about what is to come . FALLON : Yeah . OBAMA : You know , I really -- what I said , I do n't want them to be afraid . I want them to embrace the future and know that the world is getting better . We have bumps in the road , we have ups and downs . But I want our kids to like move forward . I do n't care where they come from , with strength and with hope . And that -- [ cheers and applause ] FALLON : I love you for saying that
Fallon went on to talk about her husband 's farewell speech , saying he “ lost it . ”
FALLON : I lost it at home . I was crying on my wife 's shoulder .
He continued the gushing :
FALLON : [ Barack 's ] just the best man in the whole wide world . I mean , no way could there be a cooler human being than that guy . And every time Malia lost it -- I lost it .
He went on to praise the Obama daughters as “ so pretty ” and “ so nice ” before calling the Michelle and Barack “ good parents . ”
Later in his “ Thank you notes ” sketch , Fallon compared the First Lady to another liberal icon ; Beyonce .
FALLON : Thank you , Mrs. Obama , for being a strong , smart , independent woman , an activist , a style icon , and a great dancer . Showing us all what it would look like if Beyonce married a much nerdier Jay-Z
Fallon ended the interview by asking Michelle if she was going to keep up her initiatives she started while in the White House . This gave her the opportunity to tout her notoriously problematic healthy school lunches program , even insinuating that critics of the program lacked common sense .
OBAMA : You know , the fact that we have really made big strides to change the health of our kids , especially through the school lunch program which I hope does not get touched , because that makes sense . We have to keep doing things that make sense for our future . [ Cheers and applause ] It 's like -- you know , it 's nuts . FALLON : Yeah [ nods in agreement ] OBAMA : We know our kids need to eat well . They need to eat healthy and we ca n't sort of start changing that when they go to school .
The segment was more like old friends gossipping than an interview . Fallon never drifted far away from the personal , even asking Michelle , “ How 's your mom doing ? ” before sharing family photos of the Obamas during their time in the White House . The audience appropriately replied with lots of “ Aww ” s , cheers , laughter and applause .
Sure , softball questions are commonplace on late-night shows but no other political figure would receive this kind of ego stroking and deity-like praise like the Obamas do .
A mourning ritual and a roadside memorial , a “ ghost bike ” marks the site where a bicyclist was killed while riding .
According to ghostbikes.org , a site that chronicles memorials set up in the New York City area and elsewhere , the first ghost bike was created in 2003 in St. Louis .
Now they 're all over the world — including in Southern California .
Last fall , a gallery in East Hollywood showcased art related to ghost bikes in the Los Angeles area .
Painted completely white , the bikes help bring closure to those who lose friends and family on the road , according to members of the cycling community who erect ghost bikes .
Danny Gamboa , who has worked on a 60-minute documentary about ghost bikes , is one of several activists who create the memorials in the Los Angeles area . Gamboa 's website is filled with photos of the memorials .
“ We 've placed ghost bikes for cyclists as young as 6-year-olds and as old at 90-year-olds , ” Gamboa said .
The mission is “ to make sure that anyone killed on their bike is n't forgotten and is n't dying in vain , ” according to a Facebook page for Ghost Bikes-LA .
According to federal data , 726 cyclists died in collisions in the U.S. in 2012 . As a growing number of Southern California cities seek to add or consider bike lanes and cycling advocates becoming more vocal , such deaths are increasingly in the spotlight locally .
For one Oxnard father whose young son was among those killed while riding , the makeshift memorials serve as a raw reminder of the fragility of life .
“ When I lost my son , I walked away for five minutes , and it was in those five minutes my son was taken away from me . And I can never have him back , ” father Anthony Martinez said .
One day while visiting the site where his son , 6-year-old Anthony Jr. , died , Martinez was stunned to discover a ghost bike dedicated to the boy .
“ I was speechless because this individual did n't know me … did n't know me or my family , ” Martinez said of whoever erected the memorial .
He was so touched , Martinez joined the ghost bike community of volunteers who vow to honor as many victims as they can .
“ It 's a way of showing a family that there 's someone out there that cares and feels their pain — that 's the way I look at it , ” he said .
The most valuable thing I got from attending Djangocon last week was a giant list of technologies . Some we already use at Mahalo ( it was nice to hear that we were doing something right ) , and some that I had n't heard of before . Here 's the list , hope it helps you find something useful :
django-config – a project aimed at working with profiles for multiple settings files . haystack – a search app for Django brabeion – an app for adding badges to your project zeromq – not a Django thing , but I heard this mentioned on several occasions . I still do n't understand exactly what it is , so check it out . ( Not to be confused with RabbitMQ or any AMQP servers . ) ipython – a better python shell . You should be using this . maatkit – tools for managing MySQL , Postgresql , and memcached databases . sqlalchemy – an alternate python ORM . django_alfajor – a Django wrapper for using alfajor , a functional front-end testing framework in Python . dulwich – git protocol and file formats written in Python . sphinx – Python documentation generator . celery – a tool for asynchronous job/task processing . fabric – python library and tool for deployment via SSH . gunicorn – a lightweight WSGI HTTP server in Python . django-piston – a framework for creating a RESTful API for your Django project . django-tastypie – another framework for adding a RESTful API to your Django project . django-taggit – a Django tagging app . django-debug-toolbar – a great toolbar/heads-up-display for debugging and developing in Django . django-filter – a tool for generically building Querysets based on user inputs . django-notification – a user notification tool . logbook – logging replacement for Python/Django proclaim – a tool using Redis to allow conditional rollout of features . varnish – a page caching solution . django-staticfiles – an app to help to serve static files in Django . lettuce – a tool for managing test-driven development . Edit : sentry – dammit , I forgot this one . Real-time logging for Django exceptions . ( We just started using this one , it 's pretty sweet . )
No promises on the quality of these ( although most of them are pretty widely used , but a few of them were people 's pet projects , so they 're still in beta or alpha .

An Islamic State suicide bomber killed at least 41 people who had gathered to watch a soccer match in a stadium south of Baghdad on Friday evening , demonstrating the deadly threat still posed by the group as it is slowly being driven back from the territories it controls .
The attack in the Babil province town of Iskandariyah came hours after U.S. officials said a top Islamic State commander , an Iraqi known by the nickname Haji Imam , had been killed in
an American commando raid , though there was no immediate reason to believe the incidents were linked .
The bomber struck as trophies were being handed out to teams after a tournament , according to local officials .
[ Senior Islamic State commander said to be killed in U.S. operation ]
Iraqi officials put the death toll at 41 and said an additional 105 people were injured . A Babil police spokesman , Col. Muthanna Harith , said preliminary reports suggested 30 people died .

Among the dead was the head of the local council , and the injured included two senior local figures in Asaib Ahl al-Haq , one of the Shiite militias active on the front lines against the Islamic State , according to Falah Abdul Kareem , the head of the local security council . But most of the victims were spectators who were attending the tournament , he said .
In a statement issued by its Amaq News Agency , the Islamic State said the attack targeted a gathering of Shiite militias , known collectively as Hashd al-Shaabi . It did not mention that the blast took place at a soccer match .
The Islamic State said that more than 60 people died , including a local militia commander , and that nearly 100 were wounded in the attack . The bomber was named as Saifullah al-Ansari , an apparently fake name indicating that he was a local Iraqi or Syrian member of the group . A photograph accompanying the statement suggests he was in his early teens .
“ Our knight immersed into their crowds until he detonated his belt , turning them into scattered parts , ” the statement said .
The Islamic State has been resorting to suicide attacks with growing frequency in recent weeks as the group 's fighters slowly lose control of territories they had held in some instances since 2014 .

More than 50 people died in a suicide truck bombing in the Babil province town of Hilla
this month , a week after two suicide bombings targeting Shiite areas of Baghdad killed more than 100 . Hilla is a mixed Sunni-Shiite town , but the attacks there have targeted Shiite communities .

Today 's coverage from Post correspondents around the world
Economic woes do n't stop America 's patriotic spirit . This year citizens will celebrate the Fourth of July in numbers as big as ever . In fact , they could spend upward of $ 3 billion on holiday weekend parties , food , entertainment and travel .
According to the National Retail Federation 's 2010 Independence Day Consumer Intentions and Actions Survey ( conducted by BIGresearch , a consumer research firm based in Worthington , Ohio ) , 87.8 % of all Americans will take part in some sort of Independence Day festivity . And they 'll spend a lot of cash doing it . Here 's how .
In Depth : Fourth of July by the Numbers
Lots of Americans show off their holiday spirit in the form of flags , decorations and clothes : 79 % of Americans already own some form of patriotic merchandise , and 16 % will buy more for this year 's holiday , according to the survey . But they 'll do do more than just wave flags : 42 % of them will watch fireworks or attend a community celebration .
Those fireworks do n't come cheap : Consumers will spend over $ 600 million on fireworks this holiday weekend , according to the American Pyrotechnic Association , a Bethesda , Md. , trade group . Two-thirds of that will be spent on backyard fireworks , but there will also be over 14,000 organized local displays .
Independence Day tends to be a time for casual get-togethers with loved ones , rather than formal dinners or gift-giving . `` You 're just enjoying quality time with your family and friends , '' says Pamela Goodfellow , an analyst at BIGresearch . But quality time does n't come cheap , especially for the 62 % of Americans who will gather for a cookout or a picnic . BIGresearch estimates that each cookout will cost , on average , about $ 54.62 . And with 36 million barbecues and picnics taking place across the country , Americans could spend a total of nearly $ 2 billion on cookouts alone .
Americans will spend $ 92 million on chips and $ 60.3 million on dip . They 'll drop $ 193.6 million on hamburger patties , $ 70.4 million on buns and $ 86.2 million on cheese . And they 'll pay $ 203 million for mayonnaise , mustard and ketchup , and $ 161.5 million for lettuce , tomatoes , relish and onions .
Grilling all that food costs almost as much as buying it . Americans will spend $ 111.1 million on charcoal and another $ 94.3 million on lighter fluid , according to the BIGresearch survey .
What about dessert ? Watermelon will cost the nation $ 167.5 million , and popsicle revenues will total $ 107.7 million .
On an occasion where they needed to be near flawless to beat the in-form world champions , the Kiwis instead fumbled their way to a 34-8 drubbing at the hands of Australia in the Four Nations final .
Draw Widget - Grand Final - Australia vs New Zealand
The errors started inside the opening two minutes for David Kidwell 's side , and they never stopped , with New Zealand finishing the match with a total of 14 mistakes , which saw them complete just 25 of 41 sets across 80 minutes at Anfield on Monday morning ( AEDT ) .
`` To do that in any game of football , let alone a final , let alone against a team like Australia , it 's going to be tough , '' Kidwell said post-match .
`` We just needed to get back to a decent completion rate to be honest with you… We gave them too many opportunities at the wrong end , and they took full advantage of it .
`` They got out to a lead that was uncatchable really . ''
At the other end of the spectrum Australia rarely wasted their time with the ball , completing at 90 per cent and turning their extra possession into 10 line breaks and six tries .
New Zealand captain Jesse Bromwich said the sheer number of errors through periods of the game was unlike anything he had experienced across his seven-year professional career .
`` Seven errors in 20 minutes [ at one stage ] , I do n't know if I have played a game where we have done that before , '' the Melbourne Storm front-rower said .
`` You can not do that in this tournament , let alone the final .
`` You may as well give them the ball and let them score a try there .
`` We were working hard enough out there and to put pressure on ourselves like we did there was tough . ''

Despite the message constantly being relayed on the field to start holding the ball , New Zealand never found a significant period where they were able to stay error-free and build pressure .
Fullback Jordan Kahu , who provided the Kiwis with two highlights via tries in the 56th and 69th minutes , said they played to their intended style , but failed to execute on many levels .
`` I guess we were just trying to do a bit too much , '' Kahu said .
`` The style of footy the Kiwis like to play , we like to throw the footy around .
`` We were throwing the ball around , but someone was n't there and we were just making a few too many errors .
`` We gave a good team an inch , and you ca n't do that against Australia . ''
Meanwhile New Zealand winger Jordan Rapana was taken to hospital immediately after the match , with Kiwis medical staff claiming he may suffer a fractured eye socket early in the second half .
With four days of padded practices done , we now have a much clearer look at some of the most critical positions on the roster . And nowhere will the differences between unpadded and padded practices become clearer than along the trenches .
While it was difficult to get an understanding of the offensive line play , there was a reason to be optimistic : a new offensive line coach and some new offensive linemen meant that the 2016 should n't look like the 2015 line .
But the early returns are n't great , and that could have a ripple effect throughout the offense , and therefore the defense 's field position .
Offensive Line
If you 're worried about Matt Kalil , let me reassure you that you should remain worried .
It 's true that Kalil probably had his best day in pads on Day Five of camp , which is a good sign , but the balance of his performance has n't been great . Up until yesterday , he was perhaps the worst performing offensive linemen , consistently losing one-on-one drills against Everson Griffen and on occasion others .
This most recent day of padded practices was definitively more positive , however , and he generated some movement in the run game . While he took a lot of heat from Griffen in one-on-ones , he at least looked better in elevens , where he kept the pocket clean more often than not and reacted to his assignments well .
Hopefully that improvement continues , though one-on-one performance for OL and DL has been surprisingly predictive . Linval Joseph won the most one-on-ones last year after adjusting for who he was playing against , and Clemmings was the second-worst offensive lineman , just ahead of Bykowski . Matt Kalil checked in at 24th of the 30 linemen , while Berger ranked fifth .
Next to him , Alex Boone has looked phenomenal , though it needs to be said that in eleven-on-eleven drills yesterday , he was n't really performing up to his level . While some of this can be chalked up to Linval Joseph 's absolute dominance—more on that in a bit—Boone also struggled against Tom Johnson at times .
That 's not a big problem and he did well in half-line and one-on-one drills . I think people will be very happy with his performance in the regular season if these early returns mean anything .
The battle between John Sullivan and Joe Berger was characterized by Zimmer as one that may be resolved through different styles of play . A few days ago , he said “ It 's a good battle . Both of them ( John Sullivan and Joe Berger ) have different strengths , and we 're just trying to figure out what 's the best combination for the other four guys in there . Whether it 's the physicality or the intelligence or how we can work that out . We 're going to keep rotating them this week , and I 'll try to figure it out after the next break we have . ”
While Sullivan would be the “ intelligent ” one and Berger
the one who plays with “ physicality , ” none of this is to say that Sullivan is n't physical or Berger unintelligent . A lot of this battle will be resolved off the field ; if Berger provides too much interesting depth along the interior line , better play may not mean he starts . If Bridgewater can handle all the protection calls well on his own , like he was forced to last year without Sullivan , then some of the advantage Sullivan provides may be moot .
On the field , I 'd say Sullivan has outperformed Berger over the past two days , but the margin is n't enormous . While Sullivan is performing at a lower level of play in one-on-ones , his ability to peel and win double-teams in elevens seems more obvious and useful .
This all could change however , in part because having a center who can win one-on-one battles against defensive tackles more often than Sullivan can is a compelling reality , especially if Bridgewater can handle the protection calls .
As for Brandon Fusco , he 's been a pleasant surprise . There have n't been many tweets about him as the other five linemen at the other four spots have consumed a lot of attention , but that might be a good thing for a guard who looked so bad last year that it was impossible to ignore him . Fusco has had his struggles , especially on twists , but he 's been winning a good number of his matchups .
There have been some confusing moments in elevens where it seems like he does n't hit his assignment—linebackers untouched in the assigned run lane is never a good thing—but from a physical and technical standpoint , we may be closer to 2013 Fusco than 2015 . While I would n't expect him to hit those heights , we may be a good deal closer to average than we were .
Andre Smith , on the other hand , has been difficult to gauge . He has dominant stretches of play against Robison and Hunter that look really positive and then he has long stretches of play where it seems like he can never get set right . It was difficult to get a read on him until I pored through the notes and the general consensus seems to be pretty negative . While he 's been performing better than T.J. Clemmings and seems to have the starting right tackle job sewn up , the highlight periods of good play do n't make up for the long runs of poor play .
The offensive line should be better overall . The right tackle and left tackle positions will have at least marginal upgrades , while the left guard position will be a huge upgrade over last year . We should expect the level of center play to remain consistent , but possibly expect a downgrade ( but maybe not as much as we thought ) at right guard .
Outside of those six players , I should note that Willie Beavers ' play seems to have dropped off dramatically since I last talked about him , and Zac Kerin 's play has dropped off a little as well—though by not nearly as much .
Once again , the worst-performing offensive lineman on the roster is probably Carter Bykowski and he has n't really improved much over last season to me . Jeremiah Sirles has also performed poorly thus far , which is a sad surprise because of how well received he was by San Diego fans . Maybe his performance in the preseason will make up for it . He seems to be losing to a whole host of defensive linemen , including Scott Crichton , Zach Moore and Danielle Hunter .
Nick Easton has been performing well , even though he did get some audible flack that was pretty well-reported .
# Vikings OL coach Tony Sparano not happy with center Nick Easton 's performance in positional drills . Was calling him `` soft . '' — Eric Oslund ( @ EDOslund ) July 31 , 2016
Easton has done well against the assortment of defensive tackles he 's been up against , which include Toby Johnson , Travis Raciti , Scott Crichton , Claudell Lewis and Kenrick Ellis .
Defensive Line
This defensive line is good . It is very good . And it feels like it could be better than last year 's . Griffen seems unstoppable , even when twisting inside against Alex Boone or John Sullivan , and Linval Joseph seems to be playing at another level . There have been so many times I 've seen free linebackers because Joseph wo n't let the OL move to the second level .
Sharrif Floyd has found himself into the backfield often , and he continues to provide both a pressure and run-stopping element while also taking on an unusual number of double-teams in camp so far .
Switching off between Brian Robison and Danielle Hunter should also produce some excellent results as Hunter seems to have made measurable gains over his ability last year , while Robison is performing at a high level despite not getting press from us here in camp . He seems to be doing a good job getting pressure , though perhaps that has more to do with Andre Smith than anything else .
Aside from those five , Tom Johnson continues to make waves and has been able to slip past or power through all of the interior starters . He plays with the first team nickel a lot and seems to be performing at the level he was the last two years .
With those six players , the defensive line rotation may be stronger than it has in a long , long time .
At the backup nose tackle spot , Shamar Stephen seems to be competing with Kenrick Ellis , and has the upper hand . Not only is Stephen regularly rotating with the twos while Ellis is with the threes , Ellis ' missed time has given Stephen an enormous edge .
Beyond that , it seems like Stephen is outperforming Ellis . He 's doing a better job penetrating the offensive line and seems to hold the run about as well . Stephen also provides a little more versatility , given that he can play some three-technique—though maybe that does n't mean as much given that the Vikings were evidently comfortable giving Ellis three-technique snaps last year .
If any backup is having a hell of a camp , it 's Justin Trattou . It 's not difficult to see why Scott Crichton has been relegated to third team end/tackle with the way that Trattou has been playing . Not only is he performing well against Matt Kalil and Jeremiah Sirles , he 's been able to play against Andre Smith and interior linemen as well . In all of those circumstances , he 's been outperforming the other backup defensive ends and seems to be a consistent rotational guy .
Zach Moore is not far behind him , however , and continues to find ways to influence the play . He 's played more inside than Trattou has , while still playing quite a few snaps on the second team while Hunter rests . I did n't expect Moore to play this well , but he 's been able to stand stout against the run while still providing a pass-rush threat .
I do n't have many notes on the other defensive linemen , except to say that Claudell Lewis looks much better than I expected and that both Toby Johnson and Travis Raciti are not threats to move up the depth chart . Theiren Cockran has certainly been disappointing .
Other Observations
Quarterback
Teddy plays as well as ever . Despite two interceptions yesterday—neither of which I would characterize as quarterback error—he 's done a good job placing passes for contested catches , finding efficiencies in the red zone and generally moving the ball . The deep ball , which had disappeared for a few days as Bridgewater looked to play underneath in situational drills , came back and he hit a few receivers deep—like Kyle Rudolph , Adam Thielen , Charles Johnson and Stefon Diggs .
Teddy on Day 5 was much better than Teddy on Day 4 , as he underthrew receivers too often and could n't place the ball in optimal spots , even as he was beating coverage . For those concerned about his mechanics ; a longer look at more recent practice video than what I looked at on Day 3 shows no difference—he drops his elbow still , especially on deeper throws , but his mechanics are clean short and underneath . The elbow drop is not nearly as severe as in previous seasons and his release remains quick .
Were I to gauge the ball 's velocity , it seems to be faster . More importantly , his deep accuracy still seems to have improved .
Both Shaun Hill and Joel Stave looked better than they have in the past several days , and this picks up on the theme of improvement that was noted on Day 3 . I still do n't think this means they 've been performing well , but Stave did throw the prettiest pass of the day to Adam Thielen on a deep crosser .
If this is the level of performance one expects from the Vikings backup quarterback situation , I still think there 's significant reason for worry—though with Hill ( who has thrown , of course , more interceptions ) and Stave ( whose passes remain wild ) , the situation does n't seem as bad to me as it did several days ago .
“ Skill Players ”
Trae Waynes looks better and in position , Treadwell certainly needs more work ( more drops in camp , again ) , Stefon Diggs is getting open against everybody , Xavier Rhodes is looking sharp—in contrast to early in camp—and Mackensie Alexander looked a lot better on Day 5 than he did in the previous four days .
Treadwell seems to have a lot of attributes that will make him very good , but has not put them together on a consistent basis . In one-on-one drills , he did a phenomenal job on Day 5 , getting open and catching the ball in a variety of ways from a bevy of platforms . In elevens , he was n't as consistent . In prior days , it was the opposite , where his one-on-one drills looked poor , but his elevens looked better .
Adam Thielen is doing well , and certainly better than he did early on , but nothing is eye-popping . Again , this seems fine given that he 's often playing with the ones . Charles Johnson is doing very well , but continues to have contested catch issues .
Moritz Böhringer continues to look like he belongs in a way that Babatunde Aiyegbusi never did , but he still does n't look like someone who will make the roster and has debatable practice squad prospects . He had two highlight plays in the last two days , but also some pretty severe missteps .
Tre Roberson has been performing poorly ever since I wrote an article on him . Melvin White has n't been great .
Blake Renaud does not look like a rosterable fullback at the moment and continues to lose collisions with linebackers like Audie Cole and Eric Kendricks . Chad Greenway is doing well thus far in camp , while Anthony Barr is playing like a star . Kyle Rudolph is playing much better than I expected him to , and so is David Morgan , who interestingly did n't seem as sound as a blocker as he had as a catcher over the past two days .
I do n't see Kyle Carter making the practice squad and I thought he and Leonhardt were far and away less talented than Morgan , Rudolph and Pruitt—who seems to be improving as a blocker .
Generally speaking , I think camp has positive returns for the Vikings , but we 'll have to wait and see .

The Associated Press - BERLIN ( AP ) - German prosecutors have charged a railway dispatcher with negligent homicide in the collision of two commuter trains in Bavaria earlier this year that killed a dozen people .
The dispatcher , whose name has not been released in line with German privacy laws , also faces 89 counts of causing bodily harm in addition to the 12 counts of negligent homicide , the dpa news agency reported Monday .
Traunstein prosecutors say the dispatcher is suspected of playing an online game shortly before the two trains he was in charge of collided on a single-track line on Feb. 9 .
The crash was near the Bavarian town of Bad Aibling , about 60 kilometers ( 40 miles ) southeast of Munich .
The dispatcher has been in custody since April .

Georgia State athletic director Charlie Cobb wants to extend the contracts of football coach Trent Miles and his staff , but will have those discussions after the season .
Miles has two football seasons left on a contract that he signed when he was hired in 2012 . He led the Panthers to a 6-6 record this season and a berth in the Cure Bowl , the program 's first postseason experience .
“ We have had a fantastic season , ” Cobb said . “ What I think has made this season a success is the coaches , players and everyone involved in the program have stayed in the moment . After the bowl game we will have big-picture conversations about how we make the program better . ”
Miles went 1-23 in his first two years as he tried to take a program that did n't have much success on the FCS level under previous coach Bill Curry and turn it into a FBS program .
The Panthers started 1-4 this season before winning four consecutive games , including a 34-7 win over rival Georgia Southern in the regular-season finale , to reach six wins and become bowl eligible .
The team is expected to return all but six starters next season , which could make them one of the favorites to win the Sun Belt Conference next year .
A 23 year-old Chinese-Peruvian woman named Tracey Tong is being hailed a subway shero after a video circulating online shows her ardently defending a Muslim couple from bigoted harassment .
In the video , an older woman – who later identifies herself as of Puerto Rican descent – verbally attacks a Muslim man . “
When another subway rider , speaking in accented English , asks her to stop bothering the couple , the Puerto Rican woman turns her vitriol toward this rider as well . “ You do n't understand , you 're not even from here , ” she screams . “ I am . I was born here in America . ”
It 's at this point that Tong , a Queens native , jumps in to stand up for the Muslim riders , switching languages from English to Spanish to try and get her point across . Explaining that she was born in the US but her mother was not , Tracey reminds her fellow Latina that most of us in this country can trace our roots elsewhere . “ We need to stick together ! ” she urges the older Puerto Rican woman , in a plea for solidarity .
As the conversation unfolds , Tracey refuses to back down in her defense of the couple , and in her demand that they be treated with respect – noting that she will stand up for them in any language necessary . “ I 'm asking you to please respect her , ” she insists . “ In Spanish , in English , in Chinese , in French – whatever language you want me to say it , I will say it . ”
The video is both a stark reminder of the work we need to do against colorism and Islamophobia in the Latino community , and an example of how to hold one another accountable with grace and strength .
“ I actually did n't know anyone was recording the situation , to be honest , ” Tong said in an interview Remezcla about the supportive reaction the video has gotten online . “ But since it 's gone viral , I really hope that it helps everyone get that little bit of extra courage they are needing when they have to face something so unfortunate like this , and to fight for what is right . ”

How to call private functions ( bind to hidden symbols ) in GoLang
Names are as important in Go as in any other language . They even have semantic effect : the visibility of a name outside a package is determined by whether its first character is upper case .
Sometimes It 's necessary to overcome this limitation in order to organize your code better , or access some hidden functions in foreign packages .
These techniques are heavily used in golang source code , and this is the primary source of where it comes from . Its distinguishable lack of information there are on the internet on this topic .
From the good old days , there are 2 ways of achieving this bypassing compiler check : can not refer to unexported name pkg.symbol :
Using these techniques I have managed to bind to internal golang runtime schedule related functions to over use goroutines threads parking and internal locking mechanisms .
Using assembly stubs
Idea is simple - provide stubs in assembly with explicit JMPs to needed symbols . Linker does not know anything about which symbols are exported and which not .
i.e . old version of src/os/signal/sig.s :
// Assembly to get into package runtime without using exported symbols . // +build amd64 amd64p32 arm arm64 386 ppc64 ppc64le # include `` textflag.h '' # ifdef GOARCH_arm # define JMP B # endif # ifdef GOARCH_ppc64 # define JMP BR # endif # ifdef GOARCH_ppc64le # define JMP BR # endif TEXT · signal_disable ( SB ) , NOSPLIT , $ 0 JMP runtime · signal_disable ( SB ) TEXT · signal_enable ( SB ) , NOSPLIT , $ 0 JMP runtime · signal_enable ( SB ) TEXT · signal_ignore ( SB ) , NOSPLIT , $ 0 JMP runtime · signal_ignore ( SB ) TEXT · signal_recv ( SB ) , NOSPLIT , $ 0 JMP runtime · signal_recv ( SB )
and signal_unix.go binding :
// +build darwin dragonfly freebsd linux nacl netbsd openbsd solaris windows package signal import ( `` os '' `` syscall '' ) // In assembly . func signal_disable ( uint32 ) func signal_enable ( uint32 ) func signal_ignore ( uint32 ) func signal_recv ( ) uint32
Using go : linkname
In order to use this , the source file have to import _ “ unsafe ” package . To overcome -complete go compiler limitations one of possible solutions is to put empty assembly stub file near by the main source to disable this check .
i.e . os/signal/sig.s :
// The runtime package uses //go : linkname to push a few functions into this // package but we still need a .s file so the Go tool does not pass -complete // to the go tool compile so the latter does not complain about Go functions // with no bodies .
The format of this instruction is //go : linkname localname linkname . Using this its possible to introduce new symbols for linkage ( export ) , or bind to existing symbols ( import ) .
Export with go : linkname
A function implementation in runtime/proc.go
... //go : linkname sync_runtime_doSpin sync.runtime_doSpin //go : nosplit func sync_runtime_doSpin ( ) { procyield ( active_spin_cnt ) }
says explicitly to the compiler to add another name to the code which will be runtime_doSpin in sync package . And the sync reuses it in sync/runtime.go with simple :
package sync import `` unsafe '' ... // runtime_doSpin does active spinning . func runtime_doSpin ( )
Import with go : linkname
A good example sits in net/parse.go :
package net import ( ... _ `` unsafe '' // For go : linkname ) ... // byteIndex is strings.IndexByte . It returns the index of the // first instance of c in s , or -1 if c is not present in s. // strings.IndexByte is implemented in runtime/asm_ $ GOARCH.s //go : linkname byteIndex strings.IndexByte func byteIndex ( s string , c byte ) int
In order to use this technique :
Import _ “ unsafe ” package . Give function definition without body , i.e . func byteIndex ( s string , c byte ) int Put a //go : linkname instruction to the compiler right before the function definition , i.e . //go : linkname byteIndex strings.IndexByte , where byteIndex is the local name , and strings.IndexByte is remote name . Provide .s file stub to allow compiler to bypass -complete check to allow partially defined functions .
Example with goparkunlock
package main import ( _ `` unsafe '' `` fmt '' `` runtime/pprof '' `` os '' `` time '' ) // Event types in the trace , args are given in square brackets . const ( traceEvGoBlock = 20 // goroutine blocks [ timestamp , stack ] ) type mutex struct { // Futex-based impl treats it as uint32 key , // while sema-based impl as M * waitm . // Used to be a union , but unions break precise GC . key uintptr } //go : linkname lock runtime.lock func lock ( l * mutex ) //go : linkname unlock runtime.unlock func unlock ( l * mutex ) //go : linkname goparkunlock runtime.goparkunlock func goparkunlock ( lock * mutex , reason string , traceEv byte , traceskip int ) func main ( ) { l : = & mutex { } go func ( ) { lock ( l ) goparkunlock ( l , `` xxx '' , traceEvGoBlock , 1 ) } ( ) for { pprof . Lookup ( `` goroutine '' ) . WriteTo ( os . Stdout , 1 ) time . Sleep ( time . Second * 1 ) } }

A pretrial hearing took place for Ronnie Chang of San Marcos Monday . Chang was busted during this marijuana dispensary raid on September 9 , 2009 .
San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has injected himself into a federal criminal case against the operator of a medical marijuana dispensary , intensifying his standoff with federal prosecutors on cannabis enforcement issues .
Timeline : Medicial Marijuana in San Diego
Filner 's urging jurors who 'll be chosen for the trial to reject federal law in favor of state statutes under a centuries-old legal concept known as “ jury nullification '' -- whereby jurors can refuse to convict people under laws they believe should not be applied .
It 's a bold , brash move that 's potentially controversial and politically risky for a mayor .
Mayor Fights for CA Law
Filner 's invoking a legal concept that goes back centuries , called `` jury nullification '' -- whereby jurors can refuse to convict people under laws they believe should not be applied . ( Published Monday , May 20 , 2013 )
But that 's not atypical of the former `` Freedom Rider '' who served two months of jail time in Mississippi during the early years of the Civil Rights Era .
`` This is way overdoing it when local laws , state laws allow compassionate use of medical marijuana , ” Filner told reporters at the downtown U.S. District Court complex Monday . “ Someone should not be going through this stage of prosecution for trying to help people to have access to medical marijuana . ''
Filner spoke after attending a pretrial hearing for Ronnie Chang , a San Marcos man busted along with more than a dozen marijuana collective and dispensary operators countywide in late 2009 .
City Council Considers New Pot Ordinance
San Diego Mayor Bob Filner recently proposed an ordinance to allow medical marijuana dispensaries to operate in commercial and industrial areas for a $ 5,000 yearly permit fee and a 2-percent city tax on sales . Eugene Davidovich of San Diego Americans for Safe Access and Scott Chipman with San Diegans for Safe Neighborhoods discuss with NBC 7 's Mari Payton on `` Politically Speaking . '' ( Published Thursday , April 11 , 2013 )
The case has is now heading to a trial , expected to begin this fall .
Chang has been in custody since his bond was revoked last year .
On Monday 's docket were prosecutors ' arguments that Chang 's attorney , Michael McCabe , violated a judicial order against discussing the case in public by giving a videotaped interview to medical marijuana activists that was posted YouTube . It has since attracted a little more than 500 views .
McCabe told Judge Michael Anello that he 'd request that San Diego Americans for Safe Access , the video 's producer and YouTube account holder , take down the video .
That seemed to satisfy the judge and Asst . U.S. Attorney Paul Starita , at least for the moment .
Meantime , federal and county authorities continue to raid pot shops in San Diego , after Filner 's `` stand-down '' order to police while the City Council works on a medical marijuana dispensary ordinance .
The mayor is calling on Chang 's eventual jurors to send a message .
`` It 's time , like with Prohibition , to step back and say this was a stupid thing to do , ” Filner said outside the courthouse . “ Let 's step back , and juries ought to take the lead and say that to the federal government…and if the federal government is n't listening to the mayor , maybe they 'll listen to the jury . ''
Representatives of the U.S. Attorney 's office listened in on Filner 's remarks to the media .
They told NBC 7 that prosecutors would have no comment .

A spray of lazy daisies turns a bargain sweater into a great boutique find . Erika Kern Before : This sweater has a great shape and I love the color , but it lacks personality . Erika Kern After : With some yarn , two stitches , and a little time , a $ 20 bargain becomes a whimsical sweater worthy of the finest boutique . Erika Kern
Once you have one daisy done , it 's just a matter of time before you have dozens . I did n't have a pattern for where the flower placement ; I just stitched , then looked , then stitched some more . Do n't be afraid to work this way -- there are no mistakes . If you do n't like how something looks , just take it out and stitch it somewhere else .
Have fun with your work . The joy will translate to your work and you 'll have the happiest sweater in town !

The Mission E is just the start of the mission . By 2023 , Porsche wants as many as half of the new cars rolling off its assembly lines to be electric vehicles , according to CEO Oliver Blume . But do n't worry , Porschephiles—the core of the electric anschluss seems likely to avoid the company 's sports car models .
Blume mentioned Porsche 's wide-ranging electric car plans in a recent issue of German business magazine Manager Magazin , where he broke down the company 's general roadmap for its battery-powered future . A year or two after the launch of the hotly-anticipated Mission E performance sedan in 2019 , Blume said the carmaker would bring an electric crossover coupe to market—no surprise , as spy pictures and rumors of just such a car have made the rounds of the Internet on occasion in the last few years . Both of those vehicles will reportedly be built at the company 's new Zuffenhausen electric car production facility , which is capable of churning out around 60,000 vehicles per year . ( Previously , Porsche has said it expects to sell around 20,000 Mission Es a year , giving it plenty of assembly line capacity for a high-end electric SUV . )
The biggest change to the Porsche lineup will come around the year 2022 , Blume said , when Porsche is expected to launch the next-generation Macan crossover . That SUV , he told the magazine , may be offered solely as an electric vehicle . Assuming the carmaker continues to crank out the Macan in the sort of numbers it has so far—it 's Porsche 's best-seller , with close to 100,000 copies sold last year—transforming it into an EV would go a long way towards helping the company reach the 50-percent-electric-car goal . Assuming , of course , that some of those current Macan buyers do n't ditch the model when it goes all Tesla .
Microsoft watchers have been poring over US Patent Office filings recently , coming up with a number of gems related to a new foldable “ Surface Phone ” device that Microsoft is apparently working on . One fan even used the patent drawings for the basis of some pretty inspiring looking renders , and we have to say we 're intrigued .
There 's no official word from Microsoft , of course , and undertaking one more leap into the waters of mobile competition with giants like Google and Apple seems almost ludicrous . Still , former Windows phone users and Microsoft fans continue to hold out hope for a new Surface Phone .
So , if one did become available , would you want one ? Take our poll below :

Purdue put the Big Ten on the map last season with an impressive campaign . Now , it 's Indiana 's turn to carry the torch into the postseason . The Hoosiers put together an impressive regular season campaign and pack one of the nation 's most potent offensive lineups , entering the weekend with a .305 batting average . Dustin DeMuth lead the offense with a .399 batting average , 19 doubles , five homers and 38 RBIs , while catcher Kyle Schwarber is a big-time bat in the middle of the lineup . Schwarber is hitting .374 with 10 doubles , 16 homers and 46 RBIs . Also keep an eye on Scott Donley , who 's hitting .352 with four homers and 52 RBIs , while Michael Basil and Sam Travis each have a tendency to get big hits . Both are hitting .308 , with Travis packing more of a powerful punch with eight homers and 48 RBIs . On the mound , sophomore right-handed pitcher Aaron Slegers is red-hot with a 1.93 ERA in 88 2/3 innings of work , while Joey DeNato ( 2.52 , 85 2/3 ) and Kyle Hart ( 3.01 , 83 2/3 ) both are quality arms to watch . Bullpen-wise , Scott Effross and Ryan Halstead have established themselves as two of the nation 's better relievers . Effross has a good arm and has made 25 appearances with a 2.13 ERA in 55 innings , while Halstead has made 23 appearances and has a 2.27 ERA and 10 saves in 35 2/3 innings of work . The big key for Indiana this weekend is getting good starts . This team can hit with the best of them , turning much of the attention to the pitching staff .
Austin Peay State
Austin Peay is one of the hottest teams in the postseason entering this weekend , riding a 15-game winning streak . It also received a boost last weekend when talented starting pitcher Lee Ridenhour finally returned from an injury . Ridenhour tossed 2 1/3 scoreless frames last weekend and for the season has a 2.22 ERA in 77 innings of work . From a pitching standpoint , also keep an eye on fellow starting pitchers Zach Hall and Casey Delgado . Neither have overly impressive numbers , but are more than serviceable with Delgado tallying 100 strikeouts so far this spring , and Hall having a 4.68 ERA in 82 2/3 innings of work . APSU has a strong bullpen with Tyler Rogers and Kacy Kemmer leading the way . Rogers has an astonishing 21 saves this season with a 1.83 ERA in 44 1/3 innings of work , while Kemmer has appeared in 32 games and has a 2.81 ERA in 51 1/3 innings . From an offensive standpoint , the Governors will enter the postseason with one of the nation 's better offensive attacks , hitting .315 as a team . Craig Massoni , Cody Hudson , Jordan Hankins and Reed Harper form quite the quartet . Massoni leads the team with a .388 average , 16 homers and 68 RBIs , Hudson 's hitting .365 with three homers and 38 RBIs , Hankins , a preseason All-American type of guy , is hitting .351 with 11 homers and 52 RBIs , and Harper is hitting .345 with six homers and 55 RBIs . APSU is n't your typical mid-major postseason team -- this team is very experienced in these situations .
Florida
Now that the Gators are in the NCAA Field of 64 , perhaps it 's time for some of the pressure to be relieved , and for this young team to finally play to their potential . The Gators have had a rather see-saw type of season , but that was to be expected with a hefty group of young players . Should the Gators escape the Bloomington Regional , their pitching staff will be a big reason why . UF has plenty of talented arms to work with this weekend . Right-handed ace pitcher Jonathon Crawford will be a high draft pick and has a low-90s fastball to go with a nice slider . He has a 4.03 ERA in 80 1/3 innings , along with 64 strikeouts and 33 walks . Meanwhile , Johnny Magliozzi ( 2.49 , 61 1/3 ) , Bobby Poyner ( 3.41 , 37 ) , Danny Young ( 4.28 , 40 IP ) and Eric Hanhold ( 5.88 , 33 2/3 ) are all potential starting pitchers . Bullpen-wise , keep an eye on Ryan Harris and Daniel Gibson . Harris has a big-time arm with an upper-90s fastball . He also has appeared in 35 games with a 2.75 ERA in 55 2/3 innings . Meanwhile , Gibson , a talented left-handed arm , has appeared in 30 games with a 4.26 ERA in 38 innings . Offensively , the Gators have the ability to be very solid , and to be pretty average . Richie Martin is an electric young player who 's hitting .304 with 18 RBIs , while Harrison Bader is hitting .304 with a home run and 22 RBIs . Vickash Ramjit and Taylor Gushue are two guys I 'd watch this weekend . Neither have an overly impressive batting average , but have power potential .
Valparaiso
Valparaiso is a true case of saving the best for last . Valpo entered the season expected to do some special things . But after an up and down regular season , the Crusaders put together quite an impressive run in the conference tournament . Valpo has a solid pitching staff entering the weekend with an excellent reliever to watch in Karch Kowalczyk . Kowalczyk has appeared in 22 games and has an 0.36 ERA and 12 saves in 25 innings of work . Meanwhile , keep an eye on starting pitching Cole Webb , who has made 14 starts and has a 3.59 ERA in 90 1/3 innings . He has struck out 54 and walked 25 , while teams are hitting him at a .285 clip . Offensively , the Crusaders certainly are n't going to blow you away with a .277 team batting average , but keep an eye on leading hitters Tanner Vavra and Chris Manning . Vavra is hitting .333 with 17 RBIs and Men is hitting .320 with three homers and 32 RBIs . Valparaiso is experienced in this setting , making last year 's Gary Regional , so keep an eye on them for an upset .

RENTON – The baseball cap was neon green and worn backwards .
Not that Christine Michael needed that to stand out . He was first in line among Seattle 's running backs , trying to put his best foot forward in this third chance at making a first impression as the Seahawks began their Organized Team Activities on Tuesday .
“ This is his time , ” coach Pete Carroll said after the workout . “ We 're going to push him in that regard . ”
Opportunities have been tough to come by for Michael in his first two years as a Seahawk . Opportunities , however , are what he will have plenty of between now and the start of the regular season . Robert Turbin is recovering from hip surgery and Marshawn Lynch is , well , he 's Marshawn Lynch , which means he 's not doing all that much in the team 's offseason program . Lynch wo n't be doing all that much in the team 's four preseason games , either , which leaves Michael ample opportunity .
“ He wants to be a front-line , first-line back , ” Carroll said , “ and he 's got tremendous talent and we 're going to see how it goes . With high expectations . ”
Yes , it 's time for the annual offseason feature about the potential emergence of Christine Michael . In fact , there 's a formula to it at this point .
Step 1 : Start by stating he was the fifth running back chosen in the 2013 draft , selected one pick after the Packers tabbed workhorse Eddie Lacy in the second round .
Step 2 : Mention Michael 's extraordinary combination of size and speed . At 221 pounds , he 's as big as any back on Seattle 's roster and faster than all of them .
Step 3 : Carefully point out that the 52 carries Michael has totaled in two NFL seasons are n't necessarily a criticism of him so much as a reflection of how productive Lynch has been as Seattle 's starter .
Step 4 : Mix in a few buzzwords like maturity and consistency when talking about Michael 's growth in his first two NFL seasons .
Add it all together and you 've got the quintessential NFL offseason story on a potential contributor who may be on the cusp of a breakout season .
Lynch is back this season after getting a big , fat raise , but he 's essentially on a year-to-year basis going forward . Michael is now midway through his rookie contract , and his future in Seattle will depend on whether he 's ready to grab hold of the opportunities that will come his way .
“ He 's an exciting back , ” Carroll said , “ and he 's so comfortable now . I ca n't imagine we do n't see him at his very best . ”
Just one question , then : Why have n't we seen him at his best before ? After all , under Carroll the Seahawks have thrived on giving opportunities to younger players even if they 're not ready to be starters .
Yet Michael did not dress the first five games last season , has carried more than five times in only two games in his career and has yet to score a touchdown . Lacy gets more carries in a month from Green Bay than Michael has gotten in two seasons .
Carroll was asked what has kept Michael from making a bigger impact so far .
“ Consistency , ” Carroll said . “ Just coming back . Have a good game and come on back and have another one . Stay with the workload , and handle the bumps and the bruises . ”
Michael had a hamstring injury that slowed him entering the regular season in 2014 . He also did n't do himself any favors with two fumbles in the preseason .
It 's too soon to say it will be different for Michael this season . In fact , you wo n't really know until August when the team starts playing preseason games and opponents start tackling .
“ You can see his assignments and his consistency here , ” Carroll said , “ but until we start playing football , at that position , you ca n't evaluate . ”
For now , there 's just Michael and his neon green hat and the hope that this year will be different .

Obama would snub VP offer from Hillary if asked Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday October 29 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Sen. Barack Obama ( D-IL ) said Monday he wouldnt accept a vice presidential slot should his rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton , defeat him in securing the Democratic partys nomination for president . Im not running for vice president ,  he said . I dont have intentions of being on the ticket as vice president. The candidate made his remarks during the webcast of a presidential dialogue co-sponsored by MTV and the website MySpace , which allowed Obama to field instant messages from viewers watching online . One question was about his willingness to run with Clinton. After initially saying it was too early to make those kinds of determinations , the senator was pressed by the events co-moderator , Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post , who specifically asked if he would serve as the vice presidential half of a Clinton-Obama ticket . No ,  he said . Im not running for vice president , Im running for president of the United States. The online discussion came as Obama seeks to turn up the pressure on Clinton , who continues to hold commanding leads in national polls . In recent comments to the New York Times , the candidate said he would be taking a harder line against his opponent , and admitted that his lack of assertiveness played a part in Clintons polling success . In an interview on Friday that was initiated by his campaign to signal the change of course , Mr. Obama said now is the time for him to distinguish himself from Mrs. Clinton ,  reported the Times . While he said that he was not out to kneecap the front-runner , because I dont think thats what the country is looking for ,  he said she was deliberately obscuring her positions for political gain and was less likely than he was to win back the White House for Democrats. Obama was also sharply critical of Sen. Clinton in an article published today in the Des Moines Register , in which he derided her for voting to approve a recent Senate resolution on Iran  a measure Obama says mirrors Clintons vote to authorize military action in Iraq . `` I think it 's important that we not provide any additional support for blank checks to a president and vice president that have shown no restraint whatsoever when it comes to our foreign policy , '' Obama told the paper . `` I think Senator Clinton has tried to straddle the line at times . '' A tape of the Obama event , which was broadcast from Coe College in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , will air tonight on the MTV network .

Skype For Android Exposes Private User Data
These days , protecting one 's personal data online is a major concern to almost everyone . If you 're not looking out for threats to your identity and private data , you have n't been paying attention .
Yet somehow , in the midst of all of this , Skype , one of the most popular apps for Android ( and otther ) devices has left a significant security leak on the phones of every user who has downloaded their Android app - all 10 million of them ! ( The exception to this appears to be the Skype Mobile for Verizon app , which was not found to carry the vulnerability . ) Our good friend Justin Case at AndroidPolice has discovered this exploit while digging around under the hood of the Skype app . And frankly , this is not at all a subtle , or hidden flaw .
Where Skype Messed Up
In the course of its day-to-day operations , Skype saves a variety of your data to a folder , which bears the same name as your Skype username , on your SD card . Unfortunately , they appear to have overlooked a fundamental step in the process : setting proper permissions for this folder , leaving all of its contents open and accessible to everyone and any app on your phone . Oh , and they did n't bother to encrypt the data either .
If you 're interested in the technical detail , take a look at the file structure of that folder , below . The .db files are sqlite3 databases . For those uninitiated into Unix arcana , the `` -rw-rw-rw- '' at the beginning of each file listing indicates that anyone can read from or write to this file .
# ls -l /data/data/com.skype.merlin_mecha/files/jcaseap

How Bad is This , Really ?
What is the data that 's stored in this open , unencrypted folder ? Let 's start with a few minor details on display in the main.db file , like your full name , date of birth , phone numbers , email address , your bio , etc . ( in the Accounts Table ) . And , in the Contacts Table , we can peek at all the parallel information on everyone in your contact list . And moving on to the Chat 's Table , you can see - yep , you guessed it : all your instant messages .
What 's the Danger in All This , Really ?
But , this is all on my phone , and therefore my data remains in my hands , right ? Not exactly . The fact that your data is unencrypted , in an open-standard database , in an unsecure folder , means that any app you install could potentially access all of this information , and then phone home , sending it all to the creator of this rogue app .
But They 'd Need the Name of the Folder , Would n't They ?
In order to find one 's way into this folder , they 'd need your unique username ( which , as we said , is also the name of the folder ) . Luckily for the rogue app developer , and unlucky for you , Skype made this easy , by storing your username in a fixed location . So anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Unix commands can find your username and the path to the data store :
# ls -l /data/data/com.skype.merlin_mecha/files/shared.xml
-rw-rw-rw- app_152 app_152 56136 2011-04-13 00:07 shared.xml
# grep Default /data/data/com.skype.merlin_mecha/files/shared.xml

How Realistic is it For Someone to Write an App Like This ?
After discovering the privacy hole , Justin was kind enough to take the time to show just how easy it actually is to exploit , by writing and putting out a Proof of Concept app . { We link to this app strictly for informational and educational purposes , and to encourage the folks at Skype to do something about fixing this before someone with less integrity than Justin or us decides to do something with it . } Install and run this app on any Android phone { read : does n't need to be rooted } with Skype installed , and take a look at some ( not all ) of the info available to be harvested . A less scrupulous hacker could be sitting back and gathering all the personal information which would come pouring in . ( Fortunately there is no credit card information stored in this folder . )
Here 's a video demonstration of what it does :
Justin 's Proof of Concept App Demonstrates The Skype Privacy Leak
What is Skype Going to Do About It ?
It took a day , but at time of writing of this article , Skype had acknowledged the flaw in the program in their privacy blog :
It has been brought to our attention that , were you to install a malicious third-party application onto your Android device , then it could access the locally stored Skype for Android files .
These files include cached profile information and instant messages . We take your privacy very seriously and are working quickly to protect you from this vulnerability , including securing the file permissions on the Skype for Android application .
To protect your personal information , we advise users to take care in selecting which applications to download and install onto their device .
As usual , check back to this space for more security updates on this and other Android apps . And I 'll be interested to hear what your next move will be . Are you uninstalling Skype from your phone ? Or are you simply going to be more careful in screening other apps you install , to avoid a rogue app that will take advantage of the weakness ? Feel free to comment below and let us know .

Outside Southeast Asia , few people know of Palembang , a city on Sumatra , the sixth largest island in the world . A gloomy and immense city , with almost two million inhabitants , most of them living in cramped and squalid conditions .
The tropical River Musi bisects the city , a desperately polluted waterway , bordered by slums built on stilts and a few old colonial buildings .
Vessels of all types use the Musi , hauling everything that can be sold abroad or to the rest of Indonesia . The river is jammed with enormous barges filled with coal , oil tankers , makeshift boats carrying palm oil fruit bunches , as well as countless ships carrying timber .
Plunder is done openly ; there is no attempt to conceal it .
Ms. Isna Wijayani , a Professor at Bina Darma University in Palembang , laments on the situation .
“ There is no primary forest left in a wide area around Palembang , ” she says . “ However , illegal logging does n't get reported in the local media . It is because powerful forces , including police and the army ( TNI ) are involved or directly behind much of the illegal logging and other profitable commercial activities in South Sumatra . ”
Bina Darma University invited me to speak on the manipulation of the Indonesian media by the West . I was asked to address some 100 selected students and lecturers from the region . What followed was an hour-long discussion , during which I clearly understood how little is known , even among the local students and teachers , about the dire environmental situation in their part of the world .
“ We have no idea about the extent of deforestation around here , ” explained Ms. Lina , a student .
Ms. Ayu Lexy , a graduate student , was somewhat more knowledgeable on the subject : “ I think Donald Trump is crazy , claiming that there is no global warming . The effects of it are clearly felt here . ”
Just as I had done several years ago , I rented a makeshift speedboat and instructed the captain to take me around the delta to Upang , a village more than one hour of literally ‘ flying ' over the murky waters from Palembang .
There was the Pusri plant , producer of fertilizers , one of the largest in Southeast Asia , belching smoke and spewing an unbearable stench into the air . Right across the water , surrounded by slums , a wood-processing plant was emitting yet another very distinct odor . Local children were swimming nearby , clearly oblivious to health hazards .
Later , a former top executive of Pusri , Mr. Reza Esfan , confessed to me : “ We create pollution , of course , although we try to minimize it . I ca n't deny that unsavory odor is emitted… Obviously , Pusri 's mistake was that they did n't purchase the land surrounding their plants . Now , if we have a leak , then the community sues us… ”
Naturally , not a word about the suffering of the communities…
At Kapitan village , several women were washing their clothes in the filthy river water , and then brushing their teeth in it .
“ Why should n't we be washing ourselves and brushing our teeth in clean water , ” a village woman said . “ We ca n't spend our money on such luxuries ! Anyway , the river water is free , and it is clean . ”
As the woman spoke , a grotesquely swollen carcass of a dog passed slowly by in the water just a few meters away .
The C.D.C . report said that “ much of antibiotic use in animals is unnecessary and inappropriate and makes everyone less safe. ” Then in December , the Food and Drug Administration announced a plan to curtail the use of antibiotics in animals .
Meat producers use antibiotics to prevent sickness in animals that are raised in close quarters in industrial farming operations . Chickens are treated , for example , with a small dose of gentamicin while still in ovo in an effort to prevent infection through a tiny hole made when the egg is administered a drug that prevents Marek 's disease and infectious bursal disease , highly infectious viral diseases that can wipe out flocks .
Antibiotics also are incorporated into feed commonly used by large producers to help animals grow faster and use feed more efficiently .
But producers are aware of the consumer demand for antibiotic-free meat . Bell & Evans , a smaller producer , has worked with its feed supplier to incorporate oregano into the kibble it feeds its chickens to act as a replacement for antibiotics , and Tyson last year started a line of chicken marketed under the label NatureRaised Farm , which is raised cage-free on a vegetarian diet without antibiotics .
Chick-fil-A already uses chicken breasts free from fillers , additives and steroids .
Rob Dugas , vice president for supply chain management at Chick-fil-A , said the shift would take time because it required changes by producers from the hatchery to the processing plant . “ For instance , any flock treated with antibiotics today is aggregated into the larger production facility , ” Mr. Dugas said . “ For us , birds will have to be segregated all the way down to the egg production . ”
Chick-fil-A executives said they could not say yet whether the changes would result in a price increase for consumers . Typically , antibiotic-free chicken is more expensive than traditionally processed poultry .
“ We do know that it has a potential cost ramification , both to us and to our customers , ” Mr. Tassopoulos said . “ We are going to do everything we can to minimize the impact on the price of our products , and the growing interest in antibiotic-free meat may help with that by increasing supplies . ”
In her dissent in today 's contraception ruling , Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg notes that “ the exercise of religion is characteristic of natural persons , not artificial legal entities. ” That used to be true .
For all the years of jokes about corporations being people , the United States has never actually seen corporations as being capable of exercising their own personal faith . Indeed , the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals explained last year that courts have “ long recognized the distinction between the owners of a corporation and the corporation itself. ” Ruling that “ a for-profit corporation can engage in religious exercise ” would “ eviscerate the fundamental principle that a corporation is a legally distinct entity from its owners . ”
But in today 's Hobby Lobby ruling , the court 's conservative majority makes the opposite assumption . Justice Alito wrote :
“ Protecting the free-exercise rights of closely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control them . ”
This is made almost in passing , as if it were n't especially important , but it 's worth pausing to appreciate what this sentence actually says . Alito believe corporations have the right to exercise religious beliefs – and that right demands protection . It 's as if the court majority takes it as a given that a corporation , and not the literal people in it , can attend worship services , pray , contemplate moral quandaries , read scriptural texts , and reach spiritual conclusions .
On literally the same page of the ruling , Alito added , “ No conceivable definition of ‘ person ' includes natural persons and non-profit corporations , but not for-profit corporations . ”
Right , because what 's needed when defining “ person ” is more corporations , not fewer .
Alito added , “ Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law . ”
Wait , what ?
There are experts in this area who can speak to this with far greater authority than I can – such experts should certainly weigh in by way of the comments section – but as I understand it , corporate law has actually said the exact opposite .
In fact , the Constitutional Accountability Center 's Doug Kendall specifically noted in a press statement , “ For the first time in our nation 's history , the Supreme Court has ruled that for-profit corporations have religious rights and have accorded them religious exemptions . Despite their attempts to qualify that ruling , it opens the floodgates to claims by corporations for religious exemptions . ”
It 's worth noting , of course , that the court apparently wants to keep those floodgates closed . Alito is fairly explicit on this point , saying , “ [ O ] ur decision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate ” and does not apply to corporations that may raise religious objections to “ vaccinations and blood transfusions . ”
By what reasoning do the five conservatives conclude that a Corporate Person 's objections to contraception are more legitimate than a Corporate Person 's objections to blood transfusions ? They never got around to explaining that . It 's simply true because Alito says it 's true . Maybe blood transfusions would also be in trouble if such a case reaches the high court in the future , maybe not .
As Ryan Grim summarized , “ The Court has basically just given up any attempt at coherence . It 's just raw power . ”
There 's a haunting and strangely beautiful quality to Toronto 's abandoned and derelict places that makes for fantastic photography . Maybe it 's due to the faded signs of life , and the grass and wild flowers slowly reclaiming the man-made objects , or maybe its the sense of silence and privacy .
Snapped a few days ago at sunset by photographer Peter Muzyka and uploaded to the blogTO Flickr pool , these graffiti-covered and seemingly mothballed TTC vehicles near the commission 's Wilson Subway Yard do , apparently , serve a purpose .
`` I was going through Downsview many , many times and I always saw those objects from far , far away and I was n't sure what they were at the time until someone mentioned it , '' explains Russian expat Muzyka . `` You can see them from the window of the train [ between Downsview and Wilson ] . ''
To get inside the fenced-off area , Muzyka sweet-talked friends at the Wilson yard into letting him inside for a few hours while they performed maintenance . Though technically part of the complex , the field containing the vehicles is actually some distance from any active tracks .
`` It was quite surreal because usually you do n't see a train or bus in that kind of setting . Usually you see them in concrete with people around and all that . Here , it was quite a contrast because you see them in a really beautiful field . There were lots of different flowers there , such as camomile flowers , and the bus was basically sinking in this tall , beautiful grass . ''
According to Brad Ross , executive director of corporate communications at the TTC , the H2 H4 series subway cars and city bus are used by Toronto Police Service for training exercises , though the undisturbed brush around the vehicles suggests no-one has been by for some time . Inside , a thin layer of gray-white dust coats the seats and floor .
Muzyka estimates the cars last saw use in 2001 , gauging by dates on promotional material left inside . The last H4 subway train made its final ride on the Bloor-Danforth line in January of this year .
`` It was quite nostalgic for me because I actually came to Canada in 2001 . It was like they were taken from the past and frozen in time . ''

According to our latest research , the global military support vehicles market is expected to reach $ 3.43 billion by 2019 , an increase of over $ 400 million from 2014 .
According to our latest research , the global military support vehicles market is expected to reach $ 3.43 billion by 2019 , an increase of over $ 400 million from 2014 . The rising tension between countries in the Middle East and the Americas , border disputes in the Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) , and increasing incidences of terrorist activities have led to increased demand for modernized systems and technologies that can be put to use in the defense sector .
Military support vehicles perform support mission tasks . These vehicles are categorized into three types :
Heavy vehicles ( 46 % market share ) : These are capable of carrying payloads that weigh more than 10 tons . These include the family of heavy tactical vehicles ( FHTV ) , heavy equipment movers , and wheeled tank transporters .
Medium vehicles ( 35 % market share ) : These can carry payloads like the family of medium tactical vehicles ( FMTV ) and transport cargo that weighs 2.7 to seven tons . They are also used to carry troops across dangerous areas .
Light vehicles ( 19 % market share ) : These can carry less than two tons of payload and five to six personnel .
Defense budget cuts slowing growth in the Americas
North and South America make up 50 % of the global military support vehicles market , largely due to the United States . In 2011 , the United States spent more on military and defense than the 13 next highest spending nations combined . However , the America 's region is currently experiencing sluggish growth due to defense budget cuts from many countries including the United States .
In 2013 , there were 45 brigade combat teams ( BCTs ) in the Americas , which included 552,100 soldiers . By 2015 , it is expected to have 32 BCTs , which includes 490,000 soldiers . This number corresponds to a reduction of 11 % in troop numbers and 29 % in BCTs .

Large growth expected in APAC
The global military support vehicle market is growing the fastest in the APAC region where the growth is six times larger annually than in the America 's . Emerging markets such as China , Japan , and India are continuously increasing their defense budgets year-on-year for enhanced national security .
In 2014 , the defense budget of China was $ 131.5 billion , which showed an increase of 12.2 % from that in 2013 . India is the largest defense importer and accounts for 15 % of the global deals in this sector .
In 2012 , Australia was the third largest contributor to the defense budget in APAC . The Australian army has plans to acquire 1,800 lightweight trailers , 2,000 lightweight security vehicles , and more than 400 armored medium and heavy vehicles .
In 2012 , Singapore 's defense budget was $ 9.53 billion . The country is focusing on the development of modern military equipment . The army also has plans for the acquisition and replacement of its existing vehicles with light vehicles such as the M113 Armored Personal Carrier and the Bionix armored fighting vehicle ( AFV ) .
In 2014 , India 's defense budget was $ 40 billion , which was approximately 7 % higher than that in 2013 . This step was taken for the development of army forces such as ground vehicles and their equipment . In 2015 , Tata Motors received an order worth $ 136 million for the development of 1,200 multi-axle trucks , which will be used for the transportation of spares , ammunition pallets , and other equipment . In addition , the Indian Army ordered 2,071 Maruti Suzuki Gypsy vehicles , which can act as all-purpose vehicles .
Raised as a Catholic , Appaden told me that he discovered Randi in 2010 , when he watched the magician in an online TED talk discussing homeopathy . At the time Appaden was a student at a Christian college , struggling with his faith ; two years later , during Randi 's first visit to India , he took a 13-hour bus ride across the country to see Randi in person . “ It literally changed my life , ” he told me , and explained that he now hopes to help teach skepticism in Indian schools .
The magician looked small and frail , lost in the folds of his striped dress shirt , leaning on his cane , but he mugged gamely for every acolyte . For many of his most zealous followers , the opportunity to meet Randi at TAM may be as close as they will ever come to a religious experience . “ It 's an obligation , it 's a very heavy obligation , ” he said . “ I ca n't stand one person being turned away and not being given the same attention that others have been given . ”
A few days before the conference , I visited Randi at his home , in Plantation , Fla . The modest octagonal house was almost hidden from the street by a lush garden of finger palms , elephant ears and paperbark trees . As we sat upstairs , surrounded by some 4,000 books — arranged alphabetically by subject , from alchemy , astrology , Atlantis and the Bermuda Triangle to tarot , U.F.O.s and witchcraft — he said that he disliked being called a debunker . He prefers to describe himself as a scientific investigator . He elaborated : “ Because if I were to start out saying , ‘ This is not true , and I 'm going to prove it 's not true , ' that means I 've made up my mind in advance . So every project that comes to my attention , I say , ‘ I just do n't know what I 'm going to find out . ' That may end up — and usually it does end up — as a complete debunking . But I do n't set out to debunk it . ”
Born Randall James Zwinge in 1928 , Randi began performing as a teenager in the 1940s , touring with a carnival and working table to table in the nightclubs of his native Toronto . Billed as The Great Randall : Telepath , he had a mind-reading act , and also specialized in telling the future . In 1949 he made local headlines for a trick in which he appeared to predict the outcome of the World Series a week before it happened , writing the result down , sealing it an envelope and giving it to a lawyer who opened and read it to the press after the series concluded . But no matter how many times he assured his audiences that such stunts were a result of subterfuge and legerdemain , he found there were always believers . They came up to him in the street and asked him for stock tips ; when he insisted that he was just a magician , they nodded — but winked and whispered that they knew he was truly psychic . Once he understood the power he had over his audience , and how easily he could exploit their belief in the supernatural to make money , it frightened him : “ To have deceived people like that . . . that 's a terrible feeling , ” he said .
He turned instead to escapology — as The Amazing Randi : The Man No Jail Can Hold — and feats of endurance . He broke a record for his 55-minute stint encased in ice , and bested the time his hero Houdini had spent trapped in a coffin on the bottom of the swimming pool at the Hotel Shelton in Manhattan . But Randi never forgot the believers , and how susceptible they were to exploitation by those who lacked his scruples . And so , as his reputation as a magician grew , he also began to campaign against spiritualists and psychics . In 1964 , as a guest on a radio talk show , he offered $ 1,000 of his own money in a challenge to anyone who could show scientific evidence of supernatural powers . Soon afterward , he began broadcasting his own national radio show dedicated to discussion of the paranormal . He bought a small house in Rumson , N.J. , and installed a sign outside that announced randi — charlatan . He lived there alone , with a pair of talking birds and a kinkajou named Sam . Although Randi had known he was gay since he was a teenager , he kept that to himself . “ I had to conceal it , you know , ” he told me . “ They would n't have had a known homosexual working in the radio station . This was a day when you had to keep it completely hidden . ”
During the late '60s and early '70s , popular interest in the paranormal grew : There was a fascination with extrasensory perception and the Bermuda Triangle and best sellers like “ Chariots of the Gods , ” which claimed Earth 's ancient civilizations were visited by aliens . There were mystics , mind-readers and psychic surgeons , who were said to be able to extract tumors from their patients using only their bare hands — and without leaving a mark . Randi continued on his crusade . Few of his fellow illusionists were interested in exposing the way that conjuring tricks were used to dupe gullible audiences into believing in psychic abilities . “ Everybody else just kind of rolled their eyes , ” Penn Jillette , a good friend of Randi 's , told me . “ 'Why is Randi spending all this time doing this ? We all know there is no ESP . It 's just stupid people believe it , and that 's fine . ' ”
Randi kept up his $ 1,000 challenge — and eventually increased it to $ 10,000 — but found few takers . Then in 1973 , he met the nemesis who would define his struggle : Uri Geller , who had recently arrived in the United States from Israel . Geller was a charismatic 26-year-old former paratrooper who performed mind-reading feats similar to those with which Randi baffled audiences as a young mentalist . But Geller said that his powers were real and also claimed to have psychokinetic abilities : He could bend spoons , he said , using only his mind . His supposed gifts were studied by a pair of parapsychology researchers at Stanford Research Institute , who were persuaded that some of them , at least , were genuine . Randi told me that he met Geller soon afterward . “ Very flamboyant , ” he recalled venomously . “ Very charming . Likable , beautiful , affectionate , genuine , forward-going , Handsome — everything ! ” His manner , Randi explained , was the key to the techniques employed by Geller and others like him . “ That 's why they call them con men . Because they gain the confidence of the victim — and then they fool ‘ em . ”
In theory , this is a great item . Unfortunately , I am on my third one , and I still do n't have the awesome stool that I was hoping for . The first was ordered from Amazon . Once assembled , it did not roll very far until the one side started to drag on the floor . Upon inspection I noted that that the base was n't perfectly round , having been damaged in shipping . I called Cramer , and their customer service was very helpful , and they offered to send a replacement right away , as well as a larger box so that I could return the assembled one that I now have . The delivery came quickly , and the condition of the boxed stool was laughable . Totally crushed on one side , as was the stool base inside . I did not bother to assemble this one , and called Cramer again . Same person apologized and said that this sometimes happens , but that they ship these things all the time , and she 'd be happy to ship another , and that maybe this one could be double boxed . That one came today - same single box as the first two , and while it is the best of the three , it is still out of balance , and one side definitely hangs lower than the rest of it , affecting it 's ability to scoot in anything but a right hand curve .
So , this stool is a lovely idea . It appears to be made from quality materials , with sturdy springs and such . I have seen them in other places , and they are usually easy to use , and helpful to have around . The problem with receiving one through the mail is that they come in a simple cardboard box , which is not built to withstand the rigors of the delivery system of FedEx or UPS . I feel silly calling again to have yet ANOTHER one sent to me , but on the other hand , I spent fifty bucks on a stool so that it would be awesome . This is not awesome . This is just a wonky rolling stool . It 's okay .
If MCPHS University 's nursing program does not correct problems , the state could withdraw its approval .
The nursing program at MCPHS University in Boston was given a formal warning from the state after students ' sagging scores on the nursing licensure exam triggered a review that uncovered larger problems , documents show .
State officials believe the school has run afoul of regulations regarding oversight , instructor qualifications , and student evaluations in the nursing program , according to a letter sent to the school by the state .
Regulators from the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing gave the school three deadlines , most recently June 2017 , to submit material showing its progress to correct the issues , and they recently revisited the school , according to the state .

The review is ongoing . If the university does not correct the problems , the state could withdraw its approval of the program , which last fall had 327 students .

The nursing program is the second one at the Fenway-based health sciences university that recently has been put on notice by regulatory agencies .
The Globe reported last week that the doctor of pharmacy program was placed on probation by accreditors in June .
School administrators acknowledged the nursing program 's status on Monday and said they are working to correct the problems , which were first cited by the state in December .
“ Our goal is to have the warning status removed within the next academic year , and we believe we are on track , ” said MCPHS University provost George Humphrey , in a statement . He said the university expects state regulators will report their findings to the school in the fall .

MCPHS University , previously called the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences , has about 7,000 students . It is best known for its pharmacy program but now offers a host of other health care degree programs at its campuses in Boston , Worcester , and Manchester , N.H .
Financial rating agencies have given the school strong marks , but it relies almost entirely on student tuition for revenue .
The school has significantly increased enrollment in recent years , from 1,737 in 2000 to 6,674 in 2014 , according to Moody 's Investor Service .
MCPHS University offers several nursing degrees in Worcester and Manchester , but only the Boston accelerated bachelor of science in nursing degree was warned .
The state review of that program was triggered by a consistently low rate of graduates passing the professional nursing licensure exam , known as the NCLEX-RN . When state regulators reviewed the school , however , they cited 11 areas where the Boston program fell short of the state regulations that govern nursing schools .

A three-page letter from Angela M. MacDonald , the state nursing education coordinator , listed the areas and asked the school to submit certain documents and monthly reports of its progress to correct the problems .
‘ Our goal is to have the warning status removed within the next academic year , and we believe we are on track . ' George Humphrey , MCPHS University provost
According to the state letter , the nursing school fell short in each of the five broad categories of state regulations for such schools . Those categories are program mission and governance , faculty qualifications , students , curriculum , and resources .
The letter does not say exactly what problems regulators found but cites the regulations in question . One has to do with the educational qualifications of professors and another is the requirement that all admitted students possess a high school diploma or equivalent and be immunized .
The letter also cites a regulation that requires written agreements with agencies where students do clinical learning , and another that says faculty shall evaluate students ' academic progress .
A spokesman for the state nursing board said on Monday that the school has been “ very responsive ” and met the monthly benchmarks described in the letter .
The university responded to questions from the Globe with the statement from Humphrey . The provost acknowledged that the review was triggered by sub-par scores on the licensure exam . The state requires nursing schools to maintain a pass rate of 80 percent or higher for first-time test takers .
The state publishes exam pass rates for all Massachusetts nursing schools online , which show that in 2016 the pass rate for MCPHS 's Boston nursing program was 68 percent . In 2015 it was 73 percent and in 2014 it was 76 percent . In 2013 , it was 55 percent , according to the state . The MCPHS scores for the Worcester program are consistently higher .
In his statement , Humphrey stressed that the warning does not pertain to the post-baccalaureate program in Boston or the Worcester or Manchester nursing programs . All nursing graduates are still eligible to take the licensure exam , he said .
Humphrey said the three-year program in Boston places 98 percent of its graduates in nursing jobs within a year of graduation . It remains accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education .
Tuition for the three-year accelerated nursing program in Boston , which accepts high school graduates and prepares them to be nurses , is $ 45,750 per year , including the summer semester .
There are eight other nursing programs in Massachusetts on “ approval with warning ” status , according to the state .
Meanwhile the school 's signature pharmacy degree program , the doctor of pharmacy on the Boston campus , remains on academic probation by its accreditors because of overcrowded buildings and not enough professors . It is working to correct those problems as well , school officials said last week .
Pharmacy students said the university 's Longwood campus is so crowded it is hard to find a space in the library to study .

It 's Party Time at the Chess Olympiad
By Frederic Friedel
Chess is hard , chess involves a huge amount of study and preparation , chess is often tedious , staid and boring . Some chess players , too , can be defined in the same way . But certainly not all of them . Most are quite affable , good-natured people who know how to enjoy life . How to have a good time when they are not brooding over a chessboard . Some are veritable party animals .
As fate would have it , at the chess Olympiads there are many parties . Every other day some team , usually from Africa or the Caribbeans , will throw one . It involves throbbing music and alcoholic drinks , and is inevitably well-attended by members of the 150 or so national teams that are participating in the Olympiad .

The Bermuda Party
The highlight of every recent Chess Olympiad , from the entertainment and night-life point of view , has been The Bermuda Party . It is the supernova big-bang celebration , and has escalated from a wild , noisy affair to one with multiple imported bands which play throbbing bass-heavy music until well into the dawn . For obvious reasons The Party it is held on the eve of a free day , so the participants have a good 36 hours to recover from its mind-numbing after-effects . Incidentally , in Turin a tour to Venice had been arranged for the free day – the party attendees simply got onto the early morning bus and slept on the six-hour ride to the city of canals .
The host of the Bermuda party in proper evening attire
One interesting aspect of the Bermuda Party is that on the day before it is held a very large number of chess wives arrive at the Olympiad , ostensibly because they do not wish to miss the great action , but certainly in many cases to make sure their husbands do not have to go through the ordeal all by themselves . The same applies for female players , with the chess husbands or boyfriends arriving in time to chaperone the ladies to the party .
The Bermuda party is the entertainment high point of every Olympiad

The Incident
What transpired at this year 's Bermuda Party is described as accurately as possible further below . We held back for a while with this report , at the explicit request of the English team , who was worried about the effect a massive world-wide exposure would have on some of those involved . We complied , although the story was juicy and , equally important , offered us the opportunity of publishing a lot of pictures of attractive female players .
In the meantime the news of The Incident has made the broadsheets all over the world , which suddenly discovered a passionate interest for chess . The story was quickly dubbed `` Gormallygate '' and , according to The Guardian , is `` probably the best thing to have happened to this much-mocked pastime in a generation . '' And the chess blogs , naturally , went wild over it , reporting on a day-by-day , sometimes hour-by-hour basis . For them this became the main topic of the 2006 Olympiad , sweeping their web pages clean of chess . Some of them really need to get a life .
Arianne Caoili , playing for Australia at the Turin Olympiad
So let 's get to the facts . At the heart of the story is Arianne Caoili , Women 's International Master playing on board three of the Australian team , rated 2169 on the FIDE list . Arianne , who will turn 20 this December , is of Filipino-Australian-Dutch extraction . She is also a bit of a glamour starlet ( see the special section below ) , and an aspiring singer .
Levon Aronian in action , before the incident with Gormally
At the Bermuda party , which she attended at the arm of German GM Arkadij Naiditsch , Arianne at some stage started to dance with Levon Aronian , the world 's number three player and top board of the Armenian team . The dance , she told us later , was neither close nor sexy , and Aronian an old friend whom she has known since she was eight or ten . `` There is no romantic link between us , '' she said .
Aronian in action – the super-GM at the Bermuda party
The dance with Aronian , however , incurred the wrath of – well not GM Naiditsch , but Daniel Gormally , a 30-year-old grandmaster , Elo 2554 , who plays on board four for England . Danny knew Arianne only casually ( `` there is no romatic link , '' she told us once again ) , but the sight of the superstar dancing with his beautiful acquaintance resulted in a surge of jealousy in the Brit . He lunged at Aronian and sent the surprised GM sprawling on the dance floor .
Gormally 's action was fairly harmless , but he had violated one of the basic laws of nature and evolution , which says : never attack an Armenian . Immediately a random countryman of Aronian , whom we shall call GM X ( and who happens to be a reserve player on the US team , rated 2575 ) , rushed forward with murder in his eyes . Figuratively speaking , we believe .
Fortuitously , at this point another grandmaster , a muscle-bound man of superhuman strength , whom we shall call GM Y , intervened energetically in order to prevent the situation from escalating any further . He pinned Gormally to the wall with one hand , while fending off GM X with the other . There was an emergency exit close by , and GM Y quickly popped Gormally out into the fresh air , while making sure that the vengeance-seeking GM X remained in the party room . During the scuffle the wife of Dutch GM Jan Timman took a light grazing blow to the chin – nothing serious , but it left her in tears and in need of comforting . This act of kindness , too , was absolved by GM Y . In case you are wondering : no phone booth , cape or Clark Kent glasses were involved .
The whole incident was dismissed a few days later by Arianne 's mother Annette as `` a storm in a teacup '' . We too had the feeling that everyone , except the newspapers and blogs , wanted to forget the incident as quickly as possible . Levon himself was completely unfazed when we spoke to him the next day . `` Nothing happened , '' he said , implying it was just a minor dance-hall scuffle . Of course the laws of nature and evolution are not so casual about these things : later that day Gormally was confronted by a group of Armenians , who roughed him up a little . Danny decided enough was enough and returned to England . Aronian went on to win his next game in great style , and then take the Gold Medal with his team .

And now , before you fill our feedback inbox with thousands of emails , here is the solution to the obvious puzzler : the Superman Grandmaster Y was none other then our mild-spoken commentator , the man who brought you the live Playchess multimedia coverage from the Chess Olympiad in Turin . Yep , Yasser Seirawan , who it turns out has muscles of steel ( we felt ! ) and has been trained not just in the Marshall but in the martial arts . Ask him to tell you about this hidden part of his personality the next time he is doing a multimedia broadcast on Playchess.com .

Would you like to read something funny ? The very intriguing Judge Richard A. Posner has issued another order [ PDF ] , and it 's another little spanking of Apple in the Apple v. Motorola patent litigation case , the one he dismissed with prejudice on June 22 . If only all judges were as astute about patents ! Some are , of course . In fact , a judge in the UK just ruled that HTC does n't infringe Apple 's slide to unlock patent , as there is prior art from the Swedish phone Neonode N1 . This is the same stupid patent Judge Posner mocked , I believe ( `` Apples .. argument is that ' a tap is a zero-length swipe . ' Thats silly . Its like saying that a point is a zero-length line . `` ) , and it 's definitely the same one that just got Apple an injunction for now on the Nexus , BBC News reports : Apple has previously defended its slide-to-unlock patent in other disputes against Samsung , HTC and Google 's Motorola unit with some success . Most recently a US court ruled the patent was valid in a dispute that led to a sales ban being imposed on the Google-branded Nexus smartphone . So maybe in time , reason will prevail . But probably not initiated by Apple , as I 'll show what they 've been up to after the dismissal , according to Judge Posner , who was not amused . Or maybe he was . I am .
Here 's the order , which arose because after the judge dismissed the case with prejudice , Apple tried a workaround , trying to salvage two of its patents from sudden death against Motorola : UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT
OF ILLINOIS EASTERN DIVISION ________________ APPLE INC. and NeXT SOFTWARE
INC. ( f/k/a NeXT COMPUTER , INC. ) , Plaintiffs , v. MOTOROLA , INC. and MOTOROLA
MOBILITY , INC. , Defendants . ____________ No . 1:11-cv-08540 Judge Richard A. Posner . ORDER OF JUNE 26 , 2012 The case having been dismissed , I am not at all sure that I have jurisdiction to issue this order ! Anyway it really isnt an order , but merely a comment on an email . The email is from Apple and concerns the judgment of dismissal with prejudice that I directed be entered on June 22 , 2012 . Much of the email is taken up with rulings that I made in the course of the litigation . On appeal from a final judgment a party can seek appellate review of any interlocutory ruling that has not been rendered moot by the final judgment . There is no occasion for specifying those rulings in the judgment itself . Apple refers to a January 19 , 2012 , email in which it said it will movenot that it was movingto sever its claims relating to alleged infringement by Motorola of two patents , the 721 and the 983 , and to stay further action on them in this litigation , pending the Federal Circuits resolution of an appeal involving the same patents in a suit between Apple and HTC . Apple v. HTC , No . 2012-1025 ( Fed . Cir . filed Dec. 29 , 2011 ) . ( HTC , like Motorola , is a manufacturer of cell phones that use the Google-developed Android operating system . ) The exact language of the January 19 email , so far as pertinent to severance and stay , is : Apple will move pursuant to Fed . R. Civ . P. 21 to either sever its infringement claims as to U.S. Patent Nos . 5,481,721 and 6,275,983 , and/or to stay resolu- tion of those claims pending the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuits resolution of a pending appeal involving the 721 and 983 patents. Notice that the email does not commit to sever ( and/or to stay ( emphasis added ) ) . The email itself was thus not a motion for a severance or for a stay , and I took no action in response to it . That was five months ago and until yesterday , June 25 , I had not heard a further peep from Apple about these two patents . I assumed it had abandoned its claims . Apple indicates in its email that it wants me to sever those patent claims and stay action on them . Coyly , it still has not filed a motion to sever , as required by Fed . R. Civ . P. 21 . The informal suggestion in the January 19 email , never followed up , of a possible future motion to sever the two patents did not survive the entry of final judgment . Keeton v. Morningstar , Inc. , 667 F.3d 877 , 88283 ( 7th Cir . 2012 ) . At the hearing on June 7 , I indicated my tentative decision to dismiss the entire case , yet that did not trigger a motion to sever the 721 and 983 patent claims either . That decision became final on June 22 . By its inaction , which given the quality and resources of Apples legal team I must assume is strategic , Apple has forfeited any right to a severance . June 26 , 2012 [ Signature of Richard A Posner ]
United States Circuit Judge 2 Do n't you love the word `` coyly '' ? He misses not much , like Judge William Alsup in the Oracle v. Google litigation . Judges are definitely beginning to notice that they are being used not to resolve real legal issues , but as a proxy for a competition struggle , and I do n't think they much care for it . Judge Posner said the US patent system is `` dysfunctional '' . When judges start to say things like that , the tide can begin to turn . It reminds me a little of Righthaven-style copyright infringement business plans that at first seemed to be working , making a list of gazillions of anonymous infringers at once and asking the courts for their names prior to identifying who actually was or was n't infringing because it was cheaper than suing them individually , until judges began to figure out what it was all really about and shut it down hard . Patents are trickier , and Apple is n't Righthaven , but slide to unlock ? Apple wants to shut down an entire product line over slide to unlock ? Are they kidding ? Hopefully , somebody will show the judge who just ruled the patent viable that there is prior art . Finally , please do watch Dan Ravicher of PubPat 's video of a talk he gave at Google in April about patents , why they are such a mess , and what we can do , including helping find prior art . He explains what he has found to be the most useful way to go about finding prior art , patent mapping , which he explains at around the 49:00 mark . Those of you who regularly help in our deep dives into prior art searching at Groklaw may find it useful to add this skill to your repertoire .
Late yesterday morning , Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) turned to Twitter to deliver a message to Senate Republicans : “ Do n't take something that should be above politics – our sacred duty to veterans – and pull it down into the muck of petty politics . ”
It quickly became clear exactly what the Democratic leader was referring to – and the degree to which GOP senators were inclined to ignore her suggestion . The Washington Post reported late yesterday :
The burgeoning controversy over Planned Parenthood 's fetal-tissue practices may have claimed its first victim : a bipartisan bill to help wounded veterans have children . The Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act , a bill authored by Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) that would require fertility treatment and counseling for “ severely wounded , ill , or injured ” military members or veterans , had been expected to proceed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday . But Murray said she has asked that the bill be pulled thanks to proposed amendments from Sen. Thom Tillis ( R-N.C. ) – including one that would have , in Tillis 's words , prevented the Department of Veterans Affairs from working with “ organizations that take human aborted babies ' organs and sell them . ”
Left with little choice , Murray had to pull her bill – a measure that had been considered uncontroversial – because of the Republicans ' new-found interest in crusading against Planned Parenthood .
It was a discouraging setback for proponents of expanded veterans ' benefits , but it was probably just the opening salvo in a much larger campaign . Politico reported overnight that some GOP lawmakers intend to connect Planned Parenthood to a pending highway bill , too :
Mitch McConnell is eyeing a major breakthrough on a multiyear highway bill that many in Congress doubted could be done . But his colleagues vying for the presidency see something else : one last chance to steal the spotlight on the Senate floor before the first GOP debate in August .
Specifically , Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , ostensibly the more libertarian-minded candidate in the 2016 field , “ is pushing an amendment to defund Planned Parenthood ” by way of a bill to finance infrastructure spending . Politico 's headline asked , “ What do highways have to do with Planned Parenthood ? ” The answer , of course , is nothing , though such details are apparently unimportant right now .
The report added , “ Paul is already fundraising off his demands to get a vote on slashing the $ 528.4 million in government funding that Planned Parenthood receives each year , though he would n't say how far he will go to get that vote on the transportation bill . ”

Introduction
This is the second of three articles that will examine the LM391x series of LED driver ICs . The first covered the LM3914 , this will cover the LM3915 and the LM3916 will follow . The goal of these is to have you using the parts in a small amount of time and experiment with your driver ICs , from which point you can research further into their theory and application .
Although these parts have been around for many years , the LM3915 is n't used that much however for the sake of completeness we 're writing the tutorial . The LM3915 offers a simple way to display a logarithmic voltage level using one or more groups of ten LEDs with a minimum of fuss . If you 're wanting to make a VU meter , you should use the LM3916 which we will cover in the final instalment of this trilogy .
Instead of having each LED represent a voltage level as with the LM3914 , each LED connected to the LM3915 represents a 3 dB ( decibel ) change in the power level of the signal . For more on decibels , check out Wikipedia .
To display these power level changes we 'll run through a couple of examples that you can use in your own projects and hopefully give you some ideas for the future . Originally by National Semiconductor , the LM391X series is now handled by Texas Instruments .
Getting Started
You will need the LM3915 data sheet , so please download that and keep it as a reference . First – back to basics . The LM3915 controls ten LEDs . It controls the current through the LEDs with the use of only one resistor , and the LEDs can appear in a bar graph or single ‘ dot ' when in use . The LM3915 contains a ten-stage voltage divider , each stage when reached will illuminate the matching LED ( and those below it in level meter mode ) .
Let 's consider the most basic of examples ( from page two of the data sheet ) – a simple logarithmic display of voltage between 0 and 10V :
After building the circuit you can connect a signal to measure via pin 5 , and the GND to pin 2 . We 've built the circuit exactly as above on some stripboard for demonstration purposes , with the only difference being the use of an 8.2kΩ resistor for R2 :
To show this in action we use a signal of varying AC voltage – a sine wave at around 2 kHz . In the following video , you can see the comparison of the signal 's voltage against the LEDs being illuminated , and you will see the logarithmic voltage increase represented by the LEDs :
We used the bar display mode for the voltage increase , and the dot display mode for the voltage decrease . Did you notice that during the voltage decrease , the LEDs below the maximum level being displayed were dim ? As the signal 's voltage was varying very quickly , the change in the LED 's location is a blur due to the speed of change . In the video below , we 've slowed the frequency right down but kept the same maximum voltage .
Well that was a lot of fun , and gives you an idea of what is possible with the LM3915 .
Displaying weaker signals
In non-theoretical situations your input signal wo n't conveniently be between 0 and 10 V. For example the line level on audio equipment can vary between 1 and 3V peak to peak . For example , here 's a random DSO image from measuring the headphone output on my computer whilst playing some typical music :
Although it 's an AC signal we 'll treat it as DC for simplicity . So to display this random low DC voltage signal we 'll reduce the range of the display to 0~3V DC . This is done using the same method as with the LM3914 – with maths and different resistors .
Consider the following formulae :
As you can see the LED current ( Iled ) is simple , however we 'll need to solve for R1 and R2 with the first formula to get our required Vref of 3V . For our example circuit I use 2.2kΩ for R2 which gives a value of 1.8kΩ for R1 . However putting those values in the ILED formula gives a pretty low current for the LEDs , about 8.3 mA . Live and learn – so spend time experimenting with values so you can match the required Vref and ILED .
Nevertheless in this video below we have the Vref of 3V and some music in from the computer as a sample source of low-voltage DC . This is not a VU meter ! Wait for the LM3916 article to do that .
Again due to the rapid rate of change of the voltage , there is the blue between the maximum level at the time and 0V .
Chaining multiple LM3915s
This is covered well in the data sheet , so read it for more on using two LM3915s . Plus there are some great example circuits in the data sheet , for example the 100W audio power meter on page 26 and the vibration meter ( using a piezo ) on page 18 .
Conclusion
As always I hope you found this useful . Do n't forget to stay tuned for the final instalment about the LM3916 . And if you made it this far – check out my new book “ Arduino Workshop ” from No Starch Press .

Just over 10 years ago , Dr. Arnold Schecter , a public health researcher in Texas , started finding traces of chemical flame retardants in the breast milk of American women . It appeared that the compounds were carried into the milk from fat in the mothers ' bodies .
“ The route was n't a surprise , ” said Dr. Schecter , a professor of environmental health at the University of Texas School of Public Health in Dallas . Breast milk is rich in fat , and the compounds he was looking at — polybrominated diphenyl ethers , or PBDEs — linger in fat .
The real question was how flame retardants were getting into women 's bodies in the first place . One unexpected source turned out to be food . Dr. Schecter surveyed Dallas supermarkets and discovered flame retardants in lipid-heavy items including butter and peanut butter , bacon , salmon , chili with beans , sliced lunch meat and more .
They are present in tiny amounts , he emphasized . But that they are there at all raises questions that researchers find increasingly troubling . If flame retardants can be found even in peanut butter , then where else have they spread ? And what health risks come with them ?
Flame retardants are a family of chemical compounds that reduce flammability or inhibit the spread of fire in a range of ways — from interfering with fire 's ability to consume oxygen , to forming a barrier , to acting as chemical coolants . Use of the chemicals rose greatly in the 1970s , as manufacturers increasingly put fast-burning synthetic materials and plastics in their products . Today , about 1.5 million tons of these compounds are used globally every year .
Various formulations of flame retardants are linked to a variety of possible health effects , all still under study . Some seem to be fairly benign , but others are suspected carcinogens . Some appear to interfere with the normal operation of hormones , notably thyroid hormones , while some , such as PBDEs , appear to affect brain development .
But to understand and measure these health risks , researchers first must figure out the extent of the contamination in the environment . The answer is growing clearer : Flame retardants show a remarkable ability to spread everywhere .
“ We 're exposed in every known environment , ” said Heather Stapleton , an associate professor of environmental sciences at Duke who has been studying flame retardants for 15 years .
Some of the older chemicals , like PBDEs , are being phased out in the United States ( and have been banned in Europe ) . But because they were designed to be durable , resistant compounds , they stubbornly persist in our surroundings . And some of their replacements , such as a new generation of organophosphate flame retardants , are also showing up in unwanted places .
Flame retardants have been found in Antarctic penguins and Arctic orcas ; in North American kestrels and barn owls ; in bird eggs in Spain , fish in Canada and , indirectly , in bees — honey from Brazil , Morocco , Spain and Portugal has been found tainted with flame retardants .
These chemicals also have been discovered in homes and offices , subways and trains , cars and airplanes . Dr. Stapleton worked on a recent study showing that airplane cabins contain startlingly high levels , leaching from seats , bins and even that curtain dividing first and coach class . She has found the compounds in baby products . Recently she published a study examining flame retardants in tents .
“ If a camper sets up a tent in very hot area , it looks like the chemicals come off the fabric , ” Dr. Stapleton said . “ We 're worried that people are breathing them in . ”
Human activities help spread the flame retardants , but the larger drift of them across the planet derives from their longtime use in homes and businesses . The compounds are often sprayed into fabrics and foams used in furniture , bedding and clothing , rather than chemically bonded to the material . So they are gradually shed . Often they attach to dust particles , which not only settle onto floors and shelves , but also waft outside through open doors and windows and air-conditioning systems .
Once outside , they can be transported anywhere by water and winds . “ We know this from other long-lasting materials , like DDT , ” Dr. Stapleton said . “ It 's called the grasshopper effect . ”
Of course , not all of it hops away — plenty stays right in the room . A 2012 study concluded that most American households contain dust tainted by flame retardants . A recent survey of 40 day care centers in California found a wide range of flame retardants , including PBDEs , in every one of the dust samples .
The dust may be especially risky for young children , because they crawl on the floors and often put their hands in their mouths , said the study 's lead author , Asa Bradman , an associate director of the Center for Environmental Research and Children 's Health at the University of California , Berkeley . It does n't surprise him that the chemicals turn up in the children themselves .
An earlier study by Dr. Bradman , measuring flame retardant levels in children 's blood , found they were highest in those who play indoors most often , notably in poor neighborhoods where parents hesitated for safety reasons to let them play outside .
Flame retardants are regulated in the United States primarily by the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act , which does not require studies of toxicity or long-term health effects for most industrial compounds before they are marketed . Although several efforts have been made to update that legislation , so far none has gained enough Congressional support .
At the moment , there 's not much you can do limit your exposure . Dr. Bradman recommends frequent handwashing and vacuuming , particularly in environments in which children may be exposed . He also suggests looking for products labeled as free of flame retardants .
More effective steps , he added , will require national policy changes , including laws that require better assessment of these chemicals and funding for studies of alternative strategies to protect against fire .
“ Before we engage in the widespread use of chemicals with the potential to end up in everything , we should stop to ask if they 're really necessary , ” said R. Thomas Zoeller , a professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has studied the effect of flame retardants on thyroid function .
He added , “ We should do that , put some of those rules in place , before we put the next generation at any further risk . ”
AUGUSTA , Maine ( NEWS CENTER ) — You can now legally have a hedgehog in the state of Maine without any special licenses or permits .
The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife have added hedgehogs to the unrestricted animal list .
There was a bill up for debate which would have eased the restrictions on owning the animals , which initially required two different permits . LD 35 was created after sixth graders from Mechanic Falls complained to Sen. Eric Brakey about the hoops they had to jump through to get hedgehogs as pets .
Now that the animals are n't restricted , people do n't need special licenses to get them , so the committee decided there was no need to vote on the bill .
Sen. Brakey said in a statement , `` I 'm really glad this issue could be resolved for these students without the need for further legislation . ''

Our application is driven by calls to action delivered to project backers via email . We send ~2 million emails a month with 98 % + deliverability .
Given the important role email plays in our business , we wanted to have better technical and behavioral insights into what was going on with our sent emails . We wanted to know more about our email at the project and backer level as well as what kind of impacts our emails have on conversion rates . Here are some of the steps we took to get a better picture :
Webhooks vs on-the-fly querying
We use Mailgun for sending email . Their platform provides two main ways to understand what your email is doing :
HTTP APIs with rolled up statistics Event-based webhooks
We were n't sure of our use cases for the data yet , so we decided that storing the data in our database would be the most flexible path forward .
Sending headers via ActionMailer callbacks
We instrumented the mailers of interest to include additional SMTP headers including the backer_id and project_id . ActionMailer callbacks allowed us a convenient hook into the email-sending lifecycle that looks like the below wrapper :
class BackerMailer < ActionMailer : :Base after_action : add_metadata_headers ... def sample_email ( backer_id , project_id ) @ backer = Backer.find ( backer_id ) @ project = Project.find ( project_id ) ... end def add_metadata_headers headers [ ' X-Mailgun-Variables ' ] = { `` backer_id '' : @ backer.id , `` project_id '' : @ project.id , `` subject '' : mail.subject } .to_json end end
Upon processing the event webhooks , we read out these headers again and persisted the following data :
backer_id
project_id
email subject
message_id ( unique across Mailgun )
( unique across Mailgun ) event status ( delivered , dropped , complained , bounced )
We set up an endpoint in our app to receive webhooks from Mailgun :
class Emails : :SentEmailsController < ApplicationController before_action : verify_signature def create if missing_required_params ? # tell Mailgun not to try again head : ok return end process_event ! head : ok end private def missing_required_params ? # assert the required headers are present so we process # only the emails for which we 've passed in our custom headers ... end def process_event ! sent_email = SentEmail.find_or_initialize_by ( message_id : params [ `` Message-Id '' ] ) sent_email.backer_id = backer_id sent_email.status = event_status sent_email.subject = subject.squish sent_email.save ! end def verify_signature # verify the signature of the request ... end end
Storing and updating events
The underlying model and table looked like this :
class SentEmail < ApplicationRecord belongs_to : backer end # == Schema Information # # Table name : sent_emails # # id : integer not null , primary key # message_id : string not null # status : string not null # backer_id : integer not null # subject : string not null # created_at : datetime not null # updated_at : datetime not null # # Indexes # # index_sent_emails_on_backer_id ( backer_id ) # index_sent_emails_on_message_id ( message_id ) UNIQUE #
With this setup , we could query for emails sent to a particular backer or roll up statistics for a given project . This setup has given us much better insight into the emails we send to each user and the higher-level effect our emails are having on each particular project .
Questions we can now answer
With the above setup we can interrogate our system about email deliverability . Here are some specific queries we 're running :
Backer level deliverability backer.sent_emails.group ( : status ) .count
Project level deliverability project.sent_emails.group ( : status ) .count
Project and email type deliverability project.sent_emails.group ( : subject , : status ) .count
Email deliverability across our system SentEmail.group ( : status ) .count
Having this data in our system means we can now surface relevant statistics to our project creators about what our application is doing and how emails affect their business .
A couple of optimization improvements
With the above implementation we are seeing response times averaging around ~30ms with reasonable P99 outlier response times . Although there are a handful of improvements we could make ( see below ) , we are cautious not to pre-optimize and have been happy with this setup .
We are continuing to monitor things . In the event of performance issues , here are a couple ideas we are considering for the future :
Enqueueing background jobs for later asynchronous processing in the webhook instead of doing Postgres queries in-band . We would be trading a Postgres query for a Redis query here .
Extracting the controller action into middleware and reducing the amount of the Rails stack required to process the action .

In 2032 an Earth that knows only peace is forced to relearn the art of war.Twenty years have passed since the population of Earth did a fine job of destroying nearly everything in one final struggle for power by the politicians and military leaders . Twenty years have been spent building a near Utopia , a society where currency and finance are irrelevant , a planet without hunger or poverty . All weapons have been destroyed to ensure peace . But hidden away in an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean , a cabal of old-world magnates : ex-leaders , financiers , politicians , and despots , are planning a return to the greed fueled , hate filled past . And there in no way to fight them . Except this one last remaining Adaptive Cruiser – The Antaeus.Antaeus Rising combines explosive action with powerful real-time strategy . Take command of powerful aircraft carrier/manufacturing platform . Create military units with your carrier using the most advanced nano-technology known by the modern world and lead an army against the forces of the Old World Cabal . Plan your assault from within your carrier and than enter your units for some third-person mayhem ! The fate of world is in your hands , are you able to hold it ?
The Stockton and Ellis entrance/exit from BART and Muni , with the escalator that dumped you off right by the door of the Apple Store , is closing today due to the construction of the Central Subway which is generally mucking up that entire block . The bad news is the temporary closure of this handy entrance will last six years , essentially until the whole subway project is complete .
If Willie Brown were an avid Twitterer , he 'd surely bemoan this latest inconvenience as just another reason the `` Central Circus '' should go to hell , but alas , he is not .
Meanwhile , at the other end of the rather brief subway line , the SFMTA is rejecting all their current bids for the Chinatown Station , as the Ex reports . Engineers apparently identified a cost-saving measure that had n't been previously considered , so the project is going out for bid again .

Police say a Pennsylvania man showed up drunk to be fingerprinted for a previous drunken driving charge and earned himself another one in the process .
Online court records do n't list an attorney for 41-year-old Kevin Kroll , of Dunbar Township . He faces a preliminary hearing June 30 on charges of drunken driving and public drunkenness for the Feb. 20 incident .
That 's when Uniontown police say Kroll walked in smelling of alcohol when he arrived to be fingerprinted for a Jan. 9 drunken driving incident .
The officer smelled alcohol and gave Kroll a breath test- and later a blood test- both of which showed he was legally intoxicated .
Uniontown Lt. Tom Kolencik says , `` To come in intoxicated is disrespectful to the judicial system and disrespectful to the police . ''

I first read The Handmaid 's Tale around the time it was published in 1986 . I was just 22 , a sheltered young thing . I recall wondering what everyone was raving about , since only the top story layer of the book connected for me . Now , with decades of life experience behind me , I see that this is a deeply moving , complex book . I 'm so glad I decide to read again just at this moment in time .
You would think that something written thirty years ago would seem dated . But that was n't the case for me . If anything , I think there are so many things imagined in the book which have become more possible today instead of less . In a sense , this is a cautionary tale that a large art of the population ignored or misunderstood .
More than ever , we should be reading this and sharing it with the young women in our lives . And discussing it with them , so they see more of the depth than my 22-year-old self did .
Margaret Atwood imagined a world where a totalitarian power went into action against foreign zealots and their own people 's `` wanton '' behavior . This power was meant to make the world better , but it also created a world of highly distinct `` haves '' and `` have nots . ''
She says , “ Better never means better for everyone ... It always means worse , for some. ” It might be just me ( although I suspect not ) but this sure sounds like what we often hear today on the news and in conversations .
Reading this at the end of 2016 after a brutal election cycle , the following quote from Atwood seems both wise and horrible . Have we not been hearing about people who feel invisible ?
“ We were the people who were not in the papers . We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print . It gave us more freedom . We lived in the gaps between the stories ''
Atwood 's Republic of Gilead gives people one-dimensional functions . Correction - she gives women one-dimensional functions . They are Wives , Marthas , Handmaids , Aunts , or Unwomen ( and a few more which would be spoilers ) . Unwomen are rebels , likely to be banished to the toxic waste dumps of the colonies . Everyone else plays a part in the singular female focus - procreation . As I read , I wondered what category I 'd fall into should I have the bad luck to land in Gilead . The women there have no layers of life or experience . They are expected only to fulfill their narrow role .
Why is procreation such a focus ? Because of falling birth rates among white people . This book does n't discuss race except one small spot near the end . It 's as if there is only one race in Gilead . And the only people in that race with any power are men .
The main character , Offred ( literally of Fred named after the Commander she serves ) is the perfect blend of weak and strong . She tells us of her past and says , “ When we think of the past it 's the beautiful things we pick out . We want to believe it was all like that. ” But her life is not beautiful . And Atwood straddles the line of past and present , sending back and forth in a way that keeps you wanting more . Just as Offred wants more . Just as we all want more for ourselves and the generations of women coming after us .
If you read this book long ago , pick it up again . If you have n't yet read it , move it up to the top of your TBR . Buy it for friends . Buy for your sons and daughters . Use it to teach and to learn what kind of world we could be if we stop valuing the diversity of all people .
Warning : This article contains very strong language that may offend some readers .
When Martin Scorsese 's The Wolf of Wall Street was released in 2014 , it had the questionable distinction of containing more F-bombs than any other drama — 2.83 per minute , a total of 506 . Only a documentary about the word itself exceeds it in cinematic history , with 857 instances . But this is far from unusual for American films , in which profane words frequently number in the hundreds . Television tends to have stricter standards .
Back in 1972 , the comedian George Carlin released an album including a monologue called Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television . These days , you can hear all of them on cable television , but they remain taboo for network television shows . This has inspired creativity . As Dan Harmon , creator of the US sitcom Community , told the New York Times , “ As a writer , you 're always reaching for a more potent way to call somebody a jerk . [ Douche ] is a word that has evolved in the last couple of years — a thing that sounds like a thing you ca n't say . ”
The influence of American films and television on British culture is strong . Any British person who has n't visited America could be forgiven for assuming that America is one giant cluster-cuss , its citizens dropping F-bombs like Eliza Doolittle dropped her Hs . But this is n't necessarily so . There is a real puritanical streak in America that is much discussed — but little understood — by the British . It manifests itself in unpredictable ways , like an unwillingness to use seemingly innocuous words ( the word ‘ toilet ' , for example ) and a certain gentility when it comes to swearing .
For example , Americans consider it a big deal when a public figure is caught swearing . After President Obama declared his intention to “ find out whose ass to kick ” in connection with the BP oil spill , Time magazine published a Brief History of Political Profanity , saying that although “ the comment was n't particularly vulgar… coarse language always seems shocking when it comes from the mouth of a President. ” Americans — even presidents — use all kinds of language , but in real life swearing retains more of its shock value than you would imagine , if your primary contact with American culture were its movies .
It is not unusual , in the real America , to meet a graduate of the Ned Flanders School of Swearing . ‘ Gosh darn it ! ' ‘ What the dickens ? ' ‘ What the flood ? ' ‘ Leapin ' Lazarus ! ' Writer Julie Gray describes the phenomenon : “ I recently said to someone that I 'd be shocked as pink paint if something did n't happen . My mother used to describe either a person or a situation that was going downhill as ‘ going to hell in a hand basket ' . My grandmother used to say ‘ good NIGHT ' when something surprised or shocked her… I do n't know where I picked it up but I will sometimes say ‘ H-E double toothpicks ' or ‘ fudge ' . Even Nicholson Baker , in his book House of Holes ( promisingly subtitled ‘ A Book of Raunch ' ) , has his characters say things like “ for gosh sakes ” , “ golly ” , and “ damnation ” as well as the f-word , just to keep it real .
Celia Walden , an English woman who moved to Los Angeles , described for the Telegraph her realisation that Americans “ do n't use expletives as much as we do. ” She found it refreshing ( “ I have n't been cursed at in nearly a year ” ) and noted that her “ new sensitivity ” to swearing might be related to having become a mother to a child whom she 'd rather “ did n't end up like the tiny mite I once saw fall out of his pushchair in Shepherd 's Bush , look accusingly up at his mother , and calmly enunciate the words : ‘ Bloody hell ' . I still wonder whether those were that poor child 's first words . ”
No matter what age they start , the British seem far more fluent at swearing than Americans . They are more likely to link colourful language with having a sense of humour than with coarseness or vulgarity . Some even have the ability to make a word sound like a swear word when it is n't . Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie once performed a comedy sketch based on the idea that if the BBC would n't let them swear on the air , they 'd simply make up their own curse words , “ which are absolutely pitiless in their detail… and no one can stop us from using them . Here they are :
STEPHEN : Prunk .
HUGH : Shote .
STEPHEN : Cucking .
HUGH : Skank .
STEPHEN : Fusk .
HUGH : Pempslider .
STEPHEN : No , we said we would n't use that one .
HUGH : Did we ?
STEPHEN : Yes , that 's going too far .
HUGH : What , “ pempslider ” ?
STEPHEN : Shut up .
Even without making up new words , the British definitely have , and make use of , a larger vocabulary of swear words than Americans . Americans mostly find it funny — as if the British were swearing in another language — but Ruth Margolis , writing for BBC America 's blog Mind the Gap : A Brit 's Guide to Surviving America , warned them that Americans might find their language offensive : “ To get on in polite company , try to avoid… friendly-offensive banter . Brits exchange jovial insults because we 're too uptight and emotionally stunted to say how we really feel . The stronger your friendship , the more you can lay into each other and still come away with a warm feeling . This is not how Americans roll . Tell your US pal he 's a moron or anything stronger and you likely wo n't get invited to his wedding . ”
Indeed , there are some words the British use casually that are considered more offensive or insulting by Americans . As Margolis notes , for example , in Britain one might plausibly tease a friend of either sex by calling them a twat ( rhymes with cat ) or the four-letter c-word , which is all but unsayable in the United States — and which linguist John McWhorter ( while not at all against swearing in principle ) has lumped in with the n-word as one of Americans ' most taboo . Americans find it really shocking to hear it used carelessly .
There are also words the British use that are actually ‘ swearier ' — even less polite— than they sound to the American ear , simply because they are unfamiliar . Hugh Grant gets a huge laugh saying , “ Bugger ! Bugger ! ” to express frustration in Four Weddings and a Funeral , but , as Philip Thody describes in Do n't Do It ! A Dictionary of the Forbidden , bugger is a term of bigotry and abuse with a long and nasty history : “ Rarely used in a literal sense in modern English , and scarcely used at all in the USA , where the term is sodomy… It comes , through the Old French ‘ bougre ' , from the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages to the Greek Orthodox Church , whose members were said to be Bulgarians , infected by the Albigensian heresy , and thus tending to practise unnatural vices . Since the Cathars made a special virtue of chastity , it was a shade unfair . However , since in the Middle Ages sodomy and buggery were linked to heresy as well as to witchcraft , it was perhaps only to be expected. ” Bugger is also versatile : ‘ Bugger off ' means ‘ go away ' . ‘ I 'll be buggered ' is a general expression of surprise . ‘ Bugger me ! ' is as well , but it implies a greater degree of astonishment . Similarly , the word sod — used to describe a foolish person , or to tell someone to ‘ sod off ' ( get lost ) — is actually short for sodomite .
Bloody is an all-purpose intensifier that , according to the Oxford English Dictionary , once qualified as the strongest expletive available in just about every English-speaking nation except the United States . In 1914 its use in George Bernard Shaw 's Pygmalion was hugely controversial . ( Later , when a reporter from the Daily Express interviewed an actual Cockney flower girl , she said that Shaw 's dialogue was unrealistic : Neither she nor her fellow flower-floggers would ever have used such a filthy word . )
When Gilbert and Sullivan 's opera Ruddigore — originally spelled Ruddygore — opened in January 1887 , the title caused considerable offense . Ian Bradley relates in The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan that WS Gilbert , when approached by a member of his London club who commented that he saw no difference between “ Ruddygore ” and “ Bloodygore , ” shot back , “ Then I suppose you 'll take it that if I say ‘ I admire your ruddy countenance ' , I mean ‘ I like your bloody cheek'. ” It 's hard to take bloody seriously now , given how often the British use it . This is the risk with any good swear word : Overuse it and it loses its meaning . Still , to Americans bloody remains the quintessential British swear word , and one of the only ones they have not adopted themselves ( except when they 're being pretentious or ironic ) .
Both countries share a fascination with swear words ' that reference the male anatomy . Americans and the British have dick , cock , and prick in common , but Britain takes the theme further with pillock and knob , as well as masturbator synonyms tosser and wanker . A commenter named Brian D on Ben Yagoda 's blog , Not One-Off Britishisms , told the story of a group of British engineers from his company , sent to work at Wang Labs in Massachusetts . They were asked to attend a meeting to recognize an employee for outstanding achievement : “ It was announced from the stage that this person was a King in the company and so would be presented with the Wang King award . The entire British contingent had to leave the room in hysterics . ”
Misunderstandings abound , but one thing is for sure . If you choose to swear , and you want your swearing to be understood on both sides of the Atlantic , you ca n't go wrong with the classic , the universal , the little black dress of swear words : fuck . As Audrey Hepburn once said , “ Everything I learned , I learned from the movies . ”

They use new and developing technologies such as GPS , satellite imagery , laser mapping and fast computing to create complex layers of interconnected geographic information . Today we can measure position very accurately . We can make maps and look down on the world from airborne and satellite platforms , and visualise the natural and built environment in 3D . Geospatial information constantly reveals new insights about our world and our place in it .
There are many types of surveyors and geospatial engineers , some listed below :
What land and cadastral surveyors do
Land surveyors play a crucial role in land development , mapping and engineering construction . Registered land surveyors have a special status as they are the only professional who legally define the dimensions of new or existing property . The Australian property market is worth over $ 1000 billion . Surveyors advise landowners , lawyers , builders , architects , planners and other engineers .
To become a registered surveyor , graduates must pass the exam of the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information of New South Wales . Surveyors are always in demand with state and federal government , local councils and private companies . Land surveyors are skilled in land measurement , land law , mapping and geographic concepts . They enjoy working both indoors and outdoors , using modern measurement technology .
Cadastral land surveyors in the private sector often begin their careers with outdoor , hands-on tasks . As they progress , they develop their professional skills with client liaison , project development and more legal and business matters .
In government departments , graduates initially work on implementing operations relating to land , water , roads , rail or harbours , depending on the department . They progress to develop policy and regulations and advise on special case or unusual surveys . All surveying relies on geometry , mapping and a spatial brain to fit measurements together . Surveyors are the measurement experts .
What engineering , mining and hydrographic surveyors do
Engineering surveyors
From the development of the Olympic stadium , the Pacific Highway , the Lane Cove tunnel or the huge new rail networks , to all new major high-rise developments in Australia and internationally , engineering surveyors are there from project launch to completion .
The increased scale and complexity of new infrastructure is very challenging , however , engineering surveyors are assisted by recent advances in measurement technology including :
laser scanning
surveying robots
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs )
High-precision satellite positioning techniques , including GPS .
Engineering surveyors are sought after by major development companies like Leightons , Brookfield-Multiplex , Lend Lease or Meriton , where they oversee all aspects of major urban development including pre- and post-construction surveys , through to ongoing monitoring of finished projects .
Engineering surveyors often begin their careers in the field , leading parties responsible for the set out of complex projects . They go on to manage teams of survey parties and work closely with project managers and allied professionals to ensure projects are completed on time and on budget . As projects become more ambitious , the experienced engineering surveyor must design new techniques with the latest technology to ensure challenging building specifications are met .
There is a lot of personal satisfaction in the work of an engineering surveyor as the final project is a constant reminder of the contribution they made to the completion of the project .
Mining surveyors
Mining is our most valuable export industry and mining surveying is critical for supporting today 's and tomorrow 's mine operations .
The expansion of mining in Australia has produced a desperate need for mining surveyors who are an integral part of the mineral production process . Mining surveyors draft mine plans and determine how the mine will operate efficiently and safely , as well as helping to minimise environmental damage and remediate old mine sites .
Mining surveyors work at all kinds of mines from open-cut iron ore mines in Western Australia to underground coal mines in New South Wales and Victoria , as well as overseas . Mining surveyors are in great demand by companies like RioTinto , BHP Billiton , Vale , Newcrest , Xstrata and Centennial Coal .
Mine surveyors use the latest in GPS and automated surveying technology , including UAVs to :
explore new ore bodies
calculate how much material can be extracted
survey stockpiles
optimise the design and operation of open-cut and underground mines .
In an emergency , they are essential in efforts to rescue trapped miners .
Mining surveyors must take exams administered by the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information after they graduate to become registered mining surveyors .
Mining surveyors usually begin their careers in a hands-on role , dealing with the day-to-day operations of the mine . After registration , they supervise teams of surveyors and liaise with mine managers and allied professionals . Some may choose to take further study and become more involved with the business side of the mining company , while others will develop their technical skills and advise on new techniques to improve yields , cut costs and maximise profits. ,
This highly paid segment of the surveying profession is an attractive option for professional surveyors .
Mining surveyors get a lot of personal satisfaction from improved mine yield and the smooth operations of the mines for which they are responsible .
The work is very 3-dimensional and a mining surveyor must have a good spatial awareness . Mining surveying is great work for a hands-on , pragmatic professional who is n't afraid of large machines and operations and who is looking to work efficiently , but in a safe manner .
Hydrographic surveyors
Hydrographic surveyors map :
rivers
harbours
coastlines
seabeds .
Hydrographic surveyors also measure the impact on the coast and offshore structures of the ocean , climate change and development .
Hydrographic surveyors monitor marine environments and prepare digital charts for navigation , as well as supervising the offshore construction of pipelines and submarine cables , drill platforms and wind farms , piers and seawalls . Employers in Australia and overseas include governments , oil companies , such as Shell and Chevron , and engineering companies building new energy and transport infrastructure .
After graduation , it is possible to gain professional recognition of their specialised skills through hydrographic certification .
They use :
GPS technology linked with sonars
tide gauges
underwater laser scanners .
When the Pasha Bulker was beached off Newcastle in 2007 , hydrographic surveyors helped salvage operations by mapping an exit route , avoiding submerged rocks . Hydrographic surveyors were also involved in the recent refloating of the Costa Concordia off the coast of Italy .
A career in hydrographic surveying can be extremely exciting and rewarding with outdoor work on the rivers and seas or in the office carrying out important calculations .
What geospatial scientists and engineers do
Geospatial engineers
Modern geospatial technologies are used to create solutions in an ever-widening range of industries . Currently , there are more well-paid jobs than there are geospatial engineering graduates – in private industry and the government sector , in Australia and overseas .
Geospatial engineers measure large-scale and/or highly dynamic features using technology such as :
global navigation satellite positioning systems , such as GPS
airborne LiDAR
terrestrial laser scanners
high-resolution mobile laser scanning
robotic total stations
UAVs .
Geospatial engineers face the challenge of managing and combining huge volumes of geospatial data from various measurement techniques of differing precision and at differing times .
Mapping and visualisation
This includes mapping in 3D of everything from the interior of buildings to the Earth 's terrain , and the generation of amazing flythroughs for land use planning and management .
Spatially-enabled industries
This includes robotics and machine automation , smart buildings and smart infrastructure , car navigation systems , transport logistics and new digital services for mobile phones .
Geodesists
Geodesists are principally researchers who work with the fundamental coordinate framework that maps our world . This kind of research is usually done at the postgraduate level and geodesists work in universities and federal and state government agencies , such as Geoscience Australia and the NSW Department of Lands , which are charged with the maintenance of the national or state coordinate frameworks .
Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) specialists
GIS specialists use ongoing developments in digital technology to enhance the ways that information can be used . Integrating these databases in real time with GPS positions or other devices opens up a new world of location-based services – one of the many uses of GIS .
Location-based services
This is about linking social networks , navigation and business directories on mobile phones , to access information in new ways , create new services or just find your friends . Location-based services use powerful applications from Google , Apple , Facebook , Microsoft and others .
GIS is used in mine management to optimise work flows . It is used by councils for asset management and by emergency management authorities to coordinate activities , especially during large disaster events . GIS is used in traffic management and environmental monitoring , and is increasingly being used across the corporate sector , especially in the insurance industry .
Spatial Data Infrastructure
Ultimately web services of geo-data can be linked to provide a spatial data infrastructure ( SDI ) that could be used to benefit everybody . GIS specialists ensure that these layers inter-link for analysis and planning , to meet the needs of the community and our changing natural and built environments .
What remote sensing professionals do
Surveyors and geospatial engineers use modern satellite , aerial and land-based positioning technology to provide mapping services for flood plain studies , coastal monitoring , natural resource management , agriculture , sustainable development , and many more applications .
Remote sensing professional link this data with satellite imagery and other forms of remote sensing data for a range of environmental monitoring applications , such as salinity and soil moisture monitoring for precision agriculture , or for emergency management of hazards such as earthquakes and tsunamis , real-time bushfire or flood monitoring , etc .
Graduates could work for Geoscience Australia , CSIRO , state government lands departments , some local councils or research institutions .
West Virginia , Kentucky and Georgia say they were targeted by election-related cyberattacks that have been traced back to the Department of Homeland Security .
Last week we reported that the State of Georgia had traced an attempted break-in to its voter registration database to none other than the famous Russian government agency , the Department of Homeland Security .
Now it has been revealed that Kentucky and West Virginia `` have confirmed suspected cyberattacks linked to the same U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP address as last month 's massive attack in Georgia '' . There must be some way to blame Moscow :
BREAKING : 2 other states ' election agencies confirm cyber-attacks linked to same DHS IP address as 11/15 cyber-attack on GA network . @ wsbtv pic.twitter.com/3430zQZ8KZ — Aaron Diamant ( @ AaronDiamantWSB ) December 15 , 2016
It 's a well known fact that the Department of Homeland Security is a Kremlin front
While there could be an `` innocent '' explanation for such attacks ( testing network security , for example ) , the Department of Homeland Security did not inform any of these states — before or after the attacks — that they had been conducted , for security-checking purposes or otherwise . In other words : These states still do n't know why DHS targeted , and they 're still waiting for an answer :
In the past week , the Georgia Secretary of State 's Office has confirmed 10 separate cyberattacks on its network over the past 10 months that were traced back to DHS addresses . `` We 're being told something that they think they have it figured out , yet nobody 's really showed us how this happened , ” Kemp said . `` We need to know . '' He says the new information from the two other states presents even more reason to be concerned . `` So now this just raises more questions that have n't been answered about this and continues to raise the alarms and concern that I have , '' Kemp said .
Georgia 's Secretary of State says he has already sent an appeal to the incoming Trump administration , asking for assistance in resolving this bizarre string of cyberattacks .

According to some Apple Retail sources , Apple 's AirPods may show up for sale in the next couple of days , but nearly immediately go on back-order , because of limited product availability .
Based on multiple comments made to long-time Apple journalist John Gruber , there is speculation that the long-awaited AirPods would barely make it to retail for the holiday season , but in very limited quantities . However , Gruber did note that the sources were n't particularly well-placed , '' They are getting very close to missing the holidays , '' said Gruber . `` I have heard just in the last 24 hours , not from like a very well placed little birdie but from a birdie , that there 's a possibility , that there are whispers in Apple , among people who work at Apple retail , that they might actually come in 'the next few days . ' '' Should Gruber 's data be correct , it lines up with what AppleInsider was told in early November by sources at Apple Retail and corporate as well.Sources within Apple corporate told AppleInsider that there was `` no way '' that the company was going to miss a holiday season release . Additionally , several venues have received pre-release sets for review . `` We 're ready to go any time , '' one AppleInsider retail source confirmed . `` We 've got a few pairs for customer demonstration that we 're just waiting on the word to start with . `` Additionally , in the end of November , Apple CEO Tim Cook also noted that the long-awaited AirPods were `` finalizing '' and expected to ship in the `` next few weeks , '' in time for the holiday season .
Stanford 's Bryce Love won the Doak Walker Award as the nation 's top running back and finished second in the voting , behind Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield , for AP Player of the Year .
Mayfield also won the Walter Camp and Maxwell Awards for Player of the Year and received the Davey O'Brien Award as the top quarterback . He 's expected to make it a clean sweep when the Heisman Trophy winner is announced Saturday .
Bryce Love/Stanford Athletics Bryce Love/Stanford Athletics
Nate Herbig/Stanford Athletics Nate Herbig/Stanford Athletics
He set a school record with 301 yards on 25 carries against Arizona State and with a bowl game remaining , needs 47 yards to break the school record set by 2015 Heisman finalist Christian McCaffrey .
Love joins Toby Gerhart ( 2009 ) as the two Stanford winners of the Doak Walker Award .
Jim Plunkett , in 1970 , and Andrew Luck , in 2011 , are the lone Stanford quarterbacks to win the Walter Camp Award .
Love was named the AP 's All-Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and also earned first-team honors at running back .
Stanford 's offensive lineman David Bright and tight end Kaden Smith were also named to the first team .
Justin Reid was named first team defense as a safety .
Stanford offensive linemen A.T. Hall and Nate Herbig were named to the second team , as was Utah wide receiver Darren Carrington , whose sister Dijonai plays for the Stanford women 's basketball team .
Stanford 's defensive tackle Harrison Phillips , cornerback Quenton Meeks and punter Jake Bailey were second team selections .
Happy Valentine 's Day ! A heart shape is the universal symbol of LOVE . It in no way depicts the image of a human heart . That 's a relief ! I would n't want to open a human heart shaped box of chocolates . Although , I am sure there are some people who would find that appealing .
In the worm world , these wonderful earth loving creatures have five blood pumping organs in their tiny , hardworking bodies . I would n't exactly call them organs , though . They are more like bands which contract and release and preform similar functions as a human heart . But the worms ' hearts do not fill up with blood the way humans do , they just squeeze the two blood vessels which help to circulate the blood through out the body .
Check out the illustration ! You can see the 5 hearts and the two blood vessels , ventral and dorsal . I grabbed this picture off of a cool site , Kingston Worm Farm . They too are spreading the word of the worm .
Also , it would be nice to show your Red wigglers some love . Feed them something sweet . Maybe you have some strawberry tops left over after you feed your loved one some strawberries dipped in chocolate or smothered in whip cream !
Madrid plot move for 'homesick ' United keeper De Gea as replacement for Casillas
Real Madrid are eyeing Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea as a long-term replacement for Iker Casillas .
The Spanish champions and their manager Jose Mourinho have a strong relationship with De Gea 's agent Jorge Mendes and feel they can exploit that to tempt De Gea back to Spain in the foreseeable future .
Casillas has already stated that he sees De Gea as his successor in Spain 's national team and feels he can bring him on by working with the keeper at the Bernabeu .
Unhappy ? David De Gea has been linked with a move to Real Madrid
Suggestions in Spain that De Gea is homesick in Manchester have not been confirmed by United .
He has been in and out of the United team and is not certain to start against Braga in the Champions League on Tuesday , which sources in Spain feel is contributing to his restlessness .
Earlier this month , De Gea admitted he often finds life tough at United .
' I am working flat-out every day because I need to regain the confidence of the coach .
'For me , a training session is a match and after that it is necessary for me to show what levels I can achieve in games .
' I ended last season satisfied with my work for Manchester United , but it is quite normal to go back to zero at the start of the following season .
Competition : Anders Lindegaard has often been favoured ahead of De Gea
' I do n't believe I have been at the top in the last couple of months but with each game I am rediscovering my level .
' I accept the manager 's decision . If he considers Anders [ Lindegaard ] as No 1 it is not a problem for me I only want to play and maintain my challenge for the position . '
United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has no plans to choose a No 1 just yet , preferring to rotate De Gea and Lindegaard .
Future : Madrid are reported to want De Gea to replace Iker Casillas
'Everybody wants to play , goalkeepers are no different , but the way I look at it at the moment is getting the two of them experience will help me in the long term , ' he said .
'Obviously at some stage one of them will take over if he shows a real consistency in top-level performance and he has shown maturity .
I 've really set myself up for a fall this time . It 's just not that I have to tell you how much the Baldur 's Gate games meant , or still mean , to me . It 's not just that I have to explain how they 're tied to key events in my life , or that even now a single sound , quote or strain of music can still take me back . It 's that I have to communicate my depth of feeling without making you think that I am a madman . A crackpot . A total nut .
I bought the first Baldur 's Gate on a whim . I was bored and sad and working the most god-awful accounting job that you could imagine , a job where our boss was one of those co-ordinated paperclip neat freaks that we now make office comedies about . Baldur 's Gate came in a glossy box , spread across five CD-ROMs and accompanied by that most decadent of luxuries , a fold-out map . It was retail therapy .
I did n't imagine it could live up to its hype . I 'd long since lost interest in the PC 's role-playing games , which had become either tedious dungeon crawls , spreadsheets of magic items or action-focused bash-'em-ups . Baldur 's Gate , I imagined , would be another distraction . Most importantly , it would contain no sums , no invoices and no purchase orders . I was not prepared for it to have an incalculable influence on my life .
A few years of relatively spiritless role-playing meant I knew how the cack-handed 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons rules worked . I rolled the game 's dice . I built a character . Then , I found myself standing outside the door of a Tudor-style inn , the wind brushing the trees and birds singing as the most beautiful music I 'd ever heard in a game began to play . I stepped through the doorway . I spoke to the innkeeper .
Believe it or not , violence is n't the solution to everything .
`` MY 'OTEL 'S AS CLEAN AS AN ELVEN ARSE , '' he bellowed .
Everything after that is a blur . I do n't remember how many evenings I rushed home to throw myself into that game , to lose myself in its beautiful depths and to let it paint smiles across my face . I was rapt , in awe of its production quality , of its gorgeous rendered backgrounds , its enormous playing area and its seemingly endless hidden treasures . I had never seen a game with such a detailed and yet such an open world , a world where you could literally wander off the beaten track into the whispering , autumnal and often deadly woods .
Adventure was everywhere , with quest treasures begging to be seized , plot threads waiting to be grasped , my travels taking me from the haunted hilltop ruins of a mage school to the wyvern-infested caverns under a forest a-scuttle with giant spiders . It did n't even matter that the central plot was a convoluted introduction to a sinister secret , because it was just one story among so many that this game was waiting to tell me . Baldur 's Gate rewarded me every time I exercised my curiosity , showing me that , whether I could handle it or not , adventure was not only waiting for me around every corner , it practically hung in the air like morning mist , so drenched was this world in danger and magic .
Adventure lay at the end of the forest path , was scrawled across the headstones of a forgotten grave , was hidden in a gurgling waterfall , was even found behind the painting on the wall - and the overconfident explorer soon learnt that one misstep could take them through a secret door into the kobold-infested sewers , the opulent tomb of a cursed and long-forgotten sorcerer , or even on to another plane of existence .
As characters get more powerful , magic becomes increasingly prominent .
Through all this , it sang to me with its sweeping , vibrant soundtrack . By the late 90s , and particularly after Grand Theft Auto and Command & Conquer , I was aware that video game soundtracks were improving no end . But Baldur 's Gate was the first I found truly cinematic , with music grand enough to match the game 's vision and ambition .
But most memorable was its wit . The time was yet to come when all video game dialogue would be performed by voice actors . The Baldur 's Gate games came just before this and , with Planescape Torment , represented not only the last of the text-heavy roleplaying games but also the most literate , demonstrating some of the wisest , savviest and often the funniest writing ever seen in any video game .
It was irreverent , referential , self-aware , sarcastic and charming in equal measure , its words animating its characters and world as beautifully as its music and its visuals . It told the stories of embittered slaves , eccentric explorers , half-mad magicians and poor Maple Willow Aspen , who simply wanted to avoid any more tree-related taunts . The game was as full of jokes as it was adventure , its puns and pranks as much a reward as experience points .
My late teens had me trapped in a soul-crushing job in a nowhere town , losing all my friends to universities across the country . It was the toughest time of my life , and sometimes the saddest . My life had stalled when suddenly , thanks to that whim , my imagination was lit up as if by a flamethrower and my creativity returned . By chance , Baldur 's Gate also helped me to get to know one of my best friends and it returned me to tabletop roleplaying . As much as any book , it also inspired me to write , even to write about video games professionally . Perhaps most important of all , I think it helped keep me sane . I told you I was n't a crackpot .
Search everywhere , there 's a world of adventure out there , just waiting .
When its sequel arrived two years later I would 've been happy with more of the same , but Shadows of Amn was like a fine wine , richer and darker , while even more grandiose in its scope and themes . It took the Dungeons & Dragons formula to its logical conclusion , painting adventuring parties not as wandering heroes for hire but as lonely bands of damaged people who repeatedly witness death and suffer loss , roaming the lands together as rootless , surrogate families . The game 's vaunted romances , where non-player characters would grow closer to the player and which prefigured those of Mass Effect or Dragon Age , all told stories of terrible loneliness and hurt , while other characters carried forth from the first Baldur 's Gate had also suffered great harm .
The game was as much a coming-of-age story as it was an adventure . Both the player and their companions gradually came to understand the true nature of the protagonist , someone wrestles with a growing awareness of their heritage and with a fear of what they might become , even how they might harm those few close to them , their fellow travellers . Mirroring this , its environments became ever more sordid and unpleasant . Its cities were grittier , its crypts murkier - and , eventually , it took its players into the fabled Underdark and even the many hells themselves , regions where it became all too easy to feel at home .
It was n't simply that these locations were more dangerous , it was that they were darker , grimmer and had ever more sinister implications . They were a metaphor for your own descent into the darkness within and a far cry from the first game 's pastoral , romantic and homely beginning . All this coming of age , with its discussion of power and responsibility ( and clumsy romance ) , was oddly familiar to a young man coming to the end of his teens ( and united with his girlfriend of the time by a love of the first Baldur 's Gate ) .
And if the first game inspired me , the second overwhelmed me . It outclassed its predecessor in every aspect , making its locations larger , its writing sharper and funnier , and adding an astonishing amount of content ranging from countless bizarre creatures to talking swords to a whole , richly detailed , you-might-not-even-go-there underwater city . My adventuring party became more animate and articulate , reacting to me , to each other , to the world about them , and doing so with the voices of accomplished actors that included David Warner .
The voice cast included actors who had starred in The Omen , Futurama and even Star Trek , The Next Generation .
Warner dominates what is not only my favourite moment in the game , but my favourite in any since . A guided tour of a spellcaster 's asylum , a haven for the magically afflicted , is almost one long , indulgent and interactive cut-scene . As you and your party walk from cell to cell , being introduced to every inmate by a stern and indifferent Warner , the game presents an increasingly bizarre cavalcade of characters , each more affected than the last . A small girl claims she can change shape and also see behind the `` masks '' that others wear . A mentally unstable woman sees the true nature of reality and , for one terrifying moment , reveals it all to you .
While Baldur 's Gate set my inspiration alight , its sequel forever changed the way I looked at roleplaying games , at the characters within them , at how they do ( or do n't ) solve their problems . At the climax of Baldur 's Gate 2 , my adventuring party took a moment to speak with me , to reflect on all that we 'd done together and to tell me how they felt about me . It caught me entirely off-guard , a moving moment with a horrible sense of finality , as if I 'd never have another chance to speak with my companions again . No video game had ever engaged me like this before .
No games since have made me search as hard , laugh as much or feel quite so spoiled , and I like to think they may still have one or two stories left for me . To this day , I 'm still delighted to tell the tale of the moment that Baldur 's Gate 2 suddenly and dramatically broke the fourth wall with the arrival of the stereotypically teenage adventuring party of Tim Goldenhand . Those bickering , fledgling adventurers , speaking as if sat around a table role-playing , concocted the most naïve and telegraphed attempt to betray my character before , without warning , reloading the game to undo their failure . Yes , reloading .
Some might say that BioWare has come far in the last 12years , that the Baldur 's Gate series was a splendid role-playing debut - but I do n't think the studio ever left those games behind . They 've become the foundation upon which all its other titles have been built and their influence still echoes down the years . For me , BioWare 's best work is that which most closely reflects its first two role-playing games - and it has failed somewhat wherever it has strayed from them .
Seaweed is swimming its way into the mainstream market .
Waitrose has just announced that it will stock fresh seaweed in its stores , while sales of the green stuff soared by 125 per cent after Jamie Oliver claimed it had helped him lose weight .
“ Seaweed is one of this year 's biggest trends in veg which we 're seeing on the menus of some of London 's top and most creative restaurants , '' says Waitrose product developer , Simona Cohen Vida . `` Our customers like to experiment in the kitchen , so we predict that seaweed will be top of the shopping list this spring . ''
A staple in our diet in ancient times , seaweed has become popular not just because of its delicious flavour , but because of its many health benefits .
Companies such as the The Cornish Seaweed Company and This Is Seaweed in Ireland are harvesting a variety of seaweeds and related products , including dulse , kelp , carrageen , wakame , sea spaghetti , seaweed salt , and so on .
Not sure what to do with it ? How about sea spaghetti pasta with basil pesto ? Or dulse and quinoa salad ?
You can also cut down on your salt intake by using seaweed salt , a mixture small-flaked dulse , nori and sea greens mixed with Maldon Sea Salt . Pinch and sprinkle on any dish .

PLAINFIELD , N.J. -- A New Jersey woman distracted by her cellphone was hospitalized after she fell over open basement access doors and fell 6 feet ( 1.8 metres ) into the opening .
Surveillance video captured the woman Thursday as she walked along a Plainfield street . The 67-year-old landed in the cellar of Acme Windows , where workers were repairing gas lines .
Martin Delgadillo told WNBC-TV in New York he was standing outside his barbershop on Somerset Street when he saw the woman plunge through the access door .
`` She was looking at her phone -- the last minute -- she hit the door and fell right in , '' Delgadillo said .
The woman , whose name was not released , was taken to a hospital . Police said her injuries were not life-threatening .
`` I thought texting and driving was a bad thing , '' Delgadillo said . `` Now it 's texting and walking . ''
Georges St-Pierre is in the middle of a contract stand off with the UFC . The longtime welterweight champ declared himself as a free agent earlier in the week , saying that his team has terminated the contract after the UFC violated the terms of his deal . The UFC has since responded to say they reserve their rights under the law to have GSP honor the contract .
James Quinn is currently handling St-Pierre 's legal affairs , and he recently spoke about his UFC contract . He deemed that the deal , which includes the controversial “ Ancillary Rights Clause ” and “ Champion 's Clause ” , is “ something out of the 1940s . ”
`` I 've done a lot of work in sports . When I read that contract , I was blown away by how restrictive it is , '' Quinn told MMA Fighting .
`` They 're basically tying him up for life . They have no rights and they own all of his licensing and all the other things . It 's unheard of in the other professional sports . And they wo n't get away with it forever . ''
He says those types of contracts are n't seen in sporting organizations today , and once placed under the scrutiny of the law , would be found illegal . Another issue GSP 's team has , is that the contract was signed long before the Reebok deal was put in place , and trying to enforce that new provision may be challenged in court as well .
Quinn also mentioned the on-going anti-trust lawsuit against the UFC when speaking about St-Pierre 's situation .
`` You could n't get away with any old contract in any of the other sports , '' Quinn said . `` There is litigation in that aspect of a class-action lawsuit that challenges the contract as being illegal under the NHS laws . That case is ongoing , and I think that under the law 's terms , I do n't think the contract -- that formal contract -- is likely to stand up . Not in today 's world . It 's a pretty nice form of slavery . ''
They maintain that they 're still willing to negotiate a new deal with the promotion , but are aware that it can take a different route through litigation .
“ It 's really up to the UFC , whether they 're willing to negotiate another contract or not , '' Quinn said .
`` We take the position that we believe the contract has been terminated . They have their hand , we have our hand , we 'll see how it plays out , ” he said . “ Georges still wants to fight and he 's perfectly happy to fight under a new UFC contract , if we can negotiate one . Or if not , he 'll look at other options . ''
I should start off by saying that I 've found dating in general to be relatively crappy . Getting to know someone can be exciting , but also incredibly taxing . It requires constantly staying on your toes and reining in some of those qualities about yourself that might be a little too eccentric for someone to accept at first .
But online dating ?
Well , that comes with its whole own set of challenges , does n't it ?
Let 's be honest here . It all starts with the shiny commercials that promise true love while featuring nauseatingly normal people who have found their match floating around in the interwebs . Doting couples with bright smiles are a dime a dozen in this world . And yeah , the whole thing seems a little bit too good to be true , but what have you got to lose , right ?
I signed up for eHarmony shortly after my 22nd birthday . I was still in college , swimming in a sea of available guys , none of whom seemed remotely interested in anything beyond a hookup . After a nudge from an older friend who married her online match , I coughed up a few bucks after I migrated to LA temporarily . It was perfect timing , really . Plenty of people to choose from , none of whom I actually had to see again after I went back home .
I only met two men in person before I nixed my account . But upon moving back to LA , I decided to give Match a try , when I remembered why I actually hated the whole ordeal in the first place :
1 . Judgey McJudgerson Friends
I 've been lucky that the majority of my friends have been supportive in my endeavor , but I have stumbled upon a couple who gave me the ole skeptical lift of the brow and disapproving , pursed-lips hum . You know the ones I 'm talking about .
“ You 're young . You 've got plenty of time . What the hell are you doing on an online dating site ? You look desperate . ”
Well , I 'm almost 23 and I 've only had one boyfriend . So , you do the math .
Kidding ( mostly ) . But seriously . Why is there this stigma attached that a woman ( or a man ) must be desperate to resort to a dating service ? I 'm just looking for a nice guy with similar interests . Can I help it if I ca n't find him on my own ? Seriously .
2 . What Looks Good On Paper Falls Flat IRL
He 's the guy of your dreams ! Funny , romantic , passionate . What more could you want ? Imagine your surprise when his idea of funny is actually a bad Adam Sandler movie and his passion lies in Excel spreadsheets ( I 'm not even kidding . I once dated a guy who compared spreadsheets to an artist 's canvas ) .
And so many people ( myself included ) are better with the written word than conversation . So how do you really know if you 're gon na get stuck with a dud ?
3 . Those Creepy Old Guys
He 's 50 . Divorced with three kids . And “ Hey , age ai n't nothin ' but a number , baby . ”
Um . No . Unless of course , you 're George Clooney . In which case , let 's talk .
( Honorable mention goes to those creepy smarmy guys who pretty much pay for a sex service ) .
4 . There 's Actually No Polite Way of Admitting That You 're Shallow
I ca n't lie . I 've clicked away on several occasions without actually reading a profile , based solely on what a guy looks like . And yeah , when it comes down to it , personality comes first . Who wants to date someone you have nothing in common with ( especially when you 're a film and television buff like me and people just do n't always get you ) ? But attraction is important , too .
So let me just lay it out on the table right now and get it out in the open . If you 're shorter than me and your hair 's longer than mine , then this relationship is over before it even got started .
5 . The System Kinda Sucks
Look , I know dating is n't an exact science , particularly because men and women are attracted to so many different types of people . Person A might be looking for someone the total opposite of them , whereas Person B might want a carbon copy of themselves ( okay , I do n't actually know anyone quite like that , but they must exist somewhere , do n't they ? ) .
Still . You 'd think eHarmony would know better than to ‘ match ' me with a guy who 's completely disinterested in all things entertainment and loves to analyze spreadsheets . Like , I did n't spend hours ( okay , 15 minutes ) filling out those personality profiles for nothin ' .
Well . For more than a free dinner , anyway .
6 . It 's Hard to Stand Out
No wonder jerks like me are only checking out your photos when everyone 's profile sounds the same . I once connected with a guy who created a sarcastic page just to get a little attention . And I respected him so much more for it .
Assuming anyone actually made it to the part where he admitted to joking ( does anyone actually hate puppies ? ) , I 'm sure he received a lot of responses .
7 . No One Really Looks Like Their Best Selfie
Do I ever look like this ? Rarely .
There 's a filter for everything these days . And you do n't need to be a Photoshop genius to nip a little here or tuck a little there . Blame it on the lighting , make-up , the flash . But things are looking a lot bleaker in the harsh light of day .

The Olympic Stadium in Deodoro will stay in use as a stand-alone venue but the Olympic Park around it will be closed and dismantled
The Paralympic Games will take place as planned next month , but face major budget cuts , the International Paralympic Committee has announced .
The cuts will be made to venues , the workforce and transport .
Delayed travel grants will now be paid to athletes , but 10 countries may struggle to get teams to Rio .
`` Never before in the 56-year history of the Paralympic Games have we faced circumstances like this , '' said IPC president Sir Philip Craven .
With 19 days to the start of the Games , the IPC says Rio 's organising committee has not raised enough money to fund the Paralympics .
This is due to Brazil 's struggling economy and the fact that only 12 % of available tickets have so far been sold for the Games , which start on 7 September .
It meant organisers were three weeks late in paying 8m euros ( £7m ) in travel grants to help athletes get to Rio .
But Rio 's mayor Eduardo Paes has secured an additional £36m of funding and £24m in sponsorship from state-run companies after an injunction was lifted that had blocked further state aid for the Games .
What 's being cut ?
Downsizing of Rio 2016 's workforce for the Paralympics
Changes to the transport services for athletes and their teams
The closure of a number of venue media centres
Moving events to other venues to enable Deodoro Park to be dismantled , allowing the other venues to have dedicated transport hubs
However , security forces currently in place for the Olympics will remain for the Paralympics .
Craven added : `` These cuts are on top of the ones we , together with the International Olympic Committee , have already made in the last 12 months and are likely to impact nearly every stakeholder attending the Games . ''
Organisers were meant to pay travel grants to all 165 participating countries by the end of July . The grants , paid to national Paralympic bodies , cover the travel costs for athletes and officials .
The first instalments will now be paid but the IPC is concerned that the delay could threaten some countries ' participation .
`` Currently we have around 10 countries who , even if the grants are paid , may struggle to cover the cost of their travel to the Games , '' said Craven .
The IPC also said only 290,000 tickets have been sold and it did not expect to see full venues in Rio .
Despite the problems Craven said the Games would `` act as a catalyst to positive social change in Brazil and Latin America '' .
He added : `` We are working desperately hard to protect athlete services , especially within the field of play .
`` They have dedicated their lives to reaching these Games and we will do our utmost to try to maintain the service levels and scope that they expect at a Paralympic Games . ''

The British Paralympic Association says it is `` worried '' about the situation .
In a statement it said : `` The news about the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games is worrying given the obviously constrained budgets and significant reductions in service levels for venues , transport , provision for the media and other stakeholders .
`` London 2012 proudly showed the world what was possible and we want Rio to be the next stage of that positive journey . The IPC 's announcement makes clear that there is major risk to that . ''
Richard Lane , from disability charity Scope , added : `` It 's incredibly disappointing to hear that disabled athletes are being short-changed and face competing in empty stadiums .
`` With more than two weeks to go , we hope the organisers can address these issues and ensure the Games are a success . ''
Analysis
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson , who has won 11 Paralympic gold medals , on BBC Radio 5 live :
`` As much as London was amazing , we really hoped Rio would be another step up . They have successful teams , media sponsorship , but when they bid for the Games they were in a different financial and political position .
`` Part of me thinks the IPC has been quite bold in going public to put pressure on the government to step up and deliver the Games they want to deliver .
`` But what really worries athletes is events running on time and transport to the venues .
`` Those are the bits they need to concentrate on right now to make sure it happens .
`` Where we are really lucky in the British team is having the resources and set-up to mitigate much of this . It 's desperately disappointing for athletes who potentially ca n't get there . Maybe some of the better-off countries can step in and do whatever we can . ''
Sen. Ben Cardin said Friday that there is “ no question ” Russia attempt to interfere in the U.S. presidential election , but acknowledged they did not determine the outcome .
“ There is no question that Russia tried to influence our election , ” Mr. Cardin , Maryland Democrat , said on CNN . “ That is now well established . They tried to influence the election in favor of [ President ] Trump . ”
“ There were many connections between Russia and representatives of the Trump campaign , ” he added . “ The investigations taking place are going to give us some of those answers . ”
When asked if he believed Russia rigged the outcome of the election for Mr. Trump , Mr. Cardin said “ no . ”
“ No , I 'm no suggesting the outcome was determined by Russia , but we do know Russia tried to influence the outcome of our election , ” he said . “ That 's a very serious matter , and we also know there were contacts made with members of the Trump campaign . That 's very disturbing . ”

It wo n't be long now , less than 3 weeks in fact . We 'll all do a spot of googling to find out which channel , ITV4 ? BT Sport ? Some of us will be up to date quicker than the official Spurs website . We 'll all be there . The Europa League . I 've been fortunate enough to get to know a good number well informed and genuinely nice Spurs fans in the Twitter community in the last two years , and the majority will watch our Europa League games , though perhaps with varying degrees of interest . But should we care ?
A while ago we had a taste of the Champions League , and we liked it . We were one Arjen Robben penalty away from tasting it again . The Champions League brings big money , big players and an unparalleled sense of achievement . So why should we care about the Europa League ?
Realism
We 've got the 6th highest wage bill in the league , the 10th biggest stadium , consistently sell our best players and ca n't compete with Man City , Chelsea , or Man Utd for spending power . We do n't have the historical allure of Liverpool and have n't been able to consistently offer Champions League football like our hated rivals Arsenal . There 's a strong argument to say 6th is about right for Spurs . I do n't necessarily buy that , and if Pochettino can be given the kind of backing that was denied AVB from the board and fans , then I believe we can achieve Champions League football again within two or three years . But in recent seasons the word ‘ ambition ' seems to have become a byword for delusion and entitlement . I 've made an argument before ( see far below ) that Harry 's achievement of 4th on both occasions were done so in ages of unprecedented turbulence at other clubs , along with the most talented Spurs line-ups you 're likely to see in some time . It 's worth knowing where we sit . Gooners can bait us with “ you should know your place ” and honestly ? Perhaps , for the short term we should . It will make future progress all the sweeter . Realistically we 've been in and around the Europa league for some time , so its worth accepting that and embracing it temporarily , as anything else will just lead to resentment .
It 's a European competition
You would n't believe it sometimes given the media hype for the Champions League , but it 's true . The Europa league/UEFA cup has a proud history and exposes the squad to European football . Back in 2012-13 we played successive games against Lyon , Inter and Basel , all of whom have been Champions League regulars in recent seasons . That sort of exposure is vital for our players , and in the words of the great Bill Nicholson “ If we 're not in Europe .. We 're nothing .. ”
In recent seasons the word ‘ ambition ' seems to have become a byword for delusion and entitlement
Co-efficient
Yes , probably the saddest argument of the lot , but important nonetheless . Winning games and generally participating in European competition brings co-efficient points to clubs which determines seeding in subsequent group draws . Liverpool , having not progressed far in their Europa League attempts and missing last season entirely now face the rather daunting prospect of being 3rd or even 4th seeds for their Champions League group when the draw is made thanks to being 45th in the coefficient rankings . Spurs , by contrast are 16th , and were we to achieve the Champions League this year , far-fetched though it may seem , we would be second seeds . The same ‘ ambitious ' fans who despise the Europa League may thank it should we reach the Champions League and have a favourable draw .
We could win it
There 's not a single game that comes up in the Europa League where every Spurs fan thinks “ ah , we 'll get tonked here ” . Unlike the Champions League , where , by the quarter finals you know your luck will run out soon . I just ca n't accept the idea of regularly participating in a competition you have no prospect of winning . When the Champions League does happen for Spurs , I 'd like us to be a good deal stronger than we are now and not contribute towards this farcical self-serving nonsense perpetuated by the media that being in it is enough . Competitions are there to be won , not so rich men in suits can slap each other on the back over a lucrative sponsorship deal .
Watching Spurs win is good
Among all the turmoil of August-December last year , watching us win every group was pleasant , blessed relief . Soldado even managed a hat-trick . Who does n't like watching their team win ? !
Squad rotation
The top teams all have two players in every position . The difference between Spurs and Chelsea is that we ca n't pay £200k to a player with the promise of a trophy most seasons . Our fringe player want games , and the Europa League provides a good opportunity to play the squad and let everyone fight for their place . And lastly…
What else would you do on a Thursday night ?
There 's more uplifting baseball news on the Blue Jays ' front . Toronto has hired former Expos ' all-star Tim Raines as a roving minor-league coach and coordinator within the farm system . That 's a great hire .
There are no major-league responsibilities right now , although Raines will be a visible presence with the major-league club at early spring training and likely on several exhibition bus trips .
The former NL batting champion and four-time league stolen base king will be asked to counsel young Jays ' outfielders and baserunners throughout the farm system , replacing Rich Miller . The 53-year-old , who made his debut in 1979 with the Expos , had been out of baseball . Welcome back . Even though it 's officially a minor-league hiring , it 's a great move by GM Alex Anthopoulos on several levels .
First is the fact that bringing Raines into the fold acknowledges the rich history of major-league baseball in this nation , even as the Jays are gaining real momentum in La Belle Province .
Second , Raines is being hired before he is able to add the inevitable “ HoF # 30 ” at the end of his official and soon-to-be more valuable autograph , as is the right of every immortal at Cooperstown .
It wo n't be this year , but fact is if the Jays had waited until after Raines was voted into the Hall of Fame , even though it may take a few years , it would seem like opportunism . The Sanford , Fla. , native will likely not earn 75 per cent of the votes cast this time , but his candidacy is gaining traction .
Third positive ? Two of the best outfield prospects in the Jays ' current system , project with similar tools and skill sets to Raines . They are both high draft picks from June 2012 , D.J . Davis and Anthony Alford . Raines will be able to help them tremendously . Raines knows their issues on and off the field . He was a second baseman , not a natural outfielder . He had a below average outfield arm , but it made him have to work harder , charging base hits with quick release and hitting the cutoff man .
The Jays ' young prospects will listen to a man with a similar background who has been there , done it , made mistakes and found redemption along the way . It adds to his credibility with the message .
Alford could be the main prospect to get inspiration from Raines ' personal story . The 18-year-old from rural Mississippi dropped to the third round of the '12 draft despite five-tool major-league potential . The reason was he was committed to Southern Miss to be their quarterback . The Jays took him as the best athlete available and signed him only after they agreed to let him play football .
How did that work out ? In December , after his Golden Eagles football team went 0-12 and he lost his starting QB role , Alford was arrested on campus for aggravated assault , charges that have since been reduced to conspiracy to possess a weapon on school property . Still not good . He has since transferred to Ole Miss for 2013 , but clearly , his troubled future now lies in baseball .
Raines is the perfect mentor to bring into the Jays ' organization as a confidant for Alford , whether this was Anthopoulos 's intent or not . He also has a troubled history . After two Expos callups in 1979-80 , Raines broke into the NL with a bang at age 21 . He finished second to Fernando Valenzuela as rookie of the year in a strike-shortened '81 seasons , stealing 71 bases in 88 games .
After that rookie season , Raines went home to Florida with money and fame and could not handle it . The '82 seasons was marred by inexplicable mood swings and loss of focus . On his 22nd birthday , Sept. 29 , a story appeared in the Toronto Star by Wayne Parrish outlining a season ruined by drug use . It was his personal sophomore jinx and threatened to ruin his career .
This was early in MLB 's awareness of its own drug abuse problems . The Expos quietly sent Raines to a California drug rehab centre . We decided that our troubled star was not going to be subjected to a daily Q & A regarding his drug-addled season , but there was a story needed to be told as part of the recovery . We leaked the info to Michael Farber , then of The Gazette , now with TSN 's The Reporters . It was the right media choice in getting the message told in a sensitive , well thought out manner . The confession was cathartic for Raines and a warning for other young players in baseball .
On the first day that Raines reported to 1983 training camp in West Palm Beach and had his one-time-only mea culpa presser on the field , he finished and turned to join his mates . Andre Dawson walked up and wrapped his arm around his friend and squeezed and for the next 20 years as a major-leaguer , the Hawk was a positive influence that never let go . It 's why , in my mind , Dawson had to go to Cooperstown ahead of Raines . Without the Hawk there would have been no Rock .
Welcome back to baseball Mr. Raines and teach Mr. Alford well .
Half the world economy is one accident away from a deflation trap . The International Monetary Fund says the probability may now be as high as 20pc .
It is a remarkable state of affairs that the G2 monetary superpowers - the US and China - should both be tightening into such a 20pc risk , though no doubt they have concluded that asset bubbles are becoming an even bigger danger .
`` We need to be extremely vigilant , '' said the IMF 's Christine Lagarde in Davos . `` The deflation risk is what would occur if there was a shock to those economies now at low inflation rates , way below target . I do n't think anyone can dispute that in the eurozone , inflation is way below target . ''
It is not hard to imagine what that shock might be . It is already before us as Turkey , India and South Africa all slam on the brakes , forced to defend their currencies as global liquidity drains away .
The World Bank warns in its latest report - Capital Flows and Risks in Developing Countries - that the withdrawal of stimulus by the US Federal Reserve could throw a `` curve ball '' at the international system .
`` If market reactions to tapering are precipitous , developing countries could see flows decline by as much as 80pc for several months , '' it said . A quarter of these economies risk a sudden stop . `` While this adjustment might be short-lived , it is likely to inflict serious stresses , potentially heightening crisis risks . ''
The report said they may need capital controls to navigate the storm - or technically to overcome the `` Impossible Trinity '' of monetary autonomy , a stable exchange rate and free flows of funds . William Browder from Hermitage says that is exactly where the crisis is leading , and it will be sobering for investors to learn that their money is locked up - already the case in Cyprus , and starting in Egypt . The chain-reaction becomes self-fulfilling . `` People will start asking themselves which country is next , '' he said .
Emerging markets are now half the global economy , so we are in uncharted waters . Roughly $ 4 trillion of foreign funds swept into emerging markets after the Lehman crisis , much of it by then `` momentum money '' late to the party . The IMF says $ 470bn is directly linked to money printing by the Fed . `` We do n't know how much of this is going to come out again , or how quickly , '' said an official from the Fund .
One country after another is now having to tighten into weakness . The longer this goes on , and the wider it spreads , the greater the risk that it will metamorphose into a global deflationary shock .
Turkey 's central bank took drastic steps on Tuesday night to halt capital flight , doubling its repurchase rate from 4.5pc to 10pc . This will bring the economy to a standstill in short order , and may ultimately prove as futile as Britain 's ideological defence of the ERM in September 1992 .
South Africa raised rates on Wednesday by half a point to 5.5pc to defend the rand , and India raised a quarter-point to 8pc on Tuesday , all forced to grit their teeth as growth fizzles . Brazil and Indonesia have already been through this for months to stem a currency slide that risks turning malign at any moment .
Others are in better shape - mostly because their current accounts are in surplus - but even they are losing room for manoeuvre . Chile and Peru need to cut rates to counter the metals slump , but dare not risk it in this unforgiving climate .
Russia has a foot in recession but can not take action to kickstart growth as the ruble falls to a record low against the euro . The central bank is burning reserves at a rate of $ 400m a day to defend the currency , de facto tightening . As for Ukraine , Argentina and Thailand , they are already spinning out of control .
China is marching to its own tune with a closed capital account and reserves of $ 3.8 trillion , but it too is sending a powerful deflationary impulse worldwide . Last year it added $ 5 trillion in new plant and fixed investment - as much as the US and Europe combined - flooding the global economy with yet more excess capacity .
Markets have a touching faith that the same Politburo responsible for a spectacular credit bubble worth $ 24 trillion - one and a half times larger than the US banking system - will now manage to deflate it gently with a skill that eluded the Fed in 1928 , the Bank of Japan in 1990 and the Bank of England in 2007 .
Manoj Pradhan , from Morgan Stanley , says that China 's central bank is trying to deleverage and raise rates at the same time , which `` amplifies risks to growth '' . This is a heroic undertaking , like surgery without anaesthetic . It is the exact opposite of what the Fed did after 2008 when QE helped cushion the shock . Morgan Stanley says that 45pc of all private credit in China must be refinanced over the next 12 months , so fasten your seatbelts .
Moreover , China is struggling to keep its industries humming at the current exchange rate . Patrick Artus , from Natixis , says surging wages - and falling productivity - mean that it now costs 10pc more to produce the Airbus A320 in Tianjing than it does in Toulouse .
The implications are obvious . China may at some stages try to steer down the yuan to hold on to market share , whatever they say in the US Congress , partly to stop Japan stealing a march with its 30pc devaluation under Abenomics . Albert Edwards from Société Générale say this may prove the ultimate deflationary shock , dwarfing the 1998 Asia crisis .
Europe has let its defences collapse behind a Maginot Line of orthodox monetary policy . Eurostat data show that Italy , Spain , Holland , Portugal , Greece , Estonia , Slovenia , Slovakia , Latvia , as well as euro-pegged Denmark , Hungary , Bulgaria and Lithuania have all been in outright deflation since May , once tax rises are stripped out . Underlying prices have been dropping in Poland and the Czech Republic since July , and France since August .
Eurozone M3 money growth has been negative for eight months , contracting at a rate of 1.1pc over the past quarter . Bank credit to the private sector has fallen by €155bn in three months , according to the latest data from the European Central Bank .
The ECB 's Mario Draghi talked up the need for a `` safety margin '' against deflation before Christmas but now seems strangely passive , as if beaten into submission by the Bundesbank . I heard him twice in Davos repeating - woodenly , without conviction - that core inflation is merely back to where it was in 1999 after the Asian crisis and in 2009 after the Lehman crisis , and therefore benign .
We are not in remotely comparable circumstances . Those two events were at the outset of a new credit cycle . Right now we are nearly five years into an old cycle - already long in the tooth - and 80pc of the global economy is tightening or cutting stimulus . As matters stand , the next recession will push the Western economic system over the edge into deflation .
The US has a slightly bigger buffer , but not much . Growth of M2 money has been slowing even faster than it did in the nine months before the Lehman crash in 2008 , but then the Fed no longer pays any attention to such data so it may all too easily repeat the mistake . The Fed is surely courting fate with $ 10bn of bond tapering each meeting into the teeth of incipient deflation , as Minneapolis Fed chief Narayana Kocherlakota keeps warning .
Those who think deflation is harmless should listen to the Bank of Japan 's Haruhiko Kuroda , who has lived through 15 years of falling prices . Corporate profits dried up . Investment in technology atrophied . Innovation fizzled out . `` It created a very negative mindset in Japan , '' he said .
Japan had the highest real interest rates in the rich world , leading to a compound interest spiral as the debt burden rose on a base of shrinking nominal GDP .
Any such outcome in Europe would send Club Med debt trajectories through the roof . It would doom all hope of halting Europe 's economic decline or reducing mass unemployment before the democracies of the afflicted countries go into seizure . So why are they letting it happen ?
Though the film starts a bit slowly , with hefty doses of introduction and exposition , it gradually attains velocity , depicting politics not merely as the binary struggle between opposing forces to which we have become all too accustomed ( though there are elements of this characterization as well ) , but as a three-dimensional puzzle to be solved . There are a handful of occasions when Spielberg lays the uplift on a bit thick , John Williams 's score swelling like a bladder , but for the most part the movie is lively and full of wit . The deep and varied cast—David Strathairn , Hal Holbrook , James Spader , John Hawkes , Jackie Earle Haley , Tim Blake Nelson , Jared Harris , and many others—depict a compelling universe of political personalities orbiting the president . And if Tommy Lee Jones , playing Rep. Thaddeus Stevens , always comes across rather more than Tommy Lee Jones than as the iconic abolitionist—well , there are worse things .
Lincoln fares less well when it turns its focus to the president 's private life , in particular wife Mary 's continuing grief over the premature death of their son Willie , and both parents ' resistance to the entreaties by their eldest son , Robert , that he be allowed to enlist . The humanizing purpose of these scenes is apparent enough , but here Day-Lewis is let down by his co-stars . As Robert , Joseph Gordon-Levitt is forgettable , his role considerably smaller than his billing might lead one to believe . The casting of Sally Field as Mary is more problematic . Like Jones , she is too recognizably herself ; but where the script furnishes the former with countless opportunities to deploy his mordant wit , Field 's relatively thankless role offers few compensations for her failure of mimesis . Contemplating history 's judgment late in the film , Mary laments to her husband , `` All anyone will remember is that I was crazy and I ruined your happiness . '' Despite the screen time afforded her , the film offers little to enrich or complicate this verdict .
Which brings us , at last , to Day-Lewis . In past great performances—as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood , for instance , or Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York—Day-Lewis created figures of such simmering ferocity that they threatened to burn a hole in the screen . Here , by contrast , he wisely opts for understatement , receding gently into his characterization . Lincoln , after all , is already larger than life . The trick lies in bringing him down to a comprehensible size .
In Day-Lewis 's hands , the Great Emancipator is alternatingly droll and melancholy , sure of his arguments yet eager to engage with others ' , part self-taught intellectual and part tricky lawyer . ( `` It is n't our Southern states that are in rebellion , '' he explains amiably at one point , `` but only the rebels in our Southern states . '' ) Most of all , he is an inveterate aphorist , ever eager to illustrate his points by spinning tales -- most of them presumably tall . ( Among them , he shares the funniest scatological joke about George Washington I expect ever to hear . )

In May 23 , the Iraqi joint forces launched Fallujah battle , which is one of ISIS strongholds in Anbar province . Thirty three days later , in the 26th of June , Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi announced the liberation of Fallujah , raising the Iraqi flag inside the city and saying : ” As promised , this is an Iraqi Flag held high in Fallujah . We did it earlier in Tikrit , Ramadi and Jurf Sakher and we will do it in Hawijah and Mosul . ”
In the other side , the extremist group still holed up inside the Syrian city , Manbij . The city is totally surrounded by the Syrian Democratic Forces troops which are supported by the International Coalition warplanes and French-German military experts on the ground .
As to Brett McGurk , the envoy of the US president , the ongoing operations will set the conditions to start advancing toward Raqqa City , he said to the Foreign Relations Committee in the US senate : ” The Manbij operation , it 's ongoing on right now , it 's hard fighting , once that is done , that sets the conditions for Raqqa. ” . Perhaps ISIS does not want its supporters to notice its weakness , so the group is trying to entrench itself by trapping civilians as human shields in order to delay the coming defeat .
On the other hand , fears of what comes after ISIS still exists , especially after the bad experiment in Tel Abyad which is controlled by People 's Protection Units , the major party in the Syrian Democratic forces .
The Daily Beast news website questioned in a long report about the destinies of the city , and threw down the following questions : Who exactly will govern those towns now ? Will it be the Kurds who have led the fight against ISIS ? Or will it be what some in the Pentagon have privately called the “ token Arabs ” trained by the U.S. to accompany them ? .
These questions are for the US administration , which has always turned a blind eye to the PYD known aspirations and the violations committed by these troops in several cities and towns . If PYD troops repeat these violations in Tel Abyad , Hasakah and their suburbs , sensitivities and sectarian tensions will increase and generate Arab-Kurdish protracted conflict .
Back to Iraq , the loss of Fallujah is one of the harshest blows received by ISIS since the declaration of the caliphate in 2014 and controlling wide territory in both Iraq and Syria . But the accompanying events to Fallujah liberation battle and the sectarian practices and declarations by Popular Mobilization Forces make the liberation incomplete . Civilians found themselves between ISIS 's hammer and the anvil of the sectarian militias . Cases of torture and abuse of the civilians will prove ISIS 's assumptions and repeated claims of being the defender of the Sunni Arabs .
Of course , the presence of Qassem Soleimani with the Popular Mobilization during this battle gave bad references and made this battle looks like a part of the Iranian attempts to control over the region especially after the American-Iranian agreement , which is considered by Obama as his most important achievement during his period of presidency .
Of course , attention will be directed towards Mosul , ISIS 's main stronghold in Iraq . Different challenges will face the Iraqi administrations and its American supporters , such as : securing more than one million Iraqi civilians who live in the city and meeting their humanitarian needs , and also keeping the sectarian militias , backed by Iran , far from the city because they consider all civilians to be terrorists and enemies even if they were women or children .
Air strikes , which have already started targeting ISIS locations , will not be enough ; therefore the Iraqi forces will be in a serious test for their effectiveness . And we will see how serious and credible General Robert Otto 's statement is , in which he said : ” The challenge is to find targets that we can strike where we 're not going to inadvertently damage civilians ” .
These losses did not prevent ISIS from committing more terrorist attacks outside its borders ; the most recent was the bombing of Ataturk Airport , which left more than 42 dead and 239 wounded . By this attack , ISIS wanted to deliver a message that expelling the group out of its controlled cities is not enough to declare victory .
In fact , launching raids over innocent civilians in Raqqa , Mosul and other cities will not defeat ISIS . In order to defeat the terrorist group you must first get rid of the causes that have helped ISIS to arise , injustice and tyranny .

Washington ( CNN ) Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said Thursday it 's `` looking more likely '' that she 'll run for president in 2016 , though she acknowledged she faces challenges in the wide-open Republican presidential primary field .
In an interview on Boston Herald Radio , Fiorina said her primary concern right now is introducing herself to voters , and raising enough money to compete .
`` Of course people do n't know me and they need to get to know me , '' Fiorina said . `` Do we need to raise money ? Yes . Do we need to raise as much money as Jeb Bush ? No . ''
Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush 's team has telegraphed plans to raise $ 100 million in the first quarter of the year , an eye-popping sum intended to discourage some of his potential GOP opponents from the race . Fiorina said , however , she believes there are other ways to compete .
`` Money is important , but money is not everything , and I actually think good , old-fashioned , on-the-ground , reach-out politics counts for a lot , '' she said .

A few months ago , I spent a couple of days in Manchester . I 've already blogged about the brilliant museums I visited whilst I was up there ( the People 's History Museum , and the Imperial War Museum North ) , but I also found some great protest stickers whilst exploring the city . Paying attention to a city 's protest stickers helps me get to know a place , by giving me an insight into the issues that matter to the city . Manchester had a lot of protest stickers , many of which I had n't seen before , which is just one of the reasons I liked it so much . Manchester is a vibrant city with a fascinating history . Protest stickers in some cities are dominated by only one or two issues ( Newcastle , for example , had a lot of stickers relating to animal rights ) , but this was not the case in Manchester . Its diversity is reflected in the wide range of issues that are represented in the city 's stickers . There were also a lot of stickers in Manchester that I have n't seen before ; I have not seen any of the stickers featured in the post anywhere else . I 'm not saying they are all unique to Manchester , but it is an indication of the city 's healthy culture of dissent .

What 's the Life Expectancy of That Appliance ?
A friend recently mentioned that appliances seemed to be dying prematurely for his neighbors and wondered if his were next . He bought new construction about five years ago and knew of multiple neighbors replacing their hot water heater or microwave .
I thought five years seemed about right for the microwave but agreed the hot water heater should have lasted longer . The conversation had me wondering what is the normal life span for household appliances we consider necessities .
Factors in Appliance Life
The amount of use is going to impact how long the appliance lasts . A large family is going to have more wear and tear on the clothes washer and dryer or the dishwasher than a single person or couple . Of course , wear and tear can be mitigated by repair or replacement of damaged parts and much of this repair is within the purview of the homeowner .
Numerous sources are available for replacement parts . For example , GE Parts can be purchased by the consumer directly from General Electric 's corporate site or from third party retailers like Partselect.com . One of the advantages of using a third party online retailer is that they can often provide tutorial videos and help lines .
It 's important to take care of your appliances to extend their useful life . For a refrigerator this means cleaning the coils and gaskets regularly . That microwave needs the filters in the vent hood cleaned monthly . Charcoal filters need to be replaced every 6-12 months .
Sometimes it is worth paying more for a product with a longer warranty . Installing a water heater can cost several hundred dollars . Consider the installation costs when comparing water heaters that range from a 6 year to 12-year warranty period .
With new construction , the builder might have purchased high-end appliances with shorter useful life warranties and projections .
Appliance Life Expectancy
The important thing to remember about stated appliance useful life is that it is an average . You might have the bad luck to be on the low end . If you 're not willing to take the chance , that 's why they offer extended warranties ( although I do n't recommend them in general ) .
According to Mr. Appliance , the life span of the microwave oven is 5-10 years with an average of 8 years . The gas water heater can live 5-13 years with an average of 9 years of use . My friend 's neighbors ended up with the short end of the life spans .
———– $ $ $ $ $ ———-
The conversation spurred me to evaluate the age of our appliances . We 've replaced all of them since moving in four years ago with one exception . The water heater is at the average life span . Let 's hope it 's a couple of years before I write about replacing it . : ) . How do you extend the life of appliances ?
GOP says action makes Nashville a 'sanctuary city ; ' Council members say it does not
Republican legislators are threatening action as Metro Nashville tries to codify restricting cooperation with federal immigration officials .
On Tuesday night , Metro Council passed the ordinance on second reading . A third and final vote is on track for next month . As sister publication the Nashville Scene reported after the meeting :
Although the ordinance would largely formalize Metro 's current posture with relation to immigration enforcement , it has become a sort of proxy for a whole set of debates surrounding immigration in the wake of President Donald Trump 's election . The bill 's sponsor , Councilman Bob Mendes , has been at pains to emphasize that it does not make Nashville a `` sanctuary city . '' Instead , it would prohibit Metro funds , facilities or resources from being used to enforce federal immigration laws and would also seek to prevent the Davidson County Sheriff 's Office from responding to voluntary detainer requests from federal immigration agencies unless they are accompanied by a warrant . In other words , the ordinance would have Metro cooperate with the feds when such cooperation is legally required , but that 's it . The council ultimately advanced the bill on second reading by a 25-8 vote . The council deferred until August a second ordinance that would end an agreement between Metro and the federal government that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to make use of a certain number of beds in the local Nashville jail . Mendes has cited public safety as a main motivation for the bill , arguing that uncertainty about immigration enforcement has led local immigrant communities to shy away from calling the police or bringing their children to be immunized for fear that they 'll be swept up in the Trump administration crackdown . Those arguments were repeated Tuesday by Mendes and co-sponsor Councilman Colby Sledge .
However , several Republicans say the ordinance does indeed make Nashville a `` sanctuary city '' in violation of a 2009 state law . That law 's sponsor , state Sen. Jim Tracy ( R-Shelbyville ) , issued a press release Wednesday blasting the ordinance and threatening legislative action .
`` There is a high cost to illegal immigration for our cities , counties and state , '' said Tracy . `` That is why we took action in 2009 to prevent it . The ordinance passed yesterday clearly defies the letter and the spirit of our state law . ''
Tracy said if the ordinance is adopted on third reading , he will request an opinion as to its legality from the Attorney General 's office .
State Sen. Mae Beavers commented that if elected governor she `` will use the powers of the Governor 's office to defund any city in Tennessee that chooses to violate state and federal laws by embracing and encouraging illegal aliens to locate to our state . '' And Bill Lee , another gubernatorial candidate , called the ordinance `` a reckless policy '' that he `` would use every tool at my disposal to halt the adoption of . ''
On Thursday morning , Metro Councilman Jeremy Elrod responded on Twitter with screenshots of applicable provisions and a link to the ordinance , saying , `` Nashville 's proposed immigration ordinance says in four places Metro must comply w/ federal , state or applicable law . Then it says if anything in the ordinance runs afoul of federal or state law , that portion is automatically void . ''
But U.S. Rep. Diane Black , who is reputed to be entering the Tennessee gubernatorial primary in the next few weeks , posted on Facebook , `` I am appalled and disgusted that those in a position to lead are using their voice to obstruct immigration law , putting illegal aliens first and Tennessee families last . I implore the Nashville City Council to consider the dangerous implications this will have on our families , and I urge you to fulfill the promise you made to Tennesseans , when you took an oath of office , to protect those you serve . ''
Black later tweeted , with a link to an article about the meeting , `` When justice is n't enforced to full extent & no follow-thru of deportation , ur essentially commuting sentences of dangerous criminal aliens . ''
But many of the most recent targets of U.S. Immigration , Customs and Enforcement are members of Nashville 's massive Kurdish community , who have been in the country for decades . One man was rounded up by ICE because 15 years ago he sold alcohol to a minor , an infraction for which he had long since served all applicable penalties . ICE officials have also been posing as police officers , which they are not . Mayor Megan Barry has sent a letter requesting a halt to the practice .
Nashville Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper has sent a letter to the Iraqi ambassador questioning what will happen to any deported Kurds . Many Kurds fear deportations back to Iraq will likely result in death . `` It is vitally important to determine if the dangers they could face abroad entitle them to at least temporary protection from removal , '' Cooper wrote .
Gov . Bill Haslam said he talked to Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security Commissioner David Purkey on Monday to `` help us understand what 's prompting this '' and said Purkey is in discussions with his federal counterparts about the ICE situation . A federal judge in Michigan was asked to halt the deportations on Wednesday after the ACLU filed a lawsuit , but any ruling will not affect the Nashville Kurdish community .
Haslam said he will `` wait and see '' what happens with the Metro ordinance before forming an opinion as to whether action by the state is necessary , adding , `` I would n't be surprised , just having watched [ them ] , if the legislature reacts if [ Metro ] Council does pass that . ''
( September 22 , 2016 ) Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has released a new video designed help to organize supporters and allies around the issue of opening up the 2016 presidential debates to allow for more than two candidates .
The new video recounts the candidate 's 2012 arrest with her then running mate Cheri Honkala when the pair attempted to enter the presidential debate at Hofstra University .
The video also invites supporters to visit the campaign 's debate organizing hub at Jill2016.com/debates , where they are offered several possible ways to help the current effort .
The debate organizing site includes a link to RSVP for this year 's protests at Hofstra which will take place this Monday , September 26 .
Volunteers can also make an optional pledge to take part in non-violent civil disobedience : http : //www.jill2016.com/nonviolent_civil_disobedience .
Other ways to support the effort include signing Jill Stein 's Open the Debates Petition , phone banking , and contacting the debate commission directly . The petition has garnered more than 100,000 signatures , which supporters say indicates strong public support for more open presidential debates .
It was May when globalization came to Lebien , a small town in Poland . The telephone rang and Elzbieta Religa answered . The caller said she represented Lane Energy , a subsidiary of a British company that invests in natural resources . She said her boss wanted to speak with Religa and told her that the company had found something interesting in the earth beneath Lebien 's homes and farms .
Religa is a sturdy-looking farmer with three hectares ( 7.4 acres ) of land , 20 hogs and three dogs . Lebien is in the northern Polish region of Kashubia , some 90 kilometers ( 56 miles ) from Gdansk . The town has 960 inhabitants and only its main street is paved . Most of the houses were built by Germans before World War II .
`` The woman said there 's gas here , '' says Religa . `` Thousands of meters below the earth , locked into the rock , but somehow they can get it out . '' Religa is currently serving her third term as the Soltys , or mayor , of Lebien . She invited the people from Lane Energy to a meeting at town hall . They arrived in small buses , managers and engineers , Americans , Britons , Canadians and one Indian . The guests paid for a lavish buffet .
The company built its first drilling rig a few months later . One evening , Religa saw a bright light on the other side of a forested area . Lane was burning off the first of the gas being pumped out of the well . The flames were as tall as houses .
Now the drill hole has been sealed with a head-high pipe and three valve wheels . Thanks to the gas , thousands of new jobs will soon be created in Poland -- and elsewhere .
Tapping Unconventional Sources
In many parts of the world , geologists are now testing the ground for natural gas trapped in shale ( shale gas ) , sandstone ( tight gas ) or coal seams , gas that has been largely unreachable in the past . Using a new technology called hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking , '' a sort of controlled earthquake , companies are now bringing the gas to the surface all over the globe , in Australia , China , India , Indonesia , Latin America and Europe . The entire planet is being resurveyed .
The authorities in Poland have awarded 70 concessions for exploratory drilling in the last two years . The race for the best reserves is also in full swing in Canada , where the Chinese are leading the pack . The Chinese energy company PetroChina has just spent $ 5.4 billion ( 3.9 billion ) on a Canadian project .
In the United States , however , the natural gas revolution is the furthest along . Newly discovered reserves there are already being exploited .
About half of the natural gas consumed in the United States now comes from so-called unconventional sources . The country has already replaced Russia as the world 's leading natural gas producer . `` We have twice as much gas as the Saudis have oil , '' boasts Texan investor T. Boone Pickens .
The euphoria is being fueled all the more by current global fears of new oil price shocks . The crisis in the Middle East makes it painfully clear , once again , how dependent the world 's economy is on petroleum reserves in the Arab world -- and how sensitively prices and growth react to any changes in the region .
When the unrest began in Libya , the international commodities markets fell into a panic within hours . The oil price , which had hovered around $ 80 to $ 90 for months , broke through the magic $ 100-a-barrel ( 159 liters ) barrier within hours and peaked at about $ 117 on Friday .
This was not so much a factor of Libya being such an important supplier on world markets . What had traders and dealers so concerned and triggered worldwide panic buys was the fear that the crisis could spread to the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) and Saudi Arabia .
Together , the UAE and Saudi Arabia are sitting on the world 's largest oil reserves . Unrest with possible interruptions in delivery would drive the price of oil to astronomic heights . The most recent upturn in the global economy would come to a precipitous end -- yet again .
Since the last oil price crisis in the 1970s , the industrialized nations have been trying to reduce their dependency on oil from the OPEC countries , with moderate success .
The world 's thirst for energy is massive , and there are few alternatives to oil . This could make the exploitation of the new natural gas reserves all the more important .
Now that Marvel Studios has finally acknowledged that principal photography on Doctor Strange is well underway , and that Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mads Mikklesen are among the cast members , both actors were recently pressed for details about their roles in the much-anticipated Phase 3 movie.Mikklesen , fully aware of those Marvel snipers , remained tight-lipped when IGN asked about his Doctor Strange character . However , he did reveal whether or not he has started filming.said the Danish actor.Meanwhile , Chiwetel Ejiofor was speaking with Vulture about his new film The Secret In Their Eyes when the inevitable questions about his role as Baron Mordo in Doctor Strange came upsaid the English actor when asked about possibly appearing in Marvel sequels . “ When asked if it 's safe to assume Baron Mordo will be an antagonist to Benedict Cumberbatch 's Sorcerer Supreme , and what drew him to this role , Ejiofor seemingly tensed up.he replied.Anyhow , is currently shooting on sound stages in London , England and will soon move to Hong Kong . The Marvel production was also spotted last week shooting in New York under the working title , as opposed to the initially-reported . What do you think ?
This is the first part of a two part series about how to set up leaflet maps to show zipcode areas with some extra data coming along for the ride allowing us to color the zip code areas based on demographics or any other reporting data . I did this using an ASP.NET MVC site and Web API with a Sql Server database . A database is required for this approach but there 's nothing stopping you from reimplementing this in your backend architecture of choice .
Here 's what it looks like sans the external controls on the page to change reporting parameters and the coloring function ( more on that later ) .
This part will focus on getting the zipcode data into your db and your backend set up to serve it out in JSON , ready for leaflet maps to receive it .
1 . Get the census shape data
First up is getting the basic boundary data for all the zip codes in the US . Luckily our handy census bureau is kind enough to provide this . Head on over to data.gov and get the line shapefile . Inside that zip file should be a ~816mb .shp file .
2 . Shrink it up with QGIS
The level of detail is really way more than we need for leaflet , so to spare everyone slow loading times we 're going to simplify some of the geometry in the shape file . QGIS is a free tool that can open up the .shp file and simplify it . To do that , add the layer by going to the menu Vector > Geometry > Simplify Geometry . I used the simplification of 0.0003 to get the file down from the ~816m down to ~96mb . Have the shrinker save it to a new file for the next step . If you 've never seen the whole US zip code map before it 's quite the sight ! .
3 . Convert the shape into GeoJSON
Leaflet needs all this shape data in a standard JSON format so to get it from .shp to GeoJSON we need FWTools . Thanks to the GIS Collective for their tutorial on this step . Once you have the FWTools installed go to their bin directory and run the ogr2ogr command to convert the file :
C : \Program Files ( x86 ) \FWTools2.4.7\bin > ogr2ogr.exe -f `` geoJSON '' `` C :
ew-path\simp.js '' `` C : \old-path\simp3.shp ''
With the JSON overhead the file is now sitting at around 175mb . If you 're feeling like a mean web developer you could make your clients download that file for their map now ; ) However , I was feeling generous so let 's get the data into a DB so we only serve up what they really need to see .
4 . Create your table
5 . Get the data into your DB
Now we need to import our GeoJSON data into the database but also pick up where each zip code is at . If you crack open the .js file now you can see that each row after the first few lines has some meta data about what zip code it is and its latitude and longitude . Since this will be a one time deal I got hacky and wrote a simple LinqPad script to loop through the lines and put it in the DB . Here it is for convienience but it requires you to chop off everything but the contents of the features array inside the .js file .
Got ta love those hard coded string positions . If I wanted to waste any more brain cycles on this little bit I 'd run it through a proper parser and then import but the quick and dirty way was faster here .
If you were paying close attention you would have noticed there 's a point column in the table we created . This is a nifty feature of Sql Server that allows us to store a proper latitude longitude point in a single column which can be queried against in a much more elegant way as we 'll see later . Pre storing this in a column instead of creating it in the query is muuuuch faster . Promise .
UPDATE zipcode_geojson SET point = geography : :Point ( latitude , longitude , 4326 )
Optionally , you can now update the point column to be non-nullable if you want to crack your DBA whip .
7 . Get some demographic data
This is also optional , but makes the results much more interesting . I opted to get a cheap zipcode demographic database from easydbs.com for $ 30 . It comes with a decent amount of data about income/age/population which is just what I was looking for . Here 's their schema for reference that I 'm working off of .
8 . Serve it up
This is the most complicated bit to get the JSON data out of the database , join it together with with the demographic data , and serve it back out as JSON . Quickly . To do this I 've got some help from Dapper to get the data from Sql Server into objects , and C # Async to fetch any other reporting data at the same time as the zipcode data since that can also take a bit of time .
Let 's start with the geoJSON model that queries the zipcode database we worked so hard to get .
I started with the circle approach of fetching zips based on the center point of the map and some radius based on zoom until I realized I could get the lat/long corners of the leaflet map . A future improvement would be to expand the query viewport slightly to capture the zips who 's center is outside the boundaries but still has area inside the viewport .
To explain the model a bit , the zipCombined class is used for the query result we get out of sql server that has the demographic data joined in . The rest of the geoX classes are the format of GeoJSON strongly typed out ( save for the geoGeometry coordinates which are complicated and do n't need to be strongly typed for what we need to do ) .
Onto the controller :
The basic idea is to fetch the zip data and any other reporting data simultaneously , wait for both to finish , join up the results , and then pop it on down to the client . I also was originally saving the client from calculating the min and max revenue but ended up doing it on the client side anyways . You might also notice notice I 'm using a closure with the httpContext in GetReportingDataAsync . This has to be passed as a parameter to an async function if you want to use it for caching .
This just about wraps it up for the backend part of getting some wonderful leaflet maps on your page with zip code data . One final thought about serving up this massive stack of JSON zip code data , make sure you have gzip enabled on your server . The responses for a decent size area were upwards of 5mb without compression on and less than 500kb once I got it set up .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street 's biggest banks remain convinced the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by June 2015 , a Reuters poll found , and economists also said the market was underestimating how aggressively the U.S. central bank will tighten policy .
A detail from the front of the United States Federal Reserve Board building is shown in Washington October 28 , 2014 . REUTERS/Gary Cameron
Fourteen of 19 primary dealers , or the banks that deal directly with the Fed , said they expect the first rate hike by June 2015 , with borrowing costs rising to 1 percent at the end of that year .
The survey results show that Wall Street 's top economists were unmoved by a volatile sell-off last month and an October Fed statement that was viewed as hawkish .
In a survey taken in early October , 15 of 19 primary dealers also said the Fed would raise interest rates in June . Even in a separate survey done after stocks tumbled in a volatile week of trading last month , 24 of 47 economists still predicted a June rate hike .
The latest view , that the Fed would raise rates in seven months , comes after a strong October jobs report on Friday . The U.S. economy added 214,000 jobs in October , the Labor Department said , and the unemployment rate fell to a six-year low at 5.8 percent even as more people entered the labor force , a sign of a strengthening and resilient economy .
Eleven of 14 economists at these dealers also said the Fed will increase rates more aggressively than traders in the bond markets were pricing in U.S. short-term interest rates futures Friday . Fed funds futures contracts on Friday suggested traders were pricing in a 34 percent probability of a rate hike for June 2015 and a 63 percent probability in September 2015 .
All but three of the 22 primary dealers participated in the latest survey .
The market selloff last month pushed some measures of U.S. inflation lower , prompting investors to push back expectations of the first Fed rate increase to late in 2015 and even into 2016 .
But markets quickly recovered and , last week , the central bank issued a confident-sounding policy statement following its October meeting that expressed confidence in the U.S. economic recovery even as concerns mount over weak global growth . It also said underutilization of labor market resources was “ gradually diminishing . ”
“ The further drop in the unemployment rate does put a bit of pressure on ( the Fed ) , ” said UBS Securities economist Samuel Coffin . “ It 's pretty clear their change in tone on the labor market is coming a bit true - there is less slack . ”
The median forecast of 18 dealers for the federal funds rate at the end of next year was 1 percent , compared with the median forecast of Fed policymakers of 1.38 percent , according to projections from the central bank 's October meeting .
The median forecast of 14 dealers for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 was 2.5 percent , compared with policymakers ' median forecast of 2.88 percent . By the end of 2017 , 10 primary dealers projected a median federal funds rate of 3.5 percent , while policymakers ' median forecast was 3.75 percent .
Since December 2008 , the Fed has targeted a range of zero to 0.25 percent for its key funds rate .
President Trump 's pledge that pipeline projects will use “ American steel ” apparently will not apply to the Keystone XL project , directly contradicting the president 's own words last week .
Politico reported late Thursday night that a White House spokeswoman explained that the project , which has been in the works for a decade , does not count as a “ new ” or “ retrofitted ” pipeline and therefore is not subject to Mr. Trump 's made-in-America requirement .
Comments from TransCanada , the company proposing the project , on Friday morning seemed to confirm that it does not plan to use all U.S. steel .
The president in January signed an order calling for all new pipeline projects — or those undergoing significant retrofits or repairs — to “ use materials and equipment produced in the United States . ”
More broadly , the president has made the use of American steel and other materials in construction projects a centerpiece of his economic pitch .
Last month , in a meeting with leading CEOs at the White House , Mr. Trump explicitly told Mario Longhi , the CEO of U.S. Steel Corp. , that Keystone would use American materials .
“ And you 're going to be doing pipelines now . You know that , right ? We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved , as you know , the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota [ Access pipeline ] . But they have to buy — meaning , steel , so I 'll say U.S. Steel — but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country , ” the president said . “ So , the pipe is coming from the U.S . ”
Early in his term , Mr. Trump signed an executive order restarting the Keystone XL oil pipeline , which had been shelved under President Obama . When completed , the project will carry 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta , through the U.S. heartland and ultimately to refineries on the Gulf Coast .
After the Obama administration rejected the project , TransCanada filed a $ 15 billion legal challenge under provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement . Last week , the company suspended that lawsuit , though it was unclear whether the move was tied to the White House 's decision not to apply the American steel requirement to the Keystone project .
Asked Friday whether the company was committed to using American steel , TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha reiterated that the company planned to use North American steel for at least 75 percent of the project — with a majority of that coming from the U.S. , he said .
He would not say the company planned to use all American materials and would not address specific reports about what the White House had told the company .
“ We continue to be encouraged as our presidential permit application makes its way through the approval process , ” Mr. Cunha said . “ This project will support U.S. energy security , create thousands of well-paying U.S. jobs and provide substantial economic benefits . ”
In 2012 , the company estimated that about 821,000 tons of steel pipe would be used for the project , including about 660,000 tons for the U.S. portion . Of that , roughly half will be manufactured in Arkansas . Another 24 percent will come from Canada , and about 26 percent of the steel will be made in India and Italy .
But environmentalists , who long have opposed the Keystone pipeline , say the revelations prove that the administration has been outmaneuvered by TransCanada . They also say there is a clear connection between the company dropping its lawsuit and the White House letting it skate on the American steel requirement .
“ Donald Trump has sought to portray himself as some sort of master negotiator , but he clearly needs to spend more time in an apprenticeship . Just days ago , Trump pledged before the country and Congress that the Keystone XL pipeline that he was forcing on this country would be made with American steel , but instead , he was outmaneuvered by a foreign company that wants to use imported steel , ” Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club , said in a statement .
“ The only winner of this ‘ deal ' is TransCanada , which is using a $ 15 billion threat under NAFTA 's deeply flawed corporate tribunal system to outmaneuver Trump and push a dirty and dangerous pipeline across our country , ” he said .
Mr. Cunha would not comment on whether there was a connection between the U.S. steel requirement and the NAFTA lawsuit suspension , saying only “ the process remains suspended . ”

The HTML5 specification describes video support without specifying a particular video format . We think H.264 is an excellent format . In its HTML5 support , IE9 will support playback of H.264 video only .
H.264 is an industry standard , with broad and strong hardware support . Because of this standardization , you can easily take what you record on a typical consumer video camera , put it on the web , and have it play in a web browser on any operating system or device with H.264 support ( e.g . a PC with Windows 7 ) . Recently , we publicly showed IE9 playing H.264-encoded video from YouTube . You can read about the benefits of hardware acceleration here , or see an example of the benefits at the 26:35 mark here . For all these reasons , we 're focusing our HTML5 video support on H.264 .
Other codecs often come up in these discussions . The distinction between the availability of source code and the ownership of the intellectual property in that available source code is critical . Today , intellectual property rights for H.264 are broadly available through a well-defined program managed by MPEG LA . The rights to other codecs are often less clear , as has been described in the press . Of course , developers can rely on the H.264 codec and hardware acceleration support of the underlying operating system , like Windows 7 , without paying any additional royalty .
Today , video on the web is predominantly Flash-based . While video may be available in other formats , the ease of accessing video using just a browser on a particular website without using Flash is a challenge for typical consumers . Flash does have some issues , particularly around reliability , security , and performance . We work closely with engineers at Adobe , sharing information about the issues we know of in ongoing technical discussions . Despite these issues , Flash remains an important part of delivering a good consumer experience on today 's web .

Leaders of a fringe militarised Christian sect have been arrested on child sex abuse charges after a raid on their compound .
The Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps group is a fundamentalist Christian sect in operation in New Mexico .
The armed group , which is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center , was raided by police earlier this weak over allegations of child abuse .
Several members of the group have been arrested and charged with a string of offences .
Police are investigating alleged illegal transportation of children from missions in other countries to its US base , as well as sex abuse .
According to NBC , the group 's leader Peter Green has been charged with 100 counts of criminal sexual penetration of a child , and is being held on $ 5 million bond .
One of the group 's co-founders ‘ General ' Deborah Green , is also being held on a $ 500,000 bond .
NBC reports that other members of the cult including Joshua Green , Stacey Miller , Amos River , Victoria River , Ruth River and Timothy River are also being held .
The various charges include child abuse , bribery and not reporting a birth .
The group insisted : “ We do n't know who all the accusers are , but the accusations are just re-runs of old lies that have been investigated and shown to be malicious attacks against a legitimate ministry . ”
Responding to the arrests the group pointed to a mass of web conspiracies that it claims “ exposes all these INCREDIBLY FALSE accusations against the Generals and ACMTC members . ”
JoeMyGod points out that the group are designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
The group 's website refers to Barack Obama as a “ sodomite ” , adding of Trump 's election : “ It was the American people that wanted a change , not the homo-oriented NEW change spouted by Obama ! ”
It adds : “ It is God who has unleashed gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender , and question ( GLBTQ ) terrorism against the church in order to separate His true ones from the snakes , flakes , and fakes CLAIMING to be His .
“ We can truly say this is a great move of God .
“ AS THE FALLOUT from the Pink Stink Sodomite ( PSS ) bomb settles over this godless America , things are yet to take their final place .
“ Christians and non-compliant non-Christians can still raise HELL ! We expect this . This is the whole reason…to get Americans off their lazy behinds and on to the frontlines TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT .
“ Fight not against God/His Word , but fight against the evil satanic principalities , powers , the rulers of darkness of this world , and against wicked spirits in high places .
“ GOD IS USING this whole ugly , perverted , sick , stinking , diseased Homo movement to be a punishment upon the church and this land . But , hopefully His true ones will gather under His government ( who are going to receive their share of punishments from God , you can count on it ! God will not be mocked ! ) .
“ IT ALL BOILS DOWN to these friends—we 're either going to stand for God/Jesus/the Holy Bible or with this sick/Satanic/pro-abortion/pro-sodomite government . Get off the fence ! We 're either going to allow God 's Holy Fire to BURN the HELL out of us , or be consumed by strange fire ( e.g . queer fire ) . ”
It adds : If we here are ‘ homophobic ' , they ( GLBTQ ) are ‘ heterophobic ' . I say , REPENT or PERISH ! Homosexuals are NOT VICTIMS ! , they CHOOSE their medicine .
“ They are NOT VICTIMS of circumstance who need protection and praise . NO ! They choose to DIE ! These people ARE NOT born ‘ that way ' . There is NO PROOF for such a statement . I offer them the Gospel of Christ—to be BORN AGAIN .
“ Even among their thinning ranks , some believe that they should not impose their ‘ choice ' on the public .
“ If America really wanted this ABOMINATION , there would have been NO need for a Supreme Court decision—but most Americans are repulsed at such vileness . These few believe that the public should choose .
“ After all , dear folks , the endless propaganda campaign has been running in high gear ever since Obama ( Obamanation ) has been at the wheel . Do n't believe for a minute that most ( they are now saying ) Americans are FOR them . HA ! This is pure Pink/Lavender Propaganda . I would dare say about 10 percent , maybe not even that high .

Tottenham Hotspur 's Danny Rose and Christian Eriksen have both been named in a list of the best performing players in Europe 's top five leagues .
Two players dispensed with by Spurs without ever making an impact at the club , Iago Falque and Yuri Berchiche , also appear in the CIES Football Observatory 's research team 's list .
The Observatory is a research group within the International Centre for Sports Studies which has published numerous studies using data from the beautiful game .
Their latest findings , using in their words “ the technical analysis of player performance ” , includes the ten best performing players in each position from the top flights in England , Spain , Italy , Germany and France .
To be considered eligible for their system , players had to have played at least 900 domestic league minutes so far this campaign .
They measure player performance based on six Key Performance Indicators : rigour , recovery , distribution , take on , chance creation and shooting .
Rigour highlights the place good at both aerial duels and tackling - whilst recovery focuses more on the positional and tactical awareness of players .
In the full-backs category , Rose received an overall rating of 87 , which placed him joint fourth with Atletico Madrid 's Filipe Luis and Napoli 's Faouzi Ghoulam . Alex Sandro of Juventus was the top full-back , with Liverpool 's James Milner and Bayern Munich 's David Alaba joint second .
In the non-international list , headed up by Chelsea 's Marcos Alonso , is Real Sociedad 's Berchiche in joint second with Guingamp defender Marcal Oliveira .
Left-back Berchiche , 26 , joined Spurs from Athletic Bilbao in 2007 , yet never appeared for the first team . He was loaned out to Cheltenham Town and then Valladolid before being released in 2010 .
Tottenham midfielder Eriksen is joint seventh in the list of attacking midfielders with a score of 87 with Manchester City 's David Silva , Chelsea 's Eden Hazard and Fiorentina star Josip Ilicic . City 's Kevin de Bruyne and Liverpool 's Philippe Countinho head up the list with 89 .
Torino forward Falque appears in the non-international list , joint third with Nice 's Alassane Plea , with Atalanta 's Alejandro Gomez leading the way .
Falque arrived at Spurs in 2011 , first on loan before the deal was made permanent , with the pedigree of having been in the youth set-ups of Real Madrid , Barcelona and Juventus . But he only made a couple of appearances before being loaned out to a string of clubs and then sold to Genoa .
The first CD I purchased with my own money was `` Achtung Baby '' by U2 . I was 13 . I had heard `` One '' and `` Mysterious Ways '' on the school bus radio and so was excited when I finally had the album containing those songs in my prepubescent hands . When I got home from the Best Buy in Topeka , I jammed the CD into my parents ' stereo and prepared my ears for sonic nirvana .
Hear and see more about Animal Collective .
Once there , a strange thing happened . The noises coming out of the speakers were indecipherable to me ; I could n't make out a thing . My face fell as I walked into the kitchen to tell my mother that I 'd made a huge mistake .
Spending money on `` Achtung Baby '' was not a mistake , of course . In fact , I still count it among my favorite albums . It did teach me a lesson -- my 13-year-old brain was not capable of deciding whether a record is good after one listen . That has n't changed . Try as I might , I ca n't tell much about an album during its first playback .
With that in mind , I thought it would be fun to journal my efforts to grasp something new . First , though , I needed an album I thought would be worth my time . Animal Collective 's new disc , `` Merriwether Post Pavilion '' ( MPP from here ) fit the bill . Based on my affection for their 2007 release , `` Strawberry Jam , '' I was excited about the prospect of new material . Once that hurdle was cleared , I needed only $ 12 to buy the CD , a little time and a lot of patience .
It used to be that I had specific criteria that determined whether I would buy a particular CD : It took three good songs before I would fork over any money . For example , in 1993 , I heard `` Ordinary World '' by Duran Duran and started paying attention . Next was `` Come Undone . '' My interest was piqued further . When `` Too Much Information '' hit the radio , I packed myself into my silver 1985 Chevy Celebrity ( the extra-cool station wagon version ) and drove into the city to buy the album .
As the years went by , the criteria dropped to two good songs , then to one , before finally settling in its current state , which is that if I 've heard the band 's name , seen it on a telephone pole , or imagined it as a possible word combination , I can probably convince myself to buy their album .
This state of mind has been good for my collection , but it has made the process of listening more difficult . It used to be that I had anchors -- songs I knew I liked and that I could look forward to hearing . For example , on Oasis ' `` What 's The Story Morning Glory ? '' it was `` Wonderwall '' and `` Champagne Supernova . '' On Pearl Jam 's `` Ten , '' it was `` Evenflow '' and `` Jeremy . ''
Thus , in some ways -- even though I 've heard thousands of new songs -- my task with Animal Collective was even harder . Add in the fact that their music is sometimes described as `` experimental '' and it was clear that this would be a challenge .
Listen 1 : I kind of like that one song .
I had purposely avoided listening to anything Animal Collective-related before digging in . So there was no `` Wonderwall '' waiting for me . It was all new , which is why my notes on that first listen are sparse and nearly unintelligible .
Song 1 : `` Woof . '' Song 2 : `` Eudora kids -- Skateboards and guns . I like . '' Song 3 : `` Fourth-grade chorus -- all sopranos . '' Song 4 . ( blank ) Song 5 . `` Eighties . '' Songs 6-11 : `` All same . ''
I had known I was going to struggle through the first listen , but that did n't stop me from being disappointed . I could tell I would eventually like the second song . That was the end of the good news . The first song sounded awful -- hence the `` Woof '' comment . The third song sounded like it was being performed by a squadron of eunuchs banging on cymbals , except I was n't that creative when I made notes -- hence the fourth-grade chorus comment . From there , I could n't discern much .
( Side note : I wrote `` skateboards and guns '' because I was driving through the town of Eudora , Kan. , at the time and saw two groups of kids -- one with skateboards , one with rifles . It was an interesting contrast , but it had nothing to do with Animal Collective . )
Listens 2 and 3 : This is the worst album I 've ever heard .
I was still enjoying the second song , but had written the following after listen No . 3 : `` Never going to like this album '' and `` Repetitive , boring , want to quit listening . ''
It was n't looking good for MPP .
Listen 4 : OK , this album has something going on , but I think the dudes who made it took themselves a little too seriously .
I could feel familiarity lurking around the corner , but I was growing frustrated with my inability to connect with the music . I had decided that the songs were nothing more than a bunch of extended melodies , a sentiment with which I can still agree . I also noted , `` Maybe trying too hard ? ''
Listen 5 : There 's hope , but this will be lucky to make my top 250 .
I listened to the album while working out . MPP is not workout music , but I did have some breakthroughs . I was sure I liked songs Nos . 2 , 4 and 5 , and No . 7 was growing on me . Finally , some anchor points . My cold , Animal Collective-hating heart was thawing .
Listen 6 : Light at the end of the tunnel ?
I had time to give the album a real listen : I put in the CD , turned the volume dial to `` Wall-shaking , '' and lay down in bed , ready to pay attention to nothing but the music .
I wrote that the vocals on Song 2 , `` My Girls , '' sounded like they were done by the Beach Boys . Song 3 annoyed me ; the line `` Will it be just like they 're dreaming ? '' gets repeated approximately 63,000 times . I noticed harmonizing in Song 4 , `` Summertime Clothes . '' I picked up on a beat I like in Song 5 , `` Daily Routine , '' and decided I liked it , despite the high-pitched harpsichord at the beginning of the song . ( Harpsichord is a guess , I should note . )
By Song 6 , I was dozing off , which is actually a good sign . It means the album was becoming familiar . I woke up in time for the repetition of what I thought was `` lying in a coma , '' but which is actually , `` lion in a coma , '' which I assume to be the case only because that 's the name of the song .
The music was making me feel pleasant . Something was happening .
Listen 7 : Acceptance .
After my seventh listen , I wrote only this : `` I think I 'm starting to like it . ''
Seven listens are n't enough to fully comprehend an album , especially one as far-out as MPP . But I 'm afraid if I listen anymore , I 'll start to hate Animal Collective only because there is a limit to how many times I can hear a record in a few days .
MPP is a fun album , but the songs are too long . Generally , they are fairly simple tunes that borrow from 1950s- and '60s-era sensibilities , done with a psychedelic , we-might-be-taking-LSD-while-we-do-this style . Because the songs are so simple , it would be nice if they were shorter . Six of the 11 tracks on the album go past the five-minute mark . Usually , there is n't enough there to warrant five-minute songs .
But that 's not to say it 's not a pleasurable listen . It is . These guys can sing -- it 's not bad to be compared to the Beach Boys . And they create interesting , dare I say , soundscapes . Really , Animal Collective is an instrumental band . They do sing , of course , but their voices are used more like instruments than as story-telling machines . To my ears , MPP is background music . Cool , creative , fun background music , but background music nonetheless .
After I wrote the framework of this column , I checked metacritic.com for reviews of MPP . It received an 89 , meaning that it is one of the best-received albums in recent history . Some of that acclaim is probably because of indie music , feeding-frenzy syndrome -- if someone says it 's genius-level work , everyone else is afraid to dissent for fear of being labeled uncool .
But do n't take their word for it . Do n't take my word for it . Go to the Animal Collective Web site , listen and decide for yourself . It could be that I have n't even cracked the surface of MPP and that you 'll discover things I 'm incapable of grasping . There 's only one way to find out : Listen .
I 'll keep doing the same . I do n't think `` Merriwether Post Pavilion '' is ever going to topple `` Achtung Baby '' from my personal top 10 , but just like with that album , I 'm glad I did n't give up after the first listen .

YouTuber with 53 million subscribers posted videos featuring antisemitic jokes and Nazi imagery , including two men holding a ‘ Death to All Jews ' sign
The Walt Disney Company has severed ties with YouTube 's biggest star PewDiePie after he posted a series of videos featuring antisemitic comments .
PewDiePie , real name Felix Kjellberg , is a 27-year-old Swede who built a huge fanbase making opinionated videos , mostly about video games . With more than 53 million subscribers on YouTube , Kjellberg has turned his videos into a lucrative business , earning more than $ 14m per year from advertising , sponsorship and appearance fees .
Facebook Twitter Pinterest PewDiePie announcing Revelmode through a joint venture with Disney 's Maker Studios
A key part of PewDiePie 's empire is a joint venture he formed with Disney 's Maker Studios in 2014 . This gave him co-ownership of a multi-channel network called Revelmode that produces videos , mobile apps and merchandise . Following an investigation into the antisemitic content by the Wall Street Journal , Disney has ended this joint venture .
According to the Journal 's analysis , over the last six months the YouTuber posted nine videos that include either antisemitic jokes or Nazi imagery , including one , posted on 11 January , that featured two men holding a banner that stated : “ Death to all Jews ” . Another video , posted 22 January , featured a man dressed as Jesus saying , “ Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong ” .
A spokeswoman for Maker Studios said in a statement : “ Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent , he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate . Maker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward . ”
YouTube has n't removed any of the videos , although PewDiePie 's channel has pulled three of them .
On Sunday Kjellberg wrote a blog post “ to clear some things up ” .
He said that his comments were jokes that have been taken out of context and that the video with the banner was created to show “ how crazy the modern world is ” . He used freelance marketplace Fiverr to hire two men in India to make the offensive sign .
“ I think it 's important to say something and I want to make one thing clear : I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes , ” he said . “ Though this was not my intention , I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive . ”
“ As laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people , to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups : No , I do n't support these people in any way . ”
PewDiePie 's comments have made him popular with neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer , which has run a series of articles about the YouTuber , describing him as “ our guy ” .

“ He could be doing all this only to cause a stir things up and get free publicity , ” wrote the Daily Stormer .
“ Ultimately , it does n't matter , since the effect is the same ; it normalizes Nazism , and marginalizes our enemies . ”
The site has even added a banner describing itself as “ the world 's # 1 PewDiePie fansite ” .
Without the Disney joint venture , PewDiePie will have to produce his videos independently or find a new partner .
It is three months now since Sergei and Marina Balobanov , who live in the village of Panovo in the Omsk Region , had any news about their son Andrei . He was called up for military service about a year ago , at the age of 22 ; and was serving as a radio telephonist in a motorised rifle company .
Until his disappearance , he texted or emailed his parents almost every day and phoned them regularly ; and then it all suddenly stopped . ‘ The last call we had from him , ' his father told me , ‘ was on 12 June . All his SIM cards – he changed them quite often – were blocked . When we phoned his unit , they said not to worry – he was off on a training exercise . But a month passed , and still no news of him . We started to worry ; we thought they were holding something back from us . On 10 July , we went to our local recruitment office . At first they did n't want to have anything to do with us , but eventually they phoned his unit . “ What 's the panic ? ” we were told . “ Everything 's fine , your son 's doing his job. ” But why has n't he been in contact ? He would have sent us a message at the first opportunity , to say everything was OK . '
Andrei texted or emailed his parents almost every day ; and then it all suddenly stopped .
On 17 July , some people calling themselves ‘ representatives of Ukraine , ' phoned Andrei 's older brother Aleksei , who lives in St Petersburg , and told him his brother ‘ had been taken prisoner on the Rostov frontier with Ukraine . ' News about his capture appeared in the Ukrainian , and then the Omsk , media . Meanwhile , his unit command continued to claim that he was ‘ somewhere in the Samara Region , in central Russia , ' but were now implying that he had deserted .
On 19 July , Aleksei Balobanov wrote to the Russian president 's website , asking for clarification about his brother 's whereabouts . He received a reply two days later , stating that his letter had been ‘ sent to the Russian Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MID ) for full and objective investigation . '
A voice from captivity
On 25 July , Andrei Balobanov suddenly turned up on YouTube : the Ukrainian security services posted a video in which he asked for political asylum . The soldier recited , in a flat , expressionless voice , how he had ended up in Ukraine and why he wanted to stay there . His tone suggested that the words were being put in his mouth by someone else , and they were also unusually politically sophisticated for a squaddie : ‘ I , a citizen of the Russian Federation and former member of the Russian armed forces , served in an army unit in the city of Samara . In May 2014 , I , along with the rest of my unit and our combat equipment , was redeployed to the border between the Rostov Region and Ukraine ... I discovered that Russian regular troops , most of them from Military Intelligence detachments , were being illegally sent into the Donetsk and Lugansk Regions . '
According to Andrei Balobanov , his unit was frequently placed on alert , and he also said he had witnessed movements of equipment and Special Forces from Russia to eastern Ukraine , ‘ supplemented by people from the North Caucasus who spoke very derogatively about Ukrainians . '
Recognising , as he said , the deceitfulness of Russian propaganda , Balobanov decided he would not be part of the ‘ brother-killing war ' planned by the Russian government : ‘ I condemn the policies of Russia 's leaders , including their occupation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea and support for terrorists in its south-eastern part . My departure for Ukraine is a protest against Russian policy towards a friendly people . '
A mother 's plea
Since then , nothing more has been heard of Andrei ; his parents have no idea how or where he is . The YouTube clip was the last evidence that he was still alive . His father has confirmed that it was his voice on the video , but where was it shooting , and by whom ? Was he speaking willingly or under duress ? There has been no official confirmation from either the Ukrainian or the Russian authorities that he was taken prisoner or surrendered – a silence from both sides .
I contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs press office , and received the reply that the video was certainly genuine , but that Ministry staff were wondering why Andrei 's brother 's letter had been redirected to them , and not the Ministry of Defence . That was the only place , they said , that would have any information about Private Balobanov .
Sergei and Marina had of course written to the Ministry of Defence as well , and had been told that there were no prisoners of war on Ukrainian territory .
Balobanov 's parents were told by the Ministry of Defence that there were no prisoners of war on Ukrainian territory .
A few days ago , the ‘ Omskinform ' website posted an open letter from Marina Balobanov to people in the Omsk Region . ‘ Three months have gone by since my son disappeared , ' she wrote . ‘ We have written to all the investigative bodies , the Committee of Soldiers ' Mothers , the Ombudsman 's Office , and several times to Vladimir Putin ... '
The only answer the Balobanovs received was from the Military Prosecutor 's Office . ‘ They have only one response : that Andrei is a deserter , ' says Marina . ‘ They have produced false documents , with all the dates changed , to back up their version of events . ' According to the Prosecutor 's Office letter , ‘ Private Balobanov 's absence was noted on parade on 17 July , and after all attempts to find him failed , he was officially charged the following day with going AWOL . '
But why did Balobanov 's commanding officer not respond to the fax sent by his local recruitment office on 10 July ? And why did a soldier who contacted his parents almost daily for the seven months before he ‘ went AWOL ' then remain silent for more than a month ?
The investigation into his disappearance also showed that on 17 June , Balobanov was appointed deputy leader of his platoon . So why did n't he send his family and friends news of his promotion ? ‘ Why ' , wrote his mother , ‘ did they take away this “ platoon leader 's ” means of communication , so he could n't tell anyone ? '
‘ The autumn draft is coming up soon , ' Marina recently wrote to the mothers of her region . ‘ Think about how you might be sending your child off to certain death . The despair of it makes my blood run cold ; God forbid , I would n't want anyone to have to face the horror we 're going through . How many more lives are going to be ruined ? Who will have to answer for it ? Nobody , I expect . '
‘ The autumn draft is coming up soon . Think about how you might be sending your child off to certain death . '
Marina has since told me that investigators from the central Investigative Committee in Moscow have begun to search for her son and look into the circumstances of his disappearance . They have promised to ‘ get to the bottom of it , ' but at the same time they are asking the Balobanovs to ‘ limit their contacts with journalists . ' The family are happy to do this , but are warning the officials : We 're no idiots ; you ca n't hide the truth from us . '
Cargo 200
Whatever the results of the investigation ( and let us hope that Andrei is found safe and well ) , this ordinary rural family can no longer be numbered with the 84 % of their fellow Russians who , according to the polls , support the Kremlin . Another one such is the wife of regular army officer Zakhar Timin , who was killed in action in Donbas . She told the Novaya Gazeta newspaper that ‘ he was n't a volunteer , but was just carrying out orders – he had no alternative . '
Among the disillusioned , to judge by online forums , you will also find many inhabitants of the Omsk Region 's Poltavsky district , where on 14 September the funeral was held of Artyom Yakovlev , who was doing his military service in the 106th Guards Division of Russia 's airborne forces . The first news of his death came from blogger Andrei Malgin , who wrote , ‘ there 's even a photo of him beside an ‘ Uazik ' truck with a trident on it , ' ( the symbol of an ultra-right Ukrainian group , it could only have been taken in Ukraine ) . Yakovlev 's division crossed the border around 10-11 August , the time that the 106th Tula Airborne Division is known to have been in the Luhansk Region ... Yakovlev disappeared on 18 August ; there have been no posts on his VKontakte page since that date .
Officially , Yakovlev died on the Ukrainian border during a training exercise .
Yakovlev 's local recruitment office said it could only respond to an official request for information ( and that this would take a month , minimum ) . Officially , he died on the Ukrainian border during a training exercise , but judging by the blogosphere , many social networkers are inclined to believe Malgin 's version .
Civil activist Yelena Vasilyeva , founder of the Cargo-200 Facebook group ( its name refers to the Russian military term for Killed in Action ) , has written about Yevgeny Myasin , a Marine First Lieutenant from Omsk serving , and recently also living , in the Archangelsk Region : ‘ In the summer , he and his men were sent to the Rostov region on ‘ training exercises ' where for some time they just sat around in the fields . Then their commanding officers started sending them into Ukraine , to Luhansk , where they were involved in fighting . And of course some of them lost their lives . Myasin , watching this , realised that he did n't want to be one of them , that he wanted to go home to his family . At the beginning of September he told his commanding officer ‘ on the ground ' that he wanted to resign his commission , and headed back to his home base to tender his resignation . On 2 September , he phoned his family to tell them about his plans . Then on the night of 3-4 September he was found dead on a highway near his home base , knocked down and killed by a truck .
‘ A family member who lived nearby came to the morgue and was able to identify his body , but only with difficulty as it was in a terrible state – the lorry had crushed his head and torso . The local military command is investigating two possible scenarios : either it was a simple accident or he was already dead when the lorry went over his body . '
According to Yelena Vasilyeva , his base commander has refused to help his family transport the body from the morgue , since at the time of his death the officer ‘ was a serving officer , but was on leave . '
News of the deaths of soldiers from Omsk , as well as Marina Balobanov 's open letter , have considerably dampened the enthusiasm of local online ‘ patriots ; ' and nowadays in debates about Russia 's future geopolitical status the anti-war faction tends to be winning the argument .
If the war continues , the popular ‘ patriotic upswing ' will swing ever lower with each Cargo 200 that comes back home ( fortunately the number of Omsk lads killed in action is still low ) , and will eventually come to a halt ; and it will happen quicker in Siberia than anywhere else . Perhaps there are people somewhere in central Russia who are willing to sacrifice their sons , but you wo n't find many here .

A Dubai-based property developer has reportedly spent a record $ 9 million on a highly sought-after license plate bearing the number five at a government auction .
The number plate “ D5 ” now adorns one of Balwinder Sahni 's six Rolls-Royce cars . According to CNN Money , Sahni previously paid almost $ 7 million for a number “ 9 ” plate just last year at a similar auction . The property developer also has two additional Rolls-Royces on order , which will bring his collection of the luxury cars to eight .
“ It 's hard , people giving comments without knowing the type of person I am ” , Sahni told CNNMoney , describing himself as a “ simple man ” .
Sahni considers the money he spends collecting license plates a form of charity and public service : “ I believe in giving back , ” he said . “ This city has given me a lot. ” He says he believes the money will go to charity and toward improving the city 's infrastructure .
While Dubai has no income tax , the money spent on the elite license plates goes directly to Dubai 's Roads and Transport Authority .
Lone digit plates are now popular in the United Arab Emirates , where owners spend lavish amounts . Abdulkerim Arsanov and his brother set up the website numbers.ae , to link sellers with buyers . As of today , the biggest deal via their website was for a two-digit plate that sold for $ 735,000 .
“ Number plates have become more luxurious than the cars themselves , ” Arsanov told CNN Money .
The record for the most money spent on a license plate in the United Arab Emirates goes to businessman Saeed al-Khouri . In 2008 , al-Khouri spent $ 14.2 million on the No . 1 license plate .

Floyd can return to the Vikings ' active roster on October 2 . He 'll be eligible to play in the Vikings ' Week 5 contest against the Bears on Monday , Oct. 9 . He 'll also be allowed to take part in training camp and the preseason .
If you 're wondering why Floyd was suspended four games instead of just two , read this explanation provided by Pro Football Talk 's Mike Florio in June :
Under the current policy , he faces a two-game unpaid suspension , at a minimum . Given that he pleaded guilty to extreme DUI , the penalty could be even greater . `` Absent aggravating circumstances , discipline for a first offense will be a suspension without pay for two ( 2 ) regular or postseason games , '' the policy provides . `` If the Commissioner finds that there were aggravating circumstances , including but not limited to felonious conduct , extreme intoxication ( BAC of .15 % or more ) , property damage or serious injury or death to the Player or a third party , and/or if the Player has had prior drug or alcohol-related misconduct , increased discipline may be imposed . ''
The NFL apparently decided to give him a more severe penalty than the minimum .
His suspension stems from his DUI arrest in December , when he was found asleep in his car with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.217 percent . The Cardinals cut Floyd immediately . He went on to play for the Patriots , winning a championship ring with the team , though he did n't play in the Super Bowl . In February , Floyd pleaded guilty to extreme DUI and wound up serving 24 days in jail and 96 days of house arrest . He signed with the Vikings in May .
He came under more fire recently when he tested positive for alcohol in June . Floyd blamed the failed test on kombucha tea , but was still ordered to serve an additional day in jail . The Vikings stood by Floyd , but Mike Zimmer said on Thursday that the team will cut him if they find out he 's lying about the kombucha tea .
Since entering the NFL as a first-round pick in 2012 , Floyd has caught 24 touchdowns .
It 's a new year , and thus far a bad one for Ben Carson 's bid for the presidency . Last week , Carson 's campaign manager , deputy campaign manager , and communications director all submitted their resignations . On ABC yesterday , the candidate tried his hand at a little damage control :
“ You know , we have had very good people , ” the retired neurosurgeon said . “ They 've had very good ideas , and no one predicted that we would even be in the hunt . And , you know , a novice in this area with no background , no campaign , no funding mechanism . So it really is quite spectacular , what we were able to do. ” “ But the fact of the matter is : Now we 're in a different ballgame , and we need the ability to execute and not just to have good ideas , ” he said .
It 's possible that Carson , roused to action by recent polls that have shown him tailspinning into fourth place , was about to shake up his campaign , and his staffers simply resigned before they could be fired . But it 's also unlikely . More probable is that the Carson campaign has begun to capsize and its crew is heading for the lifeboats . Carson 's advisors have indicated their displeasure before . Back in November , two of his foreign policy handlers fretted to the press that the neurosurgeon was n't doing his homework , after Carson erroneously claimed that China had intervened in the Syrian Civil War .
But that 's minor league compared to some of the blaring errors that Donald Trump has committed . So why is it Ben Carson 's campaign that 's falling apart ? Two reasons , I think .
The first is that Republican voters are in the mood for a fighter , a role that does n't come naturally to the placid and soft-spoken Carson . He spiked in the polls after his performance during the first debate , which was more notable for its charm than its interlocutions with any of his fellow candidates . Carson is the nice-guy Donald Trump , a celebrity figure whose strength derives not from scabrous quips , but from a quiet affability and inspirational backstory .
Problem is , Republicans are n't looking for a nice guy this year . After several tepid debate performances , it became clear that Carson was n't going to be the aggressive champion his supporters wanted . The evangelicals in Iowa who were largely responsible for propelling Carson forward defected to Ted Cruz , a far more aggressive and steely debater . Carson 's poll numbers plummeted accordingly .
The second reason why Carson has lost traction is that many Republican voters , despite their flirtation with Donald Trump , are looking for someone with a certain amount of policy knowledge . As the aforementioned grumbles from his foreign policy advisors show , that candidate is n't Ben Carson . One of the most frustrating spectacles of the 2016 campaign has been watching an unquestionably brilliant neurosurgeon bumble through basic questions , with every answer the same frayed knit job of political correctness and the media and Obama 's weakness , seemingly impervious to any urgency that he brush up on the major issues of the day .
Our next president will face daunting challenges over immigration , health care , and the Middle East . In Carson , Republican voters came to see someone who was n't prepared for the job . Donald Trump has created the illusion that he can solve our problems without actually knowing anything at all ; Ben Carson was n't so fortunate . Here again , the well-versed Ted Cruz was the beneficiary .
Now let 's hope conservatives come to the same conclusion about Trump .
Months after promising that Brampton would be granted a university campus , the Ontario government has opened the “ Request of Expressions of Interest ” ( REOI ) to allow for the development of university campuses in Brampton and Milton .
Deb Matthews , Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Development , was in Brampton yesterday for a Brampton Board of Trade event at which she made the announcement .
The provincial government will revive an old two-step process for campus selection , possibly because Brampton has not officially chosen a university partner at this stage .
Universities are expected to partner with colleges , as well as industries .
The government will first look at REOI from prospective universities . These are due on March 6 , 2017 . The REOI needs to outline programming , estimated costs ( building and operating ) , contributions from universities and their partners , and what is expected from the provincial government in terms of support .
The guidelines and templates that universities are expected to use are available online .
The government will then evaluate the proposals and create a short list of universities .
The chosen universities will be announced in May 2017 , at which point an “ Invitational Call for Proposals ” will be released . The deadline at that stage will be July 2017 .
The successful university bid will be announced in the fall of 2017 .
Between the Brampton and Milton campuses , it is expected that 1,000 new full-time student spaces ( part-time students will not count towards this total ) will be available within two to five years of opening , according to a recent memorandum .
Only Ontario universities are eligible to apply to the REOI . More than one university may partner , though one is required to take the lead .
The REOI is also required to address what kind of infrastructure the university needs and how it plans to obtain space , including acquiring existing infrastructure , leasing space , and/or creating new buildings . Renovations to existing spaces are eligible for these criteria .
Universities are expected to discuss ancillary services ( health , recreation , food ) , and how they might provide this using existing community resources and spaces .
The proposed location for the university must “ focus their development in areas of urban intensification , while also leveraging public transit . ”
The $ 180 million that Ontario announced in October is flexible funding , in that it does not have to be split evenly between Brampton and Milton . It 's entirely possible that , based on the bid , Brampton gets more funding than Milton . The government also expects that campus plans incorporate other revenue sources .
The role of the municipal government will be to support the proposal the ministry selects .
This article will be updated as more details are released .

About
I 've always wanted a Pokémon .
Well that 's not true . I guess I was technically some amount old when I was first introduced to the weird creatures . But as I grew older , the once childhood love I had for this strange , perpetually growing universe became more of a weird creepy obsession . Really though , I love finding ways to craft Pokémon with some kind of essence of how they would exist in our world . It seemed only too obvious to me that an Oddish planter would be a thing . A brief perusal of Etsy told me that either this was only glaringly obvious to me , or no one else had yet been willing to bother making one . That night , I spent hours using an aluminum mesh to create a basic frame to structure clay around . I used my fingernails and a pin to carve out the facial features and crumpled up foil layered with clay for the feet . By 3am , I had a fully painted , fully sealed Oddish planter of my very own .
I gave Oddish life the next day , planting him with an aloe vera plant I got from Lowe 's for $ 5 . I advertised my triumph on Facebook ( as us social network addicts do ) , and received an almost alarming amount of requests for more Oddishes . As much as I wanted to provide for extremely excited and supportive family and friends willing to buy further copies from me , I could not justify making and selling more of these guys . The amount I 'd spent on materials alone to make him was upwards of $ 30 , and I could n't think of an amount of money I could ask for that would make up for that , the hours I 'd labored over him , and return some kind of profit while still keeping him affordable .
A friend of mine suggested creating some sort of mold so that I could more easily reproduce these products . I jumped in head-first on that idea and bought tubs upon tubs of a reheatable silicone-like mold substance , clay sculpting tools , plaster sculpting tools , etc . After creating a brand-new clay `` master copy '' and several failed attempts at making molds ( teach me to measure out how much mold I need before pouring ... it 's not fun finding out you do n't have enough mold when your Oddish is half submerged in the stuff ) , I finally nailed down a process and got a successful mold . Plaster was my go-to material due to its cost-efficiency and sturdiness . Unfortunately , four months of effort and hundreds of dollars of mold material later , I 've only got one successful copy of Oddish to show for it . The product looks good , but the entire process is much too finicky and involved for me to look forward to repeating it with other Pokémon ; it 'd have been quicker for me to have made additional clay copies , though significantly more expensive .
First plaster copy of Oddish !
In the midst of my mold failures , I managed to create a Bulbasaur planter and a Charmander oil lamp . The completion of Charmander and a helpful suggestion from a friend was what got me truly motivated to change up my process ; it would n't be possible for me to make a mold of him in one piece , due to the hollowed-out tail . The base of the tail , being significantly wider than the opening at the end for the wick and flame , would n't allow the mold gathered in the base to be released through the smaller opening . My options were to either bake and mold the tail separate from the body and attach them later ( any vulnerabilities in the integrity of his body made me nervous since , you know , FIRE ) , or find a new way to reproduce the guy .
Charmander `` Master '' Copy
The Process
Here 's where the funding comes in ! I 've already thrown a good chunk of change into this endeavor , and I 'm determined to see it through . The funds should cover the cost for a 3D scanner ( they typically run a few grand , but I 've found one that should fit my needs for ~ $ 1300 ) , a 3D printer ( there happens to be an already-successfully-funded kickstarter project that I 've already backed that is selling printers for ~ $ 300 ) , and the rest of the funds would cover kickstarter fees and the cost of materials ( filaments , paints , wicks , oils , etc . ) as well as shipping .
Note : Plants not included -- shipping plants sounds like an incredible avoidable hassle . I imagine you guys would n't be too upset picking out your own lovely plants to nurture , and on the off-chance the products have to be flown out to your location , grass types are weak against air . No one wants to deal with that .
My plan is to continue making plaster copies of Bulbasaur and Oddish . While working on this , I would obtain the 3D scanner to create 3D scans of my clay copies of Oddish , Bulbasaur , and Charmander . Once I 'm out of plaster ( and satisfy the early pidgey rewards ! ) , I would ideally have possession of both the completed scanned files and a 3D printer and all necessary materials . I 've found a source from which I could obtain obscene amounts of PLA filament ( an environmentally friendly plastic ) , which I would use to print Oddish and Bulbasaur . I would use ABS plastic for Charmander due to the higher printing temperature ( allowing for heat exposure ) .
If this project is successful and generates enough interest , I 'd like to make more Not-So-Still Life Pokémon products . I already have a miniature water pump and the tubing necessary for a potential small Squirtle water fountain . I 've got dreams , man .

Jorge Sampaoli has departed his job as Chile manager after a dispute with the national federation , with the 55-year-old the current favourite to be in the Chelsea dugout next season .
Fifa Coach of the Year nominee Sampaoli , who guided Chile to their first-ever Copa America crown in the summer , has spent recent weeks trying to force his way out of the job , claiming he no longer felt respected .
A statement on Football Federation of Chile ( ANFP ) website confirmed that in departing Sampaoli had forgone bonuses relating to the Copa America triumph .
It further added : “ With this step the board of the ANFP has achieved the goal of resolving the current situation affecting the national team , avoiding uncertainty involving potential lengthy court actions . ”
Sampaoli , whose managerial philosophy was largely inspired by Marcelo Bielsa , is bookmaker Bet Victor 's favourite to be Chelsea 's manager at the start of next season , priced at 2/1 ahead of interim boss Guus Hiddink and Italy 's Antonio Conte at 4s .
The former O'Higgins and Universidad de Chile head coach does not sit at the top of the champion 's shortlist to take over in the summer , which is still led by Pep Guardiola and Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone .
With neither of that duo by any means guaranteed to choose a move to Stamford Bridge backup options include Conte and Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri , both of whom are both ahead of Sampaoli in Chelsea 's interest .
Hiddink confirmed earlier this month that he does not intend to remain at Chelsea beyond the end of the season , even if he wins the FA Cup or Champions League .
Chelsea 's manager for first game of 2016/17 odds ( BetVictor ) Jorge Sampaoli - 2/1
Guus Hiddink - 4/1
Antonio Conte - 4/1
Pep Guardiola - 6/1
Diego Simeone - 6/1
Brendan Rodgers - 10/1
Max Allegri - 12/1
ANFP president Arturo Salah said that the board would now seek an immediate replacement , with Chile currently lying in the playoff spot in South American qualifying for the 2018 World Cup .
Manchester City 's Manuel Pellegrini had been linked with the job but has distanced himself from a return to his homeland .
“ I hope to remain with competitive teams in Europe . I am not thinking about returning to Chile at least for the next three or four years , ” he told Radio Cooperativa .

Top takeaways from the Brooklyn Democratic debate
CLOSE The debate heated up between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as they questioned each other 's personal record on several hot topics during the Democratic debate in Brooklyn , New York . VPC
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders bellied up to the podiums for the ninth Democratic presidential debate Thursday , a milestone that seemed inconceivable when she launched her campaign a year ago as the overwhelming front-runner .
Here are a few takeaways from the DonnyBrooklyn :
Bernie makes a bit of news

Sanders , pushed by Clinton to publicly release his tax returns , announced 1 ) that his wife Jane handles the taxes for the family and she has been really busy , and 2 ) he will release his most recent tax return Friday , and other years shortly thereafter . `` They are very boring tax returns , '' Sanders promised . `` No big money from speeches , no major investments . Unfortunately , I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate . '' Clinton made no comparable news when pressed to release the transcripts of her privately paid speeches to Wall Street firms , repeating her defense that she will only release them when all the presidential candidates agree to release their private speeches .
How many people on stage ?

Clinton made every effort to make sure that Sanders was debating not just her but her husband , former president Bill Clinton , and President Obama , her former boss . When Sanders attacked her for having a super PAC supporting her , she said `` this is not just an attack on me , it 's an attack on President Obama , '' because Obama also had a super PAC and yet did not kowtow to big donors . When Sanders said Clinton was soft on climate change , she pointed to her role in Obama 's successes . `` I 'm getting a little bit concerned here because , you know , I really believe that the president has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported , '' she said . The former first lady said the crime bill her husband signed achieved some good things , despite concerns that it drove harsh sentences around the country , particularly for non-violent drug offenders . And when asked whether she would apologize for the excessive harshness of the law , she said , `` My husband has apologized . He was the president who actually signed it . ''
Mideast politics

Sanders has for a while now taken on Clinton over her 2002 Senate vote authorizing the Iraq War , which came up again Thursday night . But perhaps the most extended foreign policy exchange of the night was over their approaches to the long-simmering dispute between Israel and Palestine , long a key issue in New York . Sanders , who is Jewish , asserted that Israel unquestionably had a right to defend itself , but he argued for a much more balanced approach to dealing with the region , while reiterating his belief that Israel 's operation in 2014 in Gaza was a `` disproportionate attack . '' Clinton cited her past efforts in the region but was much more critical of Palestinians . Perhaps most noteworthy was Sanders ' forceful critique of Clinton for not reaching out more to the Palestinians . `` You gave a major speech to AIPAC , which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis , and you barely mentioned the Palestinians , '' he said .
`` All that I am saying is we can not continue to be one-sided , '' he said in concluding the exchange . `` There are two sides to the issue . ''
Justice Merrick Garland ? Not if there 's a President Sanders

The Senate Republican leadership has made clear since the day Justice Antonin Scalia died that an Obama nominee would not get a vote in 2016 . Clinton and Sanders , not surprisingly , were united in their opposition to this approach . Clinton on Thursday night said `` the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history '' and challenged the Senate to act . Sanders called the situation `` an outrage . '' However , when it came to the merits of Garland himself , things got a bit more complicated . When asked what she would do if she wins and the nomination is still pending , Clinton said , `` I will take stock of where we are and move from there . '' Sanders was much more definitive . He said that , while he 'd back the Garland nomination as a senator , if he is nominated and wins in November , `` I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination '' because Garland has not made `` crystal clear '' whether he would support overturning the Citizens United decision that led to the creation of super PACs .
Straight outta Brooklyn

The New York primary is considered a critical contest for the Democratic nomination , but both candidates are heading for the airports . Sanders is flying to the Vatican for an academic conference on social and economic inequality ; Clinton is heading to California for a round of campaign events and fundraisers . He apparently wo n't see the pope , but she apparently will see George Clooney . ( Advantage : Clinton )

Which came first , the chicken or the egg ?
How many times has it happened to you guys that you snag and brake your fishing line and you want to tie a new hook to as fast as possible to continue fishing because every second that you 're out fishing and you are not fishing is a huge loss ! You are rushing to tie a fishing hook to a line and your hands are dirty , no luck . The weather is changing and you are trying to setup your fishing rig . You are tying your swivel and you made a Clinch knot but you do n't have a long enough tag end to make one more tuck at the loop and it comes to mind that it 's the same thing it 's going to hold enough with or without the extra tuck . Is it worth it to untie and tie again ? We are going to find out the answer very soon.In this article we will see fishing knots strength comparison , chart and table of two fishing knots , Clinch knot and Improved Clinch knot We will compare them to see which one is better and is the Improved really more reliable than the ordinary Clinch knot.In this testing we want to avoid any possible human influence in the test , so that means we will use standardized knots . All fishing lines are cut before tying fishing knots , every single one of them will be the same length and it will be tied the same way which means the same number of loops.Equipment we use in this test : * Mustad Hooks Big Red 1/0 * Monofilament 10lb 4.6kg Dia .30mm * Portable Electronic Fishing ScaleFishing video with our test on the Clinch and Improved clinch fishing knot.Here are the results of the tests . The results are a little bit shocking for me and I expected much better results from both , at least 20 % .Clinch knot broke three times at 2.575 kg , 2.410 kg and 2.185 kg which gives an average breaking point of 2.390kg which is only 52 % of the full line capacity ! Improved Clinch knot broke three times at 2.825 kg , 4.080 kg and 3.735 kg which gives us an average breaking point of 3.547 kg which is 77 % of capacity of the fishing line.Final word and conclusionsIf we divide average breaking points of Improved CK and CK3.547/2.390=1.48The Improved Clinch knot is stronger 48 % which is amazing to know . The Clinch knot has a problem with slipping when it 's exposed to high tension and your tag end is gone in seconds.So do n't be lazy when you tie your swivel , hook or lure , do one more step : tuck the line through the last loop . If you do n't have a long enough tag end , do it from the beginning . Remember what you read here and maybe you will hook your dream fish and you do n't want to lose it because of a knot.Enjoy fishing , tight lines ! @ Ivohttp : //howtotiefishingknots.blogspot.com
Revisiting Race and Remedies : Should the Government Play A Role in Eliminating Racial Disparities in Education and Employment ?
—————————
Here are some remarks I delivered at a panel discussion organized by the Black Law Students ' Association ( BLSA ) of the University of Pennsylvania Law School , April 5 , 2010 . The official title of the event was as above .
These remarks occasioned much comment , most of it negative . I do n't know why this should have been so . My statements on biology and paleoanthropology are of a very basic and uncontroversial kind . The empirical data I quoted is surely known to everyone . The LSAC statistics are likewise available for inspection by any inquirer . My appeal to individualism was , I thought , well within a venerable American tradition . If I made some error in fact or logic , I wish someone would point it out to me . To date ( May 16 , 2010 ) nobody has .
—————————
The context of my remarks was as follows .
Amy Wax , a professor at the law school , had published a book titled Race , Wrongs , and Remedies : Group Justice in the 21st Century . The argument of the book , very briefly , is that what can be done in law , politics , and social engineering to make amends for slavery and Jim Crow has been done , and the rest is up to African Americans themselves .
This message was displeasing to some black law professors and/or students . There was some sort of criticism session with Prof. Wax . The meeting apparently did not satisfy the black participants , so a full-scale panel discussion was organized under the auspices of the BLSA .
Prof. Wax had read and enjoyed my book We Are Doomed and sent me an appreciative email . We had exchanged a couple more friendly emails . ( I had no previous acquaintance with her . ) She suggested to the BLSA that I might be a good panelist for the upcoming discussion . The BLSA emailed me with an invitation . I emailed back to thank them , but suggested that perhaps , given my views — which I sketched for them clearly — I might not be a good `` fit '' for the panel . A couple more rounds of emails were exchanged , with the upshot that the BLSA invited me anyway , and I accepted .
I duly attended the panel discussion . Each of us was asked to speak for ten minutes . My ten-minute address is reproduced here .
Aside from myself and Prof. Wax , there were two others on the panel , both academics . One was F. Michael Higginbotham , Professor of Law at the University of Baltimore Law School , the other William A. Darity , Professor of Public Policy at Duke University . Moderator for the event was Camille Z. Charles , Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania . There were about 140 in the audience , mostly students . So far as I could see there was no official sound or video recording of the event going on , though I suppose it 's possible that someone in the audience was capturing it on an iPhone .
I posted a brief account of the event to NRO a day or two later : see here , with a follow-up erratum here .
—————————
Thank you , Madam Moderator . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
I am here this evening in the capacity of a wet blanket . I am here not to take one side or the other on the topic under debate , but to say that the topic , as written , is based on a false premise , and therefore has no satisfactory answer . I do n't believe the disparities under discussion can be eliminated . Debate about whether government should play a greater or lesser role in eliminating them is therefore , in my opinion , otiose .
When the organizers first emailed me to suggest I appear on the panel , I told them that this is my view of the matter . I said that I was flattered to be invited to speak at such a prestigious institution , and that , having two teenage children , I am always glad to get out of the house for a few hours ; but that racial disparities in education and employment have their origin in biological differences between the human races . Those differences are facts in the natural world , like the orbits of the planets . They ca n't be legislated out of existence ; nor can they be `` eliminated '' by social or political action .
—————————
That there are natural , intractable differences between the human races seems apparent to me on both rational and empirical grounds .
First , the rational grounds . If a species is divided into separate populations , and those populations are left in reproductive isolation from each other for many generations , they will diverge . If you return after several hundred generations have passed , you will observe that the various traits that characterize individuals of the species are now distributed at different frequencies in the various populations . After a few ten thousands of generations , the divergence of the populations will be so great they can no longer cross-breed ; and that is the origin of species . This is Biology 101 .
Our species separated into two parts 50 , 60 , or 70 thousand years ago , depending on which paleoanthropologist you ask.++ One part remained in Africa , the ancestral homeland . The other crossed into Southwest Asia , then split , and re-split , and re-split , until there were human populations living in near-total reproductive isolation from each other in all parts of the world . This went on for hundreds of generations , causing the divergences we see today . Different physical types , as well as differences in behavior , intelligence , and personality , are exactly what one would expect to observe when scrutinizing these divergent populations .
Now , the empirical grounds . We all notice the different physical specialties of the different races in the Olympic Games . There was a run of , I think , seven Olympics in which every one of the finalists in the men 's 100 meters sprint was of West African ancestry — 56 out of 56 finalists . You get less pronounced but similar patterns in other sports — East African distance runners , Northeast Asian divers , and so on . These differences even show up within sports , where a team sport calls for highly differentiated abilities in team members — football being the obvious example .
We see the same differences in traits that we do n't think of as directly physical , what evolutionary psychologists sometimes refer to as the `` BIP '' traits — behavior , intelligence , and personality . Two of the hardest-to-ignore manifestations here are the extraordinary differentials in criminality between white Americans and African Americans , and the persistent gaps in scores when tests of cognitive ability are given to large population samples .
There is a huge academic literature on the gaps in cognitive test results , practically all of it converging on the fact that African American mean scores on cognitive tests fall below the white means by a tad more than one white standard deviation . There is in fact so much data on this now that we have meta-studies — studies of the studies : the one best-known to me is the meta-study by Roth et al . in 2001 , which covered 39 studies involving nearly six million test-takers . That one standard deviation on cognitive testing has been so persistent across so many decades , a friend of mine , an academic sociologist , calls it `` the fundamental constant of American sociology '' — it 's like the speed of light in physics .
To see whether that universal constant appears in the study of law , I looked up the LSAC database before coming here tonight . LSAC — the Law School Admission Council — publishes splendid statistical tables on the results of the LSAT exam , broken out by sex , region , race , and so on . The last figures I could find were for 2007-08 . In that year , 117,530 students took the LSAT at least once . Of these persons , 69,792 identified themselves as `` Caucasian . '' Their mean score was 152.56 , standard deviation 8.96 . In that same year , 12,152 test-takers identified themselves as `` African American '' ; their mean score was 142.15 , standard deviation 8.40 . That 's a difference between the means of 10.41 points , which is 1.16 times the white standard deviation . So perhaps my sociologist friend is on to something .
Should you want to say at this point that these so-called tests of so-called cognitive ability measure nothing important , you had better go and argue with the authorities here at the University of Pennsylvania law school . They have carefully recorded , and posted on the internet , that half their student intake , second and third quartiles , falls between LSAT scores 166 and 171 . * *
—————————
Thus there are both rational and empirical grounds for believing in intractable group differences between the big old inbred paleolithic populations of Homo sapiens . In the context of this discussion , there are two things that need saying about these differences .
First , the differences are statistical . Any population contains variation . Variation within a population is the essence of biology . Those of you familiar with Charles Darwin 's great classic On the Origin of Species will recall that three of the first five chapters have the word `` variation '' in the chapter title . Any population will contain individuals who are fat , thin , fast , slow , tall , short , and so on .
And in the grand biological scheme of things , human population divergences are slight , the populations overlapping massively on most kinds of traits . To go back to that `` universal constant of sociology , '' for instance : Given a one standard deviation gap between black and white means , one thing we can deduce from pure mathematics is that around six million African Americans score higher on cognitive tests than the average white test-taker . In LSAT terms , over 1,300 African American test-takers in 2007-2008 scored above the white mean .
Second , the differences are abstract . Group differences are statistical truths . They exist in an abstract realm quite far removed from our everyday personal experience . They tell you nothing about the person you just met .
Group differences are , for example , one degree more abstract than individual differences . We all acknowledge individual differences all the time : she 's fat , he 's thin , she 's shy , he 's outgoing , she 's smart , he 's dumb .
We are all , to various degrees , aware of our own individual strengths and limitations . Certainly I am aware of mine . For example : My wife is a keen ballroom dancer . Because I love my wife , I did my best to become a ballroom dancer myself . For two years — two blessed years , ladies and gentlemen — I went along twice a week with her to the local Arthur Murray studio to take instruction . At the end of it , I still had two left feet . The instruction I received was like water poured on to a sheet of glass .
Even at the things we are good at , most of us are not very good . I make my living by writing ; yet I can name , in my own small personal acquaintance , a dozen people who are better writers than I am . That 's not even to mention the Shakespeares and Tolstoys . Most of us are hopeless at most things , and mediocre at the rest .
And yet — look ! We do n't lose sleep over this . We do n't sink into rage and frustration at our own individual differences , or agitate for politicians to put balm on our psychic wounds . We accept our individual shortcomings with remarkable equanimity , playing the cards we 've been dealt as best we can . That is the attitude of a healthy human being . To do otherwise would , most of us I 'm sure would agree , be un-healthy . How much more unhealthy , then , to fret and rage and agitate about mere statistical abstractions ?
Thank you , Madam Moderator .

++ Study of early Homo sap . dispersals outside Africa are an active field with many unresolved issues — see this paper , for example . So far as I am aware , though , my brief and very general remarks here are scientifically un-controversial .
[ Added early 2011 : There seems to be a growing opinion in favor of earlier dates than the `` 50 , 60 , or 70 thousand years ago '' I gave : see here , for example , and here . If anything , an earlier date strengthens my argument , giving evolution more time to work its magic on out-of-Africa Homo sap .
It 's also becoming clear that as Homo sap . fanned out east and north across Eurasia , they interbred to some degree with the more archaic Homo stocks — e.g . Neanderthals and Denisovans — that they encountered , who had left Africa long ( > 500,000 years ) before . Since these archaic stocks were very different from each other — they are commonly spoken of as separate species — the implication is for even more and faster differentiation of different geographical populations , and in particular of the African and out-of-African super-populations , again strengthening the argument . ]

Chavez is a hero in the Middle East .
Ministry of People 's Power for Foreign Affairs , Caracas
May 31 , 2010 -- The President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , Commander Hugo Chávez , emphatically condemns the brutal massacre perpetrated by the State of Israel against the members of the Liberty Flotilla , as a result of the war action started by the Israeli Army against defenceless civilians , who tried to carry humanitarian aid supplies to the Palestinian people of the Gaza Strip , who are victims of the criminal blockade imposed by the State of Israel .
President Hugo Chávez , on behalf of his government and the Venezuelan people , expresses his deepest regret and sends his deepest condolences to the families and relatives of the heroes who have been victims of this state crime , and commit to honour their memory and to give the necessary help so that the responsible of these murderers are severely punished .
The revolutionary government of Venezuela will continue denouncing the terrorist and criminal nature of Israel , and it reaffirms , today more than ever , its unbreakable commitment with the fight of the Palestinian people for freedom , the sovereignty and the dignity .
Venezuela will support UN Human Rights Council investigation on Israeli attack against humanitarian boat convoy
Office of the Ministry of People 's Power for Foreign Affairs , Caracas
June 2 , 2010 -- The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will support the investigation that the UN Human Rights Council will conduct on the Israeli army 's attack against the humanitarian boat convoy , which tried to transport humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip .
This announcement was made by the Minister of People 's Power for Foreign Affairs Nicolas Maduro , who is in Punta Cana , Dominican Republic , attending the World Summit on the Future of Haiti .
The Venezuelan official highlighted : `` we ratified the strongest condemnation , and we also support the decision of the UN Human rights Council to start an investigation . We are going to support this investigation . ''
The UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution , which the United States refused to endorse , to condemn the attack of Israeli assault forces on a humanitarian aid flotilla bound for Gaza .
Most of the members of the UN Human Rights Council , whose sessions take place in Geneva , condemned and regretted this event , which resulted in the killing of nine people , most of them Turkish nationals .
These measure includes the dispatch of an independent fact finding mission to investigate violations of international law resulting from the Israeli attack .
In this regard , Maduro indicated that this investigation `` must aim to punish this state-terrorist crime against a group of civilians transporting humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people of the Gaza Strip . ''
On Tuesday , June 1 , the UN Security Council held an urgent debate but it did not issue a condemnation against Israel for the attack . It only regretted the killing of people during the Israeli assault against the humanitarian convoy , but it did not announce measures to prevent these events from happening in the future .
Cuba : Statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Havana , May 31 , 2010 -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba has learned with profound concern of the criminal attack perpetrated in the early hours of May 31 by the special forces of the Israeli Army on a flotilla of boats which , in international waters , was transporting humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people resident in the Gaza Strip , an attack that provoked death and injury among various members of that flotilla .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses its most energetic condemnation of this devious and criminal attack on the part of the Israeli government and calls on the international community and peace-loving peoples to demand the immediate lifting by the Israeli authorities of the illegal , ruthless and genocidal blockade of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip .
Cuba wishes to convey its most heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and reiterates its support for and solidarity with the just cause of the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights , which include the creation of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital .

Black Lives Matter protests in New York , Chicago , Minnesota and Louisiana resulted in arrests of more than 300 people over the weekend , CNN reported Monday . Last week 's police shootings of two black men in separate incidents — Alton Sterling and Philando Castile — triggered protests , which turned violent in Dallas , Texas , where five police officers were shot dead .
Castile was fatally shot by an officer last Wednesday during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights , Minnesota . His mother , Valerie Castile , issued a statement Sunday through her attorney urging people to maintain peace and calm .
“ When demonstrations become violent , it disrespects my son and his memory . Philando was a man of peace and dignity . I ask you to at all times remain peaceful in your expressions of concern regarding his death at the hands of the police . I promise that we will not rest until justice prevails , ” she said .
In Louisiana 's capital city , Baton Rouge , where Sterling was killed last Tuesday , more than 160 people were arrested over the weekend during protests and police used riot gear to tackle the crowd . Sterling was shot dead by a white police officer who had received a tip-off that the 37-year-old had threatened the caller with a gun .
Among those arrested in Baton Rouge was prominent Black Lives Matter leader DeRay McKesson . McKesson was reportedly streaming live on social media when he was arrested . He was released Sunday afternoon .
On Sunday , Louisiana Gov . John Bel Edwards said he was “ very proud ” of how the state law enforcement officials responded to the protests . He also said that the police officers were not overly aggressive .
“ The police tactics in response have been very moderate . I 'm very proud of that , ” Edwards said .
Sgt . Don Coppola , Baton Rouge police spokesman , held outside demonstrators responsible for some violence and several arrests . One officer lost teeth when a projectile was thrown outside police headquarters during the protests . Police confiscated three rifles , three shotguns and two pistols during that protest .
“ It appears the protest at Baton Rouge Police Headquarters have become more violent as out of town protesters are arriving , ” Coppola reportedly said .
Meanwhile , Micah Johnson — the suspect of last Thursday 's Dallas violence — had plotted larger attacks , according to Dallas Police Chief David Brown . Johnson , an Army veteran , had taunted officials during two hours of negotiations by laughing and , at one point , singing at them , Brown told CNN Sunday . The standoff between Johnson and police ended early Friday after the police detonated a bomb robot , killing Johnson .
“ We 're convinced that this suspect had other plans and thought that what he was doing was righteous and believed that he was going to target law enforcement — make us pay for what he sees as law enforcement 's efforts to punish people of color , ” Brown told CNN .
The police chief also said that the police found bomb-making materials and a journal at Johnson 's home indicating that he was practicing detonations . He said Johnson “ obviously had some delusion . There was quite a bit of rambling in the journal that 's hard to decipher . ”
“ At the scene where he was killed , he wrote some lettering in blood on the walls , which leads us to believe he was wounded on the way up the stairwell , on the second floor of the El Centro building and where we detonated the device to end the standoff there was more lettering written in his own blood , ” Brown reportedly said .
Migraines can feel like downright torture .
And there are n't many options to help . You could try a prescription . But most do n't work . And the ones that do ? You guessed it . They come with some severe side effects .
But now research shows that an herbal extract can provide relief . More specifically , it can cut the frequency of migraines by up to 50 percent .
Researchers with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York studied the effects of this extract on 245 patients . They published their results in the journal Neurology.1
One group of patients received 75 mg of the extract twice a day , a second received 50 mg twice a day and a third received a placebo . Subjects took the supplements for four months . At the end of the study the patients who took 50 mg of the extract experienced a 36 percent decrease in migraine attack frequency . But the ones who took 75 mg of the extract twice a day had an almost 50 percent decrease in their rates of migraine attack .
A German study found similar results.2 33 adults took 50 mg of the extract twice a day while 27 adults took a placebo .
At the start of the study participants reported suffering an average of 3.3 migraines each month . At four weeks , the adults on the extract had just 1.8 migraines per month . And with time it only got better . At eight weeks the extract reduced migraines to 1.3 per month—a 61 percent decrease . The best part…no side effects .
What can you take to reduce your migraines ?
Butterbur .
Butterbur is a shrub native to Europe , parts of Asia , and North America with wet , marshy land.3 It gets its name from the traditional use of using its large leaves to wrap butter in warm weather . It 's used for an array of ailments . And the leaves and roots are used to make extract supplements .
When a migraine comes on , blood vessels expand and become inflamed.4 The inflamed blood vessels press on nerve fibers which cause pain . Throbbing , nausea , and sensitivity to light can accompany migraine attacks .
Butterbur has anti-inflammatory and muscle-relaxant effects.5 Both of which prove to offer relief when a migraine attacks . It helps smooth muscles in the blood vessel walls in the brain .
Whereas headaches usually last for only a few hours , migraines can last several hours or even days.6 There is no cure . Doctors usually prescribe antidepressants , blood pressure medication , and seizure medication to reduce migraine attacks . Of course those come with a laundry list of side effects : loss , dizziness , blurred vision , weight gain , and pancreatitis to name a few.7 But now that you know this safe alternative—and one that actually works—there 's really no reason to put your health in danger .
Just keep in mind ; you do still need to be careful with butterbur . The raw , unprocessed plant can contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids , which are toxic and cause liver damage . So make sure you check the label to make sure it is PA-free .
PA-free butterbur is safe and effective . In as little as a month you can start to receive relief from those debilitating migraines .

burnetcountytexasorg Burnet County Judge James Oakley has apologized after suggesting that a suspect should be lynched .
A Texas judge is under fire over a comment he posted to Facebook suggesting that a black man suspected of killing a local police officer should be lynched .
“ Time for a tree and a rope , ” he posted on Monday to the San Antonio Police Department 's Facebook page , according to the Austin American-Statesman .
Burnet County Judge James Oakley took responsibility for the rash words on Wednesday . He apologized and called his language “ unfortunate , ” but denied that it contained any racial undertones .
“ I never made that connection but I do see how somebody could make that connection and be offended towards that . That was not my intent , ” he told The Huffington Post on the phone . “ Maybe I watched too many Westerns when I was little . ”
The article he posted contained news of an arrest made in Sunday 's shooting death of San Antonio Police Detective Benjamin Marconi . Otis Tyrone McKane , who is black , was arrested on suspicion of murdering Marconi one day after the detective , who was white , was fatally shot inside his patrol car .
In an emailed statement , Oakley called his response “ curt and harsh . ”
“ What I should have posted , if anything , is a comment that more clearly reflects my opinion on the cowardly crime of the senseless murder of a law enforcement officer . My view of the ‘ suspect , ' whom has admitted to the murder , is the same regardless of ethnicity or gender , ” he said . ( The suspect had told police when he was arrested that he “ lashed out at somebody , ” adding “ I 'm sorry . ” )
Oakley added that he was an advocate of due process and does n't preside over criminal court .
“ I also support the death penalty in cases where the ultimate crime has been committed and there is clear and complete evidence and where all steps of the judicial process have been respected , ” he said .
A group that monitors Texas ' Pedernales Electric Cooperative , where Oakley is a board officer , was among those enraged by his words .
“ What Mr. Oakley suggested was racist , ” PEC Truth Watch wrote in a blog post .
“ A sitting County Judge in Texas has suggested that a black man accused of a crime in Houston , TX should be lynched . Do the members and employees of PEC agree with Mr. Oakley 's statement ? Do the people of Burnet County ? I trust they do not agree , ” it continues . “ I hope they believe America to be a nation of laws and due process . The accused is entitled to a defense before a jury , however heinous the accusations against him may be . ”
On Launch Pad 39A at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida , workers prepare to remove the seal from the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate , or GUCP , on space shuttle Endeavour 's external fuel tank . A leak of hydrogen at this location during tanking June 12 for the STS-127 mission caused the mission to be scrubbed at 12:26 a.m. June 13 .
NASA willtry to launch the space shuttle Endeavour on July 11 , nearlya month late , after plugging a potentially dangerous hydrogen gas leak , topmission managers said Wednesday .
Endeavour successfullypassed a leak check during a fueling test at its seaside Florida launch pad today , settingthe stage for a planned 7:39 p.m. EDT ( 2339 GMT ) liftoff toward theInternational Space Station on July 11 , said Mike Moses , who leads the shuttle ? smission management team .
NASAinitially tried to launch Endeavour on June 13 , then again on June 17 , but the hydrogengas leak in the shuttle ? s external fuel tank thwartedboth attempts .
Engineers pinpointedthe leak in a misaligned ground umbilical carrier plate ( GUCP ) on the tank . Theplate connects to a vent line that siphons excess hydrogen gas safely away fromthe shuttle during fueling .
? This one Ifeel really good about , that we ? ve got that problem licked and we ? re not goingto see another GUCP leak again on the next launch attempt , ? Moses toldreporters .
Leak fix a success
Engineers replaceda Teflon seal and realigned the problematic plate using special washers to plugthe leak , which did not reappear during today ? s fueling test at the Kennedy Space Centerin Cape Canaveral , Fla .
? Looks like the tank performed well , ? said Endeavour ? scommander Mark Polansky via his Twitter page .
Polansky is leading a seven-astronaut crew tasked withdelivering the last piece of Japan ? s massiveKibo laboratory to the International Space Station during a marathon 16-daymission . It is NASA ? s third shuttle flight of the year , but the first to thestation since the outpost doubledits crew size to six people last month .
NASA has strictrules on the amount of hydrogen gas that can be near a space shuttle at launchtime because the extremely flammable gas can pose an explosion risk to the shuttleand its astronaut crew .
Duringfueling , the space shuttle ? s external tank is loaded with about 526,000 gallonsof super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . Some of that hydrogen boilsinto gas over time and must be safely vented away from the shuttle and beharmlessly burned off elsewhere .
Endeavour ? srepaired tank passed today ? s test with flying colors , mission managers said .
`` Therewere absolutely no leak indications whatsoever noted on the two leakdetectors , '' said NASA launch director Pete Nickolenko . `` We'llcontinue to look at the data , and our next step is to move toward launch . ''
The Endeavour astronauts are slated to go into quarantine thisweekend and return to their Florida spaceport on Tuesday , Polansky said . The countdownto Endeavour ? s July 11 launch will begin next Wednesday night , NASA officials said .
Atlantis window work
While oneteam of engineers prepares Endeavour for launch , another is tacklinga window issue on the shuttle Atlantis .
During theshuttle ? s May flights to the Hubble Space Telescope , a work light knob jammed upagainst a flight deck window pane and dashboard panel . Initially the knob wasstuck fast , but engineers managed to remove it on Tuesday by pressurizingAtlantis ? cabin and applying dry ice on the knob .
Moses said techniciansplan to take a mold of the window to see if the knob has caused damage thatwould require replacing the inner window , a potentially lengthy repair that couldsideline Atlantis for up to eight months .
The shuttleis currently slated to launch supplies and parts to the International SpaceStation on Nov. 12 .
? It couldtake a very long time , it sounds very scary , ? Moses said of any serious repair . ? But then again , I ? ve learned this team is really good at re-sequencing andcoming up with some creative ways to do some work in parallel . ?
You want to be informed so you can live cleaner , and use skincare and beauty products that are as safe as possible for you and your family . But how do you figure out which products are safe and which are n't ? There is a wide spectrum , going from completely harmless to extremely toxic , and for many people knowing which side of the spectrum their products are on is a mystery . This is mainly because of two reasons . First , ingredient lists are confusing and difficult to understand . Even when the chemicals used are disclosed , it is n't obvious if that chemical is toxic or safe . On top of that , many companies hide their chemicals inside of words like “ fragrance ” , and it is impossible to know what chemicals make up that fragrance . It is safe to assume that if they are hiding the chemical names behind “ fragrance ” they are doing it because they most likely are n't safe . The second reason is because there is no universal , independent system for classifying products as “ safe ” . As long as there is one natural ingredient in the product it can be labeled as natural , which is n't helpful .
1 . Think Dirty
Think Dirty is an app launched in 2013 that lets you scan the barcodes of products to determine how safe they are . It gives an overall rating out of 10 for the product and then further breaks it down to the individual ingredient level and ranks each of those out of 10 as well . It also categorizes the risk based on cancer risk , developmental & reproductive toxicity , and allergies & immunotoxins .
Once you download this app , you might become addicted and start scanning everything in your bathroom to see how dangerous it is . This app is highly recommended because it will open your eyes to the dangers of what you are using on your body every single day . You will be shocked at how many products you use that seem safe , are even labelled “ natural ” , but end up scoring 7-10 .
methodology Think Dirty is easy to use , has over 350,000 products in its database , and has some really cool features like recommended products with links to where you can purchase . This is great for finding products that are similar to those you use now but as much cleaner . They explain theiraround their scoring system here . Basically , they examine publically available data from places like the FDA and Health Canada on each ingredient , and the founder and advisory board assign the rankings . The Advisory Board has some industry and scientific experts , but it also has a few members that do n't seem to have the credentials to assign these types of ratings .
2 . EWG 's Skin Deep Database
EWG 's Skin Deep Database has been around since 2004 and has 65,000 products in its database . It allows you to search for products , brands , ingredients and companies . Similar to Think Dirty it ranks each product out of 10 and breaks it down to an individual ingredient level . You can also browse by product category and find the top scoring products as determined by EWG , which ultimately get an EWG Verified badge . They also have an app that allows barcode scanning of products , but it lacks many of the extra features of the Think Dirty app . It also does n't have as many products in its database . When trying it out on just a few products in my bathroom , I found some right away that were in the Think Dirty database and not in the EWG Database . However , the EWG database is an excellent resource and the browse function is great . I also think that with the information available about each database , the EWG rating methodology appears more thorough , scientific , and objective compared to the Think Dirty methodology . So , I think it is important to use both databases if possible before making any conclusions on the safety of a product . For example , the Think Dirty App ranked the Aveeno Skin Relief Body Wash as a 10/10 , i.e . the worst rating , mainly because of the quaternium-15 . The EWG database rated the same product as a 3/10 , indicating it is significantly safer than the Think Dirty App would indicate .
3 . CertClean
CertClean aims to be North America 's leading certification for safer beauty and personal care products . For a product to earn the CertClean designation , it must be free of potentially harmful ingredients such as carcinogens , hormone disrupters , etc . Basically , the product ca n't have any of the ingredients found in this list . It prioritizes human health over the use of natural or organic ingredients . It is quite new and only has 1000 products certified so far , look for this to soon start appearing on more and more products that are truly safe .
A cosmos without the Daleks scarcely bears thinking about .
Without the mutated remnants of the seemingly indestructible planet Skaro , we do n't know if Doctor Who had survived . If Terry Nation had dreamt up the Voord to menace Barbara in the series fifth episode , Den of Geek may well be paying tribute to Doctor Who as an obscure cult concern , cherished by a few but forgotten by many . Instead , we do things like this .
This list is not limited to the television series , because Doctor Who is n't limited to the television series . And hey , why not use our Comments Section to add your own list or express disbelief that I 've not included Evil of the Daleks in mine ?
10 . Daleks – Invasion Earth : 2150 A.D .
There 's something eternally Sunday lunchtime about the Amicus Dalek films , a pleasant afternoon 's stroll through mail-apocalyptic London up the woodland roads to Bedfordshire . And it 's hard to maintain the grimness of the TV original while a jazz score flourishes ( even Dortmun 's death scene features incongruous parping ) , what with vans smashing through Dalek barricades , and Bernard Cribbins dressed in figure-hugging PVC trying to stop the Dalek ship dispensing Smarties .
Plus , instead of the Slyther , there 's Philip Madoc . This is a vast improvement . There 's even bonus Eileen Way . Old Mother lives !
Scene Where You Realise How Brilliant It Is : The score . It might be Jeffless jazz but it 's jauntier than the rakish application of a wide-brimmed hat .
9 . The Dalek Master Plan
Yes reader , it is a big one . Not satisfied with alien forests , invasions of Earth , and chases through time and space , Terry Nation 's next idea was to try all three at once , with a Christmas Special thrown in . And if we 're going to have the first companion death , what the hell , let 's throw in the second one as well while we 're at it . And aliens . Lots of aliens . And an episode set in ancient Egypt . And the first of Kevin Stoney 's two great villain roles . And the return of the Meddling Monk . And unparalleled destruction . And that incredibly bleak ending . What larks !
Twelve episodes of fun , adventure , death , and mayhem . Thirteen if you count Mission to the Unknown - when the production team decide to run a full episode building up to the story , featuring none of the regular cast , you know they think they 're onto something .
Scene Where You Realise How Brilliant It Is : Personally , I could watch Mavic Chen monologue for a whole episode .
8 . To the Death
Nick Briggs is n't best known for his writing , but he 's obviously paid attention while hanging around on set during season finales . When tasked with coming up with a finale to the four years long Eighth Doctor/Lucie Miller arc , logically he does it with a huge emotional punch and as a sequel to The Dalek Invasion of Earth .
Typically , Doctor Who is a fun , action adventure . Noticeably , many of its classics diverge from this by being fundamentally grim . As the title suggests , this is one of those stories . The Daleks in it is n't especially cunning , or scheming , or clever , but they 're just nasty and efficient . Almost as horrible as the actual invasion is the first episode where Daleks soften up humanity with a bombardment of plague .
Then , when they do turn up , there 's no temporary paralysis , or tenuous reasons for them not to fire . They shoot basically everybody when they see them . The only reason they lose is because people are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice , and there 's no space-dust or timey-wimey solution to it .

7 . Revelation of the Daleks
It 's a relief , given his brief tenure , that Colin Baker 's Dalek story is a good one , a deliciously warped version of Evelyn Waugh 's superb The Loved One – only this time with body snatching , Alexei Sayle , and explosions . Technically , though , it 's more of a Davros story than a Dalek one , but what it does have is Graeme Harper directing ( thrusting eye stalks into close-ups and generally having fun making their mere presence sinister ) and a new take on an old concept : what if you took the idea of Cyber-conversion and applied it to Daleks instead . Thus we have a gruesome scene in which someone discovers their father midway through conversion into a Dalek mutant , oscillating between begging for death and ranting about racial purity .
Plus , Davros is brilliant in this . It 's impossible to watch him in the position of a businessman without imagining The Apprentice or Dragon 's Den .

6 . Children of the Revolution
As sequels to Evil of the Daleks go , this one really nails the concept of human Daleks in a way that Daleks in Manhattan sadly failed to ( also , at no point does it conjure up an image of the Cult of Skaro chasing a pig ) . Fortunately the Doctor Who is a Magazine comic strip managed it in 2002 , and what 's more it did it with a big Lovecraftian monster , multi-colorDaleks and an underwater city .
Without any impetus to portray humanity in a positive light , Children of the Revolution explores prejudice and tolerance in a way that does n't make us look like the good guys .
Bubbling under from the comic strip , the recently released Nemesis of the Daleks and Fire and Brimstone – because spider-Daleks are easier to draw than to animate .

5 . Remembrance of the Daleks
Ah , the McCoy era . And did n't we have trouble with the prototype ?
Featuring one of Keff McCulloch 's better soundtracks , the pre-credits sequence seems like it 's come from nowhere . Short , compact , it sets the scene dramatically and features the first of several excellent model sequences . It 's as confident a statement of intent as the show has ever seen .
It 's a testament to the BBC 's attitude towards the show at the time that they forbade director Andrew Morgan from working on the show again after the story went over budget , rather than take note of how good the series could look with a bit of money spent on it .
As well as looking the part , the script brought a swagger and confidence to the show that it had n't seen for many series . It 's almost as seismic a shift as The Ark in Space was back in 1975 . We 're back to questioning the Doctor 's morality , his origins , and his methods . Meanwhile , Sylvester McCoy has nailed the role and Ace has calmed down a bit since Dragonfire . For the first time in a few years , things boded very well indeed .

4 . Dalek
Rob Shearman , purveyor of disturbing dwarf-death and rampaging floating baby , was given the task of bringing the Daleks back to television on the strength of his excellent work for Big Finish . His only previous TV credit was for an episode of Born and Bred . It 's hard to imagine this sort of opportunity for inexperienced writers arising again without the program going on another long hiatus first .
Happily , after many redrafts and the temporary non-availability of Daleks , this episode manages to bring the fear-factor back with some excellent storytelling and some cutting dialogue . While the Daleks ' power to frighten may have since diminished by necessity , this episode remains a testament to the innate brilliance of the idea of a Dalek , and what can be done with it .

3 . Genesis of the Daleks
As I said before , Doctor Who is not , generally speaking , a very morose show . Even in its grimmer stories , there are plenty of moments of levity . In Genesis of the Daleks there is `` No tea Harry '' and that 's pretty much it .
From its loaded Seventh Seal references to the slow motion machine gun death spasms , death is introduced in abundance . Being their origin , much of the killing is not performed by Daleks til later in the story . Humanoids do unspeakable things unto humanoid , and we meet the halfway point in Michael Wisher 's deathless performance as Davros .
The Doctor and his friends spend much of their time suffering and losing . Even after Tom Baker 's definitive `` Do I have the right ? '' scene , the Doctor goes back on his decision and later attempts to destroy the Dalek incubation chambers . Stakes are high and desperate acts are committed .
Even then , at the end of everything , it 's still not clear whether the Doctor 's actions did more harm than good .

2 . The Parting of the Ways
In many ways the 2005 series is just one big Dalek story . Even before the show returned to our screens there had been the tiny matter of the Time War , the motherlode of temporal skirmishes . You could even argue that series one is a sequel to Genesis of the Daleks .
One thing viewers want from Dalek stories - because we 're all horrible people , you understand - is nastiness and carnage . Russell T Davies understood this perfectly , and delivered a seemingly invincible army zapping countless innocents and melting Australia . The Doctor is prepped to commit genocide to stop this , but ultimately would rather die than do so again . Thus , he is saved and reborn .
Nice one Rusty .

1.The Power of the Daleks
How unbelievably brilliant is this for a gamble : you change your lead actor , having him play a different version of the same man , and then you make him a hard sell ? Then , once the audience have become suspicious , you have his hero credentials partially restored by his deadliest enemies , only to have it strongly implied that he actually saved the day by accident ? Insanity , surely ? Well , yeah , kinda . Audiences at the time did n't warm to Patrick Troughton , but we 've had nearly fifty years of hindsight to see how our parents and grandparents were clearly mad with grief .
Power is thematically astute , a great combination of character and plot , and - from what images we have – it looked fantastic . Viewers recall the relentless march of the Dalek production line , and the sight of mutant clones being bathed in chemical baths . The soundtrack hints at a relentless onslaught in later episodes as an inevitable crescendo to the earlier slow build of dread .
The Daleks have never been as insidious , or as lethal .

And one to miss
The TV Movie . We can only speculate as to why the Daleks sound like robotic frogs in this one . Fortunately they 're only in the first twenty seconds .

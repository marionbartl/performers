Richella Heekin and Ben Marlow ( Special to AL.com )
Remember the British woman who garnered international attention after mistaking Birmingham , Alabama for Birmingham , England when planning a surprise trip to Las Vegas for her boyfriend 's birthday ?
Well , soon there will be no confusion .
During their upcoming trip to the United States , Richella Heekin and her boyfriend , Ben Marlow , will get to visit and become properly acquainted with Birmingham , Ala .
Couple who confused Birmingham , Alabama airport with Birmingham , England gets free Las Vegas trip A British couple thought their trip of a lifetime was ruined when they arrived to the Birmingham , England airport expecting to hop a flight to Las Vegas , and instead learned their flight was departing from Birmingham , Alabama instead .
`` I think it is just a great chance for us to demonstrate to people in Birmingham , England and throughout the UK that Birmingham ( Alabama ) is a worthy tourist destination in its own right , '' said Tom Cosby , a retired Birmingham businessman . `` Certainly , it was a heart-warming story to find out how this young woman made an honest mistake , a mistake that many other people have made . ''
When Iron City hosted popular British band Arctic Monkeys in 2013 at least 12 residents of England mistakenly bought tickets to the show , according to the music venue .
Cosby is arranging the couple 's trip with the assistance of the Greater Birmingham Convention & Visitors Bureau and several of Magic City 's popular tourist attractions . Merrill Stewart of Stewart Perry Construction Company is paying for the couple 's airfare to Birmingham .
This story began a couple of weeks ago when Heekin and Marlow arrived at the Birmingham , England airport for their flight to Las Vegas , but learned , sadly , that their plane was actually departing from Birmingham , Ala .
Their tickets could n't be exchanged or refunded .
Virgin Holidays quickly came to the couple 's rescue and offered them free airfare and five free nights of accommodations in Las Vegas to make up for the trip they lost .
Richard Branson tweets about couple who confuses Birmingham , Alabama with Birmingham , England English business magnate and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson loves a good surprise .
Cosby said the couple will have an even better time in Magic City than in Sin City .
`` It is just an opportunity to display our southern hospitality , for which we are world famous , and point out to the good folks in our namesake city - Birmingham , England - that this is a town well-worth visiting , '' he said .
The couple 's trip is tentatively planned for some time in August . They will fly Virgin Atlantic Airways direct to Las Vegas and later fly direct from Las Vegas to Birmingham , Alabama . Heekin and Marlow will fly back to Sin City to catch a return flight home .
Cosby said he expects the couple to spend two or three nights in Magic City where they will receive free concert tickets to Iron City , free day of ziplining at Red Mountain Park and other yet unplanned activities .
`` We want to make sure they get to sample Birmingham 's great cuisine , '' he said . `` We are going to pair them with a couple close to their own age and let them explore Lakeview and Avondale . ''
Heekin told AL.com she is appreciative of Cosby 's `` generous offer '' and is looking forward to visiting the South , and the city named after her Birmingham .
Before her `` silly mistake , '' Heekin said she did n't know anything about Birmingham , Ala. besides that it existed . After , though , she decided to do a little research .
`` I did Google and happened across one website that drew my attention to Red Mountain Park , '' Heekin said . `` It sounds like both a fun and interesting place to visit . ''
Despite the outcome , Heekin said she is still surprised by the media attention her mix-up received .
`` It was initially just meant to be a silly story when a family friend contacted the local media , '' she said in an email to AL.com . `` It just escalated when there were a huge amount of negative comments on social media . There were a few positive comments , but mainly negative and to be honest , I have n't read very many for that reason .
It was extremely embarrassing that my expensive mistake is known on a global basis , but I have got over it , '' she added . `` Plus , when you get a holiday and a few tweet mentions from Richard Branson , it did make it slightly easier to bear . ''
Semper Gumby is an unofficial dog Latin motto for the United States Marine Corps , United States Coast Guard , United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps , Navy submariners , Navy Seabees , Army Unit Supply Specialists , and the Civil Air Patrol . It is a play on the official motto Semper Fortis which means `` Always Strong '' , and that of the US Coast Guard , Semper Paratus , meaning `` Always Ready . '' Semper Gumby , referring to the animated clay character Gumby , means `` Always Flexible '' . [ 1 ] The real Latin phrase meaning `` Always Flexible '' is Semper Flexibilis .
While the first use of Semper Gumby is often assigned to Captain Jay Farmer of HMM-264 in 1984 who actually flew with a Gumby character toy mounted on the standby compass on the instrument panel of his CH-46E nicknamed `` Airwolf '' , the term was in use in 1977/78 in 1st Battalion , 5th Marines at Camp Pendleton .
While popular belief has it that the term was first referenced by the 1st Sgt TOW Co. 3rd Tank Battalion 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade ( Task Force Ripper ) prior to deployment of Operation Desert Shield from MCAGCC 29 Palms , Ca . on August 15 , 1990 . `` Marines , My platoon commander in Nam used to tell us 'Semper Gumby , Always Flexible ' . '' The 3rd Battalion , 11th Marines has `` always flexible '' as part of their official motto . Semper Gumby is also a common phrase used in the field of emergency management .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A New York state appeals court on Tuesday threw out Facebook Inc 's unusual malicious prosecution lawsuit against DLA Piper and two other law firms that have represented a fugitive who claimed a 50 percent stake in the social media company .

Reversing a lower court ruling , the Appellate Division in Manhattan rejected “ conclusory ” allegations by Facebook and its chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , that the firms knew or should have known that their client Paul Ceglia 's case was fraudulent and based on a forged contract .
Ceglia , 42 , a wood pellet salesman from Wellsville , New York , had sued Facebook and Zuckerberg in June 2010 , saying a 2003 “ work-for-hire ” contract for Zuckerberg to do programming for Ceglia 's company Street Fax entitled him to half of Facebook .
Federal prosecutors later deemed the contract a forgery and brought criminal charges against Ceglia .
He had been free on bail ahead of a trial set for May 4 , 2015 , but early last March Ceglia removed his electronic ankle bracelet and disappeared , along with his wife , two children and a dog .
Facebook is now valued at roughly $ 300 billion .
In May , a state judge said Facebook and Zuckerberg could pursue claims that DLA Piper , one of the world 's largest law firms , as well as Milberg LLP and Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman , knew Ceglia 's lawsuit lacked merit .
But in a 4-0 decision , the appeals court noted that the law firms had found experts to counter Facebook 's forgery claim , and that Ceglia had passed a lie detector test .
The court called Facebook 's allegation that the firms lacked probable cause to pursue Ceglia 's case “ entirely conclusory . ”
Facebook said it is evaluating whether to appeal .
“ We are disappointed , ” a spokeswoman said . “ DLA Piper and the other named law firms possessed evidence proving the case was based on forged documents and that Paul Ceglia 's claim was a fraud , but chose to pursue it anyway . We believe they should be held accountable . ”
Matthew Dontzin , a lawyer representing DLA Piper , said Facebook and Zuckerberg sued solely “ to deter lawyers from taking them on . These types of bullying tactics have no place in the courthouse and today justice was done . ”
Sigmund Wissner-Gross , a lawyer representing Lippes Mathias , said he was pleased with the decision . Milberg 's lawyer Gregory Joseph declined to comment .
The Facebook spokeswoman said the Menlo Park , California-based company will continue litigation against Paul Argentieri , another of Ceglia 's lawyers . He could not be reached for comment .
The case is Facebook Inc et al v. DLA Piper LLP et al , New York State Supreme Court , Appellate Division , 1st Department , No . 16162 .
What Is Chocolate Ganache ?
Ganache is a mixture of chocolate and cream typically but other types of fat can be used in place of cream like butter , coconut cream or palm oil . Ganache may have additions like eggs or sugar as well as glucose or honey to help smooth the texture . Chocolate ganache is used in making coating cakes or as a truffle filling and pastry cream filling .
What Is A Broken Ganache ?
A broken ganache is where the fat and the chocolate separate and become gritty . It is also known as a split ganache or seized ganache . See this photo :
How To Fix A Broken Ganache ?
Santa Barbara Chocolate is a high quality , high cocoa butter content chocolate , so it requires more delicate procedures when working with it as opposed to low fat high sugar chocolate chips .
If in your recipe preparation the ganache splits or seizes you can fix the problem quickly and easily with these recommendations below .
CHOCOLATIER TIP : When making ganache add the unmelted chocolate to the heated cream mixture and stir constantly . This will minimize ganache issues .
Easy Ganache Fixing :
1 ) Easy ganache problem fix and the one I teach our chocolatiers as the first thing to try ( use an electric hand whisk ) :
2 ) To be safe while whisking you can also add a little honey or glucose - just a touch .
3 ) If it looks like the ganache is starting to split again , add a little warm milk and whisk mixing well - this for sure will solve any issues .
The cause of the split ganache is due to the amount of total fat and fluid ratio in the ganache . In the future you can reduce the total fat content in your recipe by cutting butter and replacing with milk or going with a lower fat chocolate . But first try the recommendation of adding unmelted chocolate to the heated cream mixture and stirring constantly . This likely will solve your problem .

So , one of my biggest pet peeves as a PT is seeing athletes hurt as a result of poor coaching and training . Overuse injuries provide lots of clients for my practice . While this is good for business , I would really like to help prevent these injuries . I need your help . It all starts with education and a willingness on the part of health and fitness professionals to advocate strongly for our young athletes .
Consider the following scenario : a 14 y/o freshman left-handed pitcher presents for rehab to recover from Little League Shoulder . He was hurt on the second day of his high school 's fall conditioning program . He was being forced to throw in excess of 200 feet . His exact words were , “ I was sore after day one , but I felt my shoulder explode on the second day of the program. ” Think this is a coincidence ? Hardly .
Another player from the same school ( a sophomore right hander ) is also in my clinic recovering from an avulsion fracture of his medial epicondyle that he too suffered on the second day of the same throwing workout . I emailed the left-handed pitcher 's father with details about throwing biomechanics and how they decline with long distance throwing . I also expressed my concern over the coach 's aggressive throwing program . The father emailed back and said he too disagreed with the throwing program . However , the coach simply told him his son had “ not been properly coached ” prior to getting to his program . Are you kidding me ? Look at the images below to appreciate the type of damage done by overzealous throwing programs .
Coaches need to be more accountable to their training programs and philosophies . Both of these players are missing no less than 3 months of baseball because the coach is clueless about the impact of aggressive long toss and how it may actually be detrimental to his players as opposed to actually improving their throwing technique/performance .

So , how do we make a positive impact and prevent unnecessary injuries like the ones I have discussed ? I feel we need to look at the following strategies :
Educate parents and coaches through talks and seminars Network with high school athletic trainers to ensure they have some feedback/input with respect to preventive training philosophies as well as a direct pipeline to coaches Reach the athletes directly through arm care screenings , FMS evals and professionally directed throwing programs Team with high profile baseball players or coaches who understand the game at the highest level and will spread the message in a positive and constructive manner Participate in CEU course for coaches and present on throwing programs , shoulder strengthening and mobility training
Based on these two cases , I am brainstorming ways I can become more of a “ voice ” in the baseball community in my area . It is tough to convince pushy parents and misguided coaches that young kids do n't need to throw curveballs or that pitchers should probably not be forced to throw over 200 feet in hopes of increasing arm velocity . But , we need to step up and make a difference or more young kids will be suffering from tendinitis , Little League Elbow/Shoulder , labral tears or other overuse injuries .

As a father , coach , educator and physical therapist , my personal mission is to make a difference in the lives of those around me . I know many may simply be unaware that there is a better or safer way . As the emphasis on early specialization continues to grow in our country , now is the time to take action and help stop many of these injuries .
The Angels have signed infielder John McDonald to a minor league deal with a Spring Training invite , reports Rob Bradford of WEEI.com on Twitter . McDonald will earn $ 850K , plus incentives , if he makes the big league club , Bradford further tweets . The 39-year-old is represented by Relativity Baseball .
Last year was an adventurous campaign even for the well-traveled McDonald . He saw limited time with four MLB clubs : the Pirates , Indians , Phillies , and Red Sox . Over just 77 plate appearances , McDonald slashed a meager .116/.197/.174 .
McDonald has spent the bulk of his fifteen seasons to date in Cleveland and Toronto . He has a lifetime .235/.274/.327 triple-slash in 2,560 plate appearances . The slick fielder continues to hang his hat on his defensive ability . Spending most of his time up the middle at short and second , McDonald has accumulated a lifetime 10.8 rWAR through his defense , while being a net negative with the bat .
( Reuters ) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has , for the first time , approved a drug that uses 3D printing technology , paving the way for potential customization of drugs to suit patients ' needs .
The drug , made by privately held Aprecia Pharmaceuticals Co , was approved for oral use as a prescription adjunctive therapy in the treatment of epilepsy , the company said on Monday .
Spritam uses Aprecia 's “ ZipDose ” technology , a delivery system that creates premeasured doses which disintegrate in the mouth with a sip of liquid .
3D printing could help companies make products “ to the specifications of an individual patient rather than ( take a ) one-size-fits-all kind of approach , ” Wedbush Securities analyst Tao Levy said .
3D printers help make products by layering material until a three-dimensional object is created .
In the healthcare industry , these printers are used by dentists to create replicas of jaws and teeth as well as some finished dental implants and orthopedic surgeons have tested them to make customized hip replacements .
British scientists have also used 3D printing to create personalized replica models of cancerous parts of the body to allow doctors to target tumors more precisely .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans scrapped more automobiles than they bought last year as the ragged economy reduced demand and some major cities expanded mass transit service , according to a new report .

The United States scrapped 14 million autos while buying only 10 million last year , shrinking the country 's car and light duty truck fleet to 246 million from a record high of 250 million , according to the report to be released on Wednesday by nonprofit group the Earth Policy Institute ( EPI ) .
The United States , the world 's biggest petroleum user , “ is entering a new era , evolving from a car-dominated transport system to one that is much more diversified , ” said Lester Brown , the president of the EPI .
While many cities like New York have had to cut mass transit services and raise fares during the recession , Phoenix , Seattle , Houston , Nashville and other cities have expanded or improved mass transit systems .
Cities are taking a variety of steps , like adding rapid bus lanes and light duty rail , to fight traffic congestion and air pollution . Some are raising parking meter prices and cutting down the required parking spaces per building , the report said .
President Barack Obama 's “ cash for clunkers ” program , which last summer gave consumers a rebate of up to $ 4,500 for trading in older cars and light trucks , led to the scrapping of more than 700,000 vehicles . But since the incentive was only available to consumers who bought new fuel-sipping vehicles , it did not affect the ratio of scrapped vehicles to new sales .
Market saturation of autos , urbanization , high oil prices that reached a record $ 147 a barrel in 2008 , and the uncertain economy have helped cut car sales , Brown said . Given those forces , sales may never reach the 17 million per year level they were between 1999 and 2007 , he said .
Because more people live in cities than a few decades ago , young people , particularly those burdened with student loans , are foregoing car purchases , the report said .
As more people live in cities , some teens are not even bothering to get driver 's licenses . The number of teenagers with licenses peaked at 12 million in 1978 but is now under 10 million , the report said .
“ When I was a kid socializing revolved around getting into a car and going for a drive , ” said Brown . “ Today kids socialize over the Internet and on smart phones . ”
A continued drop in auto purchases could cut long-term oil demand and greenhouse gas emissions from transportation . he said . It could also lead to increases in steel supplies as big cars get recycled , Brown said .
Brown used data from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration and R.L . Polk & Co to write the report .
An explosion outside a court in the Turkish Aegean city of Izmir has killed at least two people , including a police officer , and wounded several others , according to a statement by the governor of the city .
Two attackers were killed in a gunfight with the security forces following the blast caused by a car bomb , the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Thursday , adding that police were searching for the third attacker .
The governor of Izmir , Erol Ayyıldız , told reporters that a police officer and a court employee were killed in the incident .
At least six wounded people were taken to hospital in the city located on the country 's western coast , he said .
The assailants carried out the attack after they were stopped at a checkpoint outside the court , the governor added .
Burning vehicles
Vehicles were burning and ambulances were rushed to the blast site , according to the photographs shown on national television networks .
Damage was reported around the area close to one of the gates of the court , where the blast happened , Turkish media said .
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak said a much larger attack was apparently being planned , based on the weapons found at the scene of the bombing .
`` Based on the preparation , the weapons , bombs and ammunition seized , it is understood that a big atrocity was being planned , '' Kaynak told reporters .
Al Jazeera 's Mohammed Jamjoom , reporting from Istanbul , said the latest attack shows how volatile the security situation in Turkey is .
`` It is interesting that this happened today because just yesterday there was news from officials that at least 20 people were detained in relation to the attack on the Reina nightclub on the New Year 's Eve , '' he said .
`` There is a massive manhunt going on over the incident . ''
A gunman stormed the Istanbul nightclub killing 39 people during New Year celebrations on Sunday .
A middle school student in Kennebunk suffered second-degree burns Friday when her iPhone caught fire in her pants pocket just before a class , said her family and school officials .
The eighth-grader sustained burns on one thigh and her back , and was taken to Southern Maine Health Care in Biddeford for treatment .
Additional Photos
Her mother , Judy Milligan , said , “ I was a little bit in shock ” when the school notified her about the fire . She said she preferred not to release her daughter 's name .
The 14-year-old girl had sat down just before her first-period French class Friday morning when she and her friends sitting nearby heard a pop from the Apple iPhone 5C she had been given by her mother two months earlier .
“ Immediately , smoke starts billowing from around the student , ” said Jeff Rodman , principal of the Middle School of the Kennebunks . “ She knew right away something was wrong and , in a panic , knew her pants were on fire caused by the cellphone . ”
The girl had to take off the pants , so girls in the class helped her into a corner of the room while others herded the boys from the room and summoned a teacher , who was standing just outside the door , Rodman said .
“ It was sensitive . She knew she was kind of in a tough situation , ” he said .
Teachers came to help , and someone in the main office called 911 .
The girl had the presence of mind to “ stop , drop and roll , ” Rodman said , which reduced the flames and the injuries she suffered . “ The phone fell out of her pocket … and it was still smoldering . Her pants were still on fire , ” he said .
Once the pants were off , one teacher wrapped the girl in a blanket while they waited for rescue workers and firefighters to arrive .
School officials declared a “ hold in place , ” so students could not leave their classrooms and emergency workers could get in and out of the building quickly , Rodman said .
The girl was taken to the hospital in Biddeford , where she was treated for what her mother said were second-degree burns . She was released after about 45 minutes .
She asked to return to class , her mother said , but school officials and health care workers encouraged her to go home .
“ She 's very calm – just a calm person , ” Milligan said .
A call to Apple headquarters was not returned by press time .
An investigator with the state Fire Marshal 's Office took pictures of the phone .
Andrew Rosenstein , owner of TechPort in Portland , which repairs Apple products , said customers have brought in batteries that were swollen and at risk of malfunction after extended use , but not from a phone that was almost new .
“ There 's basically a lithium-ion type rechargeable battery built in ( to an iPhone ) . The battery , as it charges and discharges , it 's really a chemical reaction that can generate heat , ” Rosenstein said . “ It 's very rare there can be an issue , but any battery is just a chemical composition that can be flammable in extreme circumstances . ”
Rosenstein said his business uses a fireproof box to store batteries from devices that are being repaired , so fire can not spread if they somehow ignite .
There have been sporadic reports of phone fires , though typically the phones that caught fire were being charged .
The most notable malfunctions of lithium-ion batteries were aboard two 787 Boeing Dreamliners , causing fires that led to the grounding of the aircraft .
Rosenstein could n't say what would have caused the battery in the eighth-grader 's phone to burn . He said there 's nothing else in the phone that could cause a fire . “ These batteries installed in Apple products in particular are extremely safe . It 's an extremely rare incident , ” he said .
Milligan said her daughter is an honor student and enjoys school , especially French class . She also is a competitive swimmer with the Biddeford Manta Rays , and had to miss Friday 's practice and Saturday 's meet in Belfast .
Milligan said she almost did n't get the call from the school telling her that her daughter had been burned .
When she left the house Friday morning with her daughter and son , she realized she had left her cellphone in the house . She contemplated going without it for the day , but instead ran inside to grab it . In the middle of her hour-long drive to work , she got the call .
The iPhone , which was green and is now black , is useless . So are the pants , which Milligan agreed to replace .
“ We went to Target and got a pair of yoga pants , ” she said .

`` Wan na go do karate in the garage ? '' # StepBrothers A post shared by Bryce Harper ( @ bharper3407 ) on Feb 23 , 2017 at 2:18pm PST
Photo day is normally something of a slog . Players spend an early spring training morning sliding past photographer after photographer , holding cards with their names on them . Enthusiasm does not pervade the proceedings , particularly among more-experienced players who have done it all before . Washington Nationals Jayson Werth and Bryce Harper , for example , were not exactly early arrivals this year .
But they did commit themselves to one of their pictures , which they wanted to get just right , from the angle of their gaze to the position of their hands . The movie “ Step Brothers ” is serious business , and Harper and Werth wanted to duplicate its movie poster exactly , with Werth as Brennan and Harper as Dale .
“ I can see why they took that picture . It so resembles them , ” Gio Gonzalez said . “ Werth 's definitely like , ‘ Do n't touch my drums . I do n't want you around my drums ! '
“ And I can see Bryce patting the drums , then asking him , ‘ Why are you sweating ? ' Then Werth saying , ‘ Well , “ Cops ” was on . ' Yeah , that 's the two right there . ”
For those unfamiliar with the film , its gravity and plot are probably best conveyed by the fact that Gonzalez 's synopsis pretty much sums it up . Will Ferrell stars in the story of two childish grown men whose parents marry , forcing them to live together under the same roof . At first , they clash . Then , they bond .
Obviously , some of the more specific plot points do not apply to Werth and Harper . And in fairness , they took the photo not for the sake of analogy , but more because “ Step Brothers ” happens to be one of the most-quoted movies in Harper 's extensive and frequently utilized movie-quote repertoire . But parallels nevertheless shine through their smiles .
When Harper first came up , a precocious teenager bound to be one of the most high-profile players of his generation , Werth tested him . Five years later , as Harper enters what might be his final season with Werth as a teammate , they have a unique bond .
“ I love him like a brother , ” Harper said . “ He 's family to me . I look up to him . ”
[ Bryce Harper might leave the Nats with a two-year window to win a World Series ]
When Harper came up to the majors in 2012 , he was 19 , the same age Werth was when he attended his first camps with the Baltimore Orioles .
The Orioles had a veteran clubhouse in those days , and Werth can still rattle off the names : Cal Ripken , B.J . Surhoff , Brady Anderson , Mike Mussina , Jimmy Key , Will Clark , and so on .
“ You just prayed that when you walked in there they would n't notice you , ” said Werth , who is a one could easily mistake for a man who has never tried to evade notice .
“ But they just would n't let you sneak by . You 'd have to stand there and wear it . ”

One day , Clark stole a statue Werth kept in his locker — a family heirloom , more than just a trinket . He made Werth play “ Hot and cold ” until he was close enough to realize the statue was under the pile of bagels on the breakfast table . When Werth tried to extricate the figurine , the veterans all booed him . His germs , of course , were now on every bagel . The rookie knew his place .
“ You 've got some young kid who comes in , and he 's not saying anything or he 's doing whatever he wants to do , or whatever , ” Werth said . “ You want to see what these people are made of . At the end of the day , they might be standing there with the season on the line . If they 're going to crack when kind of their family members are giving it to them , how are they going to act in that situation ? ”
Harper , Werth said , provided a unique case . The prodigy had never stayed on one team for more than a year or so , not in high school , not as a hired gun for tournament teams , not in college , not in the minors . He had never , Werth observed , had to be accountable for teammates for more than a few months . With the Nationals , he would have to foster long-term respect , “ to look these guys in the face tomorrow and the next day ” and every day after that . Werth wanted to show him what that meant .
“ I do n't think he has too many people that will give him a hard time , ” Werth said . “ Look around — who 's giving him a hard time ? ”
Everyone who was around the Nationals in Harper 's first year or so acknowledges that Werth was hard on Harper . All kinds of stories circulate , some involving Harper and hustle , postgame accountability to the media , or the endorsement deals Harper had young that most baseball players do not even have old .
Stories like those tend to evolve over the years , but the early Werth-Harper oral history has many volumes . Harper remembered Werth getting on him in those years , and admitted he would “ knock him down. ” But he also remembers Werth inviting him to dinner later , as if to reach out his hand and pull him to his feet .
“ I think you need hard truths . But I hear about guys who just get the hard truth . They do n't get the ‘ Hey , let 's go to dinner later , ' or the ‘ Hey , good job today , ' ” Harper said . “ That 's tough , to only get the hard side and not the ‘ I love you , too . ' ”
[ That time Jayson Werth gave Matt Williams the hard truth ]
Over the years , Harper 's profile has grown in proportion to his big league resume . He is 24 years old , married and has an MVP award at home , a grown man by all accounts , a relative veteran in the Nationals ' clubhouse . But he still sometimes follows Werth like a little brother might , tagging along on the way to batting practice , plopping down on the couch next to him , or sitting at his locker to chat with him when he usually avoids sitting at his locker much at all .

Werth and Harper have played pregame catch together for years . This winter , Werth was in Harper 's wedding . When Harper arrived at spring training this year and found himself in a corner locker , he asked the training staff to give it to Werth instead . Harper does not normally defer , but when it comes to Werth , he always does . Once , Harper was explaining how he blocked out all the outside noise and focused on the voices that mattered . He said the only ones that mattered were the family and friends , the kind of people that would be at his dinner table years from now .
“ Well , maybe J-Dub will be there , too , ” he added . Whenever he talks about his team , or those who influence him , Harper always mentions “ J . ”
“ That 's everything I want to be . I want to win , I want to be competitive , I want to lead . He does that every single day , ” Harper said . “ If we have problems , we look to J . If something goes wrong , we look to J . ”
Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said one of the reasons he signed Werth to that seven-year deal was the influence he could have on young players , whoever they were . Harper was the ultimate test case , an unprecedented prodigy unafraid to speak his mind .
Lately , he has been quieter in the clubhouse than he was before , a little more stoic , a little more businesslike , smiling a little less , cracking jokes a bit less often — more businesslike , in a way . But a quip from Werth can light him back up , and leave the duo to descend into laughter , or a flurry of quotes from one movie or another . Sometimes it 's “ The Sandlot. ” Sometimes it 's “ Dumb and Dumber. ” A lot of times , it 's “ Step Brothers , ” which is fitting , because after five years together , that is almost exactly what they are .

It 's not a coincidence that so many band bios start off with a version of “ we met in art school. ” Cram a bunch of young , creative people together in one place and odds are something special will come out of it . And that 's exactly what came out of Lancaster Polytechnic ( now Coventry University ) in the late 1970s . As the bass player for The Specials , Horace Panter enjoyed the kind of success art school bands dream about .
And today , as an artist , he 's enjoying the kid of recognition and success art school teachers dream about . In part one of the interview , he talks about the sources behind his artistic style ( s ) , the connection between art and music , and his secret for staying 25 years old .
RSS : When you consider everything you 've been doing lately—your art work , your collaborations with all types of different artists , your music , not just with The Specials , but with the Uptown Ska Collective—it seems like you 're enjoying the most productive and creative era of your life .
Horace : I would n't deny that . Definitely not . I was a school teacher . I thought I would retire as a school teacher . I got the call from Lynval [ Golding ] . The Specials were reformed in 2009 . I thought , OK , I 'll take a year off from school teaching , then I 'll go back to being a school teacher . It 's absolutely astonishing that we 've been able to last as long as we have . But we have n't done it in such a high-intensity way that we did it back in 1979 . There 's been a lot of time between tours , and I 've been using that time to establish an art career . Also , The Specials wo n't last forever . So that , hopefully , when that declines , there will be an art career to replace it . I 've always played music . Even when I was a school teacher , I had a little blues band that played weekends . Blues2Go . A small band with a big carbon footprint .
Why do you say that ?
Well , because there 's four of us and we all travel to the shows in our own cars . I 've got my equipment with the PA speakers and the singer 's got his gear and the amp . Then the drums , you know . It 's like , we do n't take up a lot of room , but we burn a lot of fuel .
The one and only time I 've seen The Specials was a couple summers ago when you played New York City on the Pier 45 .
Yes , that was a good show .
Did you take in any museums when you were there ?
I went to the new Museum of Modern Art because I had n't been since it had been rebuilt . That was great because they had a lot of Claes Oldenberg stuff . They had Henri Rousseau 's picture there , The Dream , which is great , and this whacking-big Barnett Newman that I like . I went to the Whitney [ Museum of American Art ] . They had Edward Hopper ' drawings , which was really nice . That was really good .
Talk about the Blues and Jazz series you created .
They start life as a 12-inch square board . Then they 're enlarged so they 're twice the size . So they 're two-foot square . Then I 'll work on them . So it 's a combination of sticking objects on the board , then there 's paint on there , then there 's a collage of photos . It 's a kind of mixed media thing , but I like the idea . Usually when you do an original painting , you make the print smaller . I use the opposite effect . It 's got like a billboard kind of effect . When you get up close to a billboard , you see all the pixels and all the dots and that sort of stuff . That was the idea . Each work 's got this kind of long-distance , across-the-room look . When you get up close to it , you can see that there 's a big list of names like all the people who played with Muddy Waters or all the songs—or a majority of the songs—that Bo Diddly played and bits of lyrics and all that kind of stuff . It kind of works on two levels .
I did n't want to just paint a nice portrait of Muddy Waters . I like to try and paint music , you know what I mean ? Or the impact that it had on me . I love the blues . Especially the Chicago blues guys , the majority of whom , you know this , were born in Mississippi or Alabama and likely traveled up highway 61 to a different type of poverty . I like the fact that they then amplified their music . It sort of makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck when I think of Hound Dog Taylor and Muddy Waters and all those guys . I wanted to try and get that across . That 's why there are maps involved in the pieces , as well . I think that sense of place is really important . It is to me anyway . It originated in Mississippi and it ended up in Chicago .
Let 's talk about your Americana Series . Looking at the artwork , I see a bunch of different influences—Edward Hopper , Andy Warhol . David Hockney . What do you see ?
I think with the Americana , I 'm channeling my inner Edward Hopper , I suppose . I think when I started those , I realized that the subject matter—the signs and the motel signs and the diners and all that kind of stuff—that what I was really doing was what artists had been doing for centuries . That 's just basically painting light , the way that the light is so intense and strong over on the west coast . The shadows and that sort of intensity , I think that 's where all the excessive color comes from , as well . Personally , I just loved the signs , as well . You would never get anything like that in England . It 's kind of weird . A few people from America have said , “ Sometimes it takes somebody who is n't part of that culture to come along and describe it . ”
Speaking of describing things , your style in many of your works is very stripped down and bare . The same can be said for the way bass players approach music . So I 'm thinking maybe because you 're a bass player that you approach your art like this . Or am I full of shit ?
I think you 're full of shit there , yeah . No , I never thought about that . You know , it 's an interesting comment . I love traditional iconography . Especially the Byzantine stuff and the Russian stuff where the central figure was always large in the picture . Right in the middle . I love the fact that in iconography , the rules of our perspective and light and shade are just kind of thrown out the window , you know ? There are no shadows and everything , and I kind of like that .
I can kind of relate that back to music . It 's like , here are some rules . Let 's break them . I think a lot of the Icon series was sort of based on the same rules or non-rules from icon painting . I think it just sort of developed , you know ? I 've always liked flat color and like the pop artists you know , Robert Indiana , Warhol , Lichtenstein and that sort of stuff . I 've always like , that sort of graphic approach . I wanted to do work that was , that could be appreciated by regular folks . I did n't like the elitism when I went to art college . It was all very elitism and conceptual stuff that the majority of people would go “ What the fuck is this ? ” But whereas , if you paint a picture of something that somebody can recognize , you connect , everybody can connect with it . That 's why I kind of liked the pop artists because it was using everyday symbols as the imagery . Again , it goes back to Henri Russo .
That 's the thing about iconography , it 's art with a purpose . I love the fact that you want to travel from Novgorod to Moscow and not get eaten by a bear , take this picture with you . Or if you live in Haiti and you want your crops to grow good this year , draw a picture in the dirt with coffee beans . That 's sort of using art for a purpose . That really appeals to me .
Art that 's produced by everyday people . Like everyday people starting bands .
Yes . That whole punk thing was a total sort of ground zero for music in England in the late '70s . You did n't have to be as good as Carlos Santana when you got on a stage . You could learn two and a half chords , and that was fine . It was more the energy and the optimism that you could get out there and make a noise . There was an audience there that was only a little less advanced musically than you and they would appreciate it . It was fantastic . It was really good .
You could go out in Coventry , like four nights a week , and see bands . Some of whom were absolutely dreadful . Some of them were perhaps not so dreadful . But the atmosphere was tremendous . There was a real sort of positivity going on . I just thought that was terrific . I was lucky because I could play . I was slightly older than that original punk generation . Terry Hall was an original punk . He grew up with the Sex Pistols and The Clash . He was 19 when The Specials hit , whereas I was 25 or 26 . I 'd actually learned to play , I 'd been in show bands . I had played social clubs and stuff like that . I knew how to play . It was n't like I was learning how to play on stage like a lot of these guys .
You 've said that when you step on stage , you feel like you 're 25 again . Is it almost better now , playing music live , than it was when you were younger ?
I do n't know . I suppose , I would n't say it 's better , I 'd say it 's different . Perhaps it 's nowhere near as exciting because back then in 1979 , it was the big mission . We were spearheading this thing or whatever . Whereas now , it 's a lot more comfortable . You 're not going to have the crowd invasion and we do n't set ourselves such an enormously punishing schedule . That 's a lot better . But I suppose the adrenaline is still there and there 's still the fact that we 're The Specials , anyway . There 's two and a half to three thousand people out there willing us on to be great . That 's such a tremendous feeling . It 's kind of the same when the blues band plays and there 's only 15 people . Three of which are listening . It does n't matter , I 'm still playing and I 'm playing for the other guys in the band . I just think that the whole joy of being able to play music to people is a fabulous privilege .

How Ethical are Canada 's Ethical Funds ?
“ Conscientious ” investments and the tar sands connection
by Larry Powell
The Dominion - http : //www.dominionpaper.ca
Larry Powell Photo : Share Del.icio Ethical Funds , and investing ethically in general , sounds good on paper . But how good is it in practice ?
ROBLIN , MANITOBA—As controversy continues to mount over the environmental impact of the tar sands in northeastern Alberta , so too does the dilemma facing people who have money invested in Ethical Funds .
Ethical Funds ( EF ) , a division of Vancouver-based NEI Investments , is the largest ethical investment mutual fund in Canada and was formed more than 20 years ago . It calls itself a “ pioneer and visionary at the forefront of responsible investing . '' According to their website , Ethical Funds believes that companies with strong financial performance and good environmental , social and governance practices can best mitigate financial risk over the long term . One of EF 's core values , it declares , is that “ disadvantaged communities should not bear the brunt of adverse environmental impacts . ”
But even though all five of Canada 's major banks lend money to tar sands operators , all five are included in the portfolios of various ethical investment funds in this country . Even Suncor Energy , a major corporation which actually extracts bitumen from the sands , is listed in Ethical Funds . Suncor produces some 329,000 barrels or oil per day from tar sands operations .
Suncor , along with Scotiabank and the Royal Bank of Canada ( RBC ) are ranked among EF 's top ten holdings .
Last spring , the US-based environmental group Rainforest Action Network ( RAN ) , found that tar sands investment by Canadian banks totaled almost $ 50 billion .
In a letter to RAN , RBC confirmed it was “ a financier of oil sands activity , although , at almost $ 17 billion not currently the largest . ”
There is no doubt that the impacts of tar sands extraction are enormous .
People living downstream of the tar sands , in the community of Fort Chipewyan , have been reporting elevated rates of cancer and other illnesses and blaming it on pollution from the tar sands . Details of their ailments have been widely documented , including in a recent special production of CBC 's The Nature of Things .
Dr David Schindler , an internationally recognized water expert at the University of Alberta in Edmonton , reports that tar sands development has been contaminating the Athabasca River watershed , to a greater degree than earlier thought .
He warns that the tar sands extraction is elevating levels of poisons in the Athabasca River and its tributaries to the point where they are “ likely toxic to fish embryos . ”
Alberta-based Pembina Institute says that among the provinces , Alberta was responsible for about 52 per cent of the increase in all greenhouse gas emissions in Canada between 1990 and 2008 . Pembina predicts that given the projected growth of the tar sands , their emissions will nearly triple by 2020 .
In addition , millions of hectares of boreal forest are being bulldozed to make way for more tar sands extraction . According to data compiled by Greenpeace , forests fallen to make way for the tar sands could eventually amount to an area twice the size of New Brunswick .
So how is this all sitting with those who have invested in Ethical Funds , or are interested in ethical investment in general ?
Lindy Clubb of Winnipeg has thought about investing in “ ethicals. ” But she has too many concerns . “ There are poor standards , monitoring and compliance performances in the resource and development sectors so nothing is without risk , '' she said . `` Consumers should be aware of unethical investments and use their money to influence banks and government to have and follow higher standards that protect air , water , soil , wildlife and habitat . ”
The Social Investment Organization ( SIO ) of Canada was set up to promote the practice of socially responsible investment in Canada , and represents financial institutions as well as individual investors . Its executive director , Eugene Ellmen , is more forgiving of the situation than some .
He says those who want no part of the tar sands can ask for “ oil sands-free ” portfolios . Others willing to invest in that project can still do so while pressing the companies to do better , he added .
Ian Hanington of Vancouver says he owns some ethical funds . He reluctantly accepted an explanation given him by a company representative some time ago : that it would be impossible for a Canadian fund to offer any returns to its investors without having some tar sands investment . “ It 's probably sad but true . Maybe Canada really has become ‘ a petro state with a petro dollar ! ' ” he said .
Others have decided to divest . “ I used to own Ethical Funds—no more ! I 've lost faith in this outfit , ” said Elaine Hughes of Archerwill , Saskatchewan .
Environmental Services Group , is another department within NEI Investments . According to its website , ESG Services provides research and evaluations of companies for managers of `` socially responsible investments , '' including Ethical Funds . But the name Ethical Funds itself might be a bit of a misnomer . In the words of NEI 's Vice President for ESG Services Robert Walker , “ Note that we do not describe the companies in our funds as ‘ ethical . ' This is not our claim . ”
Walker says his industry is constantly “ pressuring ” the companies they invest in to tackle such things as climate change , by preparing and publishing report cards on their performances . He believes companies like RBC are already making progress in this area .
In his defense , Walker might point to a recent policy announcement by RBC . On its website , the bank states , “ The new policy is intended to ensure that we gather the appropriate information on relevant environmental and social aspects of our clients ' business to evaluate potential impacts on a client 's financial position , and to understand how they are preventing or mitigating their impact on environmentally sensitive areas , ” explains RBC .
Even the Rainforest Action Network is hailing this as a positive indication that , at least RBC is taking “ a step away ” from its tar sands involvement . Some were more hesitant in their praise , though . The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council in northern BC , whose population resides along the proposed route for a major oil sands pipeline , said that RBC must follow their policies with action if they do n't want their `` words to ring hollow . ''
It 's impossible to know how many conscientious investors might even be aware of the Ethical Funds-oil sands connection , and if they would take action if they had more information .
But the Oil Sands Program Director for The Pembina Institute , Jennifer Grant , says there are choices .
“ Some investors may choose to exclude the environmental and economic risks associated with oil sands development from their portfolios . Other investors may use their holdings with oil sands companies to force increased disclosure on impacts and drive improved performance , '' said Grant . `` Both approaches are valuable to address the unresolved impacts of oil sands development . ''

One person was killed and several others were injured Friday in an explosion at a south Louisiana chemical plant , only miles from where a plant blast the previous day led to the deaths of two workers , authorities said .
Louisiana State Police Trooper Jared Sandifer said five people were injured , three of them critically , and were taken to area hospitals following Friday evening 's explosion at a CF Industries facility in Donaldsonville . The identity of the person killed in the blast was n't immediately released .
Sandifer said the explosion did n't pose a threat to the area surrounding the plant .
Workers were pressurizing an unspecified `` vessel '' with nitrogen when the pressure built and caused the explosion , Sandifer said .
CF Industries ' website says the plant can produce roughly 5 million tons of nitrogen for agricultural and industrial uses annually .
On Thursday , an explosion at a chemical plant in Geismar owned by Williams Cos. Inc. led to two deaths and injured dozens of others . Donaldsonville and Geismar are both located in Ascension Parish and straddle the Mississippi River , between New Orleans and Baton Rouge .
Deerfield , Ill.-based CF Industries said in a news release that one person was killed and seven others were injured in the incident , which occurred at about 6 p.m. CDT in a part of the plant that had been shut down for maintenance activity .
`` The incident involved the rupture of an inert nitrogen vessel during the off-loading of nitrogen , '' the news release said . `` There was no fire or chemical release nor is there any threat or hazard posed to the community . ''
CF Industries manufactures ammonia and other nitrogen fertilizers at its Donaldsonville plant .
`` Our focus is on our number one priority -- the health and safety of our employees and the community , '' plant manager Lou Frey said in a statement . `` We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our employees . ''
This is n't the first deadly blast at the company 's Donaldsonville plant . Three workers were killed and nine others were injured by an explosion and fire at the facility in May 2000 .
Later that year , the Labor Department 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposed a fine of nearly $ 150,000 against CF Industries . OSHA cited the company for 14 alleged safety and health violations , 12 of which were described by the agency as serious . The company did n't contest the citations and agreed to pay the penalties .
Theresa May is next month poised to announce the end of free movement for new EU migrants on the same day that she formally triggers Brexit negotiations .
The Prime Minister is expected to say that EU citizens who travel to Britain after she triggers Article 50 will no longer have the automatic right to stay in the UK permanently .
They will instead be subject to migration curbs after Britain leaves the European Union , which could include a new visa regime and restricted access to benefits .
Mrs May is expected to say that EU migrants who arrived in the UK before the `` cut-off date '' will have their rights protected as long British citizens living elsewhere in Europe are granted the same assurance .
Advertisement
Iain Duncan Smith , a leading Eurosceptic conservative MP , said that that announcement will show that Mrs May is taking control of Britain 's borders while giving clarity to the 3.6million EU migrants already living in the UK .
He said : `` Theresa understands that if you want to take control you have to command the high ground . She will be giving clarity by setting a clear deadline while the European Union looks increasingly muddled and mean-spirited '' .
The announcement means that the `` cut-off date '' for EU migrants is likely to be around March 15 , once the Government 's Article 50 bill has gone through Parliament .
The Prime Minister is expected to appeal to other European Union nations to reach a quick deal on the issue so it can be removed from Brexit negotiations as soon as possible .
It is likely to put her in conflict with the European Union , which has been pushing for Mrs May to delay the cut-off date until 2019 . However ministers have raised concerns that waiting until the end of negotiations will lead to a huge surge in the number of EU migrants coming to the UK before Brexit .
`` We have had some suggestion that that the European Commission might attempt to force us to protect everyone who arrives up to the moment of departure , '' a Government source said . `` We could end up with half of Romania and Bulgaria coming here if we wait that long . ''
The Government has also considered suggestions that the cut-off date should be set for the referendum date in June last year . However Government lawyers have advised that such an approach would be illegal .
Amber Rudd , the Home Secretary , said that after Britain leaves the European Union `` we will be ending free movement as we know it '' .
She is examining plans to give new arrivals who get jobs in key sectors of the economy multi-year visas while limiting access to benefits .
Under one plan being considered migrants would be given five-year working visas but barred from claiming in-work benefits while they are in Britain .
She confirmed that the Home Office is `` working on a range of options '' but suggested that the final system will only be decided after `` two years of negotiations and preparation '' .
David Davis , the Secretary of State for Leaving the European Union , has previously suggested that Britain will not suddenly shut the door on workers coming from the EU .
He suggested that it will take `` years and years '' for Britain to fill all the jobs that would otherwise have been done by EU migrants .
Asked about his comments Mrs Rudd said that the Government does not want a `` cliff-edge '' , suggesting that migration controls could be limited initially after Brexit .
She said : `` I think what he [ David Davis ] is highlighting is the fact that as a government we 're going to work with businesses , with employers to make sure that the immigration system we put in place does enable them to continue to thrive and continue to grow . What shape that will be we ca n't say yet .
`` We are against cliff edges . So as part of the consultation that we will be bringing out in the summer we will be asking them the best way to deliver that . ''
While the UK has reached agreements in principle with most members of the European Union already there are still several nations , including Germany , who have refused to discuss the issue until after Brexit is triggered .
Mrs May is also facing a rebellion in the House of Lords over the issue where Tory peers are prepared to back a campaign by Labour and the Liberal Democrats to guarantee the rights of EU nationals .
It came after reports that ministers are also discussing plans to give the independent Migration Advisory Committee ( MAC ) an advisory role on how many visas should be issued to take the political sting out of the issue .
The committee would decide how many visas need to be issued for workers in key industries such as software engineering , health and social care , farming and hospitality , which are heavily reliant on immigrants .
The cut-off date for the 1.2million British nationals living in other EU countries will ultimately be decided by Brussels . The European Parliament 's chief negotiator has suggested that the EU will offer British people to individually opt-in and remain European citizens .
The UFC recently beefed up its heavyweight division with the signing of Adam Milstead ( 7-1 ) .
Sources close to the situation confirmed to MMAFighting.com that Milstead penned a four-fight deal with the promotion .
Fighting out of Pittsburgh , the 28-year-old Milstead has won seven straight , all via finish ( five knockouts , two submissions ) . He has finished his last three opponents with strikes in just over four minutes of combined fight time .
A lifelong athlete in wrestling , football , and baseball , Milstead played football collegiately at Geneva College in Beaver Falls , Penn. , just a short trek from Pittsburgh . Once in the Steel City , Milstead received his introduction to mixed martial arts at World Class MMA under the tutelage Dan Roppo .
Currently , Milstead trains at Mark Cherico 's Martial Arts & Fitness Academy ( formerly Fight Club Pittsburgh ) , a previous home to fighters such as current UFC bantamweight Cody Garbrandt and the now-retired Mark Cherico ( 9-1 ) , himself a longtime standout on the regional Pittsburgh MMA circuit .
UFC heavyweight contender Stipe Miocic also enlists Milstead 's help during training camps at Independence , Ohio 's Strong Style Fight Team .
While Milstead does not have an opponent or date set for his UFC debut , sources confirmed he will not be fighting at the UFC Fight Night 82 card in Pittsburgh as many might expect . Instead , he is anticipating a spring 2016 debut inside the UFC Octagon .
Fern Mallis kicked off her fifth year of `` Fashion Icons with Fern Mallis '' at NYC 's 92Y with a bang—she brought out supermodel-turned-makeup mogul Iman for a Q & A session on topics ranging from her turbulent childhood as the daughter of a Somalian diplomat and being discovered on the street by photographer Peter Beard to her battle against racism in the fashion industry and her marriage to David Bowie . Read on for the highlights from the chat .
On her age : We all have friends and loved ones who say 60 's the new 30 . No . Sixty 's the new 60 .
On having a Somalian boy 's name : The Somalians cherish their sons . but for five generations my family had all sons , no daughters . My given name was Zahra , which is the `` flower of the desert . '' I do n't look anything like the flower of the desert . My name was changed by my grandfather to Iman , which means `` have faith . '' And it meant to have faith that a daughter would come . I 've been teased my whole life about that but I 've literally grown into my name . But my daughter is called Alexandria Zahra Jones .
On her childhood : We were very , very poor but somehow as children we never experienced it . We were never hungry but that 's what we came to know . [ My parents ] were both very political and doing two , three jobs at the same time so that 's the environment I grew up in . They encouraged education , especially for me , as a Somali Muslim girl , because that would propel me to any height .
On her mother sending her to boarding school : I resented my mother for it and we really had a tough go , but then I found out she sold all her jewelry to pay for my education . That was the best school for girls in my country .
On living as the daughter of the Somali ambassador to Saudi Arabia : I studied in Italian when I was in boarding school , so overnight when we moved to Saudi Arabia we were taught in English . I speak five languages besides mine . I went to school in Egypt because girls were n't allowed to go to school in Saudi Arabia . It 's very restricting , especially for girls , we 're not allowed to go anywhere .
On becoming a refugee from Saudi Arabia : Imagine : we have our own chauffeur , our own car , we 're going everywhere with security , as [ the family of the ] ambassador . Then Somalia had a revolution and it became a military regime . All embassies were closed , and all of a sudden people my father worked with disappeared . So my mom decided , 'Why would we wait for that to happen ? ' So , in the middle of the night , she gets a van , puts us in with nothing but the clothes on our backs and we drove to the border of Kenya and crossed on foot . I literally have two pictures of myself growing up . I am the face of the refugee . The refugees are , 99 % of the time , people who have left their countries for fear for their lives . It 's not people who want to come to other countries and be pariahs . That 's not what a refugee is .
On being discovered by Peter Beard : I was walking to [ my job as a ] waitress and Peter Beard appeared and started talking to me and asked my name and I thought he was trying to pick me up . He followed me and asked , have you ever been photographed ? And I 'd never seen a magazine in my life—except my brothers were teenagers and they had Playboy . And I said , `` I 'm not that kind of girl . '' He talked about his profession and I did n't pay attention and then he said , `` I 'll pay you , '' and then I stopped . He said , `` How much ? '' I said , `` $ 8000 . '' ( That was two years tuition . ) And he said , `` OK. '' I brought two girlfriends , he took the pictures , I thought , `` That was an easy job , $ 8,000 . '' He wrote me a check , I cashed it immediately .
On being naked from the waist up in the photos : I definitely looked at those as art . First of all , you could n't see my nipples . And I chose them because he showed them to me . And he 's still my favorite photographer because he saw in me what I have never seen in myself . And I do n't know how he saw it .
On how she came to New York : `` One of the pictures he took was on an invitation and Wilhelmina [ Cooper , founder of Wilhelmina Models ] saw it . [ Beard ] said , `` Oh , she 's in Kenya '' and he said , `` Let 's call her . '' Half the stuff she said I could n't understand . She said , `` Come to New York , you can have a business , you can make $ 250,000 . '' I said , it has to have a return ticket . I still have the ticket . [ But ] I always planned to come home . I was married . I was not 18 so I could not leave the country without the permission of my parents or my husband ( pfft , my husband , that was gon na go anyway ) . My mother was so upset with me . It was my parents . My parents would never sign a paper for me to go to America . So I forged . I said , `` I 'm a refugee , I do n't have a birth certificate . ''
On finally coming to New York : I arrive in New York on October 15 , 1975 . On my own , by the way . Three months before , Eugenia Sheppard wrote a full-page article with a picture of me by Peter Beard in the New York Post and she writes that I was discovered by Peter Beard goat herding . I was like , 'what ? ' It said , `` She doesnt speak a word of English . ''
How she got a visa to work in the U.S. : You have to understand , I did n't know makeup , I 'd never worn heels in my life , I had no concept what was going on . I did n't have a working visa . If you 're a working model you have to have torn sheets that prove you worked somewhere else before . You have to prove that you 're a model before you come here . I did n't even know what tear sheets are ! It was a tough go , everyone 's trying to figure out how to get me a visa . Halston was a friend of Peter Beard , Diana Vreeland ... I met Veruschka…this is the world I was thrown into ! These people actually wrote letters to the immigration department saying how great I would be to the industry and that 's how I got my working visa .
On meeting Halston : He permanently had a cigarette in his hand and a hand in his pocket and he said , `` Darling , can you walk ? '' And I said , `` How the fuck do you think I got here ? ''
On when Essence editor-in-chief Marcia Gillespie called her a `` white woman dipped in chocolate '' : You know how infuriating that is to me ? It was actually shown to me by a Time magazine journalist , like , `` would you like to reply ? '' I said , `` Oh no . '' You have to understand that I 'm a very political person and I know everything has repercussions and I did n't want to talk to a white journalist about a war with a black magazine . I went to her office , closed the door and we had a conversation . I have more black in me than any black person in America . I have no white in me , I 'm 100 % Somali . I never thought in my life before I came to America , ' I am a black woman . ' In Somalia , we 're all black . That 's another thing I had to learn . Now the first thing that comes out of my mouth is , `` I 'm black . ''
On the pay divide between white and black models : They had a certain hourly rate for white models and different for black models . It 's the same services ! They say , `` you worked for me , '' and I said , `` No , you hired me for a service . '' I said , `` I 'm not going to a job unless I get paid the same . '' Someone had to say it .
On her advice to young black models : Do n't think you do n't have a voice . You have a voice !
On being muse to Yves Saint Laurent : I was with him over a month . They gave me very silky black pantyhose with the line at the back , black pumps and a white robe , and you just wait for Yves Saint Laurent . You take the robe off and you 'd stand there and he 'd work all day . I saw it from the inception . All these colors that you think would clash and then so harmonious ! And Loulou was there with this gorgeous coral jewelry…
On the taxi crash that nearly killed her : I was coming from dinner on my way home and right on First Ave and 37th Street , I was in a taxi and a car hit us and the whole taxi overturned . This side [ gestures to her left side ] of my face was broken . It 's all wired from the inside . It did n't shatter , it broke in pieces and it took forever to heal . With the magic of makeup no one knows .
On her boob job : Oh , God , I never live that one down ! It 's not even that large , mind you . Would you even think I had breast enlargement ? No ! But after having my daughter I just wanted to have it done . But I 've never lived it down , including the designers , they hate it ! They come to terms with both of them but they say , `` what did you do ? You crazy girl ! ''
On her makeup line : The seed of my makeup line was my third day [ as a model ] and the makeup artist came to me with a perplexed look and said , `` Did you bring your own foundation ? '' I did n't know what he meant but I saw he did n't ask the white model . I watched him mix and mix and looked in the mirror and I was gray . I thought the magic of the camera could fix it but my career could have stopped there . But the gods of fashion and beauty were smiling because the pictures were black and white . Black and white hides a multitude of sins . So after , I went to every store I could find . I bought all their foundations . I mixed and mixed and I would put on my face and take a selfie . At the end of the day as a model my currency is my image . It 's all about , `` Is she good in photographs ? '' So I wanted to make sure I had some kind of control over my image . Armed with that I made a batch and I 'd always have it with my bag , to the point where it comes to fashion shows , all the black models would come to me and say , `` Can I have some of that ? '' But all black models never leave home without a bottle of foundation and that makes me seethe . It 's such laziness on the part of the makeup artist ! That 's your job ! It 's like me coming to a shoot and asking the photographer , `` Did you bring your camera ? ''
On her daughter , Alexandria : We tried to get pregnant for seven years . I was at a shoot and Christie Brinkley walked in and she had a baby . So I said , `` in Africa , if you carry another woman 's baby for a day , you 'll get pregnant . '' And she said , `` Here ! '' So I carried the baby all day . I do say it took two blondes to get me pregnant—Christie and David ! I was 44 years old—you hear about the miracle of birth , but no it 's the miracle of conception . That 's a miracle .
On being married to David Bowie : Funny enough , he goes to museums , shows , music shows , especially young musicians that he likes , he takes his kid to school…I 'm not married to David Bowie , I 'm married to David Jones . I 've never had members of the press in my apartment . At home , it 's home . You retain the difference between a person and a persona . And people say , `` Oh , you ca n't have a private life . '' If you want it , you can .
On the dearth of black models on the runway : What happened in the old days is that designers used to see the models themselves . But now designers have too many collections and they hire casting agents…they tell the agencies , `` We 're not hiring black models this season . '' Tell me that 's not racist . For the life of me I do n't understand . You say , `` I love Beyoncé and Rihanna , but I do n't use black models . '' What the hell is that ?
The best advice her parents gave her : That I can do anything better than the boys . For a Muslim girl , that really propels you .
Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka has announced there were a total of 22,000 criminal complaints against migrants in 2016 – a significant increase since 2015 .
The Interior Minister said the migrant criminal statistics had rapidly increased since 2014 causing a stir on social media . “ In 2014 , we had 10,400 asylum seekers who were suspected and reported , 2015 were 14,000 , and 2016 were 22,000 , ” he said during an interview with Austrian television station ZiB 2 . Mr. Sobotka then advocated a continuation of a limit on asylum applications per year , Kronen Zeitung reports .
The report comes after Sobotka announced in December , having been probed by the anti-mass migration Freedom Party ( FPÖ ) , that migrant sex attacks had gone up 133 per cent in 2016 .
Mr. Sobotka also spoke on the subject of employment for asylum seekers and claimed that up to 90 per cent of them had no prospects of finding work in Austria at the present time and have ended up on government benefit payments .
Jobs are an important part of the integration process , Sobotka argued , claiming that real integration can only work “ if we can offer jobs to people ” .
Sobotka 's party , the Austrian People 's Party ( ÖVP ) , have proposed that the current migrant limit of 37,500 be reduced to 17,000 going forward . When asked what the government would do with any asylum seekers who came after the number had been reached , Sobotka said that many would be housed in reception centres near the border or near airports .
Sobotka noted that Austria had been more successful in carrying out deportations than many other European Union ( EU ) member states saying that the country had become the “ European repatriation champions ” . He said that Austria had provided the most help to migrants who were being sent back to their home countries .
Germany , in particular , has had issues with deporting illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers to regions like North Africa and Afghanistan . The German government announced a new initiative to fly Afghan migrants to their home country but the first attempt to do so was met with large protests at Frankfurt airport .
He also said that many asylum seekers would likely be returned to Greece , but did not expect further huge waves of migrants coming through the Balkan route which has largely been shut down . However , thousands still use it per year and Hungary has warned that the numbers could increase unless countries stop encouraging migration .
The EU announced that many asylum seekers currently in Germany and elsewhere could be returned to Greece starting in March of this year . Charities like Amnesty International slammed the move saying it was , “ outrageously hypocritical of the European Commission to insinuate that Greece alone is to blame for dire conditions , when the overcrowding and insecure climate on the Greek islands are for the most part caused by the EU-Turkey deal ” .
Aussie Home Loans ' John Symond backed the same outlook .
`` I think it will fall out over the next six to 12 months , where you might see 4 to 5 per cent [ rise ] in some areas , no increase in other areas .
`` And then it will just flatten out for a few years . That 's Melbourne . I think Sydney is heading to the same place , '' he said .
'Cooling premature '
But other developers and real estate agents have responded to the possible slowdown of the Sydney and Melbourne property markets with a resounding `` What cooling ? ''
The host with the most , John Symond at home in Point Piper . Michele Mossop
The chairman of Meriton Apartments , Harry Triguboff , said his apartment market had weakened in April but recovered in June and was now `` very strong . '' He added Meriton is `` mostly lifting prices . ''
Mirvac boss Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz said : `` We certainly are pedalling as hard as we can right now . But it is cyclical , so we do recognise that there are cycles and certainly the Sydney market has to be towards the top of its cycle by any measure that you would care to look at . ''

Agents said auction clearance rates alone should not be used as a barometer to gauge where the market is at .
`` Calling the demise of the property market is premature . It still has a long long way to go , '' said Douglas Driscoll of west Sydney agents Starr Partners .
`` Sure , the herd mentality from six to 12 months ago has diminished , but let 's look at clearance rates in perspective , '' he said .
`` If you go back three weeks , 280 properties being sold , last week was nearly twice as much . It is simple maths , the more properties for sale , there will be slightly lower clearance rates . And do n't forget those properties sold privately – there are a numerous such transactions taking place . ''
The 'greed stage '
Century 21 Australia chairman Charles Tarbey said `` a lot of people are at the greed stage '' .
`` They are testing market and many have passed in . Clearance rates for the major cities , for example , are 10 per cent than this time last year . And last year they were calling it a boom . ''
National auction volumes had risen to 2378 last weekend , up from 1903 the previous week , the largest of capital city auctions held in 10 weeks , CoreLogic RP Data said .

This has prompted a lot of speculation that the two-horse race could be slowing and prices were on their way down .
One lacklustre auction on the weekend was a small entry-level deceased estate terrace in the heart of inner city Paddington , Sydney .
'It 's not time to ring the bell '
The two-bedroom terrace , which needed work , was advertised with a price guide of $ 1.4 million . Two bidders fronted the auction , opening the bidding at $ 1.3 million and moving casually to $ 1.38 million .
McGrath Real Estate auctioneer Adrian Bo put in a vendor bid of $ 1.4 million and there it finished , with neither bidder wanting to go further . The home is now up for sale at a price guide of `` over $ 1.46 million . ''
Two McGrath auctions in Mosman and Neutral Bay in Sydney 's popular lower north shore were also withdrawn .
`` But it 's not time to ring the bell and say it 's over , '' Australian Property Institute 's national president Tyrone Hodge said .
`` There is a lot of chatter in the industry and in the media , which can be a self-fulfilling prophecy . ''

`` If you look at the fundamentals , we still have lack of supply and a growing economy . The only real change is banks increasing the hurdle rate for lending , and that takes out more supply which puts more pressure on prices .
`` Very high expectations cause a lot of auctions to pass in . These are not fundamentals . ''
New projects steam ahead
Mr Hodge , who deals directly with developers , said new projects were still streaming in .
David Milton of CBRE , another big seller of off-the-plan apartments , said he has seen similar rates of sale all year .
`` Sure the market is not rising at the rapid rate from about 12 to14 months ago , but this is not feeding into the apartment market , '' he said .
ACProperty.com.au 's director , Esther Yong , who advertises to Asian local and foreign buyers , has instead seen a rise in demand this month compared to last month . Asian luxury property agent , Black Diamondz ' Monika Tu has 50 parties waiting to buy properties .

In early morning industry figures , Disney/Lucasfilm 's Star Wars : The Last Jedi has minted the fourth best Tuesday in December with $ 20.4M raising its running domestic cume through five days to $ 262M .
Tuesday 's gross is just 5 % off from Monday 's $ 21.55M . That 's excellent weekday money and phenomenal hold . But if any cynics are wondering why Last Jedi is n't busting past Tuesday records it 's only because there are still plenty of schools in session . Yesterday , ComScore reported 17 % K-12 schools out . Today that figure jumps to 24 % , then 39 % on Thursday and 61 % on Friday . Force Awakens owns the top and third best Tuesday at the B.O . ever with respectively $ 37.3M ( Dec. 22 ) and $ 29.5M ( Dec. 29 ) . Rogue One owns the seventh best Tuesday ever at $ 22.5M ( Dec. 27 ) . Last Jedi is the ninth best ever , but among December releases is the fourth highest .

LOS ANGELES – Forget cleanup hitter . Think of Ben Zobrist as a great point guard , someone who understands how the pieces fit together , sees all the angles , creates for his teammates and remains calm under pressure .
After watching the Los Angeles Dodgers hold the Cubs scoreless for 21 consecutive innings – and take control of this National League Championship Series – Zobrist realized he needed to do something different .
Zobrist had been thinking about this for days , but finally sensed the opportunity on Wednesday night at Dodger Stadium . Julio Urias – the 20-year-old lefty who 's evoked comparisons to Fernando Valenzuela – had n't allowed a hit through three innings . The Dodgers had focused on throwing first-pitch strikes and attacking Zobrist early with off-speed stuff in the zone .
“ You just try to find the right time , ” Zobrist said . “ I felt like at that point it was definitely necessary to at least try . And if it does n't work out – or you foul it off – then next pitch I 'm probably swinging . ”
Zobrist bunted the Urias curveball he saw coming , placing it perfectly along the third-base line for the leadoff hit that put the Cubs in transition . Javier Baez and Willson Contreras hit back-to-back singles , scoring Zobrist for the first run and forcing one of four errors the Dodgers committed . Jason Heyward hit a ball to the right side of the infield to score Baez . And Addison Russell broke out of his slump by drilling a 94-mph Urias fastball over the right-center field wall for a two-run homer .
Just like that , all the fourth-inning pressure in Game 4 broke the Dodgers as the Cubs stormed back for a 10-2 victory that tied up a best-of-seven series .
“ All the little things , ” Zobrist said . “ You 're not going to hit a bunch of three-run homers every game . You really have to find a way to play small ball , especially in the postseason when we 're facing good pitching and they 've been tough on us .
“ That just kind of got everything going . Offensively , everybody contributed . It just kind of felt like the floodgates opened . ”
[ SHOP : Buy a `` Try Not to Suck '' shirt with proceeds benefiting Joe Maddon 's Respect 90 Foundation & other Cubs Charities ]
This is what Zobrist did with the Kansas City Royals last season , earning a World Series ring and signing a four-year , $ 56 million contract to help the Cubs win eight more games than the 2015 team that never led at any point against the New York Mets in the NLCS .
The Cubs wanted a veteran switch-hitter in the middle of their lineup to set an example for their younger players , a winner who would maintain the same pitch-by-pitch focus and daily approach , no matter what else might be going on around this team .
“ That 's kind of what you have to do to stay sane , ” Zobrist said . “ If you do different things when things are not going well , ( then ) you 're going to drive yourself crazy in this game .
“ We try to keep the routine the same . We try to stay positive with each other and believe that it 's going to happen . We know that our offense is too good to keep down for a long time .
“ Hopefully , tonight was a big indication of what is to come the next few games . ”
While the best team in baseball during the regular season had to find its identity in October – see that first-round comeback against the San Francisco Giants – Zobrist already had enough self-awareness to know this : “ I 've said this before , I 'm not a cleanup hitter . I 'm just batting fourth . ”
Canada plans to push the United States to change a “ ludicrous ” current policy that forbids Canadians who admit to previously using marijuana from entering the U.S .
A spokesman for the Canadian government said on Friday that it has been in discussions with the U.S. government about Canada 's plans to legalize marijuana , Reuters reported . But the spokesman said the travel policy has not yet been addressed .
The policy drew attention when a Canadian man in 2014 was barred from entering the U.S. after he admitted he had smoked marijuana recreationally , Reuters reported .
“ We obviously need to intensify our discussions with our border authorities in the United States , including the Department of Homeland Security , ” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp late on Thursday , according to Reuters .

“ This does seem to be a ludicrous situation , ” he said .
This debate comes as Canada moves toward legalizing marijuana and as more states in the U.S. are beginning to legalize marijuana or ease restrictions on its use for medical purposes .

Image caption Milly Dowler disappeared from her home in Walton-on-Thames , Surrey , in 2002
The deputy chief constable of Surrey Police is to be investigated over the hacking of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler 's mobile phone voicemail .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said it would examine the conduct of Craig Denholm , who led the probe into her disappearance .
The IPCC is also investigating Det Supt Maria Woodall , who took over as senior investigating officer in 2006 .
The probe follows claims that officers knew in 2002 the phone had been hacked .
The IPCC said in a statement that it was considering `` whether Mr Denholm was aware during Operation Ruby [ the investigation into Milly 's disappearance ] that the News of the World had accessed Milly Dowler 's voicemail in 2002 and his handling of that information '' .
Mr Denholm was a detective chief superintendent at the time of the 13-year-old schoolgirl 's disappearance in March 2002 , while Ms Woodall was a detective chief inspector when she took over the case in 2006 .
The watchdog 's announcement came after the Surrey force began an internal investigation in July 2011 into the voicemail hacking .
The Surrey Police Authority said that as a result , it was voluntarily referring the two officers to the IPCC .
Neither Mr Denham nor Ms Woodall has been suspended , and they remain on duty , the force said .
'Proper investigation '
He added that the watchdog was also examining information provided by Ms Woodall to Surrey Police during the internal inquiry into the force response to allegations that Milly 's voicemail had been illegally accessed in 2002 .
They regret that the passage of time means that some individuals can now no longer be investigated Mark Lewis , Dowler family solicitor
Surrey Police said its Chief Constable Lynne Owens had met the Dowler family to update them on the inquiry and to let them know about the referrals to the IPCC .
Mark Lewis , the Dowler 's solicitor , said : `` The Dowler family welcomes the proper investigation of what happened at Surrey Police 10 years ago .
`` They regret that the passage of time means that some individuals can now no longer be investigated . ''
Amanda Dowler , known as Milly , went missing in Walton-on-Thames , Surrey , in March 2002 .
Her remains were found six months later near Fleet in Hampshire .
Former bouncer Levi Bellfield was convicted of her murder by a jury at the Old Bailey in June 2011 .
The now defunct News of the World admitted hacking the 13-year-old 's mobile phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted deliberately , as previously suggested , or were removed from her message box automatically .
The Dowlers have said they were given `` false hope '' by hearing the change of greeting triggered by the deletion of message , thinking their daughter might still be alive and had wiped a message .
The revelation that Milly Dowler 's voicemail had been hacked led to a public outcry over British media ethics , and forced News International to close the Sunday tabloid in 2011 .
Prime Minister David Cameron announced the setting up of Lord Justice Leveson 's inquiry into press standards and practices as a consequence of the phone-hacking scandal .
As the Conservative assault continues against Canadian environmental charities , The Vancouver Observer has learned that since 2007 , foreign oil billionaires the Koch brothers have donated over half a million dollars to the “ charitable ” right-wing Fraser Institute .
According to U.S. tax documents , the Fraser Institute received $ 150,000 from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation in 2008 , $ 175,500 in 2009 , and another $ 150,000 in 2010 . The grants were purportedly for `` research support '' and `` educational programs '' .
Koch U.S. Tax document slideshow :
Prior to 2008 , the Institute received another $ 25,000 in funding from the Claude R. Lambe Foundation , which is under the umbrella of Koch Family Foundations .
It has long been known that the ultra-conservative Koch Brothers have been donors for the conservative policy think-tank—though this information is not listed the Institute 's Annual Reports—however , the extent of their funding in the past few years demonstrates the foundation 's more recent influence in Canadian politics .
Grants to the Fraser Institute are also among the highest amounts listed in the Koch Foundation 's tax records ; apart from a few substantial grants to American universities , most of the other donations were under $ 10,000 .
Charitable foundation conducting “ intensely ” political activity
The Fraser Institute , described by rabble.ca as “ Canada 's most intensely political organization ” , is a registered non-profit focused on economic and public policy research . The group 's work is often seen as controversial ( which they boast about on the website ) , and is generally in support of conservative , small-government , free-market values .
A new bill would make it a crime to “ transfer ” your gun to a spouse for more than seven days .
Public-opinion polls about “ universal background checks ” for gun sales show widespread support . While President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg talk about “ gun sales , ” the actual legislation moving through Congress aims to regulate far more than sales . It would turn almost every gun owner into a felon . The trick is that the language under consideration applies not only to sales but also to “ transfers , ” which are defined to include innocent activities such as letting your spouse borrow your gun for a few hours .

Consider , for example , Senate bill S.649 , which the Senate will soon take up for debate . The background-check portion of the bill , Charles Schumer 's “ Fix Gun Checks Act , ” is based on model language that the Bloomberg gun-control lobby is pushing all over the country .
# ad # To see how the Bloomberg bill makes felons of people who do not sell guns , consider a woman who buys a rifle when she is 25 years old . She keeps the rifle her entire life . Yet over her lifetime , she — like most gun owners — engages in dozens of firearms “ transfers. ” She brings the unloaded rifle to a friend 's house , for instance , because the friend is thinking of buying a gun and wants to learn more about guns . The friend handles the rifle for a few minutes before handing it back . Another time , the woman lends the gun to her niece , who takes it on a camping trip for the weekend .
While the woman is out of town on a business trip for two weeks , she gives the gun to her husband or her sister . If the woman lives on a farm , she allows all her relatives to take the rifle into the fields for pest and predator control — and sometimes , when friends are visiting , she takes them to a safe place on the farm where they spend an hour or two target shooting , passing her gun back and forth . At other times , she and her friends go target shooting in open spaces of land owned by the National Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management .

Or perhaps the woman is in a same-sex civil union , and she allows her partner to take her gun to a target range one afternoon . Another time , she allows her cousin to borrow the gun for an afternoon of target shooting . If the woman is in the Army Reserve and she is called up for an overseas deployment , she gives the gun to her sister for temporary safekeeping .
Advertisement
One time , she learns that her neighbor is being threatened by an abusive ex-boyfriend , and she lets this woman borrow a gun for several days until she can buy her own gun . And if the woman becomes a firearms-safety instructor , she regularly teaches classes at office parks , in school buildings at nights and on weekends , at gun stores , and so on . Following the standard curriculum of gun-safety classes ( such as NRA safety courses ) , the woman will bring some unloaded guns to the classroom , and under her supervision , students will learn the first steps in how to handle the guns , including how to load and unload them ( using dummy ammunition ) . During the class , the firearms will be “ transferred ” dozens of times , since students must practice how to hand a gun to someone else safely . As a Boy Scout den mother or 4-H leader , the woman may also transfer her gun to young people dozens of times while instructing them in gun safety .
Advertisement
Under S. 649 , every one of the above activities would be a federal felony , subject to precisely the same punishment a person would receive if he had knowingly sold a firearm to a convicted violent felon . S. 649 , like other Bloomberg-model bills , has a few exceptions to the ban on transfers , but none of them apply to the situations described above .

You can make a “ bona fide gift ” ( but not a three-hour loan ) to certain close family members , not including aunts , uncles , nieces , nephews , in-laws , or civil-union partners .
Advertisement
You can let someone else borrow your gun for up to seven days , but only within your home or its curtilage ( e.g. , the porch or deck ) .
You can not lend your gun to someone on any open space you own . And even your husband ca n't borrow your gun for more than seven days .
You can share a gun at a shooting range , but only if the shooting range is owned by a corporation — not if it 's on public lands or on your own property .

You can share a gun while out hunting in the field . But back at the hunting camp , you ca n't clean someone else 's gun .

This is not “ gun control ” in the constitutionally legitimate sense : reasonable laws that protect public safety without interfering with the responsible ownership and use of firearms .

With the increasing need for effective drug development for chronic diseases , collaborations and partnerships between private and public sectors are formed . We invited Dr. Sandeep Pingle1 to share a three-article series on the need for chronic disease drug development and the important collaborations that result from this need .
95 % failure rate ! Statistics like this for a business would not only justify but also truly warrant shutting down that enterprise . However , this is what drug development in the pharmaceutical world looks like2 .
Failure of new drugs in late stages of development is a major concern for the pharmaceutical and medical community . Not only does this lead to prohibitive costs for drug development , but it also is a cause for concern for diseases that lack effective treatment options . Chronic diseases like hypertension , diabetes , Alzheimer 's , cancer , autoimmune disorders remain difficult to treat in spite of major technological and biomedical advances . So why have the scientific discoveries from genomics , proteomics , molecular biology , pharmaceutics not translated into effective therapies ? Why are effective drugs not being developed ? This is a troubling issue that needs to be addressed urgently .
One major growing problem in the 21st century is type II diabetes ; it is associated with abnormal responses to insulin ( including resistance ) leading to uncontrolled blood glucose levels . This leads to a range of pathologies affecting the eyes , kidney , brain etc . Diabetes represents a billion-dollar drug market and has been the subject of intense research , both at the basic and translational levels . The pharmaceutical and biotech industries have been attempting to develop a cure for this condition , with little success .
Similarly , Alzheimer 's disease is affecting an increasing number of people ; it is a degenerative disease characterized by dementia and other neurological abnormalities . Basic research has shown the protein amyloid-beta to be responsible , at least in part for the pathology leading to this disease . Millions of dollars were spent on trying to translate these findings into a cure for Alzheimer 's . However , none of these efforts were successful .
Another recalcitrant disease group is that of autoimmune disorders , where the body develops antibodies against its own proteins . This results in a variety of different diseases with moderate to severe disability and can be controlled to some extent by immunosuppressant therapy . However , specific drugs for these diseases would likely achieve better control and need to be developed . Among the most debilitating of the autoimmune disorders are rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus . There is no effective treatment strategy for these disorders and current therapies are associated with severe adverse effects .
The common theme for all the three disease groups described here is a lack of effective treatment options . New strategies for drug development are needed , in order to develop therapies against these conditions with minimal adverse effects . Stay tuned next week to find out what these new strategies are !

In an interview with Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly , Trump described Corey Lewandowski with more than a few superlative adjectives — “ terrific , ” “ good '' and “ talented '' among them — and said that together , they ran “ a small , beautiful , unified campaign ” during the primaries .

But , Trump added , “ we 're going to go a little bit of a different route from this point forward . A little different style . ”
When O'Reilly asked Trump if he believed there was “ a personal component inside the president 's personality that sympathizes with the Muslim world , ” he said :
“ I do n't believe anything . I see things. ” Between the Iran deal and Obama 's refusal to utter the words “ radical Islam , ” Trump said , it was n't a question of what he thinks .
“ This is n't thinking , ” he said . “ This is facts . ”

When O'Reilly asked Trump about one of his most merciless critics , Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren , the presidential nominee described her as “ very poor senator. ” Did he regret calling her “ Pocahontas ? ”

“ I do , ” he said , repeating a line he used earlier this month . “ I do regret calling her Pocahontas because I think it 's a tremendous insult to Pocahontas . So , to Pocahontas , I would like to apologize to you . ”
Without providing details , Trump said he `` absolutely '' wanted to prohibit people on a government terror watch list from buying guns . But he does n't support banning weapons “ that can fire a lot of rounds ” — “ they mostly use them for recreation , ” he said — nor does he favor registering serial numbers with the FBI .
Trump was happy to exult in his endorsement from America 's largest gun lobby . Noting that the National Rifle Association had never before supported a presidential nominee so early in a contest , he said that top NRA officials “ get a bad rap . ”
“ They are great Americans , ” he said . “ They love our country . ”
MONTICELLO , Minn. - Concern over possible prostitution and human trafficking is leading to change in one local community .
It involves a massage business in the city of Monticello .
This week , the city of Monticello started licensing massage centers . The move comes after the Sheriff 's Office heard concerns of prostitution and opened an investigation .
“ There are a lot of people in this city who are concerned , ” said Amanda Stachowicz .
Stachowicz started a Facebook group called “ Humanitarians of Wright County ” to raise awareness of sex trafficking she believes could be happening right in Monticello .
“ I do n't think people know this is happening , ” she said .
Suspicions about a massage business grew to concerns when she learned it was advertising on the website backpage.com , which is heavily monitored by law enforcement investigating sex trafficking .
“ All advertising , “ hot , sexy , young Asian girls ” who are willing to please you and make you have a memorable experience , ” Stachowicz said .

The Washington County Attorney 's Office counts the number of apparent solicitations for sexual services in the Twin Cities Metro on Backpage . From January through May , there have been 28,290 .
Those who help sex trafficking victims say you should n't assume the women are involved voluntarily .
“ That is the biggest misconception about human trafficking , ” said Sarah Colford , who has worked with sexual assault victims .
Back in Monticello , the concerns have led to a criminal investigation .
“ We 've reached out to other agencies that have dealt with issues like this , ” a Wright County Sheriff 's official said .
And the concerns led to the city taking action , now requiring massage businesses to be licensed through the city .
“ There are strict guidelines that they have to follow . And if there are activities that happen outside of that , that is out of our control . That 's where it goes over to the sheriff 's department , ” one council member explained at the meeting this week .
“ Because so many people said we 're concerned about this , they listened . And they did whatever they could city-wise , legally , to try and reign it in , ” Stachowicz said .
( Adds report of other threats , edits )
NEW YORK , May 25 ( Reuters ) - An Air France flight from Paris was escorted by two U.S. F-15 fighter jets to New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Monday after an anonymous threat was made against the flight , the U.S. military said .
Air France flight 22 , traveling from Charles de Gaulle Airport , landed safely in New York , officials said .
The anonymous threat came in a telephone call to a Maryland State Police barracks on Monday morning , and the caller made a bomb threat involving commercial aviation , Maryland State Police said .
Two U.S. Air Force F-15 jets were launched as a precaution to monitor the flight as it approached New York , said Navy Lieutenant Commander Richlyn Ivey , a spokeswoman for U.S. North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command .
The plane was cleared in New York with no incidents or hazards reported by passengers or crew , said J. Peter Donald , an FBI spokesman .
The New York Post reported 165 passengers and 11 crew members on board the Air France Airbus A-330 though those figures could not be confirmed .
Air France could not be reached for comment .
Separately , New York 's WNBC television reported that a threat had been made against a separate American Airlines flight headed to JFK , but that threat was deemed not credible and the flight was cleared .
That report also said an Saudi Arabian Airlines flight was being checked out due to an unspecified threat , and that threats had been made against three other flights at Newark Liberty International Airport .
The FBI was not immediately available to comment on the WNBC report .
The U.S. military spokeswoman said the command had not received information about additional threats against commercial airliners .
It was the first time U.S. military aircraft had escorted a private airplane or commercial aircraft since Feb. 13 , when two F-15s followed a general aviation aircraft that was out of contact while flying in a restricted area near San Francisco . The aircraft eventually re-established communications and was followed by the jets until it landed at Half Moon Bay .

Televangelist Pat Robertson on Tuesday warned that same-sex marriage would eventually destroy the Democratic Party .
On Monday , Rep. Barney Frank ( D-MA ) confirmed that a fifteen-member panel had unanimously voted to add marriage equality to the Democratic Party platform ahead of the Democratic National Convention in September .
“ About 2 percent of the population are homosexual , 1 percent of the population is lesbian , ” Robertson said during the Tuesday broadcast of CBN 's The 700 Club . “ That 's a tiny group and every time this initiative has been brought to the ballot where the people have a chance to vote they vote overwhelmingly in favor of traditional marriage . ”
“ For the Democrats to go out on that limb , it just seems like to me that they are further alienating themselves from the mainstream of America . ”
He added : “ If that 's what they want to do , fine , but it will mean the death knell of their party , it seems like to me , and of course that 's what they 're doing but maybe they have a death wish . ”
Earlier this year , the TV preacher called President Barack Obama a “ shameless panderer ” for his support of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples .
“ The bottom line is a male is equipped in a particular fashion and a female is equipped in a particular fashion , ” Robertson explained in May . “ The union of two men does n't bring forth anything except disease , apparently , and suffering . And the same thing of the union of two women . ”
“ It 's a holy union ordained of God and for these politicians to make it a political football , it makes you sick , ” the televangelist continued . “ Obama is a shameless panderer to special interests , and this campaign is enough to make you sick at your stomach . ”

If you run , you 're probably a huge weirdo . But do n't worry , I am too – and there 's safety in numbers so I 'm glad you 're here !
After running for 16 years , my life has become progressively weirder . Not only do I do things that normal folks think are unbelievable / weird / crazy / stupid , but what I think is standard is anything but for the general population .
And it seems with each passing year , the harder it becomes to stop running . The odd rituals and obsessive tendencies become further ingrained in my personality until they help define who I am .
Sleep is n't just fun , it 's recovery .
A bathroom stop is n't just a relief . It 's a chance to check your hydration .
Parks are n't just for picnics , they 're for barefoot strides .
Food is evaluated as fuel .
Indeed , we 're a wacky bunch . But that 's what makes us fun – our idiosyncrasies are what bonds , unites , and strengthens runners everywhere .
So from one weird runner to another , I just want to say that it 's great to be weird together .
To celebrate runners , I 've created a list of the top 13 weirdest things we do because we run . But these are mostly from my experiences as a runner . I 'd love for YOU to add your own oddities , obsessive-compulsive rituals , and crazy tendencies in the comments below .
Let 's have some fun !
Our Weirdest Running Habits
Runners are n't just weird about what they do , but also because of what they like and what they wear . These are our weirdest tendencies , habits , and preferences – and they might just sound familiar .
1 . We have a skewed sense of weather . Tropical storm caused record flooding ? Lightning ? Triple digit temperatures ? Well , you got ta get in your run !
After giving my mother countless anxiety attacks , I now give this warning : It will take a nuclear holocaust to stop me from running .
2 . Our hobby is n't as “ fun ” as others . Getting up at 4am to run over 26 miles for fun this weekend was a CHOICE ! This is what I do for fun ! Why my non-running friends do n't get this is beyond me .
My response : Oh , you 're in a kickball league ? Neat .
3 . Nipple Band-Aids ! While I 've never needed to tape my nipples , it 's a tried and true strategy for those of us predisposed to chafed , bloody , raw nipples . The next time your nipple is pouring blood , do n't forget that you chose to run !
Other sports require their participants to wear jock straps . We have Band-Aids… for our nipples .
4 . Our definition of “ far ” is very different . We run more per week than you probably drive – and some of us run enough per year to get us from LA to New York .
Once on the weekend , we 'll run far enough to prompt our family members to say , “ that 's why they invented cars . ”
5 . We are Gear Junkies ! We own more shoes than fashion bloggers and the latest update to your favorite pair is discussed at LENGTH on Runblogger .
Most runners could be mistaken for paid tech consultants because of their expertise programming GPS watches , heart rate monitors , and wearable tech that the general public does n't even know exists .
And socks ? I own more than 30 pairs .
5 . Our commitment is steadfast . Yes , we run almost every day . Yes , we do it in challenging weather . YES , we get up before dawn to run !
I die a little bit on the inside when people are incredulous that I run most days .
6 . We run a LOT . Not only do some of us run every day , but there are some runners who do it TWICE in one day !
Tell a non-runner you 're going for the day 's second run and watch their head explode .
7 . Bathroom breaks do n't need to happen in bathrooms . Taking a quick pit stop outside is no big deal ( just make sure you have a tall blade of grass to hide behind ) .
Using the facilities without facilities does n't even phase me anymore – just another Wednesday !
8 . Shoegasms . Runners get more excited about a new pair of running shoes than most people do about getting a new flat screen .
Look at those colors ! The heel-toe drop differential ! Wait , is that Fresh Foam ? !
9 . We downplay what others think is extraordinary . Running a marathon , training for hours , and finishing races faster than most can can finish them on a bike makes others think we 're superhuman .
But to us , it 's just something we love to do . And when the extraordinary is normal , that 's a weird world to live in .
10 . Wear gratuitously short shorts . Shorts with a 1.5 inch seam and a split leg design attract the scorn of non-runners everywhere . And have prompted some of the most hilarious taunts I 've ever heard :
Hey , why are you wearing your sister 's shorts ? ! Mommy , why is that man naked ? Why are you wearing booty shorts ? Get your life together !
Keep'em coming !
11 . Own too many running books . For just a glimpse into my library , just look at my collection of running books . Who owns so many books about one sport ? How much is there to really know about running ?
I think it 's completely reasonable , but my “ normal ” friends think I 'm fit for a straight jacket .
12 . Shaved legs ( on guys ) . I have n't done this in years , but there was a time when they were always shaved . Look at the front of the pack at any major road race and you 'll notice quite a few smooth legs on the male runners .
Besides swimmers and cyclists ( who have better reasons to shave ) , male runners do it to feel fast and look intimidating . Plus , slipping into clean sheets with freshly shaven legs is heavenly . Now THAT 'S weird .
13 . Require ample “ skippy doo ” space . You need space for all those warm-up and core exercises – which are affectionately called “ skippy doos ” by a friend of mine .
Now I demand a living room clear of furniture so I have ample space to do all those exercises . When family or friends are visiting , they laugh their heads off .
Honorable mention :
I polled a few family members on our weird behaviors and got these gems :
You changed shoes before the race – why do you need two pairs of shoes ? Barefoot running ! That 's so weird . Oh , and those toe shoes . Who runs in those ? Runners are usually so healthy when it comes to their diet and lifestyle , but then all these races end in chugging beers !
Your Turn !
Now I want your reasons why runners are weird ! Leave a comment below and let us know what makes runners so “ different . ”
And then let 's rejoice in our weirdness , celebrate our idiosyncrasies , and cherish our wacky habits . We 're a community : an oddball group that shares this unspoken culture .
They 're what makes us runners , after all .
If you 're new here , I 'd love for you to join this running community . And I promise not to send you anything too weird 🙂

JERUSALEM
Forty-seven years ago , extremist Australian tourist Denis Michael Rohan set fire to the flashpoint al-Aqsa Mosque in Israel-occupied East Jerusalem .
“ I still remember the fire as if it happened yesterday , ” Sheikh Ekrema Sabri , the head of the Supreme Islamic Council and former preacher of Al-Aqsa mosque , told Anadolu Agency on Sunday .
“ The moment the people of Jerusalem heard about the fire , they rushed in , bringing water inside cans to put out the blaze , ” he said .
The fire has destroyed nearly third of the al-Qiblah mosque , including the 1,000-year old priceless wood and ivory pulpit of conqueror Saladin .
Sabri accused Israeli authorities of cutting off water from the area and preventing fire engines from reaching the site to extinguish the fire .
“ Around 1,550 square meters of the 4,500 square meters that comprise the Al-Aqsa mosque compound were completely destroyed by the fire , ” he said .
The blaze also destroyed the mihrab ( prayer niche ) of Muslim caliph Omar bin al-Khattab , the decorated interior and the gilded wooden dome .
“ It was a grisly crime and a terrible tragedy , ” Sabri recalled . “ It took us more than 30 years to repair the damage caused by the fire , ” he said .
In response to the arson attack , Islamic countries founded the umbrella Organization of the Islamic Conference , now the Organization of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) , during their summit in Morocco .
On September 15 , 1969 , the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 271 , which grieved at the extensive damage caused by the fire and condemned Israel for failing to respect UN resolutions .
Rohan was arrested two days after the arson attack . Israeli authorities said that he was suffering from severe mental illness and later expelled him to Australia .
For Muslims , Al-Aqsa represents the world 's third holiest site . Jews , for their part , refer to the area as the `` Temple Mount , '' claiming it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times .
Israeli excavations
Mahmoud Shtaiyeh , 69 , a witness to the fire , said Rohan had planned the arson attack in advance .
“ The fire was set to three different areas in the mosque , ” Shtaiyeh told Anadolu Agency .
He recalled that thousands had run into the mosque in a despite attempt to extinguish the fire .
“ [ We ] began to put the fire out with cans , buckets , clothes and even with our bare hands , ” he said . “ We were not afraid of death ; all it was a matter to save the Al-Aqsa mosque . ”
The arson attack was one of several assaults on the flashpoint site since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967 .
In April 1982 , an Israeli soldier indiscriminately opened fire on worshipers inside the mosque , killing two and wounding six others .
In October of 1990 , Israeli police killed 21 Palestinians and injured scores during clashes that erupted when Jewish extremists tried to place the foundation stone of a Jewish temple inside the mosque .
Israeli authorities , meanwhile , have carried out `` archaeological '' work in the vicinity of the mosque without disclosing the exact nature or details of these excavations .
Palestinian anger at the excavations reached a fever pitch in September 1996 , when the Israeli government opened a tunnel under Al-Aqsa mosque 's western wall .
The Israeli move invited Palestinian fury , sparking days of demonstrations across Israeli-occupied territories , during which 63 Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured .
In September 2000 , a visit to Al-Aqsa by controversial Israeli politician Ariel Sharon sparked what later became known as the `` Second Intifada , '' a popular uprising against the Israeli occupation in which thousands of Palestinians were killed .
“ Since 1967 , the Israeli occupation authorities worked intensively to build settlements around Jerusalem in order to surround the city and isolate it from its Arab surrounding , ” Hanna Issa , a Palestinian expert on settlement affairs , told Anadolu Agency .
“ This policy not only aims to isolate Jerusalem , but also to prepare the ground for the demolition of Al-Aqsa mosque , in order to build the alleged Solomon 's temple in its place , ” he said .
Issa went on to assert that Israeli authorities have opened more than 25 tunnels underneath the Al-Aqsa mosque compound since 1996 , warning that the Israeli excavations have already weakened the mosque 's foundations .
“ The mosque wo n't stand a moderate earthquake and this is what Israel wants , ” he said .
FBI director James Comey has suggested that an international agreement between governments could ease fears about IT products with government-mandated backdoors , but privacy advocates are doubtful .
Speaking on Thursday , Comey suggested that the U.S. might work with other countries on a “ framework ” for creating legal access to encrypted tech devices .
“ I could imagine a community of nations committed to the rule of law developing a set of norms , a framework , for when government access is appropriate , ” he said on Thursday .
Comey made his comments at the University of Texas at Austin , when trying to address a key concern facing U.S. tech firms in the encryption debate : the fear that providing government access to their products might dampen their business abroad .
Critics have said this government access amounts to a “ backdoor ” into tech products that essentially weakens a device 's security , putting consumers at risk .
But another worry is the business impact . Customers might prefer non-U.S. products that do n't have law enforcement access .
On Thursday , Comey said : “ I do n't want to be any part of chasing the innovation from this great country to other places . ”
However , he said that other nations such as France , Germany and the U.K. are also trying to solve the problem faced by law enforcement access to encrypted data . That might result in “ inconsistent standards ” that hurt the U.S. companies , when it comes to their international business .
“ There 's a danger that we , the mother and father of all this innovation , will be the last to solve it ( the encryption problem ) , ” he said .
Comey did n't elaborate further on his idea , but privacy experts are calling it unrealistic .
“ I do n't think it makes sense , ” said Nicholas Weaver , a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California Berkeley .
Comey 's idea means that all countries will essentially agree to weaken the security in their vendors ' tech products , Weaver said . However , other countries will balk , fearing that the U.S. might exploit the cooperation for spying purposes .
“ Would you still use a U.S. product , even if you know the NSA ( National Security Agency ) could have the rights to it ? ” he said .
Others think any mandated government access to tech devices risks cyberespionage from U.S. rivals .
“ Once you build that backdoor good luck trying to keep the Russians and Chinese out , ” said Nate Cardozo , an attorney with the privacy advocate the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Nevertheless , the FBI director has been more vocal in recent weeks about reigniting the encryption debate .
On Thursday , he said the FBI had been trying to unlock 2,800 electronic devices , collected from federal agents and local police in criminal investigations . However , the FBI has failed to open 43 percent of them , even with classified techniques .
Although private companies are generating today 's technology , Comey said : “ their job is not to decide how the American people should live . The American people should decide how they live . ”
Last year , the FBI publicly feuded with Apple over gaining access to a locked iPhone from the San Bernardino shooter . But on Thursday , Comey said the tech industry can find an approach that creates government access , while keeping malicious actors out .
“ I reject the , ‘ it 's impossible ' response , ” he said . “ I just think we have n't actually tried it . ”
Cardozo said he does n't think Comey 's comments did much to convince anyone in Silicon Valley .
“ It 's childish to stomp your foot , and say , ‘ nerds you have to try harder , ' ” Cardozo said .
Weaver said that both the tech industry and FBI have valid arguments in the encryption debate , but both sides are “ talking past each other . ”
However , unlike Comey , he does n't see any middle ground in the encryption debate . `` They ( the FBI ) are asking for something that can not be done , without significantly weakening the systems , '' he said .

RALEIGH , N.C. ( WNCN ) - Dozens of businesses are closed today Thursday as people rally for immigrants in Raleigh .
The rally and business closings are part of the national `` Day Without Immigrants . ''
Organizers are trying to show the impact immigrants have on the nation 's economy while also showing their opposition to President Donald Trump 's immigration policies .
Locally , at least 50 businesses are closed today in Raleigh and many more are closed throughout the Triangle .
The owner of one of those businesses says a lot of her customers are undocumented and worry about whether they 'll be able to stay .
`` Some do the wrong thing . That does n't mean all of us do . Most of us come here to work and maybe have a better future , '' said Silvia Martinez , the owner of El Pancito .
Recent enforcement actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) has put a lot of immigrants on edge .
`` We are people that work pay taxes . And we are here trying to grow our families and do better for our families . We are good people , '' said David Salazar with Si a las Licencias .
Martinez said she 's definitely seen concern in the immigrant community over recent ICE actions .
`` Everybody 's concerned . A lot of people do n't even want to go out . They do n't want to go shopping , or they 're just afraid to go to work , '' she said .
Another one of the 40 stores closing today in the Triangle is Merritt 's Store and Grill in Chapel Hill .
They posted a message last night on Facebook saying that they have decided to be part of the immigrant 's strike . They said 95 percent of their staff is Hispanic and they will reopen on Friday .
The Day Without Immigrants rally began at 10 a.m. in Moore Square in downtown Raleigh .
Larry Bird walked onto the court , about to coach at practice , and was told that one of his players was missing .
Back at the hotel , still in bed , was Michael Jordan .
It was the eve of the NBA All-Star Game in 1998 , the last time Madison Square Garden hosted the star-studded event , and Jordan had the flu .
Bird , the former Boston Celtics superstar then in his first season coaching the Indiana Pacers , was coach of the Eastern Conference All-Stars . That meant , for just one day , he would coach Jordan , the Chicago Bulls superstar -- who was listed as questionable for the game .
When Bird boarded the team bus on the morning of the game , Jordan , ill as he was , was on it . But shortly after tip-off , Jordan got the remedy he needed . It was 19-year-old Los Angeles Lakers phenom Kobe Bryant , who was being hailed as the next Jordan .
`` It was interesting because Michael was n't feeling well on the way over there on the bus , '' Bird recalled in a phone interview with Newsday . `` But once he got there and got going , it was pretty interesting to watch how he played against Kobe . ''
Jordan suddenly did n't resemble someone who spent the previous day in bed with a 101-degree fever .

Bird had stressed ball movement , but Michael versus Kobe stands as one of his favorite memories from that game .
Bryant was making his debut , becoming the youngest All-Star in NBA history . Not yet a starter for the Lakers , he was voted into the starting lineup for the West .
`` Kobe was trying to go after Michael early , '' Bird said . `` And Michael started going back at him . ''
Though Bryant won the crowd with his 360-dunk and thunderous alley-oop off a lob from 21-year-old Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves , Jordan was named the game 's most valuable player . Relying mainly on his turnaround fadeaway jumper , he had 23 points and eight assists to lead the East to a 135-114 win over the West . His status initially was in doubt , but he ended up playing more minutes than any other player .
`` I can remember there was a lot of talent , '' Bird said . `` It 's an All-Star Game , but there was a lot of talent on both squads . ''
That included seven of the current top 18 scorers in league history -- Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz , Bryant , Jordan , Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers , Garnett , Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs and Reggie Miller of the Pacers .
`` I ca n't say I was intimidated or a little nervous about it , '' Bird said of coaching so many stars . `` Just going along with business as usual . ''
The Knicks were a playoff team when the Garden last hosted the All-Star Game , though they did n't have any representatives . This time , the game will be played in the home of the team that currently has the worst record in the league ( 10-41 ) .
`` Rebuilding is not an overnight deal , '' Bird said of the current state of the Knicks . `` It takes time . If you are going to rebuild , you ca n't Band-Aid it as you go along . Phil [ Jackson ] has had great success . He has been very valuable to our league over the years and I think he 'll get it right . ''
On Sunday , Golden State 's Steve Kerr -- who turned down the Knicks ' coaching job over the summer -- will lead the Western Conference All-Stars . He 'll be the first rookie coach to guide an All-Star team since Bird did so in 1998 . Any advice from Larry Legend ?
`` You try to get them to play together , play hard , '' Bird said . `` You are there to put on a good show , but you definitely want to win . Being in any All-Star Game , and especially in New York , you want to play well . ''
THE notion of mummies conjures , to most minds , images of ancient Egypt . The brightly painted body-swaddling and monumental , pyramidal tombs of that land are hard to cap as a funerary send-off . But others mummified their dead , too . And in 2005 a discovery on a remote Scottish island called Cladh Hallan suggested ancient Britons were among them .
The case that the two Cladh Hallan burials , which took place in the second millennium BC , were mummifications is not quite proven . Britain 's wet climate tends to reduce all remains to bones , even if the tissues had been painstakingly preserved by smoke or swaddling clothes , so the bodies found were not exactly in pristine condition . But even their bones contain clues . And members of the team that unearthed them have joined forces with Thomas Booth of the Natural History Museum , in London , to look at them in more detail . As a result , in a paper just published in Antiquity , they have been able to offer further proof that the Cladh Hallan remains were deliberately mummified . They also show , by examining other burials in the same way , that mummification was a widespread practice among late-Bronze Age Britons .

Dr Booth has spent a good deal of his professional career looking at Bronze Age British bones . What he sees in them routinely is something called bioerosion . Corpses quickly become the lunch , within and without , of teeming masses of bacteria . The interiors of their bones bear the tracks of this snacking : long , hollow tunnels beneath their surfaces . By contrast , when Dr Booth and his colleagues studied known mummies from northern Yemen and an Irish bog , they failed to find such tunnels . They had thus , they realised , unearthed a promising way of identifying mummified remains . And , crucially , both of the Cladh Hallan burials lacked such tunnels too .
That led to further sleuthing . When the team examined 34 other sets of Bronze-Age British remains , they found 16 of them had this “ arrested bioerosion ” . That suggests mummification was widespread in Bronze Age Britain , though British mummification techniques do not seem to have been as good as Egyptian ones were , for many of the corpses were partly bioeroded and had only odd limbs that had been correctly mummified .
The funerary practices of the ancient Britons did not stop there , though . DNA testing of some mummies showed that they were reconstructed from several corpses . What this means is anybody 's guess . Dr Booth hazards that mummies were kept among the living , for political and social purposes . If you were related to a landowner who died , for example , then you could stake a claim to the land by stating kinship . That is harder to do with only part of a dead landowner , so patching your relative up with bits and pieces from others might strengthen your claim . Alternatively , unburied mummies may have been thought of as channels through which the living could talk to the dead , or to the gods—much as saints ' relics are venerated by some people today .
That is speculation . Dr Booth 's discoveries do , though , suggest that mummification was not just the preserve of the preserved in Egypt . And the team now have a simple means to discover just how widespread the practice was .
As the 2016 election results played out , observers on both sides were shocked that Donald Trump won four key swing states – Florida , Pennsylvania , Michigan , and Wisconsin – where Hillary Clinton had been heavily favored . She had seemingly locked up Florida with early voting alone , and the other three have all reliably gone blue for a generation . But more suspicious than the fact that Trump won these states was the fact that he won them all by the same margin .
The most commonly posited explanation of Donald Trump 's shocking election victory was that every professional pollster in the nation – despite each working independently and using differing methodologies – somehow managed to overlook the same pockets of Trump voters in these states . If such pockets did exist , they would have existed in varying sizes in each of the four states , thus resulting in different sized wins in each .
Ask any statistician and they 'll tell you that a reasonable distribution of the results would have been Trump winning one of the states by one percent , won one of them by perhaps three percent , won one of them by two percent , lost one of them by one percent , or something along those lines . But instead the voting tallies looked startlingly different from any natural distribution . In fact they looked startlingly the same .
According to the New York Times , the voting results broke down like this : Trump won Florida by just over one percent of the vote . He also won Pennsylvania by just over one percent . He won Michigan by just under one percent . And he won Wisconsin by precisely one percent . That 's not how numbers tend to work in the real world .
On its own , this kin of suspiciously consistent numerical dispersion across the four states that decided the election would be something that could be written off as a mere fluke . But when you put it within the context of the numerous other ways in which the voting tallies make no mathematical sense , it points to the numbers having been rigged or altered .
Specifically it points to some hacker having nudged these four states into Trump 's column by no more and no less than the one percent he needed , so as not to arouse suspicion by giving him too large of a win in any of the states he was supposed to lose . But if so , it 's the pattern of all of these states being won by the same one percent that stands out as suspicious , because that 's just not how numbers work to begin with .
Your Sourpuss Grandpa Will Love Blockchain
Dan Conway Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 7 , 2016
Retired middle school gym teacher .
He shoveled snow until his hands bled , gave a firm handshake and did n't waste a thing . In his day everyone did what they were supposed to do , Dammit .
Grandpa sourpuss is going to love blockchain because it reintroduces old fashioned values with the fury of the pointer stick you will eventually pry from his cold , dead hands .
Blockchain eliminates the flashy bullshit .
A deal 's a deal , said Grandpa . Smart contracts on the blockchain ensure that goods and services go where they are intended , that money is deposited before goods are delivered , that terms of service do n't change . The dude with the suit and the hair and the college ring “ sheparding your engagement ” is n't going to charm anyone out of what they deserve .
Corporate marketing campaigns wo n't have as much work to do hiding the facts with slick images and upbeat music . Business terms , philanthropic contributions and other company metrics will be transparent on the blockchain 's distributed ledger . Think fewer hardworking emojis and exclamation points from Fortune 500 companies — a blessing .
The blockchain-based economy will have its own risks and rewards— there are no free rides in this world— but the smooth operators who focus on brand and flash rather than substance will be taken down a notch for sure .
We miss you , Grandpa Tata !
It 's all a conspiracy !
Grandpa wishes he were a fly on the wall when the big power players get together to decide how they are going to screw us . Whether or not there is collusion among the power elites like the gathering of the heads of the five families in The Godfather , blockchain takes the power away from behemoths , wherever they may be .
In the tech space , for example , Facebook , Google , Apple and Amazon control a distressing amount of our online presence and economic activity . They scoop up the profits , monetize our data , and create walls to keep us in the ecosystems they control and profit from .
Blockchain networks are n't controlled by anyone . Cryptography and advanced economics have created what some call the God Protocol — trust established by code rather than powerful entities like banks , corporate owned social networks or computer platforms . You no longer need to pay the Godfather for protection .
In a blockchain version of Uber the drivers keep the money and set the rates by consensus rather than corporate directive . In a blockchain version of Google , the users keep their own data and share it only when they are compensated .
No one believes a blockchain version of Google is around the corner , but you see where this is headed . More ownership by more people creating less likelihood that friends of John Galt can set the term sheet for the next decade of your life on the back of a juice bar napkin .
Damn you , Obama !
Grandpa did n't like George W. Bush either . He thinks they are all the same — always meddling , taxing too much , talking rather than doing .
The invention of blockchain was born from libertarian political thought as much as it was from computer science .
Blockchains are n't controlled by any country . They are nearly impossible to shut down because they live on millions of computers spread throughout the world . So this is the most free system Grandpa will likely ever see . But I differ from Grandpa and the hard core libertarians if they think no government involvement in blockchains is a possible outcome .
For many reasons , including the information cited in this piece , I believe blockchains will create prosperity benefiting a much wider group of people than those who usually reap the rewards of large scale disruption . I 'd rather that those of us involved with this industry work with potential regulators to craft smart solutions that protect consumers in some basic ways , thereby avoiding the nuclear option — a herd of crazed bureaucrats with hammers seeing every problem as a nail .
It is naive to think that governments will stay out of blockchain entirely — and in some cases , they are already moving in . I see this as a sign that we are legit — and a reminder that vigilance and advocacy is needed to avoid bad laws and short sighted outcomes .
And now it 's time to put grandpa in his recliner and flip on Family Feud . When he starts complaining that people are n't as smart as they used to be — tell him blockchain ca n't help with that and it 's time for his nap .
I hope I look this good in 60 years .
Appendix : Basic Blockchain Background and Context :
Blockchain is the technology behind Ethereum , Bitcoin and several smaller platforms that have attracted a flood of new developers and more than $ 1B in venture investment over the past two years .
Cryptocurrency is the compensation that “ miners ” receive for using their computers to run peer to peer blockchain networks in lieu of centrally controlled servers . Ether , Bitcoin and other currencies are bought and sold on digital asset exchanges like Coinbase in the same way that stocks are traded on NASDAQ or the NYSE .
The Decentralized Web allows for a wider distribution of value and ownership on the Internet and was the original goal of the inventor of the World Wide Web , Tim Berners-Lee and his compatriots . It is finally being made possible by breakthroughs in cryptography and advanced economics — the two essential elements of blockchain .

The U.S. is finally offering some new humanitarian assistance for the country it is helping to ruin :
The U.S. will provide $ 89 million in additional humanitarian aid to war-torn Yemen , the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) announced Wednesday .
Obviously , Yemen can use all the assistance it can get , so this is a welcome move , albeit one that is long overdue . The U.S. has previously provided roughly the same amount before , and its total contribution now amounts to approximately $ 170 million , but this is still far less than what Yemen needs . One of Yemen 's many problems is that pledges of aid have been coming in very slowly and some of the governments that have made pledges ( chiefly Saudi Arabia ) have been in no hurry to deliver on their promises . Omer Karasapan summed up the problem in a recent review of Yemen 's humanitarian catastrophe :
Here unfortunately , the situation is dire : only 19 percent , $ 298 million , of the $ 1.6 billion requested by humanitarian agencies has been funded . There have been contributions of $ 252 million outside of this humanitarian appeal but the shortfall is still above $ 1 billion .
The announcement of the U.S. contribution is a reminder that the aid Yemen needs is not being provided to the country , and even if all requests were filled they would not be able to replace the loss of commercial imports caused by the blockade . What makes the relatively small U.S. contribution even less impressive is the fact that the U.S. is daily aiding in the campaign that is battering and starving Yemeni civilians . The administration is applying a small band-aid to a gaping wound that it continues to help inflict on Yemen . The U.S. could do far more to remedy the humanitarian disaster in Yemen if it would press for an end to the blockade and a halt to the Saudi-led coalition 's offensive , but we know that is n't going to happen .
Fulham plotting late move for Jota ?
Fulham are plotting a late move to steal Brentford playmaker Jota from under the noses of Middlesbrough in the dying moments of the August transfer window , according to the Sun this evening .
Jota , who famously scored a last-gasp winner to secure Brentford 's first league win over the Whites in 22 years back in 2014 , has long been linked with a move away from Griffin Park after a summer of fevered transfer speculation . The 26 year-old Spaniard has scored 23 goals in 78 appearances since moving to west London from Ceta Vigo three years ago and Brentford placed an £8m price tag on his head .
Middlesbrough has a reported bid of around £4.5m rebuffed for Jota , who has one year left on his current Brentford contract . The Sun claims that Fulham are ready to test just how wedded their local rivals are to their asking price by tabling an offer of £6m and upping Jota 's wages to around £30,000-a-week , which is apparently substantially more than Middlesbrough are offering .
Jota , who returned from a loan spell with Eibar to score twelve goals last term , hit the post in Brentford 's 0-0 draw against Wolves yesterday but was substituted after an hour . Bees boss Dean Smith told the press after the game that he was a confident Jota will stay – although the club are braced for late bids as the transfer deadline looms closer .
CHICAGO – FC Dallas midfielder Kellyn Acosta told MLSsoccer.com on Sunday that he could move to Europe this summer , adding fuel to FCD technical director Fernando Clavijo 's recent comments that he expects the 22-year-old US international to head overseas “ in the next 12 months . ”
Acosta has been the subject of periodic transfer rumors for the better part of the last year . His profile has risen tremendously since the start of the 2016 season , when he helped lead FCD to the Supporters ' Shield and US Open Cup titles .
The MLS All-Star has become a key part of the USMNT in 2017 , earning call-ups for all four of their World Cup qualifiers this year , going the full 90 in the 1-1 draw at Mexico in June and starting four of six matches en route to the team 's recent Gold Cup title .
He said on Sunday that if he does move to Europe , he 'd like to do it in the current transfer window .
“ Any window is a possibility , ” he said . “ Ideally if I were to move , I would want to move during this window because this is the preseason for them rather than the winter when I 'm winding down my season as well as jumping in the middle of their season . So I mean , ideally , now would be the time , but when the time comes , the time comes . ”
With the World Cup looming next summer , it 'd make more sense for Acosta to move now than next January . Heading to Europe is an adjustment for any MLS player , and arriving at a new club while they 're in the middle of their season would likely only make things more complicated . Arriving in summer when European teams are in preseason often makes for a smoother transition , and would allow Acosta more time to earn minutes with a new club before Bruce Arena names a potential World Cup roster .
His preferred timeline does seem to be at odds with Clavijo 's , however . The FCD technical director told FourFourTwo 's Paul Tenorio in mid-July that he 'd like to get through the current MLS season before potentially selling Acosta in January .
“ When I say we , the ownership , the players , all of us need to figure out what is the right thing to do right now , depending on the time , ” he said . “ We 're so close to December , and we can have everything in place , win a championship and then make a transfer . We prefer to go into the transfer window in January and not July , because it jeopardizes the rest of the team . But we have to be ready to cover that decision . ”
While they 'd prefer to wait until winter to make any sales , FC Dallas did send a high-profile player to Europe last summer . After a protracted , controversial transfer saga , the club loaned winger Fabian Castillo to Turkish club Trabzonspor last September before making the move permanent in January . Dallas won the US Open Cup and Supporters ' Shield after Castillo 's departure , but were undone in the playoffs after midfielder Mauro Diaz tore his Achilles in the penultimate match of the regular season .
Europe is clearly somewhat on his mind , but Acosta said he 's focused on keeping things simple and returning to form with FCD and in Wednesday 's All-Star Game against Real Madrid ( 8:30 pm ET ; FS1 and Univision in the US | TSN and TVA Sports in Canada ) after not “ perform [ ing ] like [ he ] wanted to ” and wanting “ to impress too much ” in the Gold Cup .
“ I know there have been teams interested , but I 'm just trying to keep my head down , buckle down and work hard , ” he said . “ Obviously that 's my dream to play in Europe . I do n't know when that will be , but hopefully when the time comes I 'll be ready . Right now I 'm just focused on doing well with FC Dallas and kind of just going from there .
“ We 're still in the transfer window now , I mean anything can happen . So right now I 'm just trying to do well . I 'm here at the All-Star Game , there 's going to be some eyes there , so I just need to play my game , do what I do every week with FC Dallas and do a little bit better than I did with the national team . I just want to continue progressing and when the time comes , just make a decision then . ”
In many U.S. cities , developers are required to provide a minimum number of parking spaces with new housing units , dramatically raising rents .
Jim Dalrymple II Cars parked along a residential street in Los Angeles .
Paying rent sucks . But it 's actually a lot worse because of something that is n't immediately obvious : parking spaces . While many factors contribute to drive up the price of rents , parking is among the most significant , according to University of California Los Angeles professor and renowned parking guru Donald Shoup . BuzzFeed News sat down with Shoup during the CityLab 2014 conference in Los Angeles Monday to talk about how parking makes housing more expensive . His point : `` It 's unfair to have cities where parking is free for cars and housing is expensive for people . '' Here 's how this works :
1 . Cities require developers to include parking when they build homes . Parking does n't happen by accident , and it does n't even happen because people necessarily want it ( i.e . demand ) . Instead , cities require developers to include parking spaces with new homes or apartments . This is an idea known as `` parking minimums , '' and Shoup said they 're common across America . A typical rule is two parking spaces per housing unit , but it varies from city to city . Shoup gave the example of L.A. 's Mid-Wilshire neighborhood , saying that current regulations require 2.5 parking spaces per apartment .
Jim Dalrymple II An apartment building in the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles . This building includes underground parking because city rules require multiple spaces per apartment .
2 . All that required parking makes it way , way more expensive to build apartments . Shoup said that in some cases the cost of a parking space can soar up to $ 50,000 . In L.A. , the average cost is more than $ 31,000 , and the International Parking Institute reports that the median national cost for a parking space is $ 16,167 .

Developers do n't just eat those costs , they pass them on to renters and buyers . So , when you pay your rent or mortgage , you 're really paying for how much it cost the developer to put in that parking , Shoup expained . Juan Matute , Associate Director of UCLA 's Lewis Center and the Institute of Transportation Studies , further explained it to BuzzFeed News this way : `` Imagine if you required every housing unit to have a squash court . '' That would obviously drive the cost of the housing way up . If you actually need these things , great . The problem , however , is that cities require every unit in a given area to have all of this parking , even if the person living there has fewer cars , or no car at all . It 's kind of like bundling cable channels ; subscribers pay for hundreds of channels they may not watch just to get a few they do . Except that in the case of housing , the costs are higher and , because everyone needs a home , no one can really opt out the way a person might with cable . And one more thing : Shoup said it 's absolutely cities ' rules requiring parking that 's creating this situation . `` I never saw a building where the developer provided more than the required amount of parking , '' he said . `` They always provided what the city required and nothing more . ''
Jim Dalrymple II A modern apartment building in Los Angeles . This building has underground parking , which Shoup said is extremely expensive to build .
3 . Parking also means fewer homes get built , which translates into still higher prices . The other way parking makes housing more expensive is by cutting off supply . Shoup said in some cases it 's impossible to build more apartments because there 's simply not enough room for all the required parking .
Jim Dalrymple II
Shoup used this reporter 's 1920s , eight-unit L.A. building as an example . It was built before cities required parking and has only seven spots , but if it were torn down and rebuilt , current regulations would require a comparatively staggering 18 spots . To get even close to that number , a developer would have to dig a hole and put the parking underground — which is really expensive to do — but even then it may not provide enough spaces . Which means the developer would have to build fewer apartments . `` I saw many buildings where the developer could n't put in the allowed number of housing units because they could n't fit in the required number of parking spaces , '' Shoup said . Which brings us to simple supply and demand : Lots of people plus a limited number of apartments means landlords can charge higher and higher rents . Parking minimums , in other words , limit housing supply , even as demand increases .
4 . It does n't have to be this way . In L.A. , Shoup said , the city eliminated parking minimums in downtown in 1999 . Some people at the time thought that would produce chaos , with cars flooding the streets . But instead , Shoup said , 57 mostly empty historic buildings were converted to housing over the next decade . He added that the residents of many of these buildings still have access to parking , they just pay for it separately according to their needs ( or lack thereof ) .

Sarah Bernard / AP This frame grab made from video on Oct. 5 shows Edward Archbold competing in a roach-eating contest at Ben Siegel Reptile Store in Deerfield Beach , Fla .
It could be weeks before autopsy results can determine why a 32-year-old Florida man collapsed and died after winning a cockroach-eating contest .
Insect experts say the mere act of eating roaches , while repulsive to many , should n't have killed Edward Archbold . Some theorize Archbold may have had an allergic reaction .
Archbold ate more than 60 grams of meal worms , 35 three-inch-long “ super worms ” and part of a bucket full of discoid roaches to win the “ Midnight Madness ” bug-eating competition Friday night at Ben Siegel Reptiles in Deerfield Beach , about 40 miles north of Miami , according to The Miami Herald . The take-home grand prize was a python from the reptile shop .
Shortly after winning the contest , Archbold became ill and began to vomit , the Broward County Sheriff 's Office said . He collapsed in front of the store and was later pronounced dead at a hospital .
The medical examiner 's office said Tuesday that it has sent samples of Archbold 's remains for testing , but results are not expected for another week or two .
“ We know cockroaches shed a lot of allergens , but they 're not toxic in and of themselves , ” Bill Kern , a professor of entomology at the University of Florida , told The Miami Herald . “ Very few [ human ] cultures tend to eat cockroaches because they store large amounts of uric acid and nitrogenous waste . And they tend to be scavengers and feed on things most people would n't consider to be desirable . ”
Mike Tringale , vice president of external affairs at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America , told The Associated Press it 's possible that Archbold `` hit his tolerance level to cockroach allergens '' and went into anaphylactic shock .
Tringale said that such a severe reaction to cockroaches is `` probably rare , '' however .
Coby Schal , a North Carolina State University entomologist , also surmised that the death was likely an allergic response , `` but there is always a possibility that cockroaches do carry bacteria , but the response wo n't be immediate . It would take time for bacteria to be a problem . ''
Michael Adams , professor of entomology at the University of California at Riverside , says he 's never heard of someone dying after consuming roaches . `` Unless the roaches were contaminated with some bacteria or other pathogens , I do n't think that cockroaches would be unsafe to eat , '' Adams told the AP . `` Some people do have allergies to roaches , but there are no toxins in roaches or related insects . ''
The Broward County medical examiner 's office said Tuesday it has sent samples of Archbold 's remains for testing , but results are not expected for another week or two .

All the contestants in the bug-eating competition had signed a waiver acknowledging the risks of illness , adverse reactions and injury associated with eating live insects , the store said .
The live discoid roaches were brought out for the final round of the contest . Luke Lirot , an attorney representing Ben Siegel , the store 's owner , told the Herald that the roaches , which are sold as reptile feed , are “ raised in a sterile container from the time they 're little critters '' and are perfectly safe to eat .
One contestant , Matthew Karwacki , 26 , who won a lesser platinum ball python in the cricket-eating contest , said he ate one roach before tapping out . “ The taste did not suit me , but the texture for sure was the worst part , ” Karwacki told the Herald . “ If you could look inside a dirty gutter and scoop up what 's in there , that 's what went through my head . All the other contestants kept eating roaches , but I had to look away . ”

Sarah Bernard , an entomology student at the University of Florida , shot cellphone video of Archbold during the competition . Bernard said she did not see Archbold immediately after the competition ended . She recalled that an announcer said `` the winner was vomiting somewhere , and we 'll congratulate him when he comes back , '' according to the AP .
Ben Siegel Reptile Store said the prize python , reportedly worth $ 850 , will go to Archbold 's estate .
Archbold 's co-workers at Busch Canvas , which does canvas work for yachts and restaurants , have set up a fund for his daughter , who will turn 7 years old next week , the Palm Beach Post reported .
Archbold 's death has officials at Six Flags Great America in Chicago reviewing whether to continue with its “ Friday Night Feast , ” a weekly contest that invites guests to eat five Madagascar hissing cockroaches , the Chicago-Sun-Times reported .
“ We were sorry to learn about the unfortunate incident at the reptile store in Florida and our hearts go out to the gentleman 's friends and family , ” park officials said Tuesday , according to the Sun-Times . “ We are confident our eating contests are safe as the insects we use are raised specifically for human consumption . Insects are considered a delicacy in many cultures ; however , even though this appears to be an isolated incident , we are reviewing the eating contests at our parks to ensure we maintain a safe environment for our guests . ”

US President Barack Obama has ordered a ban on the export of goods , technology and services to Crimea .
The executive order also imposes new sanctions on Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies .
Mr Obama said the move showed the US would never accept Russia 's annexation of Crimea in March .
Similar measures agreed by the European Union earlier this week came into effect on Saturday . Canada announced its own sanction on Crimea on Friday .
After the peninsula was annexed , pro-Russian separatists took control of parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine in April , and later declared independence .
Some 4,700 people have died and another million have been displaced by fighting in recent months .
On Friday , five Ukrainian soldiers were killed in fighting - the highest death toll since the latest attempt at a ceasefire began on 9 December .
Night Wolves
Mr Obama said in a statement : `` The executive order is intended to provide clarity to US corporations doing business in the region and reaffirm that the United States will not accept Russia 's occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea . ''
In addition to the goods , technology and services ban , US individuals or companies can not now buy any real estate or businesses in Crimea or fund Crimean firms .

The new measures also include sanctions on 24 Ukrainian and Russian individuals and on a number of companies deemed to be destabilising Ukraine .
They include the Russian equity investment group , Marshall Capital Partners , and the Night Wolves biker group , over its involvement in Crimean military action .
The European Union announced its own sanctions against the region on Thursday . All investment in Crimea is banned , as is participation in Russian oil and gas exploration in the Black Sea . European cruise ships will not be able to visit the peninsula 's ports .
But like the EU , Mr Obama said he would not yet impose new sanctions on Russia itself , urging it again to de-escalate the tension in eastern Ukraine .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that `` threatening new sanctions against Russia could undermine the possibility of normal cooperation between our countries for a long time '' .
Mr Obama said : `` I again call on Russia to end its occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea , cease its support to separatists in eastern Ukraine , and fulfil its commitments under the Minsk agreement . ''
The agreement signed by Ukraine and the rebels in Minsk , in Belarus , in September , put in place a ceasefire and set out the terms for a peace process .
However , fighting has continued , with more than 1,000 people killed since then .
The Ukraine crisis began a year ago , when pro-Moscow leader Viktor Yanukovych abandoned an agreement on closer trade ties with EU in favour of closer co-operation with Russia .
This decision sparked pro-EU protests in the capital Kiev , eventually toppling Mr Yanukovych in February . Russia annexed Crimea after his removal .
The plan worked , and the kid stays .
Eighteen-year-old rookie Matthew Tkachuk is expected to play his 10th game with the Calgary Flames Thursday night versus the San Jose Sharks .
Flames coach Glen Gulutzan had some fun delivering the good news , first pointing out some of Tkachuk 's mistakes during the team video session and asking the rookie if he thought his plays were of NHL quality .
Once Tkachuk steps on the ice , he will trigger the first season of his entry-level contract and avoid , for now , a return to the Ontario Hockey League 's London Knights .
The sixth-overall pick of 2016 was being evaluated on a game-by-game basis , serving some time as a healthy scratch . A native of Scottsdale , AZ , and son of famed NHLer Keith , Tkachuk exploded for 107 points in 57 games with the Knights last season and was determined to stick in the NHL .
The power forward has one goal and three assists for four points through nine games . His possession metrics and nasty edge have also been excellent .

If Tkachuk , who has been rooming with Sean Monahan , can hang on with the Flames ' roster through 40 games this season , he will move one year closer to unrestricted free agency and salary arbitration rights .
Tkachuk will join Toronto 's Auston Matthews and Mitchell Marner , Philadelphia 's Ivan Provorov and Travis Konecy , Arizona 's Jacob Chychrun and Florida 's Denis Malgin in a deep crop of entry-level slide candidates to reach the 10-game mark .
LOS ANGELES - AUGUST 9 : Actors William Shatner ( L ) and Leonard Nimoy ( R ) promote the 'Star Trek ' 40th Anniversary on the TV Land network at the Four Seasons hotel August 9 , 2006 in Los Angeles , California . Episodes of the show will air September 8 . ( Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images )
William Shatner took to Twitter on Saturday to express his regret over having to miss Leonard Nimoy 's funeral .
Though the two `` Star Trek '' actors were very close friends , Shatner explained in a series of tweets that he wo n't be able to attend Nimoy 's funeral on Sunday , due to a previous commitment to appear at the Red Cross Ball in Florida Saturday night . Though he will not be present at the funeral , Shatner said he plans to honor Nimoy 's life from afar .
I am currently in FL as I agreed to appear at the Red Cross Ball tonight . Leonard 's funeral is tomorrow . I ca n't make it back in time . — William Shatner ( @ WilliamShatner ) February 28 , 2015
I feel really awful . Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried . — William Shatner ( @ WilliamShatner ) February 28 , 2015
So maybe tomorrow we come together here and celebrate his life . — William Shatner ( @ WilliamShatner ) February 28 , 2015
So let 's spend some time tomorrow celebrating Leonard 's life and remembering the man . — William Shatner ( @ WilliamShatner ) February 28 , 2015
Shatner and Nimoy starred as Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock , respectively , on the `` Star Trek '' television series and in multiple feature films . Nimoy died Friday at his home in Los Angeles , at the age of 83 . Following the announcement of Nimoy 's death , Shatner released a statement expressing love for his longtime friend .
California Democrats used Monday 's swearing-in ceremonies in the State Assembly and State Senate to introduce and pass resolutions condemning President-elect Donald J. Trump 's rhetoric and his anticipated immigration policies .
House Resolution 4 ( HR-4 ) states that “ the Assembly condemns in the strongest terms bigoted , racist or misinformed descriptions of the immigrant community ” and “ urges the President-elect not to pursue mass deportation strategies that needlessly tear families apart to target immigrants for deportation based on value and unjustified criteria . ”
HR-4 , co-authored by Assemblyman Anthony Rendon ( D-Panorama ) , also states : “ … the Assembly implores the President-elect to reject any expansion of the ‘ expedited removal ' process that operates without administrative oversight and robs individuals of due process. ” It also “ urges President-elect to continue President-Obama 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ( DACA ) , which grants ‘ Dreamers ' — people who were brought into the country as children by their parents — a temporary reprieve from deportation . ”
While the resolution correctly points out that “ [ i ] mmigrants have always played an integral part in American history , ” that the Golden State is “ home to more foreign-born residents than anywhere else in the country , ” and that “ [ a ] pproximately one tenth of California 's work force is undocumented , ” it ignores the challenges of large-scale illegal immigration , such as the burden on social and welfare services , increased economic competition among low-skilled workers , national security concerns , and other issues .
A similar resolution was moved through the State Senate by President Pro Tem Kevin de León ( D-Los Angeles ) . The Assembly resolution passed 57 to 14 ; the Senate resolution passed 27 to 3 , with 10 abstentions , according to the San Diego Union Tribune .
The Associated Press reported that two other bills were also introduced Monday :
State Sen. Ben Hueso , D-San Diego , introduced a bill to fund lawyers for immigrants in deportation proceedings , while Assemblyman Rob Bonta , D-Alameda , proposed helping public defenders assess the immigration consequences of criminal convictions .
Republican Assemblyman Travis Allen ( R-Huntington Beach ) responded to the resolutions in a speech accusing Democrats of sowing division and fear :
To everyone watching this today , make no mistake – this resolution was written in the darkness of night with the intention of making a national statement on your behalf without any process , conversation , or transparency . HR 4 is a politically self-serving attempt to cynically stoke fear and anxiety among Californians and the immigrant community – both legal and undocumented – living in California population – which is , in fact , the opposite of what its authors and supporters say they intend . Of course this is a nation of immigrants . Immigrants built America . Their energy and inventiveness , the patriotism with which they have embraced the United States are contributions beyond measure . They , we , have fought and died for American liberties and our way of life . We are all the fresh blood that keeps America young and renewed . But this resolution is n't about recognizing what no one is disputing . Instead , this is reckless demagoguery aimed at instilling fear , at making immigrants needlessly anxious and fearful about their future . It is beneath the dignity of this body . … I stand here today to tell you that our people ARE NOT political props , our hardworking Californian citizens will not be silenced , and our Legislature should not stand for the divisive political play that is being made here today . For this reason , I urge a NO voted on this resolution .

Introduction
The other night , I came across the problem of implementing autovivication in Ruby hashes . The solution I devised exemplifies an elegant and practical use of the Y combinator , and it seemed worth sharing .
For those of you who just want the solution , here it is :
module YCombinator def y_comb ( & generator ) proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } .call ( proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } ) end end class Object include ( YCombinator ) end hash = y_comb { |callback| proc { Hash.new { |h , k| h [ k ] = callback.call } } } .call hash [ ' a ' ] [ ' b ' ] [ ' c ' ] [ 'd ' ] [ ' e ' ] [ ' f ' ] [ ' g ' ] = 1 hash
In Perl , the following line will successfully run :
$ hash { ' a ' } { ' b ' } { ' c ' } = 1 ;
% hash
% hash
$ hash { ' a ' }
even ifwas previously undefined . Perl will automatically setto be an empty hash , it will assignto be a reference to an empty hash , and so on , all automatically . This is called autovivication in Perl : hash and array variables automatically “ come to life ” as necessary . This is incredibly convenient for working with multidimensional arrays , for example .
Ruby , sadly , does not have autovivication ( though not surprisingly , given the structure of the language ) . It does , however , provide a facility for default values of hashes . For example , one could write :
hash = Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = { } } hash [ ' a ' ] [ ' b ' ] = 3
hash [ ' a ' ]
' b '
hash [ ' a ' ] [ ' b ' ] [ ' c ' ] = 3
hash [ ' a ' ] [ ' b ' ]
nil
[ ' c ' ]
in which case Ruby will create an empty hash , assign it to , and set the keyin that new hash to 3 . However , this only works for two levels . This would not work : becausereturns , causing the attempt to accessto fail .
One solution would be to make an even more complicated default procedure :
hash = Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = { } } }
But again , that will fail for even higher dimensions of access .
What is needed is a recursive definition of the default function , one that continues to assign auto-generating hashes to each higher dimension . A standard recursive approach will work :
def make_hash return Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = make_hash } end
make_hash
But this requires that you define and store thefunction somewhere . This is risky : what if someone redefines or deletes the method ? Can it be done without defining any methods , to prevent this problem ?
Luckily , there is a solution made just for this situation : the Y combinator ! There are several good web pages that derive and explain the Y combinator in greater detail ( e.g. , Wikipedia , and a blog post that claims that the Y combinator has “ no practical use ” ! ) , so this will be a brief explanation of how it works .
Say you have a recursive Ruby procedure :
factorial = proc { |arg| if arg.zero ? then 1 else arg * factorial.call ( arg - 1 ) end }
factorial
Right now this procedure relies on the variableto contain the procedure .
We can remove this dependence by passing the recursive call 's procedure as an argument . Instead of writing a function that calculates factorials , we write a function that generates another function that calculates factorials :
factorial_generator = proc { |callback| proc { |arg| if arg.zero ? then 1 else arg * callback.call ( arg - 1 ) end } }
callback
Now we just need to pass the rightto this procedure to implement the recursion .
Imagine what an appropriate callback procedure would look like . When the Y combinator is applied to generator , it should return a procedure that can be called to perform the recursive function ( here , the factorial function ) . Call this function recursive . In the midst of executing recursive , the callback procedure may be executed . If callback is identical to recursive , then we will have successfully implemented a recursive function . So the goal is to design a Y combinator that accepts a generator and produces a procedure that , when executed , will set the generator 's callback to be identical to that same procedure .
Here is the Y combinator implemented in Ruby :
y = proc { |generator| proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } .call ( proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } ) }
proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } }
y = proc { |generator| “ ycombinator-function ” .call ( “ ycombinator-function ” ) }
It is difficult to explain how this works , but here is how I think of it at least . Think of the procedure that reads : as the “ ycombinator-function ” . Now the Y combinator looks like :
Now we pass the generator function to the Y combinator :
recursive = y.call ( factorial_generator )
generator
factorial_generator
recursive = proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) }
generator
factorial_generator
x
and the following things happen . First , thevariable is bound to . Then , the “ ycombinator-function ” is executed with itself as the argument . All that the function does is return another procedure , so the result of calling the Y combinator is the procedure : withbound toandbound to the “ ycombinator-function ” .
Now what happens when we call this resulting function with some arguments ( e.g. , recursive.call ( 5 ) ) ? First , the argument to generator.call is evaluated . But since that argument is x.call ( x ) , and x is bound to the “ ycombinator-function ” , the result is a procedure identical to recursive ! Hence , we have successfully set the callback to what we wanted from above .
Next , the generator procedure is executed , setting recursive to be the callback procedure . This produces the procedure specified by the generator . That procedure is run with the passed arguments . If that generated procedure needs to make a recursive call , it executes the callback procedure , and because the callback procedure is the recursive procedure , this whole cycle repeats itself .
Whew ! Hopefully some of that makes sense . The main point , though , is that :
factorial = y.call ( proc { |callback| proc { |arg| if arg.zero ? then 1 else arg * callback.call ( arg - 1 ) end } } ) factorial.call ( 5 ) # = > 120
will produce a proper factorial procedure , without ever having to store a name for that procedure .
For autovivifying hashes , we start with our regular recursive implementation :
make_hash = proc { Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = make_hash.call } }
proc { |callback| proc { Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = callback.call } } }
module YCombinator def y_comb ( & generator ) proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } .call ( proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } ) end end class Object include YCombinator end
hash = y_comb { |callback| proc { Hash.new { |h , k| h [ k ] = callback.call } } } .call # Now this will work : hash [ ' a ' ] [ ' b ' ] [ ' c ' ] [ 'd ' ] [ ' e ' ] [ ' f ' ] [ ' g ' ] = 1
Now we separate out the named procedure call to produce a generator function : The next step is to implement the Y combinator . Unlike the above explanation , I will make it a method available to all objects rather than a procedure.The autovivifying hash , now , is created by : Congratulations ! You have successfully implemented hash autovivication , without needing to define any external methods or variables . ( Other than the Y combinator , of course . It is possible to do that , though I 'll leave that as an exercise to the reader . )
In writing this , I discovered an unusual “ feature ” of ruby . If you run the code :
x = 1 y = proc { |x| x + 3 } y.call ( 5 )
x
y
it turns out thatis not local to the procedure stored in , but rather is actually identical to the variable outside . I 'm not sure I like this aspect of Ruby , but there it is .
It is possible to implement autovivication of hashes without using the Y combinator but still retaining the safety of having no global variables . Just take advantage of scoping inside procedures :
hash = proc { make_hash = proc { Hash.new { |h , k| h [ k ] = make_hash.call } } make_hash.call } .call
make_hash
This works fine as long as there is no variablealready defined . But this approach uses 33 lexical tokens , and the Y combinator one only uses 31 ( not including the Y combinator itself ) . So there !
Ryan Davis sent me an object-oriented implementation of autovivication :
class AVHash < Hash def initialize super { |h , k| h [ k ] = AVHash.new } end end
This is probably the best approach if you need to make many autovivifying hashes . This is what I like about Ruby : there are so many ways to do things , and they are all surprisingly elegant .
A comment on this article on Hacker News observed that my implementation was vulnerable to someone overwriting the Y combinator method that I defined in Object . This is partially correct : if someone overwrites the y_comb method , then uses of that method afterwards may fail , although already created ( “ combinated ” ? ) procedures will work fine . But , more importantly , notice that defining of the Y combinator is actually unnecessary to define the Y combinator at all . You could just define and run it all in one go :
hash = proc { |generator| proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } .call ( proc { |x| proc { | * args| generator.call ( x.call ( x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } ) } .call ( proc { |callback| proc { Hash.new { |h , k| h [ k ] = callback.call } } } ) .call
The commenter is right , though , in that the Y combinator should n't really be necessary in most modern production languages used by coders of reasonable skill—though I see no reason not to use it if the opportunity presents itself and it is documented properly ( consider linking to this article ! ) .
The commenter also expressed difficulty in understanding this article , as well as the Y combinator in general . If it is any consolation , it took me three full days before I managed to wrap my head around it . This is tricky stuff , but that 's what makes the best brain exercise .
In a 2014 national survey , the number of kids with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) appeared to skyrocket , jumping nearly 80 percent from 2011-2013 figures . But the increase is likely due to changes in the way parents and guardians were surveyed , according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The new survey may capture a more accurate count of ASD cases , now estimated to be about 1 in 45 kids . In previous surveys , some of those cases may have been clumped into cases of other developmental delays , the authors report .
The prevalence of developmental disabilities , which includes ASD , other developmental delays , and intellectual disabilities , was unchanged between the 2011-2013 data and that of 2014 . But the cases of developmental delays dropped between the periods almost as much as ASD cases rose .
The 2014 survey found that 2.24 percent of children aged 3 to 17 have autism ( that 's about 1 in 45 ) , while 2011-2013 survey data found an average prevalence of 1.25 percent ( or 1 in 80 ) .
Meanwhile , the prevalence of other developmental delays decreased nearly 67 percent from a prevalence of 4.84 percent to 3.57 percent in kids . And the prevalence of overall developmental disabilities stayed about the same with 5.75 percent in 2011-2013 and 5.76 percent in 2014 .
The survey changes included adding a specific question about ASD , mentioning specific conditions within the definition of ASD , such as Asperger 's disorder , and reordering the questions . In past surveys , autism was included in a 10-condition checklist that followed a question about developmental delays .
The authors surmised that part of the old survey 's problem may have been the order , since ASD is a type of developmental delay . “ After reporting their child 's ASD , parents likely assume ( correctly , it is worth noting ) that the next question about other [ developmental delays ] is asking about something other than ASD , and , therefore , should not be endorsed unless another non-ASD ( and non- [ intellectual disability ] ) developmental delay was diagnosed , ” they wrote .
The new estimates are more in line with those of other CDC-supported ASD surveillance systems , such as the National Survey for Children 's Health , the authors report .
Researchers at the University of Thessaly discovered that Greece experienced a 35 % spike in suicide rates during 2010 and 2012 , with unemployment and the expanding debt crisis in large part responsible for the rise .
Greece 's economy has been in a tailspin for years , exacerbated by extremely large welfare programs and spending on events such as the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics . During the years the scientists studied , however , the Greek government began to implement austerity measures to reduce the national debt and make payments to the European Union , which resulted in increasing unemployment rates , particularly among working class men .
The scientists found that the suicide rate among men between 20 and 59 years of age in the two-year span increased from 6.56 to 8.81 per 100,000 men . “ We observed that each 1 percentage point rise of unemployment rates in men aged 20 to 59 was associated with a 0.19/100,000 population rises in suicide , ” explained Dr. George Rachiotis , who led the study , calling it a “ significant correlation . ”
The scientists allege that austerity measures to reduce spending contributed to the rise in unemployment and , thus , suicide . It does not present an alternative to these measures , however , and the current Greek government has refused to cut spending .
The study echoes the results of a similar project published in the British Medical Journal in February that found an extra 11.2 suicides began occurring every month between 2010 and 2012 . “ The introduction of austerity measures in June 2011 marked the start of a significant , sharp , and sustained increase in suicides , to reach a peak in 2012 , ” a statement released by the University of Pennsylvania and Edinburgh University stated .
While experts do not attribute the Greek debt crisis , which continues well into this day , to any one factor in particular , spending is considered a significant contributor to the nation 's economic woes . Another factor is the nation 's chronic inability to generate sufficient funding to pay for this spending . The Wall Street Journal noted at the end of 2014 that Greece had not received $ 86 billion in unpaid taxes from individuals , a deficit that has made a clear impact on the nation .
Despite debate over the origins of the problem , negotiators continue to seek ways to keep Greece in the Eurozone while not forcing the rest of Europe to pay for the nation 's existence . Greece is expected to make a payment to the European Union and the IMF on June 30 , and has already confirmed it does not have the money to do so . Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras remains in Brussels , renegotiating terms for a new loan to be able to pay the June 30 installment . “ We 're expecting the payment to be made June 30 , ” said IMF spokesman Gerry Rice today , though all parties confirmed no deal had been stuck in talks today .
The EU and IMF have insisted that Greece implement austerity measures to decrease spending and generate more revenue , making it possible for the country to repay its debt . Tsipras and his party , the Coalition of the Radical Left ( Syriza ) , have refused .
Tsipras gave reporters a thumbs-up motion as he left talks today .

A Turing Machine
Quick Introduction
In Alan Turing 's 1936 paper on computable numbers , he presented a thought experiment . Turing describes a machine that has an infinitely long tape upon which it writes , reads and alters symbols . He further shows that a machine with the correct minimal set of operations can calculate anything that is computable , no matter the complexity .
My goal in building this project was to create a machine that embodied the classic look and feel of the machine presented in Turing 's paper . I wanted to build a machine that would be immediately recognizable as a Turing machine to someone familiar with Turing 's work .
Although this Turing machine is controlled by a Parallax Propeller microcontroller , its operation while running is based only on a set of state transformations loaded from an SD card and what is written to and read from the tape . While it may seem as if the tape is merely the input and output of the machine , it is not ! Nor is the tape just the memory of the machine . In a way the tape is the computer . As the symbols on the tape are manipulated by simple rules , the computing happens . The output is really more of an artifact of the machine using the tape as the computer .
The heart of the turing machine is the read-write head . The read-write head transports the tape and positions cells of the tape appropriately . It can read a cell determining what , if any , symbol is written there . The machine works on , and knows about , only one cell at a time . The tape in my machine is a 1000 ' roll of white 35mm film leader . The characters , ones and zeros , are written by the machine with a black dry-erase marker .
Video Overview
The following video is an overview of the machine and its components . There is a lot more information in other parts of the site including hardware and software details , as well as video examples of it running some common Turing machine code .
While I have taken some liberty with a number of terms and concepts , I hope you can see just how simple the rules that drive a Turing machine are . Changing ones to zeros , moving one cell to the left or right , these concepts are simple , yet they can compute anything that is computable . And from these simple concepts , the most complex computers of today are born .
That glassware is just to snazzy for my liking however any glass will do the job as long as it 's made of glass . I 'll take the chance of being hit over the head with one any day compared to the alternative of drinking out of plastics like a child .
Next is my favorite part of the event , the pour . Each barman has his own little style however if they know what they are doing they will take their time . A proper Guinness should take just over second to pour and settle so except no substitutes .
The first thing the barman should do is hold the glass at a 45-degree angle as close as possible to the tap and push forward on the bar handle . He should do this for about 1-seconds until the flow from the tap goes from creamy to dark black . Immediately after it turns black he should hold the glass at the same angle and pull back on the handle letting the Guinness flow through whilst constantly minimizing the distance between the tap and the glass .
As the Guinness level rise 's he should balance out the glass slowly decreasing the angle it 's held at until stopping pouring it so the Guinness level is online with the top of the harp you see on the glass .
After this the Guinness should be gently put down and left for about 70 seconds until the Guinness has fully settled . An ametuer barman will use this time to stare at the glass whilst the customer nervously prays the barman does n't get impatient and top up the drink to early . An expert will use this time to go and serve someone else or take money off the customer .
When the Guinness is ready to be topped up ( about seconds ) slowly lift it towards the tap and again push forwards but not all the way forward . Minimize the fall distance and let the rest of the Guinness fall into the glass without causing much disturbance so it need not settle again .
Do not draw a shamrock ( piss in the pint as the Belfast locals call it ) but gently hand over the pint to the customer . The top of the pint should be free of any bubbles and with as smooth a head as possible .
For the customer , many people make the mistake of sipping the head off the Guinness and then drinking the rest . Do not do this . Instead hold the glass at a high enough angle so the black stuff flows underneath the head into your mouth and the head never gets drunk . This also leaves you with a beautiful 'Guinness Mustache ' on your top lip which can be licked away , or else everyone can pose for a photo with their Guinness Mustaches if they are tourists .
So it does n't matter if you 're drinking your Guinness this St.Patricks day in the streets of Dublin or the gutters of New York , make sure your drink is treated with the respect it deserves .
In honor of the greatest of all holidays , St. Patrick 's day , today I 'm going to be talking about a subject very close to my heart - Guinness.Guinness is probably my favorite drink there is . It 's too thick for me to enjoy more than a couple of pints at a time , but I do know people who would drink it all day and be none the worse for it . It 's a tough drink to get into , very often people will have their first Guinness in the wrong place and this will ruin their experience of it for ever . I know friends who on the spur of the moment have ordered one in a nightclub and got a plastic pint glass filled with the mysterious brown liquid . So sour and repulsive they never finished it swearing to never drink Guinness again.However , order a Guinness in the right place where the barman has all the intricateness of a well choreographed and exactly time dance and it will be a hugely rewarding experience.Now , it goes without saying that the best Guinness is going to be found on the island of Ireland . The fresher it is the nicer it 's going to taste . However it 's still very possible to get an excellent pint across Europe as long as they serve a lot of the stuff.Any bar that only serves a few pints of Guinness a day is going to be serving a revolting drink . The best bars will go through a keg of Guinness from the time you enter to the time you leave and this means it 's always fresh.Nextly , the glassware is very important . I 'm actually not a fan of Guinness 's new glass as you can see below :
Rwanda must `` immediately end any support '' for M23 rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the United States said Tuesday , after a report from Human Rights Watch blamed the rebels for numerous rapes and summary executions .

The United States Tuesday toughened its tone against Rwanda , demanding it withdraw troops from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and end support to M23 rebels accused of atrocities there .
In its strongest comments to date against Rwandan leaders , Washington said there was `` a credible body of evidence '' linking top Rwandan officials to the rebels who have brought months of terror to the central African country .
`` We call upon Rwanda to immediately end any support to the M23 , withdraw military personnel from eastern DRC and follow through on its commitments , '' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters .
Her comments came after a damning report by Human Rights Watch and ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on the Great Lakes meeting to be chaired in New York on Thursday by US Secretary of State John Kerry .
The HRW report found M23 rebels have summarily executed some 44 people and raped 61 women and girls since March 2013 in eastern DR Congo .
Residents had reported regular movements of men dressed in Rwandan army uniforms into Congo , while food , ammunition and other supplies were coming from Rwanda to the M23 .
`` Not only is Rwanda allowing its territory to be used by the abusive M23 to get recruits and equipment , but the Rwandan military is still directly supporting the M23 , '' said Daniel Bekele , Africa director at Human Rights Watch .
`` This support is sustaining an armed group responsible for numerous killings , rapes and other serious abuses . ''
The M23 are Tutsi fighters formerly of the Rwanda-backed rebel group National Congress for the Defense of the People , or CNDP .
They were integrated into DR Congo 's regular army in 2009 as part of a peace deal following their failed 2008 offensive on the eastern city of Goma .
Rwanda has long denied any complicity in the violence , with Rwandan President Paul Kagame -- a US ally -- last year dismissing the allegations made by the UN and various human rights groups as `` ridiculous . ''
Psaki said : `` We believe there is a credible body of evidence that supports the key findings of the Human Rights Watch report , including support by senior Rwandan officials to the M23 and of Rwandan military personnel in the DRC . ''
She refused to say whether there had been any direct contact between the US administration and Kigali following the release of the HRW report on Monday , but she said the State Department 's views were shared by the White House .
Last year the US froze $ 200,000 of military aid to Kigali amid concerns over support for M23 rebels but did not go as far as accusing the Rwandan military and officials of specific involvement .
Fresh fighting raged in the DR Congo 's restive east for several hours Monday as army helicopters attacked positions of the M23 rebels , who fired mortars in return , both sides said .
The latest clashes in the central African country 's mineral-rich but conflict-torn east broke four days of relative calm , further damaging a tattered truce that had lasted from late May , when UN chief Ban Ki-moon visited the region , until July 14 .

Suggestion : When Trying To Quash A Subpoena To Reveal Your Identity ... Do n't Use Your Real Name
from the just-a-suggestion dept
Comcast notified its subscriber in this case , one Mr. Simko , of Worldwide Film Entertainment 's efforts to learn Mr. Simko 's identity .
And here 's the part that makes this little vignette so charming : rather than challenge the plaintiff 's efforts to unmask his identity , Mr. Simko filed a motion to quash the subpoena USING HIS REAL NAME .
The court denied the motion to quash . The basis for denying the motion is kind of an aside ( the motion to quash phase was not the right time to challenge venue or knowledge of the infringement ) .
What 's noteworthy about the case is Mr. Simko 's decision to voluntarily waive his anonymity . Not only did he challenge the subpoena using his own name , he filed as an exhibit the letter he got from Comcast notifying him of the subpoena . Right there , in all caps and as plain as day were Simko 's name and address for all to see .
There have been plenty of cases where a person or company gets a subpoena to try to identify an anonymous online person -- such as in various file sharing cases . It 's also not uncommon for those anonymous internet people to fight the subpoena , and it 's quite possible to do so anonymously . Apparently , no one informed that to one guy who decided to fight a subpoena by Worldwide Film Entertainment over an alleged attempt to file share the movie . Apparently , in filing the challenge , the guy used his real name and address Oops .

KERI : Social and environmental activists from various parts of North Goa assembled at Laxmibai memorial hall , Valpoi , for a meeting organized by Sattari Patrakar Sangh , to vehemently oppose the undemocratic attitude of protestors in North Karnataka , who resorted to violent behaviour , as they demanded early implementation of the Kalsa Bhandura project.Speaking at the meeting , Sakhali MLA Pramod Sawant said , `` The acts of miscreants burning a KTC bus at Hubbali , staging a rasta rook , organzing bandhs and then shouting slogans against the state of Goa , are indeed undemocratic and totally uncalled for ; that too , when the matter is pending before the tribunal and states are pleading their cases . We have not yet resorted to violence and maintained peace and patience . The Mhadei river is our lifeline and our government will take all necessary steps to protect the interest of Goans . `` Shivaji Desai , an advocate from Brahma-Karmali , said , `` There is urgent need to create awareness regarding the importance of River Mhadei and serious implications of the Kalsa-Bhandura project on Goa . Every gram sabha should pass resolutions opposing the construction of a dam and the diversion plans of Karnataka . Members of all political parties should unite and unanimously take a decision to oppose Karnataka 's project . `` Madhu Gaonkar , from Khandola , Ponda , spoke about how the fresh water flow from the Mhadei sustains the Mandovi . `` Like other rivers in Goa , the Mandovi river is affected by the tides from the Arabian Sea . The distance of salinity of rivers in Goa is about 30kms upstream , necessitating the dire need of fresh water inflow from the Ghat region bordering Goa . If the fresh water flow is reduced , as would happen , if the project for diverting the Mhadei river is permitted , the entire ecology and livelihood of Goa will be critically affected , '' said Gaonkar.Ganesh Parwar , a leader of Dalit movement in Pilgao , Bicholim , claimed that the reduction of water level in River Mandovi will hamper its navigability and mineral ore transportation through the river will be affected badly . `` This river is like a mother for Goans as it sustains life and livelihood , '' he said . `` Presently , 85MLD water treatment plants rely on the Mhadei . If Karnataka 's plans materialize , we will be deprived of our water resources , '' said Rajesh Gaonkar , a BJP leader from Shiranguli , Sattari .
Another week of Windows 10 news has bypassed us with the blink of an eye . This week kicked off with news of torrent trackers banning Windows 10 users due to privacy concerns . The controversy regarding Windows 10 and privacy originates from Microsoft 's Services Agreement , which was recently updated to allow the company to download software updates and configuration changes that may prevent people from playing counterfeit games . The agreement does not go into specifics — which is likely why this paranoia came to be . The agreement does not even explicitly include Windows 10 , rather it includes your Microsoft Account , Xbox Live , and Windows Store content .
Microsoft announced this week that Windows 10 had reached 75 million installs worldwide , which means Windows 10 is one of the fastest growing operating systems in history . From a combination of both official and non-official reports , we 've seen Windows 10 hit 14 million installations by July 31st , 25 million installations by August 7th , and 50 million installations by August 14th . These stats rightfully create buzz among fans and the media but for the most part these have been unofficial reports . Now , Microsoft has revealed nine official stats about Windows 10 . All of these were tweeted by Yusef Mehdi and have been compiled in a Windows blog post . They are n't all groundbreaking but here are a few notable highlights other than 75 million downloads .
Also this week , Microsoft released a new Windows Insider build for fast ringed insiders , which introduced improvements to right-click context menu 's and the ability to share feedback with social networks . That 's all for the major new additions , but there are undoubtedly new under-the-hood fixes thrown in too . Let us know in the comments section below whether you will be installing this new build and what you think of the progress being made on Windows 10 so far . You can check for updates via WU now to download the build if you have n't already .
Finally , Microsoft pushed out three new updates for the Windows 10 RTM this week , fixing a number of issues users have been experiencing since Windows 10 launched . As of right now , it is unclear what the updates entail , as there is changelog accompanying them . The cumulative updates read , KB3081449 , KB3081452 , and KB3081448 . Without specific call outs or detailed change logs , it seems safe to assume these updates are probably bug fixes in nature.Windows 10 is arguably considered to be in rough development for some . Check almost any forum or comment section and the pages of complaints , missing features or borked functionality seem limitless . However , the Windows team seems poised to respond quickly to growing complaints and demands as they have issued several updates addressing specific issues as well tailoring fixes for others .
That 's all this week , what was your favorite story ? Let us know below .

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Defense said Thursday that an American citizen has surrendered to the Syrian Democratic Forces and was turned over to U.S. forces .
U.S. military officials said earlier that a man believed to be an American citizen who was fighting with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) militants surrendered in Syria .
The Department of Defense said in a statement to CBS News that a U.S. citizen who surrendered to SDF `` on or around '' Sept. 12 is now `` being legally detained by Department of Defense personnel as a known enemy combatant . ''
According to `` 60 Minutes , '' an estimated 260 Americans have joined -- or tried to join -- terrorists overseas . CBS News ' Scott Pelley spoke to Abdirizak Warsame , a Minneapolis man who was sentenced to two and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS . Warsame said the beliefs espoused in ISIS promotional videos `` kind of takes control of you . ''
`` You think you 're doing something for a greater cause , '' Warsame said . `` And you think you 're doing it for good . ''
An unexpected choice of product has been used in this water installation
Luzinterruptus - the anonymous art collective - has created an intriguing and striking installation to evoke the importance of water .
Using an unusual choice of material , the Spanish group showcased the vital need for water with an 'Interactive Rain ' concept .
In fact , the material used was 3,000 condoms . That 's right : various sizes ( though mostly extra-large ) of the common condom were the basis for this installation .
The condoms were filled with blue water and lighted before being strung from the ceiling . This formed a cubic space that people could walk through as they entered the Totally Thames festival .
The condoms are conveniently the correct size and shape for creating the large droplets of water , but in addition to that the artists said :
'We thought this as being conceptually appropriate , as condoms are designed to preserve in them the true source of life ... '
One of the issues the artists faced when setting up was when the odd wasp would pierce and burst the extra-strength condoms , making the task that much more difficult and tedious .
The aim was to highlight the importance of water - aligning with the Totally Thames festival water theme - particularly at a time when , 'it is abhorrent to privatise it [ water ] and trade it for the profit of just a few ' , said Luzinterruptus .
This installation took place at the Totally Thames festival in London during September 2014 at Watermans Arts Centre . It was a recreation from its initial instalment in Campo de la Cebada , Madrid , in 2013 .

FX Awards 2015 : A snapshot of the evening
For a long time , women have fought -- and are still fighting -- to overcome gender roles and expectations . However , it 's important to remember that rigid ideas about what men and women `` should '' or `` should n't '' do is n't just bad for women .
Here are 11 of our favorite answers :
1 . Have more stylish clothing options . As bradleynowell252 pointed out , `` Girls just get so many choices on nice things to wear and still look good , even in a casual manner . '' It 's true that while women can wear `` masculine '' clothing free of judgment , the same can not be said for men in `` feminine '' clothing . `` Also , fancy hats . It 's a shame that only women get to have awesome adornments in their headwear without any social stigma , '' lokiikol noted .
2 . Be able to talk about other men being attractive . Kbjami brought up an important point when he wrote : `` Talking about how hot Brad Pitt is . I 'm not gay but I find Brad Pitt quite attractive . Actually just talking about how attractive males are in general . '' We completely agree , men should definitely be able to compliment other men . And Brad Pitt is very attractive .
3 . Order `` girly drinks . '' `` For just once , I 'd like to get to order yummy pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like but ca n't order because they 'll be made fun of , '' responded Reddit user Dwarf -- shortage . We think everyone should be able to drink Flirtinis , Mudslides and Fuzzy Navels -- they 're delicious !
4 . Get treated to a spa day . We can all agree that there are few places more relaxing than a spa . So why is it only socially acceptable for women to attend these heaven-on-earth establishments ? Euphuist said that he would love to get a `` Mani/pedi , face mask , all that jazz . Colour me intrigued . ''
5 . Carry a purse . Emmy_Bee was one of the first to comment : `` Not gon na lie . A purse would be hella convenient . '' And Riverchimp pointed out some of the exciting things one could carry around in a purse : `` Could you imagine how much beer you could fit in a purse ? Probably 8 cans . 8 friggin cans ! With you all the time ! ''
6 . Dance like no one 's watching . Sadly , rigid gender roles even follow men to the dance floor . As Charbok wrote , `` When I get drunk I love to dance like a girl . I 'm a big fan of twerking . I also like to dance with my arms up , like in a girly way . ''
7 . Wear makeup . Although the politics of beauty culture are quite complicated , and no one should feel compelled to wear makeup all the time , it can be a really fun way to express oneself . Unfortunately , men rarely have the option of wearing makeup without judgment . As RamsesThePigeon noted , `` I 'm a decent-looking guy , but a little eyeliner and some foundation could still work wonders for me . ''
8 . Get pampered by women . Chivalry and tradition teach young men they should buy meals and movie tickets , but many responded that they would like to be wined and dined once in awhile . We agree with kbjami on this one , `` I also love flowers and think girls should also buy men flowers . '' While no one -- man or woman -- enjoys being ditched after a drink , Radiationshield had a point when he wrote : `` Get a girl to pay for my drink , then disappear like a phantom in the night . ''
9 . Wear yoga pants . Baseballwiz definitely said it best : `` Wear yoga pants . I 've worn them in private before . it feels like kittens hugging your legs . ''
10 . Have fun with one 's children without being judged . Chairforceveteran put it perfectly when he wrote :
When walking through a parking lot , holding my daughter 's hand , we usually skip . I get the dirty looks from men and women alike . I 'm making my kid happy , why so much hate ? Also , when my oldest was 4 ish , she asked me to wear a headband with kitty ears so we would match . We went to iHop and a dude would not stop staring at me .
Adolf Hitler commits suicide as Reichstag burns
Now he has done it , the bastard . Too bad he could not be taken alive .
This was the reported reaction of Stalin when he heard of Hitler 's suicide . For a long time the Soviets claimed that Hitler had simply taken poison , which in their eyes made it an even more ‘ unworthy death ' , even though they had access to the closest witnesses to the incident .
The Soviet authorities were able to build up a detailed picture of events because they were interrogating Hitler 's personal aide and valet , Heinz Linge . The final report was presented to Stalin on his 70th birthday in 1949 :
In front of the open armour-plated door to the antechamber stood Gunsche with SS-Obersturmfuhrer Frick , who was on duty that day . It was now a few minutes to four . As Linge walked past Gunsche , he remarked , ‘ I think it 's over , ' and quickly went into the antechamber . There he smelled gunpowder , as if from a shot . He rushed out of the antechamber and unexpectedly ran into Bormann , who was standing , with his head hanging , next to the door to the conference room , his hand resting on the table . Linge reported to Bormann that there was a smell of gunpowder in Hitler 's antechamber . Bormann stood up straight and together with Linge he dashed into Hitler 's study . Linge opened the door and walked in with Bormann . They were presented with the following picture : on the left-hand side of the sofa sat Hitler . He was dead . Next to him was a dead Eva Braun . In Hitler 's right temple gaped a bullet wound the size of a Pfennig and two streams of blood ran down his check . On the carpet next to the sofa a puddle of blood the size of a plate had formed . The wall and the sofa were bespattered with blood . Hitler 's right hand lay palm the uppermost on his knee . The left hung at his side . Next to Hitler 's right foot lay a 7.65mm Walther pistol , and next to his left foot a 6.35mm of the same make . Hitler wore his grey tunic emblazoned with the Gold Party Badge , the Iron Cross First Class and the Wounded Badge of the First World War — as he had done constantly in recent days . He was wearing a white shirt with a black tie , black trousers , black socks and black leather slippers . Eva Braun 's legs were drawn up under her on the sofa . Her brightly coloured high-heeled shoes lay on the ﬂoor . Her lips were firmly pressed together . She had poisoned herself with cyanide . Bormann rushed out into the antechamber to call the SS men who were to carry the two bodies out into the garden . From the antechamber Linge fetched the blankets he had left there to wrap Hitler up in and spread one of them on the study ﬂoor . With the help of Bormann , who had come back again , he laid Hitler 's still-warm body on the ground and wrapped him in the blanket .
See The Hitler Book : The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalin from the Interrogations of Otto Guensche and Heinze Linge , Hitler 's Closest Personal Aides
Hitler and Braun 's corpses were carried out of the bunker and placed just two metres away from the emergency exit to the bunker , they could not go any further into the garden because Soviet shells were bursting in the area , and the Reichstag and nearby buildings were on fire . Two hundred litres of benzine were poured on the bodies but it was difficult to light the fire because of the wind whipped up by the burning city . Once lit the funeral party had to move quickly back inside because the flames were so close to the door .
It was not until the early hours of the following day that German radio made the announcement of his death :
It has been reported from the Fuehrer 's headquarters that our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler has died this afternoon in his battle headquarters at the Reich Chancellery , fallen for Germany , fighting to the last breath against Bolshevism . On the 30th of April the Fuehrer nominated Grossadmiral Doenitz to be his successor . The Grossadmiral and Fuehrer 's successor will speak to the German nation. ” Doenitz : “ German men and women , soldiers of the German Armed Forces ! Our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler is dead . The German people bow in the deepest sorrow and respect . Early , he had recognized the terrible danger of Bolshevism , and had dedicated his life to the fight against it . His fight having ended , he died a hero 's death in the capital of the German Reich , after having led an unmistakably straight and steady life .
The deaths were a signal to many other dedicated Nazis to decide their fate . Goebbels and his wife had decided to kill not only themselves but their six children as well , although they delayed until the following day . By then there was insufficient benzene left for their bodies to be completely burnt .
Cocktail connoisseurs should be on alert . There could be an aromatic kick missing from your next manhattan or pink gin . The world is suffering an acute shortage of angostura bitters , the herbal concoction used to give an extra twist of flavour to classic alcoholic drinks .
Bars are struggling to replenish supplies of angostura following a shutdown at the sole manufacturer , a recession-hit firm in Trinidad and Tobago .
Made from a secret recipe of herbs , barks , roots , spices and rum , bitters became popular in Britain as an additive for gin , partly to conceal quinine in tonic water .
In the UK the website of angostura 's main importer , WB Distribution , says the product is completely sold out .
Trinidad 's House of Angostura has blamed a shortage in ingredients and a financial restructuring . The firm is owned by CL Financial , a Caribbean conglomerate hit by a liquidity crisis , prompting an emergency bailout earlier this year by the government of Trinidad and Tobago .
Patrick Sepe , chief executive of the US distributor , Angostura USA , said the production line ran dry in June and was only just getting back on track . `` There has been a shortage , '' said Sepe . `` You ca n't just turn on and off supply of bitters . It 's not like producing bottled water – it 's a very delicate , intricate process . ''
Invented in 1824 , angostura was named after a town in Venezuela where a German doctor , Johann Siegert , came up with the recipe as a stomach tonic to ease tropical ailments among soldiers .
Bereft of the classic bitter , certain bars have now turned to alternatives , including supplies from a German company , The Bitter Truth .
`` A lot of bars are not happy , '' said Mark Ludmon , editor of Bar magazine . `` Any bar that 's trying to do cocktails seriously will feel it 's wrong not to use the right bitters . ''
Once owned by the rum firm Bacardi , the House of Angostura was sold in 1997 to CL Financial , which has failed to respond to requests for comment . According to Trinidad 's Newsday newspaper , CL leveraged Angostura 's profits against a series of acquisitions including a deal to buy control of a Jamaican industrial company , Lascelles deMercado . It was reportedly left with a TT $ 600m ( £57m ) hole in its balance sheet .
Tony Conigliaro , an award-winning cocktail inventor and owner of 69 Colebrooke Row , a bar in Islington , north London , said he had stockpiled angostura after learning of the shortage . He described bitters as a crucial finishing agent in well-mixed drinks : `` What bitters will do is stretch the rest of the flavours across the palate . ''
Distributors say the US is the world 's biggest consumer of Aangostura bitters , drinking the equivalent of about 750,000 four-ounce bottles or equivalents annually .
Sepe said he hoped supplies would improve in time for Christmas , as shipments are just beginning to resume from the Caribbean : `` There have been a lot of rumours that we 're going out of business and that people will never see Aangostura bitters again . I want to be clear that is not the case . ''
We 've reached the first international break and two weeks without ( proper ) football having had a twice weekly hit throughout August . Before the withdrawals set in , it 's time to reflect on the start that we 've made and have a look at some of the issues that have arisen . 4 points from 5 games…sitting 21st – ready for a season long relegation battle right ? Well , we know that the league table can often lie , especially so in such a small sample of games . Instead , we can get a better idea of our performances by having a look at some of the underlying stats .
To do so , we 'll delve into Ben Mayhew ‘ s expected goal numbers . Overall , we have expected goal totals of 5.9 for and 6.9 against , compared to our actual totals of 5 and 9 respectively . This suggests we 've been a little unfortunate at both ends of the pitch . Even so , an expected goal difference of -1 puts us 17th in the xG table , which is n't exactly setting the world alight or meeting Leeds ' expectations . However , when we look at the match by match breakdown , one of these things is not like the others :
QPR 1.7 ( +Pen ) – 0.3 Leeds
Leeds 1.1 – 1.1 Birmingham
Leeds 1.6 – 1.4 Fulham
Sheff Wed 1.3 – 1.8 Leeds
Nott 'm Forest 1.4 – 1.1 Leeds
The QPR was a complete aberration . Truly , truly really bad . However , since then all the games have been relatively even . Against Birmingham and Fulham we had two even games . We were better in patches whilst the opposition dominated other parts . 1 point from these 2 games is just the cookie crumbling against us a little . The two following away games are 2 more relatively tight games , shading the Wednesday one and being shaded in the Forest one . Leaving the QPR game aside ( I did some analysis of that game 's problems in this Twitter thread ) , there 's no need for hysteria around the club . We 're doing OK and whilst we 're not turning up and dominating teams , we are a little unfortunate to be going into the break with just 4 points given these performances . Some of the talk from fans saying that Monk must go is completely fucking nuts , in my opinion . It 's too early to judge what he 's doing and things have n't really been that bad either .
Now we 've all calmed down , we can look at some of the things that are going wrong , and some that are going right . On the plus side , we look a threat going forward , we 've added a heap of attacking players to our ranks this summer and they look pretty good . Marcus Antonsson has very intelligent movement and decent technical ability . Hadi Sacko reminds me of an early Max Gradel , with great pace and skill but a lack of composure and final ball whilst Kemar Roofe has caused problems with his direct running . Pablo Hernandez introduced himself as a complete magician with his debut against Fleetwood , and has since been played out of position ( more on this later ) . On the negatives , we are pretty darn terrible at defending set pieces . We gifted a goal 3 minutes in to QPR , and 2 more against Forest ( in a game where we were otherwise the better team ) all from corners . I 'll be looking into our set piece defence in more detail in another post .
The other negative has been our ditching of the 4231 formation that Monk used at Swansea and we used in pre-season and the first 2 games . Since the Birmingham game we 've gone for a 442 formation and I think if we persevere down this route , then we 'll end up not fulfilling the potential of the squad . The home games saw Pablo Hernandez slot into the midfield 2 and whilst this was a great use of his playmaking abilities , we were left horribly exposed on the counter , like this Birmingham goal :
Oh well that 's fine I hear you say , just do n't play Hernandez in central midfield . Since the signing of Bridcutt we have n't , but then we a different problem : missing his playmaking through the centre of the park . Against Forest we played him on the left , and failed to get the ball into advanced central areas , being consistently forced wide and crossing ( which is a low % strategy ) . This is neatly illustrated by our touch map vs Forest ( we 're attacking from right to left ) :
Yikes , that lack of blue dots in the circled area is exactly why we need to be playing someone in the 10 position , and we have 2 good AMs at the club already in Hernandez and Mowatt , but since we 're trying to shoehorn 2 strikers into the team we play them wide or not at all . The answer my friends is to revert to the 4231 for which we have the requisite players , since that is how we planned to play when making our signings . Let me illustrate the choices for each position :
Now the choices you make will depend on the game . Sometimes we 'll need our 10 to do more defensive work and so pick Mowatt ahead of Hernandez . Sometimes we 'll need pace and movement to expose immobile defenders and pick Antonsson , whilst other times we can use Wood 's height . We 're probably a winger short but if injuries hit we have enough versatility in the full backs to push one forward . We have the squad for 4231 and it provides us with both balance against the counter and solves the Pablo Hernandez problem .
I 'm still optimistic about the season , we have both the best squad and best manager in years . The only thing that can screw it up is Cellino 's trigger finger , so let 's not give him any encouragement . MOT

Sigma Alpha Mu Suspended Following ENG student 's death and reports of “ severe intoxication ”
The evening after the death on Saturday of freshman Anthony Barksdale II , a new member of the BU chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu ( SAM ) , the fraternity was suspended by Sigma Alpha Mu 's national leadership , based in Indianapolis , Ind . Yesterday afternoon , the University also suspended the chapter , following what Dean of Students Kenneth Elmore calls “ reports of underage drinking and severe intoxication ” at an unregistered off-campus fraternity event .
Barksdale ( ENG'16 ) was pronounced dead at St. Elizabeth 's Medical Center after being transported from an apartment at 22 Wadsworth St. in Allston , where a SAM function had been held . Boston EMS responded to a call at that address shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday .
Elmore ( SED'87 ) says his office was told on Saturday by Alex Cuetara ( COM'13 ) , president of the BU chapter , that someone had left a fraternity function severely intoxicated . Cuetara also told the staff member that the national organization had recommended suspending all activities of the BU chapter .
Elmore says he confirmed the SAM suspension with Leland Manders , executive director of the national organization , who told him the action was taken because of reports of intoxication at the party and concern that the fraternity “ risk management ” policies may have been violated . Elmore says risk management policies usually address such things as alcohol abuse .
Manders told Elmore that the Saturday event was “ a meet and greet for new members , ” and was attended by approximately 41 current members and 6 new members of the fraternity .
“ We believe that there were a number of brothers making introductions to new members , ” Elmore says . The off-campus private residence was rented by fraternity members , he says , and the event was not registered with the University .
Elmore says his initial investigation reveals that the fraternity conducted a function at which there may have been underage drinking and severe intoxication . “ Based on that and the action of the national organization , ” he says , “ we have suspended the fraternity . ”
Manders also told BU Today that the BU chapter was suspended because of a “ concern about a risk management violation . ”
“ We need to find out what happened on Friday evening and determine if there was a policy violation and how bad that violation may have been , ” says Manders , who met Monday afternoon with Elmore . “ We will work in partnership with the University offices to determine if the chapter can continue in the future and under what circumstances it continues . ”
Leadership of the organization is “ very saddened by the loss of Tony Barksdale , ” Manders says . “ We are very concerned about our members . We want to help them through this very difficult period . ”
The University 's alcohol policies have been discussed many times with the leadership of SAM and other leaders of the Greek community , Elmore says , and officers of SAM had attended bystander training taught by BU 's Sexual Assault Response & Prevention Center , which is intended to teach students how and when to intervene in several types of dangerous situations , including intoxication . Elmore and his staff have met at least 12 times , often individually , since the beginning of the academic year with the leaders of BU fraternities to discuss the responsible use of alcohol .
The University is cooperating with the Boston Police , which is investigating Barksdale 's death .
Barksdale , who lived in the Towers residence at 140 Bay State Rd. , was a 2012 graduate of Souhegan High School in Amherst , N.H. , where he earned the Coach 's Award for varsity basketball , a U.S. Marine Corps Scholastic Excellence Award , and a Humanities Award .
Grid Parity Solar Now we finally have a clean , renewable and economically viable solution to our energy needs
Clean , renewable , cost-competitive and dependable energy from the sun will soon be a reality .
“ This is a technology that will change the world , ” says Tom Beck , president of SHEC Energy Corporation of Saskatoon .
Beck says SHEC Energy has spent almost 16 years developing renewable energy technologies that have unbounded potential . Now , he says , the company has lab results showing it can reduce the cost of solar power by about 75 per cent over existing solar systems . That makes it competitive with the lowest-cost fossil fuels .
Solar power produced by existing systems costs around $ 0.13 to $ 0.20 per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) . Beck says SHEC Energy 's technology can reduce that cost to between $ 0.06 and $ 0.08 per kWh .
“ That 's only slightly more than coal , which is among the least expensive of the fossil fuels , '' says Beck . “ And it comes without the pollution and negative health effects you get when burning fossil fuels , and it 's far less costly than nuclear power , with all its long term radioactive waste issues . ”
Solar energy has been the domain of wishful thinkers for decades . But high capital costs and intermittency – the sun does n't shine at night – have always been barriers to wide adoption . SHEC Energy has successfully overcome both issues .
Unlike photovoltaic ( PV ) systems that convert light to electricity , concentrating solar power systems ( CSP ) similar to the one used by SHEC Energy produce power by concentrating sunlight to generate high temperature heat , similar to how a magnifying glass concentrates sunlight into a point of intense heat . This heat is then used to boil water to make steam to turn a turbine . This use of the turbine is the same as used with fossil fuels like coal , oil , gas or nuclear . The turbine connects to a generator that makes electricity .
In typical CSP systems , there is a high cost for deploying the solar field , which consists of hundreds or thousands of solar concentrators . This mades CSP plants more expensive than conventional power plants . And those higher financing costs result in higher costs for the power generated .
SHEC Energy 's proprietary CSP system introduces new technology that dramatically lowers the cost of the solar field and significantly increases the efficiency of thermal energy storage . This means SHEC Energy 's CSP system can store heat energy very cheaply and thereby continue producing power 24 hours a day , except in prolonged cloudy conditions . In those circumstances , the plant could switch over to fossil fuel because it operates on thermal energy , whether generated by the sun , gas or oil .
The technology also has application for amplified photo voltaics for smaller scale deployments .
There is also application for industrial , village and acreage scale systems for power and heat .
“ Now we finally have a clean , renewable and economically viable solution to our energy needs , '' says Beck .

( Reuters ) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a $ 300 million contract that Puerto Rico 's government power company awarded to a U.S.-based energy startup , the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday , citing people familiar with the matter .
The contract between Whitefish Energy Holdings and Puerto Rico 's bankrupt power utility was widely criticized after media reports showed it was awarded without a competitive public bidding process .
On Sunday , Puerto Rico 's government announced it would cancel the $ 300 million contract .
Whitefish had more than 350 workers and 2,500 tons of heavy equipment on the ground for rebuilding electrical lines destroyed in Hurricane Maria , raising concern about Puerto Rico 's management of federal disaster-relief funds to the island , the WSJ reported . ( on.wsj.com/2zjM0vi )
The Federal Emergency Management Agency , multiple congressional committees and local auditors have begun requesting documents about the deal , according to the WSJ .
A Whitefish spokesman , Ken Luce , told Reuters the company was not aware of any such investigation and that it “ is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or investigation . ”
An FBI official in San Juan , who requested anonymity , told Reuters “ we can neither confirm nor deny ” the Journal 's story .
A number of U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke 's connections with Whitefish .
Democratic Representatives Raul Grijalva and Peter DeFazio asked the Department of Homeland Security 's inspector general in a letter to investigate the contract 's execution , its terms , and “ whether there was any political impetus behind the contract . ”
The representatives said in the letter that Whitefish is based in Zinke 's hometown in Montana and that Zinke 's son once worked for Whitefish .
Zinke previously said in a statement that “ I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico. ” After the initial contract was awarded , “ I was contacted by the company , on which I took no action , ” he said .
France 's Zombie Catholics Have Risen — and They 're Voting
Having decisively defeated several rivals in his party 's primary this past weekend , François Fillon will carry the standard for Les Républicains in France 's presidential election next spring . Competitors and commentators — indeed , many voters — were surprised by this outcome . Surprised because Fillon had long trailed in the polls ; surprised because Fillon , a former prime minister , was long dismissed as the “ eternal No . 2 ” ; surprised because Fillon has promised , if elected , to starve the beast that the French fondly call l'état providence — the welfare state — a move that in France has not typically been a winning campaign strategy . But surprised , too , because , as the rest of the country is now discovering , Fillon is Catholic . Very Catholic . So Catholic , at least to the secular left , that a headline in the newspaper Libération screamed : “ Help , Jesus has returned ! ”
Fillon has never made any secret of his beliefs . He hails from the Vendée , the western region that was the site of a long and bloody resistance to the secular values , laws , and , ultimately , soldiers of revolutionary Paris . A lieu de mémoire , or site of memory , for French Catholics , the Vendée is famed for the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Pierre de Solesmes , where Fillon goes every year on retreat . In his campaign book Faire ( “ To Make ” ) , Fillon , known for his reticence , nevertheless recalls with deep emotion his Catholic schooling , explains how it has shaped his worldview , and affirms : “ I was raised in this tradition , and I have kept this faith. ” And , as it turns out , legions of Frenchmen and women who have not kept their faith will nonetheless turn out in droves for a politician who has .
These men and women are , in the controversial term coined three years ago by the sociologists Emmanuel Todd and Hervé Le Bras , les zombies catholiques of France . In their book Le mystère français , Todd and Le Bras tried to explain why , in a country where barely five citizens in 100 attend church , the weight of Catholicism is still evident . From the millions of parents who took to the streets in the mid-1980s to protest the Socialist government 's effort to merge private ( and overwhelmingly Catholic ) schools with public schools to the millions who , 30 years later , took to the same streets to protest the new ( but hardly different ) Socialist government 's effort to legalize gay marriage , these armies of French “ zombies ” would have overwhelmed the likes of Brad Pitt , let alone government ministers .
But this is less World War Z than the newest chapter in the guerres franco-françaises — France 's long series of civil wars fought over the legacy of the French Revolution , which pit a secularist left against a traditionalist right . Todd and Le Bras marvel over the persistence of Catholic habits and values in regions where Catholicism has more or less vanished as an institution . “ The most astonishing paradox , ” they note , “ is the rise of social movements shaped by a religion that has disappeared as a metaphysical belief. ” Unable to resist the French weakness for paradox , Todd and Le Bras conclude : “ Catholicism seems to have attained a kind of life after death . But since it is a question of a this-worldly life , we will define it as ‘ zombie Catholicism . ' ”
Zombie Catholics share certain symptoms : Not only do they hail from regions where resistance was greatest to the French Revolution , but they also have taken advantage of the benefits that flowed from that seismic event . Highly educated and meritocratic , they also privilege a traditional ordering of professional and domestic duties between husbands and wives ; strong attachment to social , community , and family activities ; and a general wariness over the role of the state in private and community affairs , including “ free schools ” ( Catholic private schools ) .
Fillon can check all of these boxes . His economic liberalism , in particular , has led critics to label him a French Margaret Thatcher . But Fillon 's genius was his recognition that France 's zombie Catholicism is n't just a cultural identity but also a latent political one . Indeed , the zombies came out to vote for him in greater numbers than anyone had anticipated : In the second round of the primary , more than 4.3 million individuals went to the polls . For a party that had never before chosen a presidential candidate by primary , this was a stunning success . ( It is important to note that the primary was partly open : Anyone who paid 2 euros and declared they held to right-wing or centrist values was allowed to cast a vote . Although estimates vary of the percentage of those from the left and center who voted , pollsters attribute the second swell of voters to those mobilized by Fillon 's candidacy . )
Equally stunning is how the electoral map dovetails with the sociological map traced by Todd and Le Bras . For example , the Vendée and Brittany , the western regions that formed Fillon , are among what the authors call the most “ anthropologically hardened ” zombie Catholic enclaves — places where the church has vanished but its practices and values persist . Voters from these parts of France also rallied in greater numbers than elsewhere to Fillon , while in those regions identified by Todd and Le Bras as “ anthropologically hardened ” liberal enclaves — especially in the south , much of Paris ( and the former “ red belt ” that surrounds it ) , and other large cities — voter turnout was significantly smaller . According to Jérôme Fourquet , the director of opinion and business strategies for French pollster IFOP , the takeaway was clear : Catholic , or at least zombie Catholic , voters played a “ disproportionate ” role in the primary .
Just how Catholic Fillon will remain during his campaign for the Élysée remains to be seen , but all signs point to his beliefs being both sincere and deeply held . When the French political scene was upended in 2012 by the monumental clash over the legalization of same-sex marriage , Fillon never hid his opposition . Once the legislation was passed , Fillon acknowledged that the law must be respected , but he has also repeatedly voiced his opposition to the law 's so-called “ excesses , ” by which he means the right of same-sex couples to either adopt or use a surrogate mother . His hostility to the law attracted the support of Sens Commun ( “ Common Sense ” ) , a deeply conservative Catholic organization tied to La Manif Pour Tous ( “ Protest for Everyone ” ) , the political movement that led the massive protests against the same-sex marriage law . Frigide Barjot , the former leader of La Manif Pour Tous and a controversial figure , appeared at Fillon 's headquarters Sunday night to celebrate his victory . Fillon 's personal opposition to abortion — “ Given my own faith , I can not approve of abortion , ” he said in early October — has also sent ripples of concern across the political spectrum .
Equally unsettling have been Fillon 's remarks on Islam . Though not as provocative as Nicolas Sarkozy , who relentlessly played the “ identity card ” during his campaign , Fillon has nevertheless underscored what he considers to be the unprecedented challenge Islam poses for France . He insists on France 's “ Christian roots , ” a statement critics denounce as an implicit warning to French Muslims that they are not chez soi in France . He has claimed that there is a “ concrete problem with radical Islam , ” immediately adding , afterward , that “ Catholics , Protestants , Jews , Buddhists , and Sikhs do not threaten our national unity. ” Not surprisingly , the Collective Against Islamophobia in France issued a warning about Fillon 's candidacy , declaring that anti-Islamic remarks made by Fillon spokeswoman Valerie Boyer — most notably , that only Muslim extremists wear headscarves — represented “ a small taste of what to expect ” from a Fillon presidency .
On the center and left , the takeaway from all this has been panic : It is as if real zombies have invaded France . Some of the headlines in French media following Fillon 's primary win were nearly as apocalyptic as those in the United States following Donald Trump 's victory . When not stammering over the large cross Boyer wore during a press conference , the co-owner of the left-leaning Le Monde newspaper , Pierre Bergé , tweeted that Fillon 's supporters were no better than the Pétainists of Vichy France .
As for Le Monde itself , an editorialist observed , simply , that Fillon 's victory revealed “ the emergence of a Catholic and patrimonial right . ”
And yet , given the lamentable state of the Socialists , bled white by infighting and tied to the most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic , Fillon seems likely to be the only thing standing between France and a National Front presidency in next spring 's election . The question now is whether he will be able to convince voters from the center and left to overcome their worries about his religion and his austere economic plans .
It 's also an open question whether French Catholics — zombie and non-zombie alike — will maintain their own resistance to the National Front 's anti-Europe , anti-Muslim , and anti-liberal siren call . Fillon does seem to have harnessed what the religion specialist Henri Tincq calls “ identity Catholicism. ” Those Frenchmen and women , he said , “ uneasy with a modernity that has largely erased Christian values from issues like education , family , work , and sexuality , ” and increasingly ill at ease with transnational institutions like the EU and the transnational flow of peoples — especially when they are Muslim and hail from the Middle East — have increasingly been retreating to the ostensible safety of traditionally national institutions like the Catholic Church . Fillon is now offering them what seems to be a compelling political alternative to the sclerotic secularism of the left and unsavory heritage of the extreme right .
But if this activation of Catholic identity already marks a shift in French politics , its ultimate significance is not yet clear . Much depends on the long-term direction taken by the newly awakened horde of zombie Catholics . Will they retreat further to the right and into the arms of the National Front ? The late and great historian of French politics René Rémond always insisted that the more observant French Catholics are , the less likely they are to vote for the National Front . But this truism has , with time , frayed dramatically ; moreover , it never applied to the zombies to start with . An IFOP poll taken after last year 's regional elections revealed that 32 percent of practicing Catholics voted for the National Front . Not only was this higher than the national average — 28 percent — of National Front voters , but it was also more than double the percentage of Catholic votes tallied for the party in 2014 . As a headline in the Catholic magazine Pélerin announced , the “ Catholic dam is collapsing . ”
The same poll revealed , however , that western France , Fillon 's homeland , continued to resist the National Front 's rise . Many Catholics , regardless of their religious practice , continue to feel repugnance in voting for a party whose founder , Jean-Marie Le Pen , thrived on values they consider antithetical to their worldview . But it bears noting that his daughter , Marine Le Pen , continues to reinvent the National Front , also known by its French name Front National or FN . It was no accident that when Le Pen the younger recently replaced the traditional logo of the blue-white-and-red flame of the National Front with a blue rose , she also removed the very names “ Le Pen ” and “ Front National ” from the party 's graphics . Now , her public appearances are framed by “ Marine ” and “ Au nom du peuple. ” ( “ In the name of the people. ” ) As one of her advisors remarked , “ Marine Le Pen is not the candidate of the FN but of all Frenchmen and women . ”
Fillon may have ridden a wave of the undead to victory in the primary . It remains to be seen , however , whether the Catholics — dead and undead alike — will stick by his side this spring .

The Liberal government has allocated $ 500 million to celebrate the country 's sesquicentennial , with $ 300 million for infrastructure projects and $ 200 million for heritage events .
“ Manitoba 's got next to nothing , ” said Kevin Waugh , the Conservative Party 's deputy heritage critic .
Preliminary spending figures suggest Manitoba — and the rest of the western provinces — are getting far less to celebrate the country 's milestone than peers Ontario , Quebec and Prince Edward Island .
OTTAWA — While everyone knows when Canada is celebrating its 150th bash , Ottawa is unable to say how much of its birthday money will be spent in Manitoba .
Hey there , time traveller ! This article was published 14/6/2017 ( 622 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .

OTTAWA — While everyone knows when Canada is celebrating its 150th bash , Ottawa is unable to say how much of its birthday money will be spent in Manitoba .
Preliminary spending figures suggest Manitoba — and the rest of the western provinces — are getting far less to celebrate the country 's milestone than peers Ontario , Quebec and Prince Edward Island .
`` Manitoba 's got next to nothing , '' said Kevin Waugh , the Conservative Party 's deputy heritage critic .
The Liberal government has allocated $ 500 million to celebrate the country 's sesquicentennial , with $ 300 million for infrastructure projects and $ 200 million for heritage events .
Of the $ 300-million infrastructure fund , $ 92.4 million has been allotted to the western provinces .
The agency responsible for distributing that money — Western Economic Diversification — publishes all the grants it awards , but says it ca n't narrow down those which fall under Canada 150 and how much of the fund each province is getting .
Similarly , Canadian Heritage is granting $ 200 million to events and commemorations , but claims it will take more than a week for a complete province-by-province breakdown , although it was able to provide the Manitoba figures .
Half of the $ 200-million heritage fund will go to national projects , while the other half is allocated to local communities . Of that , $ 85 million has been awarded to 575 projects so far , including more than $ 3 million for 22 projects in Manitoba .
The majority — $ 1.5 million — is going toward the 2017 Canada Summer Games , of which Winnipeg is the host city .
Waugh questioned how spending on the Games can be credited toward the country 's sesquicentennial since the Games are a recurring event funded by the the federal government . He said he believes the government rebranded its normal spend as part of the anniversary .
According to Canada 150 guidelines , any funded events must be `` new and specifically designed to celebrate '' the anniversary and `` recurring events must show how the activities will be substantially different in 2017 . ''
Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly 's spokesman , Pierre-Olivier Herbert , insists the $ 1.5 million will only go to special events at the Games that deal with Confederation . `` We do n't fund things that would happen otherwise , '' he said .
According to department documents , the money is earmarked for the Games festival and opening and closing ceremonies .
The opposition parties have panned the Canada 150 funding as a slush fund for one-time events , such as a $ 2.5-million New Year 's Eve concert on Parliament Hill and a $ 198,000 red leather sofa touring the country as part of a documentary project .
Waugh also mocked Saturday 's announcement of $ 1,600 for the City of Winnipeg to plant 200 trees and 200 shrubs . `` We 're three weeks to July 1 . Is this it ? Are they out of money ? ''
Peter Cantelon , head of the Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre in Morden , says Canada 150 funds should be used for the unglamorous role of preservation .
`` Any money that is going into a celebration is not heritage funding , it 's a party , '' he said .
Cantelon said buildings went up all across Canada in 1967 , including Winnipeg 's Centennial Concert Hall . `` In another 50 years there will still be evidence of that money ... but there will be none for Canada 150 . ''

He said there 's a trend for national funds to favour larger provinces and within Manitoba to favour Winnipeg — which has 94 per cent of the previously announced Canada 150 funding but accounts for 55 per cent of the province 's population .
`` When you 're already struggling to get your share of Canada 150 within a province and a lot of that goes to Winnipeg , it exacerbates the disproportionate share of funding , '' Cantelon said . `` Heritage is one of those areas that takes a backseat to virtually everything else . ''
Claudette Leclerc , executive director of the Manitoba Museum , unsuccessfully applied for Canada 150 funding . She said the government has maintained grants for non-anniversary projects .

For example , she said , the federal government has funded her institution 's upkeep and expansion of Alloway Hall through regular Canadian heritage grants that fall outside of Canada 150 .
`` They made a conscious decision for it not to be about building infrastructure and to be about a celebration — and that 's their prerogative , '' she said . `` I think 150 carries with it some magnitude and weight . ''
While Ottawa is refusing to release its latest spending plans for Canada 150 funding , a January summary of the heritage grants , disclosed through access-to-information laws , showed the program 's per capita funding for Manitoba was just $ 2.35 , below the national average of $ 3.98 .
By comparison , Ontario 's was at $ 5.63 , Quebec $ 4.24 and Prince Edward Island $ 20.97 .
The Free Press asked the department last week for a more recent breakdown of funding , but the department said it would need more time .

Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said during the second presidential debate Sunday night that she would nominate Supreme Court justices who advocate stricter gun laws .
`` I respect the Second Amendment , but I believe there should be comprehensive background checks , and we should close the gun show loophole and close the online loophole . We have to save as many lives as we possibly can , '' Clinton said .
Although the issue of gun control was talked about only briefly during the second debate , it has been one of Clinton 's major themes .
The Democratic nominee said during the first debate , `` We 've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them . The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men , more than the next nine causes put together . . .
`` We 've got too many military-style weapons on the streets . In a lot of places , our police are outgunned . We need comprehensive background checks , and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm , '' she continued .
`` And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who 's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country . If you 're too dangerous to fly , you are too dangerous to buy a gun . ''
Clinton also told AARP in a recent interview that when she considers ways to combat terrorism , she also looks at the problem of violence broadly , because `` it 's not only terrorists we need to be worried about . Terrorism is part of it , but gun violence kills 33,000 Americans a year . ''

HONG KONG/BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China has quietly undertaken more construction and reclamation in the South China Sea , recent satellite images show , and is likely to more powerfully reassert its claims over the waterway soon , regional diplomats and military officers say .
With global attention focused on North Korea and Beijing engrossed in its Party Congress , tensions in the South China Sea have slipped from the headlines in recent months .
But with none of the underlying disputes resolved and new images reviewed by Reuters showing China continuing to develop facilities on North and Tree islands in the contested Paracel islands , experts say the vital trade route remains a global flashpoint .
Some expect China to land its first deployments of jet fighters onto its runways in the Spratly islands in coming months , while regional military officers say it is already using the new facilities to expand naval and coast guard deployments deep into Southeast Asia .
“ They 've built these extensive facilities and both Chinese civilian and PLA experts have always made it clear that when the strategic time is right , they 're going to start using them more fully , ” said Bonnie Glaser , a China security expert at Washington 's Center for Strategic and International Studies .
“ I think it is a question of when , rather than if , China will start to assert its interests more forcefully in the South China Sea ... and that is likely to be at a time of China 's choosing , ” Glaser told Reuters .
Rival claimant Vietnam , meanwhile , is nearing completion of reclamations and an extended runway on its base on Spratly Island , the satellite images show .
CALM AFTER THE STORM
The build-up of the Spratlys symbolizes China 's growing assertiveness over the South China Sea during President Xi Jinping 's first term and was highlighted in his address to the Communist Party Congress this month .
“ Construction on islands and reefs in the South China Sea has seen steady progress , ” Xi told the Congress .
The issue is likely to come up during U.S. President Donald Trump 's visit to Asia , which begins this week .
“ We remain concerned about tensions in the South China Sea , in particular those caused by land reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts and the willingness of some to resort to coercive tactics to assert their claims , ” said Michael Cavey , a spokesman for the U.S. State Department .
“ We have consistently called on China , as well as other claimants , to refrain from any further land reclamation , construction of new facilities , and militarization of the disputed features . ”
Responding to Reuters ' questions , Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang reiterated the islands were irrefutably Chinese territory .

“ You ca n't say that the construction on our islands and reefs in the South China Sea and the building of necessary defensive facilities is an expansion of military deployments , ” he said .
“ We believe that at present the situation in the South China Sea is generally good , and all relevant parties should work hard together to protect the peace and stability of the South China Sea . ”
China 's ambassador to Washington , Cui Tiankai , said on Monday the United States should not try to “ interfere ” in regional efforts to resolve disputes in the South China Sea .

China has been seeking to soothe fellow claimant the Philippines and accelerating talks with the wider ASEAN grouping , amid concerns in Washington about the long-term security of the waterway through which some $ 3 trillion in trade a year passes .
In a speech in Singapore earlier this month , the most senior U.S. military chief in the region said even while Washington pushed Beijing for help on North Korea , it would still hold China accountable for actions that countered international rules and norms .
“ We also want Beijing to do more to stop provocative actions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea , where the Chinese are building up combat power and positional advantage in an attempt to assert de-facto sovereignty over disputed maritime features , ” Admiral Harry Harris , commander of the U.S. Pacific Command , said .
China claims much of the area through its controversial nine-dash line , which overlaps rival maritime claims by Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia , Taiwan and Brunei .
TACTICS NOT STRATEGY
A recent study by the U.S. government-linked RAND Corp weighing the risks of a conflict between the United States and China moved the South China Sea up its list of potential flashpoints .
Placing it above Taiwan but below the Korean peninsula , the study notes the waterway has “ become the unanticipated focal point of U.S.-Chinese ... rivalry ” .
While the Pentagon has embarked on more regular freedom-of-navigation patrols , or FONOPS , to challenge Beijing 's claims , some analysts believe Washington is struggling to counter China 's creeping domination of the area .
“ China appears to be pursuing a well-thought out and long-term strategy to achieve dominion over the South China Sea while America responds with ad hoc tactical maneuvers , ” said Ian Storey , a South China Sea expert at Singapore 's Yusof Ishak Institute .
“ FONOPS are tactics not strategy , and they have not made China rethink its plans for the South China Sea one iota . ”

Ni Lexiong , a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law , said there was little need for China to dramatically increase deployments now , but much depended on the actions others .
“ As long as others do n't intentionally go and provoke clashes , things will be fine , ” he added . “ The issue is that some countries , like the United States , go and stir things up . ”
( CNN ) A former U.S. Army enlistee who vowed to `` bring the Islamic State straight to your doorstep '' pleaded guilty Wednesday to attempting to detonate a car bomb at Fort Riley military base in Kansas , authorities said .
`` John Booker admitted that he intended to kill U.S. military personnel on American soil in the name of ISIL , '' John Carlin , assistant attorney general for national security , said in a statement , referring to the terror organization also known as ISIS .
`` Thankfully , law enforcement was able to safely identify and disrupt this threat to the brave men and women who risk their lives to defend our country . ''
Booker admitted in court that his plot involved the construction of a bomb containing 1,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate , according to federal prosecutors . He intended to trigger the bomb himself and filmed a video that was to be shown to Americans after his death in the suicide bombing .
`` You sit in your homes and think this war is just over in Iraq , '' Booker said in the video , according to prosecutors . `` Today we will bring the Islamic State straight to your doorstep . ''
His attorney , Kirk Redmond , did not return a call seeking comment .
Bomb was a dud from the start
Booker did not know the bomb he constructed was made with inert materials or that two men working with him were FBI informants , prosecutors said .
The investigation of Booker was launched in March 2014 after he posted on Facebook of his intentions to engage in violent jihad , prosecutors said .
Booker enlisted in the Army in 2014 and was scheduled to begin basic training in April of that year , Army spokesman Wayne Hall said at the time of Booker 's arrest .
The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him in March 2014 about comments posted on Facebook , such as , `` Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush . I am so nervous . NOT because I scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord . ''
In a video , Booker pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the leader of ISIS .
Booker told investigators that he enlisted to commit an insider attack against American soldiers like the one Maj. Nidal Hassan carried out at Fort Hood , Texas , according to prosecutors . Hassan opened fire in a building in November 2009 , killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 .
His enlistment was terminated March 24 , 2014 , at the request of Army Criminal Investigation Command , Hall said .
AT & T , you got some ‘ splainin to do . We should have seen this coming with the initial reports that the carrier was disabling HSUPA support on their 4G Android phones . Though the company touts the enhanced speeds of their 4G network , we are faced with the embarrassing fact that the iPhone 4 and its 3G radio is consistently outperforming the HTC Inspire 4G and Motorola Atrix 4G in terms of upload speed . How much faster is the iPhone 's uplink ? Try five times .
Several sources have put the claim through its paces and each time the result is the same . The iPhone 4 is getting an average 1.5Mbps upload speed while the supposedly faster 4G network servicing the Inspire and Atrix is capped at 300kbps . That 's right , capped at 300kbps when the radios installed in the Android devices are capable of up to 5.7Mbps upload speeds . You can see it in the below speed test video put together by YouTube member EchoRelay . So what 's the deal ?
AT & T wo n't provide an answer , but they are promising future devices ( and future updates to current devices ) will allow faster uploads over 4G . The hint is whatever cap is in place on the Inspire 4G and Atrix 4G will eventually be lifted . The problem is AT & T is advertising enhanced speeds making better experiences for things like video calling when the enhanced speeds simply do n't exist . One need only to check our own AndroidForums to find the complaints amassing with one user even starting a petition against the service provider .
From the sound of things , AT & T got caught up in the rush to deploy 4G devices on their HSPA+ network and might not have the infrastructure in place yet to support heavy traffic and still provide a consistent quality of experience . That 's not what early adopters want to hear , but it may be the truth they have to live with .

ABBEVILLE , La . — It was arraignment morning at the Vermilion Parish courthouse , the monthly catalog of bad decisions , hot tempers , hard hearts and hard luck . Natasha George , who until recently was one of 10 lawyers defending the poor of the parish , stood before the full gallery of defendants .
“ I 'm the public defender in Vermilion Parish , right now the only public defender , ” she said . “ Due to a lack of funding for our district and our office , today we will be taking applications for our service but you will be put on a wait list . ”
Over the next hour , a steady stream of people left the courthouse and headed out into the rain , nearly all holding a sheet of paper explaining that as the poor and accused of Vermilion Parish they were , for now , on their own .
“ This will just be hanging over my head for who knows how long , ” said Leroy Maturin , a 33-year-old drain installer who was facing a felony drug possession charge , and because he had no lawyer , had no court date scheduled for the foreseeable future .
Senate Win In Wis. A 'Turning Point ' For Gay Rights

Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin 's sexual orientation was never really a factor in her victorious campaign against Republican former Gov . Tommy Thompson . Advocates for gay rights see that as a watershed moment for the movement .
Baldwin won a seat many thought she could n't , defeating one of the state 's most successful politicians in the process . The celebration Tuesday night in Madison was euphoric .
The enthusiastic crowd was never louder than when Baldwin acknowledged making history .
`` I am well aware that I will be the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate , '' she said .
Not About Being Gay
Afterward , supporters like Linda Willsey remained `` sky-high . ''
`` Dreams do come true in politics , '' says Willsey , who has known Baldwin for more than 25 years .
`` The fact that she 's the first openly lesbian woman candidate to win a U.S. Senate seat is great , but that 's not why she won , '' she says . `` It was n't even an issue in this race . ''
In fact , the words `` gay candidate '' were rarely — if ever — spoken on the campaign trail . Baldwin , instead , mostly talked about two other words : `` middle class . ''
Analysts say Baldwin won primarily on the same issues as President Obama in Wisconsin , including the economy .
`` No one was questioning whether or not she could lead because of her sexual orientation , and that 's so amazing , '' says Katie Belanger , executive director of Fair Wisconsin , a statewide gay rights advocacy group .
Belanger says the fact that Wisconsin voters did n't seem to care about Baldwin 's sexual orientation — combined with Tuesday 's victories for marriage equality in neighboring Minnesota and in three other states — represents a major step forward .
`` I think that when we look back on the movement for LGBT equality , we 're going to look at Nov. 6 , 2012 , as a significant turning point , if not the turning point in this movement , '' she says .
Joining The Conversation
For Baldwin , the milestone of being the first openly gay candidate elected to the U.S. Senate is the latest in a series of firsts . She was the first openly gay candidate elected to the Wisconsin Assembly , and the first openly gay non-incumbent elected to Congress .
Based on those experiences , Baldwin says this historic election changes things in one specific way .
`` If you are not in the room , the conversation is about you . If you 're in the room , the conversation is with you , and that ... has a very transformative effect , '' she says .
Baldwin says she does n't have a specific gay-rights agenda she 'll immediately push in the Senate . She says her top priority will be the issues she talked about in the campaign , including preserving Medicare , middle-class tax cuts , creating jobs and fixing the economy .
But she also notes that what happened Tuesday reflects a `` sea change '' in voters ' attitudes toward gays , lesbians and marriage equality in just a few short years .
`` There were several glass ceilings smashed on Tuesday , and ... I 'm proud to have been one of those , '' she says .
To be sure , Baldwin and others say the gay-rights movement still has a long way to go , but never before has it gained so much on one Election Day .

For years , I listened to people telling me “ complex ” Leftist theory is . After a brief bit of analysis — coming on the heels of having read the classics of Western philosophy — I found myself laughing at their statements . Liberalism is no more complex than a vending machine , but it contains a twist that baffles 98 % of humanity .
Recently an article in the Boston Globe discovered this glitch and opined about it in the usual neurotic muddle of liberals that tries to incorporate many details of the current time to “ hide the ball ” about the actual simplicity of liberalism :
In liberalismâ€™s race to get ahead , Hartz said , the insecurity of those who win provokes their escalating displays of wealth , but the anxieties and pain of those who fall behind cut deeper scars . Liberalism offers no remedies for these scars because it only defends purely individual rights . Deep divisions might undermine the unwritten social solidarity that is the essential foundation of liberalism itself .
Let me translate this : liberalism says we are all equal , and yet results in reality say otherwise . How do we resolve this paradox ? The answer is that we do not , and so we become neurotic in our attempts to do so . Even in the most idealized of liberal societies , some have risen above others . Even the most Communist society must have some leaders , and they will have dachas in the countryside .
The author of that piece can not face this paradox . His solution ? More liberalism :
Donald Trump is an old standby of unconscious liberalism , but Bernie Sanders just might be a real democratic socialist . His campaign focuses on rectifying income inequality , a product of liberalism that liberalism can not address because it only speaks of individual rights .
Someone will be hired to administer equal income . This person will have more-equal income than the less-equal people to whom he distributes . In every area of life , someone will be better at running the show than others . This person will either receive more income , more power , or both through rewards like dachas which technically are not income but would be purchased with income .
It 's time to point out that liberalism/Leftism is entirely nonsense . People are not equal in ability , therefore they are not equal ; some rise above others because of their greater ability , which is an observation straight out of the pages of Charles Darwin 's books . What the American founding fathers meant by “ equal ” is that people deserve the right to pursue their destinies independent of a government shaping them toward ideological ends . It was actually a statement against liberalism , but to the Boston Globe author , it might as well have been written in Greek .
We have had over two centuries of theory trying to explain around the basic paradox of Leftism . These liberal ideas “ sound good ” but do not work in reality . This spurs a need for people to invent more of them , since people like the idea of liberalism because it sounds socially acceptable . That is , in sum , what you need to know about liberalism .
An experienced and more cynical American consumer might identify more of what liberalism actually is : advertising . It is promising that sound good , made to the consumer so that they buy the product . The product in this case is rule by liberals , who promptly vote themselves big fat salaries and government regulations that benefit their industries while destroying every other competing force . This ultimately dooms the society .
Looking back through history , we can see the Magna Carta as a formalization of liberalism . A group of merchants wanted to have greater power so that they could make greater profits and so they induced change in the political system to favor them . Being smart , but not quite as smart as their leaders , their first move was to find a way to depose those leaders , and they found they could do it through this universally-popular advertising .
The Americans tried to limit this impulse with a Constitution that in their view would protect citizens against government so that commercial interests would not run roughshod over the needs of ordinary people . It took only a few decades for people to hack around those limits and , with the rise of Lincoln , America became exactly what its founders did not want : an ideologically-driven state imprinting on its citizens that ideology .
While liberals generate mountains of words to try to hide their fundamentally simplistic view behind surface complexity , it wreaks great destruction upon us . We are chasing ghosts and illusions and in consequence , ignoring the actual problem of civilization , which is how — in the absence of regulation by nature — to keep citizenship open only to the useful people and avoid diluting ourselves into mediocrity , then facing the inevitable wrath of entropy .
All of this for a little twist , which is the idea that we are all equal except for liberals who are more-equal intellectually , and therefore we must serve them in order to gain… equality . Imagine if we had skipped this silly episode in our history and simply stuck to reality instead . How much farther along would we be ?

Many governments have started experimenting with blockchain technology .
Technology is changing rapidly and it looks like blockchains and cryptocurrencies hold much potential . Governments around the world are aware of this : since last year , the government of the Netherlands has run many pilots to test what integrating blockchain technology can mean for them .
While blockchain technology can significantly improve the administrative process of the government , there are also some other aspects that I 'm not that keen on . The most important aspect is , as you might suspect , tax collection . If you read this , you probably do n't like to be coerced into contributing to an immoral and inefficient system ( in other words , taxation is theft ) . Let 's see what the Dutch government has been up to .
Collecting tourist tax via the blockchain
Last year , the Dutch government looked at the possibility to use blockchain technology to collect tourist taxes . In the Blockchain Pilots report , they say that the municipality of Rotterdam - that 's where the test took place - lost € 400,000 of tourist taxes due to the emergence of platforms such as Airbnb that do n't take taxation into account . In the pilot , they looked at the option to remove the entire tourist tax all together and make it voluntary .
Wait ... VOLUNTARY TAXES ? !
Yeah , in this test case they thought about it . When I dug a little deeper into the reports , however , I found some other clues .
When looking at the details of the test case , it was n't just about collecting taxes that the government currently miss out on in fiat currency , but also missed taxes in Bitcoin . The government envisions the following situation :
Step one : a hotel or person receives a booking of one of their rooms .
Step two : they accept the booking .
Source
Step three : the hotel or person automatically pays the tourist tax in either fiat or Bitcoin .
A script should be integrated in the platform that automatically calculates the amount of taxes to be paid in Bitcoin .
Source
So , platforms that currently avoid the tourist tax through accepting Bitcoin , would have to report their wallet addresses to the government , so that they can monitor all transactions .
Source
The real intention of blockchain integration ?
Maybe it does n't seem like a big deal now , the intentions of this innovation are worrying :
The added value of blockchain technology is that it creates an incentive for a hotel/platform to have their administration in order and that there is more trust in the available data on taxes .... wait for it ... * The chance of an invisible 'tax gap ' becomes smaller *
Source
Further tax collection with crypto
Up until now this test case only addressed tourist tax : a relatively small part of all taxes that are collected in total . However , it seems like the government 's intention is to collect more than only that .
They actually want to fork OpenBazaar ! I wrote about OpenBazaar earlier and said that it 's a great platform that promotes agorism . It seems like this is too big a threat to the current status quo .
Note that on top of the list is not hotels , but entrepreneurs ( ondernemers ) in the city of Rotterdam
Source
Moreover , today it became clear that the Dutch government is also interested in a new project called bitJob . This is an Ethereum-powered platform that allows students to find part-time jobs and get paid on the blockchain . While this is a great opportunity to introduce many young people to cryptocurrencies , it also undermines one of the main uses of them : financial independence and the absence of middlemen .
Source
Younger people often tend to work off the record , as they only work part time and so they earn smaller amounts of money . For businesses , smaller amounts of money are also easier to hide from the tax man . Now , that 'problem ' can be fixed via a public ledger where all income is registered . You can find more information about bitJob in @ kingscrown 's recent article .
In conclusion , technology gives us the opportunity to render governments obsolete . However , they are n't giving up without a fight . As I have shown , the Dutch government is especially interested in integrating blockchain technology into their administrative processes , as if they know about the power of crypto .
And they are already looking at putting the entire Dutch tax system on the blockchain :
Source
One of the main intentions of crypto is to cut out the middleman . With government co-opting blockchain technology , the middleman jumps right back in .

Queensland is again back in the news for all the wrong reasons . Coal capital , One Nation on the rise and now once again a world beater at clearing the bush .
For 30 years , Queensland was my home . I left for love and to start a family but my heart stayed in the state . The beauty of the rainforests , the splendour of the reef , the vast forested wildness of Cape York and the expanses of the outback all left an indelible impact . I also miss the honesty , directness and the no nonsense approach of Queenslanders .
For a generation , Queenslanders from all walks of life sought to create a new and vibrant Queensland after the repressive nothingness of the long Bjelke-Petersen era .
We were sick to death of being called the police state , of being the place where creativity was mocked , where race relations resembled apartheid-era South Africa and where the natural environment was under constant siege from all manner of state-sanctioned exploitation .
As a young “ greenie ” in Brisbane in the 1990s , one of the hardest things about being a Queenslander was the knowledge that massive amounts of forests and bushlands clearing was going on up and down the coast and throughout the vast rangelands of the interior .
All through the 1990s , hundreds of thousands of hectares of bush were levelled by enormous bulldozers and massive metal chains each and every year . In the year 2000 , almost 800,000 hectares of forests and bushlands were lost . The cost to wildlife was massive with conservative estimates of tens of millions of animals killed each and every year .
And then after 30 years of unabated destruction , Queenslanders from all walks of life came together to say enough was enough .
Across the state , communities convinced the government of Peter Beattie to step in and stop the chop . After a few missteps , in 2004 , Beattie included tough new laws to dramatically decrease deforestation . These laws passed with the support of the Queensland Liberals , then in one of their periods of independence from the Queensland Nationals .
Even the peak farm body , Agforce , provided muted support for the new laws . It appeared Queensland had turned the page on a new chapter , one in which protecting the environment and building a sustainable economy was paramount .
In Canberra , the Howard government supported the laws – reducing the rates of deforestation in Queensland meant a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and meant Howard could claim that Australia was on track to meet emissions reduction targets required under the Kyoto protocol .
And the laws worked . By 2010 , clearing had reduced to 78,000 hectares , still a lot but substantially less than the bad old days . But then the tide turned .
In 2012 , the newly-elected government of Campbell Newman broke an explicit election promise and gutted the land clearing laws . The old school Nationals were jubilant and the dozers were back into the bush en masse .
The legacy of Newman 's folly is written large in destroyed forests , soaring greenhouse gas emissions and further stress on an already critically ill Great Barrier Reef .
The release on Thursday of the 2015/16 annual land clearing data is heartbreaking . Incredibly , 396,000 hectares of forests and bushlands were cleared , a 33 % increase on clearing from the previous year of 2014/15 . In total , a staggering 1.25m hectares of bush have been cleared since Newman took the axe to the laws .
Attempts by the new Queensland government to strengthen the laws in 2016 were defeated by the LNP and the cross benches .
The cost to wildlife is staggering with a recent report by CSIRO estimating that 50 million mammals , birds and reptiles are killed every year due to deforestation in Queensland and New South Wales .
Coalition split over intervention in Queensland land clearing Read more
Soaring emissions from deforestation , conservatively estimated by the Australian government as releasing 49m tonnes of greenhouse gases per year ( 9 % of all Australian emissions ) , have almost completely cancelled out reductions in emissions delivered through the federal $ 2.24bn Emissions Reduction Fund .
And finally , massive amounts of clearing in the catchments that feed that Great Barrier Reef make a mockery of iron clad guarantees to reduce clearing made by the Australian and Queensland governments as part of the multi-billion-dollar Reef 2050 plan which saved Australia from the embarrassment of having the reef listed as “ world heritage site in danger ” .
Queensland has a brighter future than this and Queenslanders , when confronted with the awful reality of what is happening , will again demand action and leadership .
It is time for the LNP to recognise the folly of their actions in 2012 , it is time for the Australian government to be firm and demand change on climate , reef protection and environmental grounds , and it is time for the Queensland parliament to commit to strong laws to end deforestation in Queensland .
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alexander Litvinenko 's death clouded relations between London and Moscow
The coroner investigating Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko 's death said there was a prima facie case that the Russian state was involved , it has emerged during a High Court hearing .
Lawyers for Mr Litvinenko 's widow are applying for judicial review of the home secretary 's `` legally irrational '' refusal to order a public inquiry .
Government lawyers , though , argue the decision was rational and lawful .
Mr Litvinenko , 43 , was poisoned with radioactive polonium in London in 2006 .
He had been an officer with the KGB before being granted asylum in the UK from where he criticised the Russian government .
His family say he was working for MI6 , and killed on Kremlin orders .
Just over seven years ago , Mr Litvinenko was poisoned while drinking tea with two Russian ex-KGB officers , at the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square , central London .
Image caption Marina Litvinenko has been campaigning for a public inquiry
His death - and the allegation in the aftermath that Moscow was involved - caused considerable damage to the UK 's relations with Russia .
There has since been a long-running legal fight between his widow Marina Litvinenko , the proposed coroner Sir Robert Owen and ministers over what should or should not be made public about the nature of Mr Litvinenko 's death .
Last October , the government won a court order blocking the release of certain secret information at the proposed inquest .
At this latest hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice , papers just disclosed show that Sir Robert concluded that documents held by the UK government `` establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the Russian state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko '' .
The documents also showed that the coroner believed there was no evidence that the British authorities could have prevented his death , the court heard .
The Litvinenko case 1 Nov 2006 - Alexander Litvinenko has tea with former agents Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun in London
4 Nov 2006 - After three days of vomiting he is admitted to hospital , and dies 22 days later . His death is attributed to radiation poisoning
May 2007 - The UK decides Mr Lugovoi should be charged with the murder of Mr Litvinenko . He denies any involvement but says Mr Litvinenko was a British spy
5 Jul 2007 - Russia officially refuses to extradite Mr Lugovoi , prompting a diplomatic row
20 Sept 2012 - Pre-inquest review hears that Russia 's links to the death will be probed
May-June 2013 - Inquest into Mr Litvinenko 's death delayed as coroner decides a public inquiry would be preferable
Jan 2014 - Marina Litvinenko in High Court fight to force a public inquiry
In a previously secret ruling , Sir Robert said there was no material in the documents to suggest that Mr Litvinenko 's life should have been assessed as being under a `` real and immediate '' threat .
Mrs Litvinenko says she wants to get to `` the truth '' of how her husband died and believes the UK government was wrong not to order a public inquiry into his death .
Home Secretary Theresa May decided that a normal inquest should go ahead before deciding whether there should be a wide-ranging inquiry .
This was despite a request for an inquiry from Sir Robert , who argued an inquest could not properly investigate the alleged involvement of Moscow in Mr Litvinenko 's death .
In a letter to the coroner explaining her decision , Mrs May said an inquest would be `` more readily explainable to some of our foreign partners '' .
At Tuesday 's court hearing , Ben Emmerson QC , for Mrs Litvinenko , argued there was a `` strong and overwhelming '' need for a public inquiry .
It was necessary in order to establish whether Mr Litvinenko was the victim of a crime committed `` for private criminal purposes '' or whether it was a `` state-sponsored assassination carried out on the territory of the UK on the orders of the Russian government '' , he said .
He also accused Mrs May of adopting the `` bizarre '' position of waiting to see the outcome of an inquest that was so restricted it would be unable to examine secret evidence linked to allegations of Moscow 's involvement .
Neil Garnham QC , for the home secretary , is arguing the claim should fail because the obligation to hold an effective , official investigation into the death is being discharged by the government through a police investigation and the proposed inquest .
The case is being heard over two days by Lord Justice Richards , Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Mitting .
Mrs Litvinenko has appealed to the British public for money to help fund her fight for an inquiry .
She says she could face a bill of up to £40,000 if she loses . So far , she has received almost £15,000 in donations .
They trade insults over Russian involvement in the plane crash . | POLITICO Screen grab CNN 's Cuomo , RT host battle
The gloves came off between CNN 's Chris Cuomo and Russia Today 's Peter Lavelle on Wednesday in a lengthy segment over the handling of the investigation and crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 .
In a nearly 10-minute back and forth , the two hosts fought — and traded insults — over whether the U.S. has provided intelligence to support suspicions of Russia 's involvement . Afterward , Cuomo apologized to viewers and said the segment “ became a little bit too heated . ”
Story Continued Below
Cuomo opened the exchange by asking Lavelle why Russian President Vladimir Putin has n't condemned the handling of the Flight 17 crash site .
( Also on POLITICO : W.H . official : Still looking for ‘ direct link ' on MH17 )
“ Vladimir Putin does n't control a crime scene in a foreign country . I think it 's quite ludicrous for you to ask that question , ” Lavelle responded , adding that Putin has called for a complete investigation .
The Russia Today host instead pointed a finger at the State Department , which he said was relying on Twitter and YouTube for evidence .
“ Maybe you have n't been following it , but the U.S. has actually [ come ] out with its own intelligence ” connecting Russia to possibly assisting the separatists , Cuomo said .
( Also on POLITICO : Obama : No new world order yet )
“ What forensic evidence are you referring to ? Twitter ? ” Lavelle replied .
“ I do not think , Peter , that this is something to be flip about—298 people lost their lives , let 's not play politics here , ” Cuomo shot back .
The hosts continued talking over each other about the investigation and Russia 's involvement .
“ Peter , why are you afraid to hear what I 'm saying ? I 'm not here to fight with you . I just left the crime scene ; the last thing I want to see is more violence of any kind , verbal or otherwise , ” Cuomo said .
Lavelle said the U.S. should be releasing and comparing satellite data and when Cuomo said it has done so , Lavelle told the anchor , “ You 're living in a parallel universe ! ”
“ Peter , calm down , take a breath . We 've already had something bad happen , there 's no reason to compound it , ” Cuomo said .
Lavelle snapped back , “ Ask me an intelligent question . ”
“ I think I 've asked you several . Your answers , I do n't know about the intelligence of , but the questions are pretty spot on . Let me ask you again because I 'm not a representative of the U.S. ; you seem to be acting like a representative of Russia , ” Cuomo said .
Lavelle interjected , “ Great , character assassination . So you went to character assassination in what ? Five minutes ? ”
“ You sound like Jen Psaki at the U.S. State Department , ” Lavelle continued .
“ No , what I sound like is a reporter who feels deeply for the 298 lives who were lost , who were not part of this conflict and do n't need to be part of your discussion about whether Russia is being unfairly blamed , ” Cuomo replied .
The pair continued in a lengthy back and forth and speaking over one another , before Cuomo expressed exasperation .
“ This is a joke . We got ta get out of this , ” Cuomo said .
After ending the segment , Cuomo told viewers , “ The last thing I want to do is to stoke some type of useless conversation , the emotion sometimes gets the better of you , especially when you 've been on the scene … I apologize for getting involved for what became more about emotion than reason there for a moment . ”

South central Oregon fire restrictions
Extreme fire danger has led to public use restrictions in south central Oregon starting Thursday .
The restrictions apply to lands managed by the Fremont-Winema National Forest , the U.S. Bureau of Land Management 's Lakeview District and U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service 's Sheldon-Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Complex .
`` The moisture content of both living and dead vegetation is much lower now than it usually is for this time of year , '' said Joe Reinarz Interagency Fire Management Officer for the Fremont-Winema National Forest and the BLM 's Lakeview District . `` New fires are showing rapid growth and increased resistance to control effort . ''
Among the restrictions : Campfires and stove fires are allowed only in designated campgrounds and power saw operations are prohibited .

Oregon Gov . John Kitzhaber on Wednesday declared a state of emergency in response to a rash of wildfires burning in steep , rugged terrain across the state .
The verbal emergency declaration enables the Oregon National Guard to mobilize resources on an as-needed basis to assist the Department of Forestry and the Oregon fire marshal to fight the blazes .
Hot , dry weather has increased wildfire danger across the Northwest .
As of Wednesday night , there were at least 10 wildfires raging in Oregon .
`` Oregon is facing a severe fire season , '' Kitzhaber said in a release . `` Conditions are dry and new fires are starting daily . ''
Kitzhaber said his declaration frees up the resources needed to `` protect people , property , and Oregon 's natural areas . ''
The emergency was declared in accordance with ORS 401.165 , which says the governor can take such action once he determines that wildfires are a threat to life , safety , and property threat exceeds the firefighting capabilities of local firefighters and equipment .
For the past week , Oregon firefighters have been hindered by hot , windy weather and steep , rugged terrain . Washington state officials have also declared a state of emergency in 20 counties .
Meanwhile , the AP reports that Washington has received clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to use an unmanned drone to monitor wildfires that pose an urgent threat .
Here 's the state of wildfires around the Northwest as of Wednesday night :
In Oregon , the Buzzard complex of eight fires has grown to 90,000 acres about 45 miles northeast of Burns in the east part of the state . Crews are using heavy air tankers , single-engine planes and helicopters to attack flames from the air and assist ground crews who focused on digging line by hand and with bulldozers .
Firefighters are working on protecting homes and establishing anchor points to extend lines . No homes have been lost but a barn was destroyed on Tuesday . The fires threaten 20 structures , including ranches , as well as livestock , sage grouse habitat and grazing land .
All access roads into Warm Springs Reservoir remain closed until further notice .
In central Oregon , the Waterman complex of three fires has charred more than 4,300 acres of timber and grass about 10 miles northeast of Mitchell . Officials have closed U.S. 26 at Ochoco Summit .
The complex is zero percent contained .
Also in central Oregon , the Shaniko Butte fire threatens homes and other buildings in an area about 14 miles north of Warm Springs . Ignited by lightning , the fire has scorched 12,198 acres .
About 20 miles north of Sisters , the Bridge 99 complex of two fires has charred more than 1,047 acres of timber . More than 170 firefighters and support staff are working the fires . No homes are threatened .
In north-central Oregon , the White River fire has scorched 642 acres about 16 miles west of Maupin . Three structures and natural resources are at risk . The fire is now 90 percent contained and the cause is under investigation .
And in central-western Oregon , the Bingham complex of two fires on the west side of the Cascades is burning in the Willamette National Forest about five miles east of Marion Forks . Caused by lightning , it has charred nearly 350 acres . Oregon 22 runs through the area but is currently open .
In northeast Oregon , the Pittsburgh fire , ignited by lightning 18 miles northeast of Imnaha , has burned through 7,100 acres of grass and brush in steep and rugged terrain .
The Pittsburgh fire is zero percent contained .
In southern Oregon , the Moccasin Hill fire , 25 miles northeast of Klamath Falls , has charred more than 2,535 acres and is 35 percent contained . So far , 17 residences have been destroyed along with 16 minor structures .
In Washington state : The biggest fire is burning in the Mills Canyon area southwest of Entiat , Wash. , charring more than 22,500 acres of grass , brush and timber . The fire , now 40 percent contained , threatens more than 400 structures .
North of Leavenworth in central Washington , a fast-moving fire covering more than 1,200 acres has led to a 35-mile closure of Highway 2 and the evacuation of 850 homes . A lightning strike started the blaze Tuesday near Chiwaukum Creek .

A microbe developed to clean up nuclear waste and patented by a Michigan State University researcher has just been improved .
In earlier research , Gemma Reguera , MSU microbiologist , identified that Geobacter bacteria 's tiny conductive hair-like appendages , or pili , did the yeoman 's share of remediation . By increasing the strength of the pili nanowires , she improved their ability to clean up uranium and other toxic wastes .
In new research , published in the current issue of Applied and Environmental Microbiology , Reguera has added an additional layer of armor to her enhanced microbes .
The microbes also use the pili to stick to each other and grow a film on just about any surface , similar to the bacterial film that forms on teeth . The Geobacter biofilm , encased by a network of nanowires and slime , gives the bacteria a shield and increases their ability to neutralize even more uranium . The improvement also allows the bacteria to survive longer even when exposed to higher concentrations of the radioactive material .
Geobacter immobilizing uranium can be described as nature 's version of electroplating . The beefed-up microbes engulf the uranium and turn it into a mineral , preventing the toxic material from leaching into groundwater .
Reguera 's team had previously linked the conductive pili to the ability of the microbe to mineralize the soluble uranium . As the biofilm concentrates many nanowires around the Geobacter cells , more uranium can be bound and mineralized . The pili are immersed in a matrix of slime , which surrounds the biofilm cells and boosts the Geobacter 's pili armor , so the biofilm now can pull double duty by helping mineralize uranium .
The shield keeps the uranium from penetrating deep into the Geobacter biofilm . By keeping this process on the surface of the film , the bacteria are not exposed to uranium and , as a community , they are able to clean up more toxic waste .
`` The results surpassed our most optimistic predictions , '' Reguera said . `` Even thin biofilms immobilized uranium like sponges . They reduced it to a mineral , all while not suffering any damage to themselves , for prolonged periods of time . ''
Even when exposed to extremely high and toxic concentrations of uranium , levels that would destroy individual Geobacter cells , the biofilms did n't just survive , they thrived , she added .
Additional MSU researchers contributing to the study include Dena Cologgi , Allison Speers and Blair Bullard . Shelly Kelly with EXAFS Analysis , also contributed to the study .
Reguera 's future research on this front will focus on deciphering how the biofilm matrix that encases the cells shields them so effectively and how to improve its properties further .
Take this as an open letter to all you boisterous , pompous , front-running Chicago Blackhawks fans that will congregate in newfound glory inside AAC Saturday night .
How bout we take you Vince Vaughn-ite bandwagoners back a decade . I 'll guarantee that 10 years ago you were n't running around acting all chesty in full Blackhawks regalia . No way . Not a chance .
You see your team was about to go 26-43-13 in the 2005-06 season , and that campaign of futility would mark the
eighth time in nine seasons that your club missed the playoffs . Yes , ( gasp ) the Hawks sucked .
Perhaps surprising to most of you is that was a season featuring the rarest of combinations : your team had no offense ( 29th in GF ) but also could n't keep the puck out of its net ( 27th in GA ) . Kyle Calder and Tyler Arnason led your ‘ attack ' ( Remember those days ? ) . Your goaltending was handled by Nik Khabibulin ( 3.35 .886 ) and Craig Anderson ( 3.32 .886 ) . And a very green Trent Yawney was behind the bench .
However , on defense there was real hope . You had these two talented young building blocks , 20-year-old Brent Seabrook and 22-year-old Duncan Keith .
Two years later Kane and Toews arrived on the scene . Voila !
Game changers .
Good times were about to roll , Hawks jerseys were flying off shelves , and bragging camp was getting full enrollment .
In 2008-09 , your Hawks went from 20th in goals against to 5th when iconic Blackhawks player turned inexperienced coach , Denis Savard was replaced by the scotch and cigar voiced Joel Quenneville .
Quenneville 's teams ability to keep the puck out of its net has led to two Conference Final appearances and two Stanley Cups in six years for your beloved Blackhawks , and that is what I suspect has spawned the irksome , thrasonical , Johnny ( Toews ) Come Lately swagger you love to exhibit in foreign arenas .
Well , know this Blackhawksnation , DStars fans are comin ' for ya . Coming for you like Jean Girard came after Ricky Bobby in Talladega Nights – only without the accent , the awkward kissing , and alternative lifestyle . But comin ' for you never the less .
Anyway , the point I 'm eventually getting to is that the 2014-15 Stars look very much like the 2007-08 Chicago Blackhawks – poised to move to the next level .

My conversation with death
Today 's poem is brought to you by the letter ‘ D ' with short cameos by the letter ‘ A '
This poem started off with me seeing how much alliteration i could cram into a reasonably sized poem whilst maintaining the integrity of the piece . I found out recently someone i knew although had never really spoken to had died , this piece is not a memorial to her simply my thoughts on death especially death during youth
The lines spoken by the character ‘ death ' are italicised .
Nigh we descend the very depths of darkness
The domain of dreams and shadows as we do n't deceiptful glasses
Driving the mundane deep into the realm of the insane
Dastardly visions products of devilish enchantment
But my discernment not declining
Devastated I was in finding
A surely evident delusion
Of a demon before my eyes
Dressed in darkest rainment
Daunted I enquired his name and
“ Death ” the reply came
On a ghoulish December day
Your alloted age has arrived
Arrest all action acquiesce your life
Accept this , your apt enterprise
Though anger I see in your eyes
If its mere disappointment which you see
From desolation of my destiny
Distinct dysfunction in your design
My eyes distinctly testify
Decadence is rife , disease , destitution
Drawn directly from the dissolution
Of decency , or it 's definition 's evolution
Yet you still come after me ?
Am I appearing as an attorney ?
Although ammorality you abstain apparently
From my assignment you can not turn me
And assuredly all acts are for the balancing
Of cosmic scales all affairs
Absolutely small and wonderously tall
All these actions are accord
And your apparition 's been recalled
Dearest death one dispensation duly do not deny
Desperation 's distraught desire : one decade more of life
Aught authority have i acquired
To accept this ask , you must resign
Divert developments devised !
Dissuade the powers so divine !
Nay , A dream , tis a dastardly dream
Devised to desecrate life 's sanctity
Help ! I cried . Help !
As i heard the ringing of heaven 's bells
Help ! I cried . Help !
Then the wailing drums of hell
Help ! I cried.Help !
So young but still I fell .

Kubica leads BMW 1-2 at Canada
F1 Grand Prix , GP Canada , Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Robert Kubica has marked his first win of F1 careers masterfully and led his teammate Nick Heidfeld to the finish . Coulthard is a well deserved third thanks to a solid drive and a perfect pit stop strategy . Kubica also takes the championship lead thanks to his win .
The Canadian GP of 2008 is started under sunny sies but with a moderately strong wind ( 7.7m/s ) . It is possible some rain will fall during the race , but so far the skies look clear . The track temperature is 34°C . Jenson Button and Sebastian Vettel will start from the pitlane .
When the lights go out , all three men in front stay in their positions . Rosberg meanwhile is able to jump Alonso , who on his behalf manages to just hold off Massa .
In the midfield , Heidfeld lost a place to Barrichello but was able to gain it again 3 laps further in the race .
After 8 laps , Hamilton is slowly increasing his lead , being 4.3 seconds ahead of Kubica . On 9 seconds is Raikkonen and a further 4 seconds down is a trio with Rosberg , Alonso and Massa .
In lap 14 , Sutil is out of the care after parking his car after turn 2 . Raikkonen has meanwhile returned on Kubica despite having run off all the grooves on his left front tyre . Two laps after the incident , Charlie Whiting finally realised the car can not be cleared , so a safety car is brought on track .
Button is meanwhile entering the pitlane for his first stop , a strange moment as he started from the pitlane and will now aso end up with a penalty . One lap later , a lot of drivers dive into the pitlane . Raikkonen and Kubica are out side by side and stop at the end of the pitlane due to red lights . Hamilton meanwhile is inattentive and hits Raikkonen from behind . Both drivers are out of the race , while Rosberg hit Hamilton too . He is able to rejoin but must get a new front wing in the next lap .
When the safety car is off , Heidfeld is in the lead as he did n't pit , ahead of Barrichello and Nakajima . Kubica is tenth and is followed by Alonso , the first of the drivers who have pitted under the safety car .
Heidfeld iis however considerably faster than Barrichello and manages to pull away more than 2 seconds per lap away rom everybody else . The German might be given the chance of his life if he can continue with the same pace through this race .
Piquet , running just behind Alonso goes off in lap 19 but is able to rejoin the track without damage . In the event , he dangerously drove backward across the track . Massa was just able to prevent an accident .
The same lap , Heidfeld is in the pitlane for a considerable time and may be going until the end without a second stop . It remains to be seen if you will manage to do so on the option tyres . He rejoind the track just ahead of Kubica but is passed by his teammate a single lap later .
In lap 26 , with 34 to go , Barrichello makes his only pitstop , handing Coulthard with the race lead . Not for long however as he stops one lap later . Coulthard comes back behind Alonso and ahead of Barrichello . As a result , Trulli is in the lead , ahead of Glock and Kubica , all running within a couple of seconds .
Just past halfway in the race , Alonso is still blocked behind Heidfeld . Kubica regained the lead due to both Toyota 's pitting and is ahead of his teammate by 11 seconds . Robert is immediately told to push hard in order to increase the gap to Heidfeld as he will have to stop in a couple of laps .
4 laps later , Alonso pushes a little too hard and touches the wall , a little too hard it seems as he is out of the race with a broken front suspension . The pit radio just after that revealed a possible gearbox problem .
With 22 laps to go , Nakajima 's front wing is broken as he touched a Honda in the hairpin . Not a disaster , had it not been that the front wing just broke off upon entrance , lifting up the car and leaving the Japanese without steering . He ends up in the pitwall and abandons the race .
One lap later , Kubica makes his stop and rejoins a couple of seconds ahead of his teammate . Behind Heidfeld , the closest competitor is David Coulthard 5 seconds further down .
Barrichello , 4th at the time is however passed by two cars in move . The action started with Kovalainen who attempted a pass on Rubens in the hairpin . Both men braked late , but still Kovalainen was able to get past . In the gap on the inside of the corner , Massa saw an opportunity and managed challenge both cars succesfully .
Moments later , Fisichella his the barriers but a safety car is not deployed . The fear of such deployment does make some drivers decide to stop immediately .
12 laps to go and Barrichello goes through the grass in the first chicane , allowing both Toyota 's to pass him . Rosberg on the other hand tries to pass Vettel on the outside of the straight , but fails . He loses so much time that he must let Kovalainen pass by . A lap later Barrichello loses another place to Massa .
The latter is charging incredibly hard and passed Trulli after he is blocked by his own teammate . Glock made an error in the first corner . As he rejoined , he cut Trulli 's was and Massa profited again .
Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of blocking any mention of immigration in Labour 's official referendum leaflet setting out its case for the UK remaining in the EU .
Furious MPs say the Labour leader was urged to include a section addressing voters ' concerns about immigration .
They warn that many voters in the party 's traditional Northern heartlands are backing Brexit because of anger over mass immigration . Despite the warning the glossy four-page leaflet mailed to millions of homes does not mention the word immigration .
Pictured , Labour Leader , Jeremy Corbyn and Deputy Leader , Tom Watson take part in a community meeting at the Guru Har Rai Gurdwara Sahib temple in West Bromwich during a visit on Wednesday
One shadow minister told the Daily Mail : ‘ Loads of us told Jeremy 's office that immigration had to be included in the leaflet , but they did n't want to know . It 's coming up on every doorstep , so it 's ridiculous that we seem to be ignoring it completely . '
The episode echoes last year 's election campaign when Labour candidates were told to ‘ move the conversation on ' if voters raised concerns about immigration .
Last night , a spokesman for Mr Corbyn flatly denied he had vetoed any mention of immigration , adding : ‘ The leaflet reinforces Labour 's main messages about the dangers of a Tory Brexit and the threat to jobs and workers ' rights . '
But the failure to address immigration in the leaflet will reinforce concerns that Labour is ducking the issue .
Shadow home office minister Keir Starmer said there was a growing perception among Labour voters that the party had ‘ walked round a problem , rather than confronted a problem ' .
He told the House magazine : ‘ What we 're picking up as we go around the country is the public – rightly or wrongly – think that Labour does n't want to talk to them about immigration .
'We have absolutely got to break that and to make it clear that we are engaging . '
Mr Starmer also took a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Corbyn 's hard-Left agenda , saying : ‘ You wo n't find the answers to tomorrow 's questions in yesterday 's answers , in recrafting , reinventing old ways of thinking , old theories , that are not relevant to the project ahead . '
Many Labour MPs are alarmed at the party 's failure to persuade its supporters to back EU membership
Many Labour MPs are alarmed at the party 's failure to persuade its supporters to back EU membership .
Northern MPs report widespread anger about mass immigration from the EU , while some Labour supporters are said to view the referendum as an opportunity to give David Cameron a bloody nose .
Former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson dismissed suggestions that Mr Corbyn 's long-standing opposition to the EU was hampering the campaign .
Today is about more than new Nexus devices . Google has also announced a new plan option for Google Play All Access . Rather than paying for multiple individual accounts , family members can now share a single family subscription for $ 15 per month . We posted this rumor yesterday , and it 's now confirmed .
The current cost of a single All Access streaming subscription is $ 10 , so even two people would save $ 5 every month with the family pack . This deal is valid for up to six people too . It 's a long overdue change for Google 's music streaming service . Both Spotify and Apple already offer family streaming discounts , and Apple Music is supposed to be launching on Android very soon .
The Access family plan is a good value compared to Spotify , which charges $ 14.99 a month for two members , $ 19.99 for three members , $ 24.99 for four , and $ 29.99 for five members . Apple Music is the same $ 15 flat rate as Google Play All Access .
The new plan option should be rolling out later this year , so you 'll have to wait to jump on the family streaming bandwagon . Note , moving to a family account will probably invalidate the launch promo price for individual All Access subs , if you 've still got that .
Cold days and a simmering pot of chili go together so well . It 's a classic stick-to-your-bones , warm your soul kind of meal . As it 's the first week of fall in the Pacific Northwest , I am all too ready to indulge in our favorite chilis and soups . This Paleo Chili with Butternut Squash is a favorite in our house because it combines everything we love about a classic meaty chili and fits a low-carb diet . I promise you wo n't even miss the beans !
Skip to recipe
No beans , no problem
No beans ? Yes , you heard me right .
While this Paleo Chili with Butternut Squash contains plenty of meat , it has no beans . Swapping them instead for creamy butternut squash , bell peppers , tomatoes , and jalapenos . I know ! I add jalapenos to everything and more . But no worries , this is n't a spicy-hot dish . It 's a pretty classic chili – just better .
Balancing spice with butternut squash
The first time I made this Paleo Chili with Butternut Squash for the fella , he was a little skeptical of my use of butternut squash before he dug in . He 's an avid hater of acorn squash , beets , and mushrooms – You know , some of the best things you can eat . So he was understandably wary of my use of the somewhat similar butternut squash in chili . Why would I sully such a classicly pure dish with squash ?
Because butternut squash is creamy , sweet , and nutty . The perfect counterbalance to the heat from peppers and acidity from tomatoes . I told you that you would n't miss the beans . That , my friend , is because of the butternut squash . It 's the perfect way to balance out the rich umami ( savoriness ) of the chili .
I make this often in the fall and winter months when it 's chilly out and it warms everything up . It reheats wonderfully for lunch for a few days and even freezes well .
A note for special diets
This Paleo Chili with Butternut Squash is grain-free , gluten-free and fits Paleo , Keto , SIBO , and Whole 30 diets .
Albeit being about 6 months late , Tesla finally started pushing the new Linux kernel update to the center console in its vehicles this week .
While it 's only a backend upgrade , Tesla CEO Elon Musk associated it with several long-awaited improvements to the vehicle 's user interface . Now that the kernel upgrade is here , those improvements should n't be too far behind .
Sources told Electrek that the latest 8.1 update ( 17.24.30 ) , upgraded the Linux Kernel from the version 2.6.36 to the version 4.4.35 .
Interestingly , the upgrade was only pushed to the center information display ( CID ) , the large 17-inch screen at the center of the vehicle , and not the instrument cluster ( IC ) .
For most Tesla owners , the release notes of the latest update only refer to “ minor software fixes and enhancements ” , but it also brought navigation and Autopilot to Taiwan , where Tesla started delivering its vehicles earlier this year , but owners did n't have access to the features .
When Tesla was first working on upgrading the Linux OS to 4.4 , Musk said that they will be able to push a much-needed updated web browser on the new system .
The in-car web browser has been described as almost unusable by owners and a report suggested that less than 30 % of Tesla drivers use it . The latest update to our website does n't even work on the browser ( unacceptable ! ) :
The update is expected to make it much more usable , along with long-awaited UI improvements to navigation and the media app .
Those updates were first supposed to come on the 8.1 software update planned for December 2016 ( pushed in March 2017 ) , but it was really light on UI improvements and instead focused on Autopilot 2.0 updates .
Tesla has put a lot of efforts trying to improve the second generation Autopilot in 2017 and it resulted in fewer updates for owners of pre-October 2016 cars .
When Tesla introduced its last major software update ( version 8.0 ) for all cars in September 2016 , we asked Musk if Tesla was reaching the limit of the car 's processing power and he confirmed that it was the case . Tesla is expected to keep pushing over-the-air updates to its fleet , but there are always hardware limitations and vehicles built before the latest generation of Autopilot have started reaching them .
Yet , there are Tesla vehicles that are 3 , 4 , and almost 5 years old on the road today and they are still receiving updates . The web browser is expected to be the biggest one , but Tesla has also been hinting at a new music streaming service .
Musk said to expect the next update in July .
My dear readers , I have disappointing news to report . Remember last week when I reported that a new Tony Hawk game was in development ? It looks like I incorrectly got you excited for about the possibility of a new full fledged game in the vein of Tony Hawk Pro Skater or Underground , according to Hawk himself . Hawk sat down and spoke with Bloomberg today , talking about how he helped make skating as main stream as it is .
Hawk went on to confirm that a new game was in development with Activision , but it is coming to mobile devices . “ We 're working on a mobile game now . We 're working on a game for mobile devices this year . We 've never gone exclusively in that direction yet so I 'm excited because , with the amount of time people are spending on their phones and their tablets playing games , we 've never had our own game in that space so I 'm excited to provide one finally . ”
No timetable was given on the release , but Activision previously said we would learn about the new Hawk title soon . Do you plan on giving Tony Hawk on mobile a shot ? Are you as disappointed by this announcement as I am ? Let me know in the comments below !

Shortly after taking over as the governor in September 2013 , had promised a `` dramatic remaking '' of the country 's Rajan has walked the talk , though the full results of his efforts would be visible only a few years from now . For example , five years down the line , the Indian could look very different from what it is now .
To start with , the near-monopoly of public sector banks , which now account for over 77 per cent of the loan market , could well be over . Experts say there could be fewer public sector banks , more niche that offer only specific products or cater to a particular group of customers and more private universal The postal department 's ambition to become a full service bank could also impact the monopoly that state-run lenders enjoy in the hinterlands .
Most importantly , customer choices would change dramatically with technological innovations , as a result of which lenders which still depend on savings deposits to attract customers , could face oblivion in the next five years .
`` There is definitely change in the air with payments banks , small and more universal banks coming in . Three years down the line , you will see many of these things happening , '' said Arundhati Bhattacharya , chairman , State Bank of India , the country 's largest lender which controls 17 per cent of the total credit of the banking system .
The changing contours of banks in India
The recent decision of the government to capitalise public sector banks based on their efficiency could go a long way in ending the muscle power that the state-run banks enjoy , if the government sticks to the strategy of selective infusion of capital . Weaker banks ' survival would be in question as their ability to raise capital from the market would be limited because of mounting non-performing loans . For diluting their owner 's stake by tapping equity markets , these banks need the government 's approval , and the latter is in no mood to oblige due to poor valuations .
Data compiled by the ministry show public sector banks ' combined market capitalisation is only 36 per cent of the banking sector 's total market cap even though they control 77 per cent of the loan market while their average price-to-book value ( P/BV ) is 0.67 . In contrast , private sector lenders ' market cap is 74 per cent with average P/BV at 2.35 .
While observing that the government 's move to link capital infusion with efficiency is one way to incentivise banks for better efficiency , Bhattacharya said only time will tell if government banks can hold on to their dominance . `` It is difficult to predict at this point in time what will happen . We will have to see whether it ( market share ) remains where it is now or comes down to 50 per cent , '' she added .
A new order
The response to set up niche banks in India after the banking regulator invited applications from aspirants has been stupendous . Over 100 entities have applied to set up payments banks and small banks , though the central bank made it clear that it will be cautious in awarding licences .
has also paved the way for wholesale banks , or to be more specific , banks which will only finance infrastructure projects . has provided incentives for such banks as they can now raise resources through long-term bonds ( with a tenure of at least seven years ) and will not have cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) , statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) or priority sector lending obligations . However , it is still to be seen whether the concept excites banking aspirants .
There could be another kind of niche banks . Going by the deliberations at the two-day bankers ' retreat ( gyan sangam ) convened by the finance ministry in Pune , there is a proposal that small public sector banks should rather focus on their strengths and not try to sell all kinds of products . `` Re-orient portfolios of small PSU banks to differentiate and focus on specific niches to build capabilities and to optimise capital , '' the summary of recommendations released after the retreat said . This could result in some government banks selling loans only to farmers , and some selling only to small enterprises . The one-size-fits-all theory could well be a thing of the past , so far as the structure of public sector banks are concerned .
There will be more universal banks also , with the banking regulator thinking about `` on-tap '' licensing of universal banks , as compared to the current `` window '' system of licensing . The guidelines for the same are expected to be released later this year .
Going ahead , they could look like what global consulting firm McKinsey outlined at the Pune retreat , which was attended by finance ministry and officials . McKinsey suggested a three-tier banking structure . On top will be large banks , which can happen through consolidation of some of the public sector banks , though not many believe this is possible at this point as most government banks are now busy putting their own house in order in terms of tackling the steep rise in bad loans . `` There is no point in merging two weak banks , this will have systemic implications , '' said the chief executive of a public sector bank .
The second is state-linked banks , a proposal which finds resonance with the PJ Nayak committee . According to the recommendations of the committee , set up to review governance structure in banks , the government should cut its shareholding below 51 per cent ; set up an omnibus bank investment company , which will be the holding company for all public sector banks ; and constitute a bank board bureau which will appoint board members as well as chief executives . The suggestions are radical , but if implemented , public sector banks will sport a completely different look , five years down the line .
The McKinsey report also talked about policy banks . Such entities are also a welcome step as it will implement the government 's policy decisions such as directed lending , which is currently being done by public sector banks . If these banks are freed from the burden of directed lending , their efficiency will improve . One step in this direction has already been taken with the setting up of the Micro Units Development Refinance Agency ( MUDRA ) Bank .
Addressing students of the National Institute of Bank Management in Pune last week , Rajan said the banking sector will see major changes with the entry of new players , while public sector lenders will be the biggest `` change agents '' . He has already laid the groundwork for the `` dramatic remaking '' .

Still wondering how the NHL Expansion Draft will work ? Let us explain .
The NHL offseason is officially in full swing now that the expansion draft and entry draft have passed us by with very little fanfare .
This year , there have been a lot more moving parts thanks to the inclusion of the Vegas Golden Knights as the NHL 's 31st team . The expansion is the NHL 's first since 2000 , but now that the meat of the offseason has come and gone , what 's next for the NHL ?
Glad you asked ! Thanks to the team at CapFriendly , we have a schedule in this busy time . For your convenience , here 's every important date you need to know leading up to the expansion draft and free agency on July 1 .
NHL dates of interest through July 1 Date ( All 2017 , EST ) Deadline/Event Date ( All 2017 , EST ) Deadline/Event June 12 Deadline for formal requests of players to waive NTCs or NMCs for the purpose of protection lists June 15 Deadline for first club-elected salary arbitration June 15 NHL first player buyout period opens June 17 , 5 p.m . Expansion draft protection list submission June 18 , 10 a.m . Expansion draft protection lists released to the public June 18-21 Vegas can negotiate and sign UFAs and unprotected RFAs June 21 , 10 a.m. Vegas submits player selections June 21 Vegas team released to the public during NHL Awards ceremony June 23-24 NHL Entry Level Draft June 25-30 UFAs may speak to other teams , but not sign new contracts until July 1 June 25 , 5 p.m . Deadline for qualifying offers June 26 RFAs may speak to other teams , but not sign new contracts or offer sheets until July 1 June 30 , 5 p.m. First buyout period ends June 30 Setting of upper and lower limits July 1 , 12 p.m. NHL Free Agency
Now , after the expansion draft and the entry draft , the normal offseason pattern has set in with July 1 being the start of free agency . It 's a lot to take in , and things have already been set in motion . While we know what Vegas ' roster will mostly look like , there 's still rumblings that the Golden Knights will deal or add a few more players before or after July 1 .
So , do n't get caught unaware . Memorize this schedule for the next few weeks . Or , just check back when needed to see what the NHL has in store for us all .
First , we can make the generalized hylomorphism from the other day more efficient by noting that once you inline the hylomorphism , you can see that you do 3 fmaps over the same structure , so we can fuse those together yielding :
g_hylo : : ( Comonad w , Functor f , Monad m ) = > ( forall a. f ( w a ) - > w ( f a ) ) - > ( forall a. m ( f a ) - > f ( m a ) ) - > ( f ( w b ) - > b ) - > ( a - > f ( m a ) ) - > ( a - > b ) g_hylo w m f g = extract . g_hylo ' w m f g . return -- | the kernel of the generalized hylomorphism g_hylo ' : : ( Comonad w , Functor f , Monad m ) = > ( forall a. f ( w a ) - > w ( f a ) ) - > ( forall a. m ( f a ) - > f ( m a ) ) - > ( f ( w b ) - > b ) - > ( a - > f ( m a ) ) - > ( m a - > w b ) g_hylo ' w m f g = liftW f . w . fmap ( duplicate . g_hylo ' w m f g . join ) . m . liftM g
Also , the above made me realize that most of the generalized cata/ana , etc morphisms give you a little more interesting stuff to do if you separate out the recursive part . Then you can pass it a monad built with something other than return to perform substitution on , or inspect the comonadic wrapper on the result .
Oh , and to support my earlier claim that g_hylo generalizes g_cata and g_ana here are derivations of each in terms of g_hylo .
g_cata : : ( Functor f , Comonad w ) = > ( forall a. f ( w a ) - > w ( f a ) ) - > ( f ( w a ) - > a ) - > Mu f - > a g_cata k f = g_hylo k ( fmap Id . runId ) f ( fmap Id . outF ) g_ana : : ( Functor f , Monad m ) = > ( forall a. m ( f a ) - > f ( m a ) ) - > ( a - > f ( m a ) ) - > a - > Nu f g_ana k g = g_hylo ( Id . fmap runId ) k ( InF . fmap runId ) g
As an aside , histomorphisms have a dual that seems to be elided from most lists of recursion schemes : Uustalu and Vene call it a futumorphism . It basically lets you return a structure with seeds multiple levels deep rather than have to plumb 'one level at a time ' through the anamorphism . While a histomorphism is a generalized catamorphism parameterized by the cofree comonad of your functor , a futumorphism is a generalized anamorphism parameterized by the free monad of your functor .
futu : : Functor f = > ( a - > f ( Free f a ) ) - > a - > Nu f futu f = ana ( ( f ||| id ) . runFree ) . return
Now , g_hylo is painfully general , so lets look at a particularly interesting choice of comonad and monad for a given functor that always have a distributive law : the cofree comonad , and the free monad of that very same functor !
This gives rise to a particular form of morphism that I have n't seemed talked about in literature , which after kicking a few names around on the haskell channel we chose to call a chronomorphism because it subsumes histo- and futu- morphisms .
chrono : : Functor f = > ( f ( Cofree f b ) - > b ) - > ( a - > f ( Free f a ) ) - > a - > b
Unlike most of the types of these generalized recursion schemes , chrono 's type is quite readable !
A chronomorphism 's fold operation can 'look back ' at the results it has given , and its unfold operation can 'jump forward ' by returning seeds nested multiple levels deep . It relies on the fact that you always have a distributive law for the cofree comonad of your functor over the functor itself and also one for the functor over its free monad and so it works for any Functor .
You can generalize it like you generalize histomorphisms and futumorphisms , and derive ana and catamorphisms from it by noting the fact that you can fmap extract or fmap return to deal with the cofree comonad or free monad parts of the term .
Alternately , since the 'identity comonad ' can be viewed as the cofree comonad of the Functor that maps everything to , you can also choose to rederive generalized futumorphisms from generalized chronomorphism using the distributive law of the identity comonad .
Below you 'll find source code for generalized hylo- cata- ana- histo- futu- chrono- etc ... morphisms and their separated kernels .

In life , and in politics , it always pays to own up to a mistake and move on .
But that 's not a lesson the Treasurer , Joe Hockey , seems to have learnt when it comes to the government 's plan to tackle the `` fraud '' of new parents `` double-dipping '' by accessing two paid parental leave schemes .
Joe Hockey 's second budget cracks down on paid parental leave 'double-dipping ' . Credit : Alex Ellinghausen
On the Sunday before Mr Hockey handed down his second federal budget , press gallery doyen Laurie Oakes suggested to the Treasurer that parents accessing both the government paid parental leave scheme and their employers ' was `` basically fraud , is n't it , taking an allowance twice effectively ? Who is doing it ? ''
`` Well , it is , '' the Treasurer said , adding that `` it 's mostly people who go on parental leave that earn more than $ 90,000 a year '' .

When it comes to an author 's writing , style can only mean one of two things—one can be learned ; the other , which is far more elusive , must be honed . And really , so we 're clear : it 's the latter that 's also tricky , fleeting , and artful ; it 's the latter that 's about taking chances and creating narrative prose that has a life of its own .
And do n't get me wrong , grammar rules and standards applied to manuscripts or published documents ensure consistency . Language is a personal form of expression where rules can be applied in different ways , so following a particular style gives editors a specific point of reference to review your work against and offers you an accepted editorial standard for your manuscript . Still having a writing style is so much more than adhering to a certain set of overall writing strategies .
A writer 's style is the way he or she chooses to craft sentences in order to engage readers . As in most things , it 's subjective . Not only is style subjective , which makes it complicated—as in some readers will respond to your writing while others won't—but even if a writer 's style is grammatically correct it can still be weak . Let 's face it : a cliché can be grammatically correct , and something written in a passive voice can initially pass a CMOS sniff test .
If an edited manuscript comes back to you with comments such as “ tighten your prose ” or “ this section is overly wordy ” or “ awk , ” it probably means you need to work on your writing style . I 've found three simple things make a big difference .
First , write exactly what you mean . In other words , do n't skirt around what you want to say , do n't mince words , and do n't overwrite—just say it . If you make a conscious effort , you 're a few steps ahead when it comes to the writing process , because being authentic and purposeful helps . Also , be sure to choose words you know to get your point across . Nine times out of ten , to craft generous and well-delivered prose , a plainspoken charm is best .
Second , it also helps to consider your tone . It 's a delicate balance so try not to be academic if your book is meant to be written in laymen 's terms , and if you 're shooting for believability do n't rely on esoteric jargon . Be sensitive to how you 're saying something as much as what you 're saying . Your characters—each and every one of them—should embrace this habit as well . If you 're writing fiction , there should be a sense of “ completeness ” in each character 's development—make sure the people and places you describe are consistent in their overall being as well as their habits and preferences .
Thirdly , be willing to rewrite . A wise editor once said :
Rewrite , rephrase , reconfigure . Unfortunately , despite the Romantic picture many of us have of the writing process , prose does not just flow down from the Muse and magically burst through your fingertips . Even the best artists need to constantly rework and revise what they 've written . It 's work . Of course , for most of us writers it 's fun work , but just because you 're an artist does n't mean that you do n't have to worry about your craft . Piano players practice scales , painters make preliminary sketches , and writers go through lots of drafts . That 's just how the process works . If you want to know the most important lesson I 've learned about making art , it 's this : the stuff that looks the easiest is usually the hardest to pull off . Jackson Pollock ? Raymond Carver ? Ernest Hemingway ? Andy Warhol ? Always keep in mind that it takes a lot of work to make a work of art look effortless .
Having style means to write simply , yet ecstatically , with purpose . And as is so often is the case with art , such writing is difficult to pin down ; we know it when we see it !
Happy revising !

Unlike most queens , she does n't describe herself as a dancer , but rather a thematic performer who incorporates elements of movies and characters she loves and thinks an audience will respond to .
Said McQueen : “ I really like to be captivating with the audience and work off them . ”

A . In high school I was like an ugly cross dresser and not really a drag queen . I would go out to house parties though and people would be like “ yas ! ” because they 're drunk and do n't care that I look bad . I started senior year and did all of my art projects with drag . I did n't get the [ expletive ] kicked out of me so that 's good I guess .
Q . What 's it like being a drag queen in Gloucester ?
A . Odd . It 's weird . It 's even weirder because one of my first and main gigs was in Gloucester . It was actually pretty lucrative , too . It was at the Madfish Grille .
Q . How did your family react to your getting on the show ?

A . Everyone 's very excited for me . Now that the cast is released , everyone is going bonkers . No one really gets what comes from the show though , they do n't understand the opportunities and possibilities that come after being on “ RuPaul 's Drag Race. ” They 're just like , “ That 's amazing , I 'll see someone I know on TV ! ” My parents are still confused as to why I 'm going all around for these premiere parties .
Q . How would you compare being on the show to being in the local drag scenes ?
A. I mean , drag queens are drag queens . They 're all pretty cutthroat . It 's two totally different worlds though . At home I can feel like a rich white lady and put on a bathrobe and have a drink before I have to go out , but on the show there 's all this running around and pressure , but that goes without saying .
Q . How much have you blown up on social media since the announcement came that you would be on this season ?
A . A lot . The night they announced the cast I thought my phone was going to just give up . This fan base is crazy . They had the entire cast picked out already and were keeping tabs on girls like Bob the Drag Queen and Acid Betty and Thorgy Thor . So they were all building their presences during that sort of latency period . They had no clue I would be on though . I went from 500 Twitter followers to 5,000 , and 2,200 Instagram followers to 14,900 . I expected there to be so many mean comments to come from all of that , but they 're all so nice . Everyone is being so positive and supportive . It 's surreal .

Q . How would you describe who you are as a drag queen ?
A. I 'm an idiot , I 'm such an idiot . I just like to have fun and for other people to have fun , too . I started doing drag from a negative place to replace those feelings . I 've always wanted to be a rock star and this is my way to express that , and I 'm an artist above all else . Drag gave me an extension to capture those dreams you did n't think would happen , and I 've gotten a lot of things I never thought I 'd be able to .

His accuser admitted during the campus hearing that she had sexually assaulted him . Yet she was never punished , while he was expelled based on her accusation .
A Drake University student who was expelled for sexual assault despite evidence he was the party assaulted received a win in court when a judge refused to dismiss his lawsuit , according to court documents provided to the Federalist .
The student , whom I will refer to as John Doe since his accuser is not identified in court documents , was expelled after Drake railroaded him and refused to provide accommodations for his learning disabilities during its investigation into an accusation against him . His accuser admitted during the campus hearing that she had sexually assaulted him and even provided altered text messages that omitted her side of the conversation to make it appear as though he had stalked her . She was never punished , but John was expelled based on her accusation .
John 's father , Thomas Rossley , was on Drake 's board of trustees for 23 years , but was removed after he attempted to get his son a fair investigation and accommodations for his disability . Rossley is suing Drake in a separate lawsuit .
John knew his accuser before the night of the alleged incident . They met up on campus after both had been drinking . John was also on medication for language-based learning difficulties , Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , anxiety , and difficulty quickly processing questions and articulating answers .
Jane Doe Admits She Acted Without His Consent
After meeting his eventual accuser , referred to as Jane Doe in court documents , John offered to hail her a cab home . John alleges in his lawsuit that Jane requested they go back to John 's fraternity house , a place she visited occasionally . The driver of the cab would later say the two were “ making out ” in the back seat .
John says he does n't remember much after leaving the bar where he met Jane . When they arrived at the fraternity house , Jane suggested they go to John 's car for privacy . Once inside , Jane initiated oral sex on John . John 's lawsuit indicates he does not remember giving consent for this action , and based on the amount of alcohol he had drunk and the medications he was on , he would n't have been able to consent anyway .
During his hearing , Jane admitted she initiated the oral sex without John 's consent , but said she did so because she was “ just giving him what he wanted. ” Such an excuse would never be accepted from a male student . Jane claimed she ran into the fraternity house to get away from John , something she could n't have done since she did n't have the security code to get in . John entered this code when the two went inside together .
John claimed he did n't remember anything until Jane was leaving . John was lying in his loft bed , and woke up the next morning fully clothed , including his shoes .
Jane claimed that she had been lying on a beanbag chair and that she and John had sexual intercourse , but she told him to stop . She claimed John was wearing a yellow condom . Campus investigators asked John if he owned any novelty condoms , to which he replied that he did not . Jane 's claim about the yellow condom was mentioned during the hearing , but John 's claim that he did not own such a condom was not .
Jane also claimed that she went to the hospital the day after the encounter but was denied a rape kit . Drake never asked for proof of this hospital visit or the results of the exam Jane claimed she received .
The Hearing Appeared Stacked Against John
From the beginning , Drake 's investigation was stacked against John . The school hired an outside investigator , Mary Howell Sirna , because John 's father was a trustee , but she had just been hired as Iowa State University 's Title IX coordinator and interim director of the Office of Equal Opportunity . When John told her he did n't remember much from the night in question , this woman wrote “ lie ” across her notes ( notes John 's father subsequently obtained ) .
Sirna and fellow investigator Tricia McKinney also failed to interview key witnesses who could have provided actual evidence . They refused to include the testimony of John 's roommate , who was in the room when the alleged assault took place , because they said his testimony was unreliable . They also refused to interview at least nine other witnesses , including one of Jane 's friends who had seen her earlier in the evening and was the first person Jane contacted after the incident .
The school also refused to allow the testimony of two men Jane went to see immediately after she left John 's room . She had walked across the street to the fraternity 's annex and got into bed with a male friend , who told her to leave after she got on top of him . She then got into bed with another man , whom she was attracted to , and remained with him until the morning .
These fraternity brothers told John about this afterwards . This second man would have testified that Jane did not seem intoxicated and showed no signs of pain , even though she claimed during the hearing that sexual intercourse caused her immense pain due to a medical condition ( the school never requested documentation for this condition ) .
John had texted Jane at 3 a.m. after their encounter to ask if she had returned home safely . She texted : “ All good , babe ” from the bed of one of the other fraternity members .
All This Evidence Was Ignored
None of this mattered to investigators . John told them he was “ not in a state to be with her ” and that he “ was not able to give consent that night. ” Jane admitted she received no consent for the oral sex , but no investigation was launched against her for sexual assault . John even attempted to file a report against her , but Drake refused to investigate , claiming his report was retaliation . Nowhere in Drake 's policy does it say the school can ignore a sexual assault accusation for retaliation .
Despite lying at the hearing and admitting to sexual assault , Jane was never punished .
Also during the hearing , Jane presented an edited set of text messages that made it look like John had been messaging her without response . John provided the complete set of texts , which included her responses . Despite lying at the hearing and admitting to sexual assault , Jane was never punished .
Instead , Drake helped Jane railroad John every step of the way . The school refused to provide disability accommodations for John , despite numerous requests , and became essentially a co-complainant against John . Jerry Parker , acting dean of students , stood in for Drake against John , and was allowed to call his own witnesses and receive his own opening and closing statements . This meant the accusing side was allowed 20 minutes for opening arguments , 20 minutes for closing arguments , and had 10 minutes to rebut John 's arguments . John , meanwhile , was only allowed 10 minutes each for opening and closing argument , and five minutes for rebuttal .
Parker also personally arranged for Jane to have an attorney after learning John had hired one with his own money . Parker also provided that attorney with all relevant documents relating to the investigation . He also allowed Jane to bring an advocate separate from the attorney , and provided Jane 's friends and family a private room in the building . John 's friends and family were not allowed in the building , and he was allowed no advocate in addition to his attorney .
So the Outcome Is n't Surprising
Unsurprisingly , John was found responsible for sexual assault and expelled . Drake was so committed to this decision that it then removed John 's father from the board of trustees for pointing out the flaws in the investigation and reminding Drake that it had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by denying his son accommodations .
Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger allowed most of John 's claims against Drake to survive .
John filed a lawsuit against Drake . U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger allowed most of John 's claims against Drake to survive . Ebinger dismissed John 's claim that his due process rights were violated because Drake is a private university and therefore not required to follow the Fourteenth Amendment . Let this be a lesson to other young men thinking of attending private universities .
John also sued those who investigated the accusation , but Ebinger dismissed them as co-defendants . The lawsuit will continue with just Drake and its board of trustees as defendants .
John 's claims that his rights under Title IX were violated , that Drake breached its contract with him through its lopsided investigation , that it breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing , that it negligently inflicted emotional distress , is liable for damages under theories of estoppel and reliance , and violated the Americans with Disabilities Act were all upheld .
Colleges Keep Losing On the Merits of Kangaroo Courts
Based on how other schools have responded after a decision like this , I would expect this case to be settled out of court soon . John 's father still has his lawsuit against the university working its way through the court . To read more about how Rossley was treated by the board of trustees , see my previous article about his lawsuit . It 's a doozy .
This decision follows a summer of wins for students falsely accused of sexual assault .
“ My son is looking forward to his day in court when all he needs to do is prove by the preponderance of the evidence that the University violated his civil rights , ” Rossley said in a statement to the Federalist ( emphasis original ) . Rossley 's mention of the preponderance standard is a knock at the university system , which uses the incredibly low standard to brand young men as rapists .
Drake University did not respond to a request for comment prior to press time .
This decision follows a summer of wins for students falsely accused of sexual assault . Schools have settled with some high-profiled students . Allegheny College settled with a student who had been expelled even though the accuser 's friend said the woman just wanted to get the young man punished for not dating her .
Columbia settled with the man accused by “ mattress girl ” Emma Sulkowicz , who had sent numerous texts to him before and after the encounter indicating she had unrequited feelings for him . She turned her claims into an art project that received worldwide attention and praise before his side of the story was ever told .
Colorado State University-Pueblo settled with Grant Neal , who had provided investigators a recording of his alleged victim saying she had not been raped ( the accusation was actually brought by a third party ) .
Finally , Amherst College settled with a young man who had actually been the one who was sexually assaulted . The woman claimed she invited a friend over after the encounter because she was distraught , but in reality , she had invited another man over whom she had a crush on . She also texted a friend throughout the night about the first encounter , saying “ it 's pretty obvi [ sic ] I was n't an innocent bystander. ” She also complained that the second man was n't making a move on her , and did n't have sex with her until 5 a.m .
UPDATE : In a statement to the Federalist , Drake University 's director of public relations , Jarad Bernstein , said the school “ strongly disagrees ” with the claim that Rossley 's son was wrongfully expelled .
“ In response to Drake 's request for a partial motion to dismiss , the court recently decided to dismiss all claims against the University officials named in this case , and to dismiss a constitutional claim
against the University , ” he wrote in an email . “ This is a key step in the litigation and is consistent with the University 's commitment to vigorously defend this case . ”
More women in the U.S. are childless than at any other time since the government began keeping track , a new survey found .
Nearly half of women between the ages of 15 and 44 did not have kids in 2014 , up from 46.5 % in 2012 to 47.6 % in 2014 , according to new data from the U.S. Census Bureau 's Current Population Survey . The figure is the highest percentage since the Census Bureau started measuring it in 1976 .
Among women between 25 and 29 , 49.6 % were childless in 2014 , also an all-time high . In the group between 30 and 34 , 28.9 % were childless , up from 28.2 % in 2012 but below an all-time high of 29.7 % in 2010 .
As of 2013 , the general fertility rate in the U.S. , as measured by the number of babies women between 15 and 44 have over their lifetimes , had fallen for six straight years and sat at 1.86 , according to the New York Times . Maintaining a stable U.S. population would require a fertility rate of 2.1 .

Bombardier has confirmed it will miss yet another delivery target for the TTC 's $ 1-billion streetcar order . The Quebec-based rail manufacturer was supposed to have delivered almost 150 of the vehicles by now , but in May 2016 it set a new target of a cumulative total of 70 by the end of the year .
TTC streetcar 4417 moves along Queens Quay in May 2017 . Bombardier has again failed to meet a revised deadline for delivery of TTC streetcars . A company spokesperson blamed it on problems with the firm 's international supply chain . ( Randy Risling / Toronto Star )
In October , the company reduced that goal again to 65 . But on Thursday a Bombardier spokesperson said it now expects to produce just 63 by Dec. 31 . “ We 've confirmed to the TTC that we are mitigating issues in our supply chain and that a total of 63 cars will be shipped ( by the end of the year ) , ” said Eric Prudhomme in an email . “ We are working over the holidays to honour our commitment . ”

In response to the latest delay , TTC spokesperson Brad Ross said the order was “ unacceptably behind. ” As the delivery schedule has slipped the transit agency has been forced to keep older streetcars on the road for longer than planned , and deploy buses on some streetcar routes . The TTC says this has created a vehicle shortage that prevents it from maintaining planned service levels in some cases . “ We eagerly await more ( streetcars ) so we can deliver the transit service the people of Toronto need and deserve , ” Ross said . The agency placed the order for 204 larger , accessible streetcars in 2009 , with the contract stipulating delivery of the entire fleet by the end of 2019 . But by the end of last year , Bombardier had supplied only 30 vehicles . As of Thursday , the transit agency had 57 new cars on its property , with the next three in various stages of transit . CP Rail is expected to pick up the 61st for shipping from the company 's Thunder Bay , Ont . plant on Friday .
Prudhomme blamed Bombardier 's inability to meet the latest revised target on problems with the company 's international supply chain . He said company executives recently met with key suppliers to “ demand corrective measures to improve performance and accelerate delivery. ” He said that since launching a recovery plan last year that included expanding its production capability in Thunder Bay , Bombardier has more than doubled its rate of production .

In a related development Thursday , Metrolinx , the regional transit agency for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area , announced it was cutting the number of light rail vehicles it is purchasing from Bombardier by more than half , to 76 from 182 . The value of the contract , which was originally for cars to run on the Eglinton Crosstown and other Toronto-area LRT lines , was also reduced to $ 392 million from $ 770-million . The move comes after a bitter legal dispute over what Metrolinx says are unacceptable production delays . The TTC is already exploring the possibility of using an alternate company for its next purchase of streetcars once the 204-car Bombardier order is complete , but Ross would n't say whether the agency is considering following Metrolinx 's lead and reducing the size of its original purchase . “ We wo n't be commenting on Metrolinx 's actions today , ” he said .

Still , the populist , grass-roots challenge to the government could open new political terrain .
For outsiders , it may seem strange that this is happening just as the Palestinian leadership prepares a bid to join the United Nations in September that could cause Israel further diplomatic isolation and popular uprisings in the occupied West Bank . With the region in turmoil , a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems farther away than ever .
But it is probably the very remoteness of a solution as well as the decline in terrorist attacks of the past few years along with the growing national wealth that have allowed this movement to coalesce .
“ We 'd been accustomed to believing that everything that mattered was about security , ” Anat Ben-Simon , a Jerusalem psychologist , said in an interview . “ All other issues had to wait . And we were constantly on the verge of some solution . But now there is nothing on the horizon , it 's pretty quiet on the security front and people got sick and tired of waiting . Meanwhile Israel became insanely expensive with a handful of families controlling everything . ”

Daniel Doron , director of the Israel Center for Social and Economic Progress , a pro-market research institution , agreed . “ Monopolies and cartels dominate every sphere of life here , ” he said . “ After years of being exploited the Israeli consumer is waking up . There is a widespread feeling that people simply ca n't hack it . ”
Mr. Netanyahu quickly grasped the significance of the protests and , canceling a trip abroad , issued directives and plans to ease the burden on consumers . He has proposed new rules to make housing more affordable and has frozen gasoline prices , while his public responses have been dominated by bold talk of ending monopolies and sympathy for the demonstrators . On Sunday , the director general of the finance minister resigned as a result of the protests .
But Mr. Netanyahu may not have sidestepped the political risk . One of the most debated questions is whether the movement is creating an opening for the country 's battered and dormant political left to challenge his leadership . Many think the answer is yes but only if it stays focused on social and economic issues and avoids the geopolitical and security ones where its views are in the minority .

Last week , the powerful Histadrut labor federation announced its strong support for the protests .
“ The left has risen back to life , ” Shai Golden , deputy editor of the newspaper Maariv , said in a column on Sunday . “ It has n't yet dared to let the words ‘ occupation ' and ‘ settlements ' cross its lips and to cite the social and economic price that they have cost Israel over the course of the past four decades. ” The new movement , he added , would be “ the social left . ”
Two decades ago , when Yitzhak Rabin defeated Yitzhak Shamir for prime minister , ending 15 years of domination by the conservative Likud Party , Mr. Rabin spoke of the need “ to change the national order of priorities and the allocation of financial resources. ” He largely froze settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza and said he was redirecting resources to the towns in the Israeli Negev and Galilee .

The left today hopes to revive itself with similar plans . The mayor of Beersheba , Ruvik Danilovich , who is an independent with roots in Labor , said in an interview in Maariv on Sunday that the theme of the new movement is “ social justice , meaning a change in priorities. ” He listed education , health care and affordable housing . He added of the Saturday night protest , “ This was a landmark event . The norms that have been accepted in the past will not be in the future . ”
The left hopes that in the coming year or two it could sweep back to power through a focus on social issues and then , in the bargain , shift the country 's external policy . The left would heavily curtail settlement building in the West Bank and has shown greater willingness to yield territory to the Palestinians and to share Jerusalem in a two-state solution .
Others are skeptical . Yaron Deckel , the host of a popular morning radio discussion program , said in an interview that while he was amazed at the size of Saturday 's demonstration and the participation of people between ages 25 and 40 , the talk of some new revolutionary era was ill-informed .
“ There is more atmosphere than substance to the movement , ” he said . “ It 's summer , the kids are on holiday , you live in a tent , it 's fun . The demonstrations are not very focused . They are for a higher standard of living . Fine . But there is no danger to this government . ”
Still listed for protection west of Highway 97 , wolves are gaining ground . But people remain their biggest problem .
Washington 's newest wolf pack , the Loup Loup , has taken up residence near the towns of Twisp and Omak in Okanogan County .
The Methow pack was confirmed by the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday , following a cluster of public wolf sightings . The wolves , previously undocumented in the area , moved in on their own , continuing a westward expansion from Idaho and Montana .
The confirmation of the newest pack brings Washington 's total minimum number of packs to 17 , nearly all of them east of the Cascades . Wolves have also been spotted in the North Cascades near Hozomeen , Whatcom County , where they have been moving back and forth across the border with Canada . Federal and state wildlife agents intend to monitor the newest pack over the winter , and get a radio collar on one of the wolves in the summer of 2016 to follow the pack 's travels .
Ann Froschauer , spokeswoman for the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service , said the precise number of animals in the Loup Loup Pack is not yet known , but biologists tracked up to six animals traveling together in recent snows .
The state most recently counted the number of wolves at a minimum of 68 in Washington in 2014 , up from 27 just four years earlier . There will be a new count in the spring .
“ Obviously a new pack shows the population is recovering ; a new pack is a good signal that wolves are naturally re-establishing themselves in Washington , ” Froschauer said .
Shot , poisoned and trapped nearly to extinction in Washington and elsewhere by the 1920s and 1930s , wolves began their return to Washington in earnest about 15 years ago , with increased sightings leading to the first confirmed pack in 2008 north of Cle Elum .
It 's been a rocky road to recovery . People so far have proved the biggest block to the recovery and survival of a species that can travel 70 miles a day crossing major rivers , mountain ranges and lakes , and endure days without food and freezing temperatures .
The gray wolf is federally listed as an endangered species within the western two-thirds of Washington . East of Highway 97 , the wolves are not federally protected , but are listed for protection by the state of Washington .
Nonetheless at least half a dozen wolves have been killed by poachers since 2012 , including a Whitman County man fined $ 100 last September . Another wolf was struck and killed on Interstate 90 between North Bend and Snoqualmie Pass last April . State sharpshooters in helicopters shot and killed seven wolves in one pack north of Kettle Falls , Stevens County , in 2012 for preying on livestock .
Hundreds of thousands of acres of habitat in the packs ' home ranges in Eastern Washington burned in wildfires during the past two summers .
Yet wolves are still gaining ground in Washington .
“ This animal is doing very well , ” said Mike Jimenez , Northern Rocky Mountain wolf coordinator for the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . “ This is a very tenacious , robust , strong , highly mobile animal , widely distributed across the globe . The trouble is people are like that as well . The problem is , how do you fit this animal back on the landscape ? ”
As the number of wolves has grown in Washington , so have conflicts with people , resulting in more wolves shot or poached . That can make conflict worse .
“ You create problem packs when you take out leaders , ” said Mitch Friedman , executive director of the nonprofit Conservation Northwest . Advocates of wolf recovery , the group has been working to help manage conflict between people and wolves with nonlethal methods , including deploying range riders on horseback to help guard their stock .
“ Wolves are incredibly resilient , no one should worry about the population ever going away at this point , ” Friedman said . “ What we should worry about is effects on their behavior because of human-caused dynamics . ”
Donny Martorello , wolf policy lead for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife , said at this point the department 's recovery plan is on track for canis lupis but when it comes to Homo sapiens , it 's a struggle . “ In terms of the numerical side of the recovery , wolves are doing what they need to do with very little effort by the state , ” Martorello said . “ It 's the people that seem to be the biggest challenge .
“ One of our goals is also to promote an understanding for wolves and coexistence . That is the one we are looking at and struggling with the most , we have seen the least amount of progress there . It 's really a people issue , a social carrying capacity , if you will . ”
The state has hired an outside conflict resolution expert , and expanded its citizen advisory panel to include more points of view , including hunters . “ We are hoping to break the pattern as wolf recovery goes on , we want to see the public understanding grow toward coexistence . ”
The wolves colonizing Washington now are mostly radiating from the original population from Canada moved by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994 to jump start recovery , with a reintroduction of 31 wolves in Yellowstone National Park and 35 in Central Idaho . Those animals have been multiplying and dispersing ever since .
There were at least 1,657 wolves counted in Idaho , Montana and Wyoming last year in 282 packs , including 85 breeding pairs .
Oregon last year had at least 77 wolves in 15 packs and eight breeding pairs . Washington now has 17 packs . Last year it had five breeding pairs and at least 68 wolves .
Jimenez is not surprised wolves have made it as far west as they have ; it seems only a matter of time before they make it south of I-90 , and then move on to the Olympics , packed with deer , elk and other prey . Wolves are hard-wired to disperse , with young on their own and on the move by the time they are 3 , in search of mates and territory of their own .
Wolves are also legendary travelers . A collared wolf was tracked from Cody , Wyoming to the north rim of the Grand Canyon last winter , Jimenez said . Another roamed from Bozeman to Vail , some 400 miles in a straight line . A year-and-a-half-old female traveled more than 3,000 miles in just six months .
Wolves have swum the Snake River to recolonize Oregon and Washington , and a wolf crossed the Cascades last April — only to get killed on I-90 . At least one wolf has made it as far as California .
“ There is n't much that stops them , ” Jimenez said . “ If you give them a little bit of protection from human persecution and they have an adequate prey base they respond very quickly , and come back . ”

Donald Trump will receive his first classified briefing at FBI headquarters on Wednesday . | AP Photo Trump : DOJ 'has to be ashamed ' over Clinton emails
The Department of Justice `` has to be ashamed '' with the way it handled its investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private server to handle classified information as secretary of state , Donald Trump said in a new interview aired Wednesday discussing his concerns about his opponent receiving classified briefings .
Asked specifically about public concerns regarding both him and Clinton receiving classified briefings , Trump remarked to Fox News ' Ainsley Earhardt on Tuesday night in Milwaukee that he is `` worried about [ Clinton ] getting it because of her email situation . She ca n't keep anything private . ''
Story Continued Below
`` I think her email scandal is one of the worst things I 've ever seen . She deleted 33,000 emails which is a crime , what she did is a crime , and to think that you have subpoenas and you 're deleting emails , it 's unthinkable . And I think probably her single greatest achievement in her life will be getting out of that mess because — and I do n't think she 's really out of it . I ca n't believe that she 's out of it , but Justice has to be ashamed . Justice has to be ashamed , '' Trump said . `` When you look at — when you look at the fact that she did so many things wrong . When you just look at the volume of — you know , I call her crooked Hillary — you look at the volume of things she did wrong , and for her to get away with that is , to me , I think it 's very hard to believe . ''
Trump himself will receive his first classified briefing at FBI headquarters later Wednesday .
Former UN Ambassador John Bolton , who now serves as a foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney , appears to be taking a page from Michele Bachmann with a new claim that the Obama administration is going to begin limiting free speech and expression to prohibit anti-Muslim rhetoric . While speaking to Frank Gaffney on Secure Freedom Radio , Bolton agreed with Gaffney that the State Department under Secretary Hillary Clinton is working with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) to curtail the freedom of speech and begin “ reinstitute blasphemy laws. ” He even warned that there are people within the Obama administration who have hate speech laws “ on their agenda ” and made the absurd assertion that Secretary Clinton is opposed to the freedom of expression .
Listen :
Bolton : I am very worried that under the Obama administration we are submitting to this claim that people have to temper their free speech rights to be respectful of what the OIC claims is the appropriate standard . Take the US embassy in Cairo 's first statement which apologize for this film as if appeasement was going to stop the mob from coming over the embassy 's wall , while it 's true that the Obama administration repudiated that statement honestly if you look carefully at what the President and particularly Secretary Clinton said since then they still are apologizing for this act , scurrilous though it might be , of an American private citizen . And it ties in directly — it 's a direct analytical predicate for the claim that it 's the movie that 's the whole problem with the riots and demonstrations in the Middle East . I think this is something that we need a broader public debate about because the notion that somehow we 're going to reinstitute blasphemy laws in the United States is something the overwhelming majority of Americans would react instinctively against .
Gaffney : Yet we are seeing as a result of something called the Istanbul process , which as you mentioned Secretary State Hillary Clinton has been involved , John Bolton , which produced last December a resolution in the Human Rights Council which is aimed at trying to prevent defamation of religions and goes beyond really what Mrs. Clinton has talked about in terms of ‘ old fashioned peer pressure and shaming ' as instruments of suppressing free expression that offends Muslims . It seems uniquely geared towards Muslims by the way , I 've not heard anybody saying we have to be impeded people from being critical of Christians or Jews or Hindus or anybody else . But John Bolton to the extent to what we have been seeing elsewhere around the world , notably the prosecution of Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Lars Hedegaard in Denmark and Mark Steyn and Ezra Levant in Canada to what amounts to hate speech . Do you think we 're on a track in this country , maybe under the guise of incitement , of a similar kind of constraint on freedom of expression if the Obama administration has its way ?
Bolton : I think there are people who clearly have that on their agenda ; I do n't see how we can blanket that reality . I do think that it comes in with a deceptively cautious approach to say ‘ we just want people to be respectful , ' well fine that 's a decision each individual makes . But the whole point of our first amendment which I think distinguishes us from every other country around the world and is another example of American exceptionalism is that the government does not interfere with the content of speech , that is up to the political opinion of each speaker . That favorite liberal icon , Justice Brennan , in that famous iconic case New York Times v. Sullivan , said that debate in America should be uninhibited , robust and wide-open , and I say I stand with Justice Brennan and against Secretary Clinton on that point .
Gaffney : Amen .
Foreign ministers of the `` Friends of Syria '' group are holding talks in Doha , the Qatari capital , to discuss how to organise the delivery of military and other kinds of aid for Syrian rebels .
Saturday 's meeting began only hours after Syrian rebels stated that they had received a new shipment of weapons from their allies and just days after the US announced its decision to deliver arms to the fighters .
The gathering is discussing demands for more weapons by the rebels who are requesting anti-tank and anti-air missiles to fight against government forces , an issue that has been on the table for months .
The talks are being attended by ministers from Britain , France , the US , Germany , Italy , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , the United Arab Emirates , Turkey and Egypt .
Al Jazeera 's Basma Atassi , reporting from the meeting , said British Foreign Secretary William Hague defined the talks as `` an opportunity to coordinate the thinking and action '' of the eleven-state group .
`` There is no change in the UK policy towards Syria and on the much debated question of providing lethal aid of any kind to the opposition , '' Hague said . `` We have taken no decision to do that . ''
He also said it is up to the UK parliament to take such a decision , adding that his country would focus on delivering more humanitarian aid and promoting a political solution . `` At the end there is only a political solution to this conflict , '' he said .
'Coordinated efforts '
`` The goal of the meeting is to be very concrete about the importance of every kind of assistance that 's coming from the London 11 countries [ Friends of Syria ] ... being fully coordinated and going through only the Syrian opposition coalition , '' a US official told the AFP news agency on Friday .
`` This is all in support of energising , re-energising , the Syrian opposition coalition leadership to work to select its leadership , '' the official said on condition of anonymity .
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the meeting would also address how to coordinate Western aid .
`` We will try in Doha to sum up the situation on the ground and to see how we can aid the opposition coalition and arrive at a political solution , '' he said .
Western aid for opposition forces so far has been confined to non-military resources like sophisticated communications equipment .
The Syrian rebels recently announced that they had received a new delivery of weapons .
`` We 've received quantities of new types of weapons , including some that we asked for and that we believe will change the course of the battle on the ground , '' Louay Muqdad , a media spokesman for the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) , the armed umbrella organisation of the Syrian rebels , told AFP .
`` We have begun distributing them on the front lines , they will be in the hands of professional officers and FSA fighters . ''
The shipment follows reports of Saudi-funded small arms and anti-tank missiles being delivered to Aleppo , where rebels are facing a build-up of regime forces , which are being supplied by Russia .
The White House last week declared that Syria had crossed a `` red line '' by using chemical weapons in the country 's civil war , and in response , US President Barack Obama had authorized sending arms to some rebel groups .
Al Jazeera 's James Bays , reporting from Doha , said the eleven countries who support the opposition are at an important crossroads .
`` There are divisions [ as to whether ] arming the opposition is the best way to solve the crisis , '' Bays said pointing at France and UK as the leading supporters of delivering arms to the opposition forces .
Geneva push
The meeting in Doha also aims to create momentum for starting peace talks in Geneva to end the crisis .
Russia and Western countries have agreed to push the process to encourage the Syrian regime and the opposition to sit down at the negotiation table for talks in the Swiss city .
Ben Rhodes , Obama 's deputy national security adviser , said that as long as there is a conflict , there remains a need to find a framework for a dialogue because ultimately the Syrian opposition and some parts of the government are going to have to find a political solution .
`` We are trying to find a way for the Russians to play some type of constructive role and to stay engaged in the process , '' Rhodes said , referring to Moscow 's continued support of Assad 's government , adding that Geneva is the only framework that currently existed .
Regarding discussions on peace talks , Bays said that there is a great deal of division between the West and Russia .
“ No one believes that those talks can take place unless both sides are brought to the table by the joint will of the US and Russia , ” he said .
A lot of people do n't remember that Johnson 's Great Society economic programs were radical , in their day . The Economic Opportunity Act created Head Start , the Job Corps , and a host of other programs . The Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the first time pumped a lot of federal money into education . The Social Security Act of 1965 created Medicare and Medicaid . Johnson signed the Wilderness Act , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities . Many of these were enormously controversial . Johnson also had to figure out what to do about Vietnam . That he failed so disastrously on that only underscores how much he had to deal with .
In 1964 , Johnson pushed through the Civil Rights Act . In 1965 , Johnson pushed through the Voting Rights Act . Both were inflammatorily divisive . Tapes of Johnson 's White House phone calls have revealed just how much pressure he brought to bear on timorous Democrats in Congress . After succeeding , he legendarily told his top aides that they had lost the South for a generation . He was right . The political cost was enormous . And he did it despite having so much else to deal with , while the country was slowly being torn apart . He did n't wait for the most politically opportune time . He did n't wait until he had finished with other priorities . He did it because it was a priority . He did it because it was the right thing to do . He did it because he was the president , and he had a chance to make historic decisions that would move the country forward .

( CBS News ) WASHINGTON - On the heels of the government 's embarrassingscandal in Las Vegas involving the General Services Administration , or GSA , comes word that a high-ranking Homeland Security official has pleaded guilty in a travel fraud ring that defrauded taxpayers out of at least $ 600,000 .
Forty-eight-year old James Woosley headed Intelligence for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) under Homeland Security ( DHS ) . Justice Department officials say that , among other crimes , Woosley faked expense reports for more than a dozen trips , and helped others do the same in exchange for kickbacks . Woosley used $ 5,000 of the taxpayer 's money to buy a boat , and nearly $ 16,000 for a real estate investment .
Officials say Woosley got help from several ICE employees , including his personal assistant Lateisha Rollerson with whom he developed `` a close , personal relationship . '' The two lived together and often traveled together on business trips . Rollerson pleaded guilty earlier to creating the fraudulent travel vouchers and documents to support Woosley 's fake expenses .
In some instances , other ICE employees stayed at Woosley 's Virginia home when travelling to Washington , D.C. on business , then created false hotel receipts . Woosley then took a kickback from their receipts .
Woosley `` abused his sensitive position of trust to fleece the government by submitting phony paperwork for and taking kickbacks from subordinates who were also on the take , '' said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen , Jr. who helped prosecute the case .
Besides Rollerson and Woosley , three others also plead guilty earlier in the scheme . They include ICE supervisory intelligence research specialist 64-year old Ahmen Adil Abdallat , ICE intelligence research specialist 53-year old William Korn , and ICE contractor 61-year old Stephen Henderson .
Woosley faces 18-27 months in prison and a fine . He has agreed to forfeit the stolen money .
BETHLEHEM ( Ma'an ) -- On the 28th anniversary of the Palestinian Declaration of Independence , Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) Saeb Erekat lauded the “ historic declaration ” for its role in paving the way for Palestinian statehood .
In a statement Tuesday , Erekat called on the international community to fulfill its “ political and ethical duties ” in order to “ translate this declaration into a reality , by embodying the state of Palestine on the ground . ''
That declaration of independence , he said , laid the foundation for future achievements `` towards realizing the legitimate rights of our people . ''
The Palestinian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed by Yasser Arafat , the chairman of the PLO , on Nov. 15 , 1988 , during the 19th session of the Palestine National Council ( PNC ) in Algiers .

Indie video games have become the premier arena for artists to explore unconventional settings and themes atypical of mainstream video games . Firewatch is a first-person adventure game that takes place just after the 1988 Yellowstone fires , while last year 's Sunset is a point-and-click title starring a maid who develops a relationship with her employer , a ruthless dictator . A new game scheduled for release in 2017 , The Church in the Darkness , is continuing indie games ' exciting new territory by taking inspiration from the 1978 Jonestown massacre .
From the appropriately-named studio Paranoid Productions , The Church in the Darkness follows Vic , a former law enforcement officer who travels to South America to rescue his nephew Alex from a dangerous cult . The game is a top-down infiltration game akin to Hotline Miami and Metal Gear Solid and allows players freedom to decide how to engage with enemies who stand in their way . Players can avoid detection altogether , kill a few , or go full Rambo , but whatever action they take has consequences .
The Church in the Darkness stars Ellen McClain ( best known as GLaDOS from Valve 's Portal ) and John Patrick Lowrie ( Sniper in Team Fortress 2 ) as the “ intense ” Rebecca and Isaac Walker , leaders of the Collective Justice Mission who relocate their members following persecution from the U.S. federal government .
Jonestown and the actions of Jim Jones are n't directly mentioned on Paranoid Productions ' website , but the allusions are very clear within the game 's eerie trailer .
The Church in the Darkness will be available on PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and for PC and Mac on Steam .
The Stanford Israel Association ( SIA ) —a student group at the California-based university that claims it “ aims to engage Stanford students with all that the Jewish State has to offer , through culture , politics , and identity ” —pulled its support for a program highlighting the stories of Israel 's minority populations .
In a statement released on Facebook late Sunday to announce its decision , SIA cited “ a combination of procedural issues and concerns raised by the University regarding past behavior by the organization due to speak , ” Reservists on Duty ( RoD ) .

The event , “ Stories From Israeli Minorities , ” was scheduled to take place less than 24 hours later at the campus 's Hillel facility . Instead , Stanford Chabad stepped in to host RoD Monday night , and the event went on as planned .
“ Our ultimate goal as the premier pro-Israel group at Stanford is to advocate for a more positive campus conversation regarding the Jewish state , ” SIA told the Haym Salomon Center regarding its decision . “ Given the concerns raised to us from the Stanford administration regarding RoD 's past behavior on other campuses , we do not believe this event would have furthered that goal . We regret not being able to promote the voices of Israel 's minorities , as was the purpose of the event , though we are certainly looking into opportunities to do so in the near future . ”
While the reference to RoD 's “ past behavior on other campuses ” remains unclear , the most recent noteworthy event took place in May 2017 at University of California , Irvine .
Hosted by Students Supporting Israel , IDF reservists speaking on behalf of RoD had to be escorted out by police following a violent protest by anti-Israel students . The Jewish , Christian and Muslim IDF delegation was on campus to counter “ Israeli Apartheid Week ” events at the university .
The protest was documented on video by smartphone cameras , ultimately leading to the anti-Zionist group Students for Justice in Palestine being placed on disciplinary probation for two academic years .
“ As a Jew , I do n't know what to say to the delegation [ that was scheduled to speak at Stanford ] , ” said Amit Deri , founder of RoD . “ They are a group of minorities , one Druze , one Bedouin , one Muslim and one Arab , who suffered a lot of criticism from the Arab community in Israel . They 've flown all the way from Israel to San Francisco for an event that was confirmed a month ago . And now , a few hours before it was to begin , they cancel it . I do n't know what to say to my people . I felt ashamed . ”
He added , “ As far as ‘ past behavior ' is concerned , our ‘ past behavior ' at UC Irvine resulted in the sanctioning of SJP because they shut down our event . When I saw the SIA statement , I did n't know what to think . This Arab delegation came all the way from Israel , left their jobs . They 're not getting paid , they are all volunteers . They left their life behind , suffered a lot of criticism from their society because they chose to defend Israel abroad—and hours before the event , they say they are canceling . I think it 's a shame . We felt very offended . ”
Stanford Hillel said in a statement that it chose to cancel the RoD event “ due to concerns raised by the University. ” The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment seeking clarification about its “ concerns . ”
“ Fortunately our partners at Chabad are able to host the program and we are encouraging students to attend with our executive director , Rabbi Jessica Kirschner , ” Hillel officials said before the event ultimately took place Monday at the Chabad . “ Canceling the event was a mistake , and we apologize for any confusion or inconvenience . ”
Deri said the delegation was comforted that Chabad agreed to host the program . Attendees heard the personal stories of the non-Jewish reservists , who spoke about being minorities in Israel , their love for the Jewish state and their desire to defend the country .
The current RoD delegation will be speaking at colleges and communities across the U.S. in California , Arizona , Minnesota , Pennsylvania and New York , covering 12 cities . The tour concludes Oct. 28 and includes reservists who identify as Palestinian and Christian , as well as a Muslim woman who is sharing her feelings about Israel providing opportunities she would never have anywhere else in the Middle East .
Jamie Carragher is puzzled why no one ever tried to sign him from Liverpool
Jamie Carragher : Surprised no one tried to sign him
Carragher 's 737th appearance for Liverpool against Queens Park Rangers ended an illustrious 16-year spell at Anfield and the former England international has revealed he is puzzled as to why he was never linked with a possible move away .
`` I never really had the option to leave - I do n't know whether it was a good thing or bad thing , '' Carragher is quoted as saying in The Sun . `` Maybe no-one rates me !
`` I 've never even been close . My agent has never rung me up and said , 'This team fancy buying you ' . Not once .
`` Maybe I was always seen as 'Mr Liverpool ' , I suppose . You 'll have to ask different managers . But I 'd never have left in any circumstances .
`` Maybe those managers realised that . Or , like I said , they just did n't fancy me .
`` And I ca n't say I ever thought about leaving when I was n't in the side . You have good times and bad times at your club .
`` It 's like being a supporter . You do n't stop supporting your team because of a bad run .
`` And we 've had some great times here , won some big trophies . So I feel lucky and privileged . ''
From day one of its existence , the sole raison d'etre of the Hamas quasi-state in Gaza has been to kill Jews , the more the merrier .
Since taking over the Gaza Strip in 2007 , Hamas has siphoned off billions of dollars of foreign aid money to build a vast labyrinth of underground tunnels , whose only purpose is to hide rockets to be launched at Israel 's civilian population and to facilitate mass terror attacks in the form of cross border raids on kibbutzim , moshavim and towns close to the border .
All the human energy of the Gaza Strip has gone into the digging of the tunnels , often by hand . The very magnitude of the effort both impresses and depresses , for it is a measure of the hatred of Jews of Hamas and its followers .
Hamas proudly proclaims its goal of reclaiming the entirety of Palestine and killing all the Jews in its Charter . Article VI of the Charter announces that the Islamic Resistance Movement exists to raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine . Article VII states that the final resurrection will not come until Muslims fight the Jews and the very trees call out , “ There is a Jew hiding behind me . Come and kill him . ”
The Charter goes on to explain why no Jewish state can exist . Palestine has belonged to the Islamic Waqf from time immemorial and will do so until the resurrection ( Article XI ) , and whoever renounces even one inch of it is as if he had renounced Islam ( Article XIII ) . Peace conferences and efforts at a permanent settlement with Israel are decried as no more than an effort to introduce non-believers as arbitrators over the lands of Islam ( Article XIII ) . Finally , it is the binding duty of every Muslim to engage in jihad to liberate Palestine ( Article XV ) .
NOR ARE THE CITIZENS OF GAZA “ free of all sin , ” as they are so often described . In 2006 , Hamas won a decisive majority of seats in the Palestinian parliament . And in 2007 , it seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority with surprising ease . Palestinians , including the vast majority of Gazans , voted for Hamas with full knowledge of its Charter and utter rejection of Israel 's existence . Like most ideological movements , Hamas has always put its beliefs front and center and made no effort to hide them .
Since 2007 , Hamas 's popularity has been greatest among the population of Gaza when its operatives succeeded in killing Jews , and its claim to superiority over Fatah has always been that it is a more effective fighting force against Israel . Were Hamas 's rockets enjoying more success killing Jews today , Gazans would again be celebrating wildly and passing out sweet candies.v
There have been no widespread protests in Gaza against Hamas 's diverting most of its foreign aid into creating the infrastructure for attacking the Jews . Even before the 2006 Palestinian elections , Gazans revealed themselves to be far more focused on destroying Israel than on the development of their own society . When Israel evacuated the Gaza Strip in 2005 , it left behind 3,000 productive and highly profitable hothouses to help build a viable Palestinian economy . But instead of taking advantage of that largesse , Gazans trashed the hot houses and began shooting rockets at Israel at far faster clip than prior to the Israeli withdrawal .
In short , Gaza 's citizens are no less complicit with the Hamas regime than were overwhelming the majority of German civilians , who eagerly supported Hitler 's war aims .
THE EXISTENCE OF THE ATTACK TUNNELS under Israel 's border and the threat to the life and safety of Israeli citizens they represent would have fully justified a pre-emptive strike to destroy those tunnels . But that is not what happened . Hamas initiated the current conflict . The kidnapping and murder of Eyal Yifrach , Gil-ad Shaer , and Naftali Fraenkel was carried out by Hamas operatives acting on orders from above . That kidnapping was then followed by the firing of hundreds of rockets at Israel , and the firing of rockets on Israeli civilians has continued without break .
Despite the fact that Hamas was and remains the clear aggressor , continuing to fire rockets at Israel and mount cross-border raids , major European capitals erupted last week in mass demonstrations denouncing Israel “ genocidal ” aggression on the innocent Palestinians of Gaza . None of those demonstrators , it should be noted , previously bestirred themselves to protest the more than 150,000 Syrian civilians killed over the past three years ( 700 in two days last week alone ) , or the truly genocidal campaign of Sudanese Muslims against their black , co-religionists in Darfur , or the systematic expulsion of Christians from every place in the Muslim Middle East . Somehow the only dead children that move them are those who die as a result of Israeli military action .
Nor have the demonstrators felt any imperative to distinguish between their hatred of Israel and their hatred of Jews . Synagogues have come under siege and Jewish businesses burned to the ground . The dogs of anti-Semitism have been loosed once again in Europe and they will not be soon contained . Three-quarters of France 's Jewish community , Europe 's largest , are contemplating aliyah , as France become increasingly unlivable for Jews . The Jews of Great Britain and Belgium may not be far behind .
BUT EVEN MORE DISTRESSING THAN THE OPEN ANTI-SEMITES are the nincompoops who enable Hamas 's strategy of maximizing civilian casualties . The list is a long one , but includes CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , who badgered Infrastructure Minister Naftali Bennett to tear kriah and confess Israel 's sins over the apparent deaths of four children on a Gaza beach from an errant Israeli artillery shell ; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon labeling Israel 's actions in Gaza City 's Shejaiya neighborhood “ atrocious ; ” Secretary of State John Kerry'angry and sarcastic comment ( caught when he thought he was off-camera ) about Palestinian deaths in house to house fighting — “ It 's a hell of a pinpoint action ; it 's a hell of a pinpoint action ; ” and President Obama 's “ growing concern ” about rising civilian casualties .
Blitzer knows that no Israeli intended to kill four children . But every single one of the 1700 plus rockets fired by Hamas in the current round of fighting was intended to kill as many Israelis as possible . And by what standards do Ban Ki-Moon and Kerry term Israel 's actions “ atrocious ” or less than “ pinpoint. ” Palestinian civilians were given two days warning to leave the neighborhood . But Hamas cynically ordered them to stay and blocked their flight . In both international law and morality that makes Hamas the culpable party for their deaths , as Israeli soldiers battled their way through the neighborhood uncovering multiple high-value military targets , while exposed to sniper fire , mines and booby-trapped houses .
Over 80 % of the Palestinian casualties so far have been males – 50 % between the ages of 18 and 28 and 66 % between 18 and 38 . Israel actually seems to be doing a remarkably good job of minimizing non-combatant deaths . As Lt. Col. Richard Kemp , High Commander of British NATO forces in Afghanistan , and a man with unparalleled experience in asymmetric warfare has said many times , no country in the history of warfare has taken more extraordinary measures to protect civilian lives than Israel . Does Kerry have the foggiest notion of how many innocent civilians have been killed by U.S. drones in Afghanistan , Pakistan and Yemen , or were killed by NATO bombing in the Balkans , in situations where ground troops were far from harms way ?
The Western media also encourages Hamas 's strategy of self-inflicted civilian deaths with its mindless narrative of cycle of violence and comparisons of the deaths on both sides , as a measure of right and wrong . But the repeated military conflicts with Hamas are not a Hatfield-McCoy feud in which every death on one side must be avenged by more deaths on the other side . One side initiated the war and that same side could end it by renouncing its desire to go on killing Jews . Israel is fighting to remove mortal threats to its civilian population , not for revenge .
The media treats the lack of Israeli civilian casualties as proof that Hamas 's rockets are a mere most a nuisance , hardly worth getting riled about . But the $ 50,000- $ 100,000 cost of each Iron Dome missile fired , the hundreds of millions of shekels in losses to the Israeli economy daily from mobilization , and , most of all , the psychological trauma on Israeli civilians from continually rushing for shelters are not trivial . Iron Dome is a welcome tool . But allowing Jews to be turned into ducks in a shooting gallery until Hamas improves its aim is not a strategy .
Comparative casualties , whether civilian or military , tell us absolutely nothing about moral culpability . War is not some kind of perverse boxing match where one can only strike one 's opponent as often as he strikes you . When war is justified , the goal is to win , and a war of self-defense is always justified . Germany and Japan 's civilian casualties dwarfed those of the Allies in World War II , as Prime Minister Netanyahu frequently notes . Did that make Germany and Japan right , despite being the aggressors ?
By focusing on Palestinian casualties as the crucial metric , President Obama and his secretary of state are doing nothing but paving the way for the next round of war and yet more Palestinian casualties . Instead of moving to deny Israel victory and the opportunity to uproot the terrorist infrastructure , they should be figuring out how to secure a peace that removes Hamas 's attack tunnels and rockets once and for all – something a little more effective , if you please , than UN Security Council Resolution 1701 ending the Second Lebanon War , which did nothing to prevent Hezbollah from doubling its pre-War missile arsenal .
In the meantime , Israel should heed the advice of Powerline blogger Scott Johnson and “ pay zero attention to world opinion when world opinion is certifiably insane . ”
Sometimes simple is best and I am one happy girl with this dish . This Roasted Sweet Potato Hash with Avocado Yogurt Sauce contains all of my favorite ingredients !
We started by roasting potatos ( such as Yukon Gold or Russet ) along with the sweet potatos . You could par-boil them so they roast more quickly , but I found they break down a bit more than with just roasting them . I also love the flavor of roasted vegetables .
We steamed and halved the brussel spouts and caramelized the pearl onions . Do n't skip this part ! Caramelizing the onions really adds so much to the dish . They are so sweet , I kept eating them straight from the pan like candy 🙂
Then we added these cute little squash called Pattypan which we sliced and pan sauteed . They are so small , they do n't take very long at all . If you ca n't find them , just use yellow squash or….even corn would be great here .
Lastly , we sauteed a small amount of red pepper for garnish , but you could also use prepared pimento if you have it . Garnish with a bit of parsley , season with salt and pepper to taste and serve hot along with a side of our cool avocado yogurt sauce ( recipe below ) .

'Neymar antics will prevent him reaching Messi level ' - Lustig takes aim at PSG star
The Celtic defender believes ongoing theatrics from the Brazilian forward mean that he will never be as revered as his former Barcelona team-mate
Neymar may be a €222 million footballer , but the forward will never receive the plaudits of Lionel Messi unless he cuts out the theatrics , says defender Mikael Lustig .
The Brazilian departed for the French capital over the summer in a record-breaking transfer .
PSG 11/2 Champions League winner
Such a switch was intended to take him out of the shadow of Messi and Co at Camp Nou and allow him to prosper as the leading light in another star-studded squad .
Lustig , though , has warned that while there is no questioning the 25-year-old 's ability , his attitude may end up denying him the plaudits which continue to be bestowed upon an iconic former team-mate .
After seeing Neymar booked for diving in a clash at Parkhead on Tuesday , Lustig said : “ It was the same as usual from Neymar . He is an unbelievable footballer but we have seen the other stuff before and we will see it again .
“ I have said before that it 's part of his game . He tries to over-react a bit to make the defender step off . We will see it again and again .
“ If he wants to be liked as much as Messi , maybe he needs to stop that . ”
Lustig added after a 5-0 defeat for Celtic which saw 18-year-old defender Anthony Ralston involved in a long-running battle with Neymar : “ He 's up there with the best already – he 's so sharp and is an amazing footballer .
“ Neymar is probably the toughest opponent in the world right now but Anthony did well . ”
PSG 's big-money signing was among the goals in Glasgow , along with fellow frontmen Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani .
While he may not be a fan of some of the methods employed by the giants , Lustig concedes that they are now a force to be reckoned with on a continental stage .

The international said : “ PSG are probably up there with the very best teams I have faced . They have world-class players in every position .
“ They are probably better than Barcelona last year with no weak links . Every single player is unbelievable on the ball .
“ If you spend a lot of money , it is no shock you will have a team like that . ”
The Associated Press and other news organizations have officially taken the position that President Barack Obama should release visual proof of Osama bin Laden 's death , claiming that without this level of transparency the White House is essentially deciding what is and is not newsworthy .
In an interview with The Atlantic Wire , AP senior managing editor Michael Oreskes explained the organization 's position is that proof should be released to professional journalists , who would then decide whether to release the media or merely describe it .
“ This information is important for the historical record , ” he reportedly said . “ That 's our view . ”
AP and other news organizations filed Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests last week in hopes of triggering the release of visual confirmation of bin Laden 's death . After a fierce internal debate that split the president 's aides , Obama has maintained that he will not approve the release due to national security concerns .
“ It is very important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of someone who was shot in the head are not floating around as incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool , ” Obama said during a recent interview with CBS News . “ That 's not who we are . We do n't trot out this stuff out as trophies . ”
“ We 're asking to see it , ” AP 's Oreskes told The Atlantic Wire . “ It 's about us saying we would like to make our own news judgements about newsworthy material . ”
Oreskes added that the AP has not decided whether or not to publish the media , should it be released .
Unlike President Obama , the Bush administration made a point of releasing images showing a number of high value targets who had been killed in military operations , like the sons of Saddam Hussein . A video of Hussein 's execution by hanging was also leaked onto the Internet by an unknown source , but it did not come from official channels .
One possible compromise solution , which parody news host Jon Stewart argued for , is showing the images to media professionals and allowing them to describe it in written reports .
“ The extremists over there already hate us and I do n't know if you know this , but the Muslim world sees pretty graphic images of people we kill on purpose or accidentally all the time , ” he said .
Recent polling shows that about two in three Americans agree with the president 's decision to keep the photos under-wraps .
The Pentagon has instead released several short videos , with audio removed , showing bin Laden examining media coverage about himself and speaking into the camera .
Officials claimed the footage was among data culled from the terrorist leader 's computers , which were seized during last week 's Navy SEAL raid .

There are too many different types of noodles in Vietnam cuisine . This photo shows that noodles using in Cao Lau after being boiled still need to be well prepared . Here in the kitchen , family members of Van Loc cao lau restaurant are detaching the noodles prior to service .

Cao Lầu Recipe
The cook who wrote this recipe is Cẩm Tuyết , a VN television chef . For English readers , just ignore the marks that are used in Vietnamese here . I include the marks because without them , they lose the meanings , and often confuse a lot of Vietnamese readers . So here it is :
1 . Water source : In Hội An ( Faifo ) and surroundings such as Cẩm Khê , there still remain old square wells that the Cham people dug from hundreds of years ago . Water from these wells is used for drinking and cooking , and it has a unique flavor . The most famous well is Bá Lễ .
2 . Lye solution : Lye is made from ashes of trees . Different trees give different lye solutions . This particular lye solution that is used to make cao lầu 's noodle is from `` tro '' tree grown in Cham Island nearby .
3 . Rice : The rice to make cao lầu 's noodle is of a local rice variety . The rice used is neither freshly harvested nor too aged . The rice is washed , soaked in Hội An 's well water and lye solution . After that the soaked rice is ground into a thick paste , poured into cotton bags to drain excess water . The paste becomes dough , and is kneaded . The thin dough is briefly steamed , cut into strings , and steamed again until the noodle becomes completely cooked . The noodle is left in open air for its surface to dry . When used , the noodle is blanched briefly in hot water . Cao lầu 's noodle has more texture and does n't have a sour flavor of regular rice noodle .
4 . Xá xíu ( Translator : This is Vietnamese pronunciation of Chinese barbecue pork , char siu ) : About 500g lean pork butt , cut to about 5cm thick . Mixture : 5g Chinese five-spice powder + 1/2 teaspoon salt + 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper + 1 tablespoon minced garlic + 2 tablespoons soy sauce . Marinate the pork in the mixture for 40 minutes . Heat a small pot in low heat , add 2 tablespoons cooking oil , and pan fry the pork a little , then add boiling water to cover the meat . You can also use coconut juice instead of water . Simmer until the liquid is reduced to little remaining . The pork should now be tender . When used , slice it into thin pieces .
5 . Stock : Cook 500g pork bones in 3 liters of water and 100 ( typo error ? ) dried shallots . Simmer and skim the fat often until about 2.5 liters stock is left . Remove the bones and shallot from the stock . Season the stock with salt and MSG ( Oriental food , of course ! ) to taste .
6 . Pork rind : Select the thinnest pork skin , and remove all the fat . Cut the skin to small pieces of about 2 cm wide , and marinate for 30 minutes in the same kind of mixture you use to make xá xíu . Deep fry ( in high heat ? ) the pork rind until crispy . Let the pork rind drain .
7 . Herb : Húng lủi ( Mentha aquatica L. ; water mint ) , cut to short stems . Chive , minced . Cilantro also .
8 . Presentation : Put noodle and water mint in a bowl . Place slices of xá xíu on top . Throw in some pork rind and minced chive . Pour just a litte of the stock into the bowl . Also throw in some cilantro on top . Put a dash of pepper .
9 . New modifications : Some people now add dry shrimp , dry squid in the soup stock to add more flavor with a ratio of 10g dry squid or shrimp and 1/2 liter of water . Some also use chicken stock instead , but this gives different flavor . Some add more varieties of herb , minced . Uncooked bean sprout , roasted peanut , rice crackers that are broken in small pieces ... are also used . Some even use ( boiled ) chicken meat cut into squares , sauteed shrimp . Some cao lầu noodle has a deep yellow color of tumeric , and is only seen in Saigon .

I recently attended `` The Golden Age of Couture '' exhibition in Bendigo ( Australia ) , which is based on this book . The pieces on display were utterly breath taking . Being highly interested in vintage fashion , I fell in love with the exhibiton and NEEDED to own the book ! The book has lots of pictures which are outweighed by informative text . The book is set up as follows : Introduction , Dior 's Golden Age , Inside Paris Haute Couture , London Couture , Textile Manufacturers & Haute Couture , Dior & Balenciaga , Cecil Beaton , The Visual Culture of Couture , The Legacy of Couture . This book is an exciting piece of fashion history , pieces made and worn by the rich and famous ... it 's all very decadent . A must-have for any aspiring designer . Get it for the information as much as the pictures . Very inspiring ! show more
Jonathan Chait sat down the with the president recently and gave us another peek inside the empty big back of fcks to give that the president has been toting around for a couple of years now . It 's a deep look inside one of the most creative and captivating minds ever to sit in that oval-shaped dungeon at the far end of Pennsylvania Avenue .
( Can I pre-order the memoir now ? )
If nothing else , the president 's musings on the nature of his political opposition should put to rest forever the notion that the president does n't understand the forces lined up against him . From New York :
When I came into office , my working assumption was that because we were in crisis , and the crisis had begun on the Republicans ' watch , that there would be a window in which they would feel obliged to cooperate on a common effort to dig us out of this massive hole . Probably the moment in which I realized that the Republican leadership intended to take a different tack was actually as we were shaping the stimulus bill , and I vividly remember having prepared a basic proposal that had a variety of components . We had tax cuts ; we had funding for the states so that teachers would n't be laid off and firefighters and so forth ; we had an infrastructure component . We felt , I think , that as an opening proposal , it was ambitious but needed and that we would begin negotiations with the Republicans and they would show us things that they thought also needed to happen . On the drive up to Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican Caucus , John Boehner released a press statement saying that they were opposed to the stimulus . At that point we did n't even actually have a stimulus bill drawn up , and we had n't meant to talk about it . And I think we realized at that point what proved to be the case in that first year and that second year was a calculation based on what turned out to be pretty smart politics but really bad for the country : If they cooperated with me , then that would validate our efforts . If they were able to maintain uniform opposition to whatever I proposed , that would send a signal to the public of gridlock , dysfunction , and that would help them win seats in the midterms . It was that second strategy that they pursued with great discipline . It established the dynamic for not just my presidency but for a much sharper party-line approach to managing both the House and the Senate that I think is going to have consequences for years to come .
It can be argued , and it has been , that the president trusted for too long in the good faith of the Republicans in Congress . ( Myself ? I thought 30 seconds was too long , but I understand that opinions on the topic vary . ) I think the president 's fundamental error lies in the fact that he fails to appreciate how far the prion disease of movement conservatism had progressed in the Republican party by the time he took office .
It was really strange , but at that point , Limbaugh had been much clearer about wanting to see me fail and had , I think , communicated that very clearly to his listeners . Fox News ' coverage had already started to drift in that direction , and what you realized during the course of the first six , eight , ten months of the administration was that the attitudes , the moods that I think Sarah Palin had captured during the election increasingly were representative of the Republican activist base , its core . It might not have been representative of Republicans across the country , but it meant that John Boehner or Mitch McConnell had to worry about that mood inside their party that felt that , No , we should n't cooperate with Obama , we should n't cooperate with Democrats ; that it represents compromise , weakness , and that the broader character of America is at stake , regardless of whatever policy arguments might be made .
All due respect to the president , but he came around when the symptoms of the prion disease had become so visible that you 'd have to have been a cable news pundit or Hugh Hewitt not to notice it . The party first ate the monkeybrains in the late 1970s , when the Southern strategy born in the 1960s came to full fruition by shoving the party 's centers of power south and west . ( Sidney Blumenthal 's The Rise of the Counter-Establishment remains the ur-text . ) By that point , the party had integrated into itself the emotional and political rubble of American apartheid so successfully that it was beginning to be able to roll back the achievements of the Civil Rights Movement .
( We have had two Chief Justices of the Supreme Court in the past 30 years . Both of them were appointed by Republican presidents . Both of them first made their conservative bones by seeking to roll back the Voting Rights Act , which the second of them has succeeded in doing . )
At the same time , the party allied itself with a vocal and politically active splinter of American Evangelical Protestantism . This allowed some of the wilder notions of American 20th Century conservativism to sneak back into Republican politics through the chapel doors . William F. Buckley did n't read the Birchers all the way out of the party . They remained close enough that Jerry Falwell could pray them back into it .
Since then , the progression has been steady and obvious , and a lot of it pre-dates the elevation of Sarah Palin to whatever place she currently occupies in our political life . Willful self-destructive stubbornness in the Congress was obvious when the Republicans took themselves completely over the cliff in the Terri Schiavo case . Republican leaders committed themselves to obstructing Bill Clinton as quickly and as publicly as they did the current president . ( As I recall , Bob Dole was particularly outspoken in this regard . ) Five years ago next month , Mark Warren and I drove up to Chappaqua for an interview with Clinton , and I think his take on what has happened to the Republican Party is a little bit more true to the history than the one in which the current president believes .
ESQUIRE : You stress that the antigovernment movement has been a long march . Are we now living through the inevitable conclusion of that long march ? Was it headed this way all along , or was there a moment when the Republicans could have turned away from the anti-intellectual , antiscience , no-tax-increases-of-any-kind kind of thing ? Was there a turning point where they could have said , We can be antigovernment to an extent , but we 're not going to go off the cliff ?
CLINTON : They could have done it if they had n't turned on the first President Bush . Because Reagan , you know , since he enacted that massive tax cut in '81 , they cut him some slack when he clawed back by 40 percent of it and signed the Social Security Commission 's recommendation . And they cut him some slack because it was working — because it was the first time we 'd ever run permanent deficits and that ignited a long stimulus . But if they 'd stayed with President Bush in '92 , they were in a place where they would always be to the right of the Democrats , but they were still basically a science-based , reality-based party . President Bush had signed some things — the Clean Air Act — which were very , very good . And the Americans with Disabilities Act . But he was conservative . He vetoed the Brady Bill — he gave in to the NRA — and he vetoed the Family and Medical Leave Act . But at least we were all sort of in a range of debate .
Obviously , I would trace it back further even than Clinton does , but there 's no question that Pat Buchanan 's bloody primary campaign against an incumbent Republican president who was pretty much the walking embodiment of the old Republican establishment brought to the fore a number of forces—xenophobia , racism , protectionism—that have powered the rise of Donald Trump . Buchanan cut up the elder President Bush so thoroughly that , by January of 1992 , it was hard to believe that , six months earlier , Bush had been so popular that he 'd scared off all the putative Democratic superstars except the governor of a small Southern state who was sharp enough to see down the road .
To me , the great failure of the elite political media in this election is not that they somehow `` normalized '' Donald Trump . Hell , the man is the nominee of one of the only two political parties we have decided to allow ourselves . The great failure in this year 's coverage is the failure to attach Trump to the Republican Party as the logical—nay , inevitable—product of three decades of deliberate political and policy choices . If El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago augurs in , this is going to enable the Republicans to claim that he was an aberration , and not a creature of their own , decades in the making .
That ensures that , sooner or later , we 're going to confront a Donald Trump who is a better politician and who does n't talk about his dick on the debate stage . That is a chilling prospect .

When Dr. Summers raised the issue to fellow economists and other researchers at a conference in 2005 , his hypothesis was caricatured in the press as a revival of the old notion that “ girls ca n't do math. ” But Dr. Summers said no such thing . He acknowledged that there were many talented female scientists and discussed ways to eliminate the social barriers they faced .
Yet even if all these social factors were eliminated , he hypothesized , the science faculty composition at an elite school like Harvard might still be skewed by a biological factor : the greater variability observed among men in intelligence test scores and various traits . Men and women might , on average , have equal mathematical ability , but there could still be disproportionately more men with very low or very high scores .
These extremes often do n't matter much because relatively few people are involved , leaving the bulk of men and women clustered around the middle . But a tenured physicist at a leading university , Dr. Summers suggested , might well need skills and traits found in only one person in 10,000 : the top 0.01 percent of the population , a tiny group that would presumably include more men because it 's at the extreme right tail of the distribution curve .
“ I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong , ” Dr. Summers told the economists , expressing the hope that gender imbalances could be rectified simply by eliminating social barriers . But he added , “ My guess is that there are some very deep forces here that are going to be with us for a long time . ”

Dr. Summers was pilloried for even suggesting the idea , and the critics took up his challenge to refute the hypothesis . Some have claimed he was proved wrong by recent reports of girls closing the gender gap on math scores in the United States and other countries . But even if those reports ( which have been disputed ) are accurate , they involve closing the gap only for average math scores — not for the extreme scores that Dr. Summers was discussing .
Some scientists and advocates for gender equity have argued that the remaining gender gap in extreme scores is rapidly shrinking and will disappear . It was called “ largely an artifact of changeable sociocultural factors ” last year by two researchers at the University of Wisconsin , Janet S. Hyde and Janet E. Mertz . They noted evidence of the gap narrowing and concluded , “ Thus , there is every reason to believe that it will continue to narrow in the future . ”
But some of the evidence for the disappearing gender gap involved standardized tests that are n't sufficiently difficult to make fine distinctions among the brighter students . These tests , like the annual ones required in American public schools , are limited by what 's called the ceiling effect : If you 're measuring people in a room with a six-foot ceiling , you ca n't distinguish among the ones taller than six feet .

Now a team of psychologists at Duke University has looked at the results of tests with more headroom . In an article in a forthcoming issue of the journal Intelligence , they analyze the test scores of students in the United States who took college admissions tests while they were still in the seventh grade . As part of an annual talent search since 1981 , the SAT and ACT tests have been given to more than 1.6 million gifted seventh graders , with roughly equal numbers of boys and girls participating .
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Duke researchers — Jonathan Wai , Megan Cacchio , Martha Putallaz and Matthew C. Makel — focused on the extreme right tail of the distribution curve : people ranking in the top 0.01 percent of the general population , which for a seventh grader means scoring above 700 on the SAT math test . In the early 1980s , there were 13 boys for every girl in that group , but by 1991 the gender gap had narrowed to four to one , presumably because of sociocultural factors like encouragement and instruction in math offered to girls .
Since then , however , the math gender gap has n't narrowed , despite the continuing programs to encourage girls . The Duke researchers report that there are still four boys for every girl at the extreme right tail of the scores for the SAT math test . The boy-girl ratio has also remained fairly constant , at about three to one , at the right tail of the ACT tests of both math and science reasoning . Among the 19 students who got a perfect score on the ACT science test in the past two decades , 18 were boys .
Meanwhile , the seventh-grade girls outnumbered the boys at the right tail of tests measuring verbal reasoning and writing ability . The Duke researchers report in Intelligence , “ Our data clearly show that there are sex differences in cognitive abilities in the extreme right tail , with some favoring males and some favoring females . ”
The researchers say it 's impossible to predict how long these math and science gender gaps will last . But given the gaps ' stability for two decades , the researchers conclude , “ Thus , sex differences in abilities in the extreme right tail should not be dismissed as no longer part of the explanation for the dearth of women in math-intensive fields of science . ”
Other studies have shown that these differences in extreme test scores correlate with later achievements in science and academia . Even when you consider only members of an elite group like the top percentile of the seventh graders on the SAT math test , someone at the 99.9 level is more likely than someone at the 99.1 level to get a doctorate in science or to win tenure at a top university .
Of course , a high score on a test is hardly the only factor important for a successful career in science , and no one claims that the right-tail disparity is the sole reason for the relatively low number of female professors in math-oriented sciences . There are other potentially more important explanations , both biological and cultural , including possible social bias against women .
But before we accept Congress 's proclamation of bias , before we start re-educating scientists at workshops , it 's worth taking a hard look at the evidence of bias against female scientists . That will be the subject of another column .
There is honesty , there is brutal honesty , and then there 's shooting yourself in the foot . Whoever changed the wording this oil change reminder sticker at the AutoMax in Pearland , Texas aimed a .50 caliber rifle at his sneaker and emptied the magazine .
It had been a few weeks since Ladonna Latham had her oil changed and was n't aware of a former AutoMax employee 's malice when , bored , she decided to read the oil change sticker . Stunned , she pulled over to make sure she was seeing correctly , then drove home and had her husband confirm it . Latham believed that she had been targeted by one of the employees .
According Max Manocheri , the manager at the AutoMax , a disgruntled former employee changed the phrasing in the computer system and several of the stickers were printed and ended up being used . Customers reacted in stride , though obviously shocked , he said , and he has apologized profusely to everyone affected , has offered to change the stickers and will offer a free oil change .
( And before you ask , no , there was n't an employee with a bag over his head working that day . )

Ahmed Mohamed spoke to the media in September about his arrest . Ahmed 's family is demanding $ 15 million total in damages and written apologies from the city of Irving , Texas , and the 14-year-old student 's former school district . Video by PBS NewsHour
The family of Ahmed Mohamed , the 14-year-old student from Irving , Texas , who was arrested after his homemade clock was mistaken for a hoax bomb , is demanding $ 15 million in damages and written apologies from two of the city 's leaders .
A lawyer for the family , Kelly D. Hollingsworth , sent letters to both the Texas city of Irving and its school district , listing several ways the teenager was “ singled out because of his race , national origin , and religion. ” The letters said Mohamed 's family is seeking $ 10 million in compensation from the city of Irving and $ 5 million dollars from the school district , Irving ISD .
“ Let 's face it ; if Ahmed 's clock were ‘ Jennifer 's clock , ' and if the pencil case were ruby red bedazzled with a clear rhinestone skull and crossbones on the cover , this would never have happened , ” the letters added .
The letters add that the school and city officials mishandled the situation and not necessarily because of oversight or incompetence .
“ The school and city officials involved knew what they needed to do to protect Ahmed 's right , ” the letters said . “ They just decided not to do it . ”
Video by The Dallas Morning News
Among the claims the letters make : that police illegally questioned Mohamed without his parents present ; school officials tried to force a confession out of Mohamed even when the teenager repeatedly claimed his invention was only a clock ; and after news of his arrest and detainment went viral , officials decided to “ trash ” him to the media .
Mohamed 's family also want written apologies specifically from Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne and Police Chief Larry Boyd within 60 days , or a civil action will be filed . Van Duyne , who 's celebrated by anti-Muslim groups , sat down for an interview in September with Glenn Beck , a former Fox News host who said Mohamed 's arrest was part of a plan to further a “ civilization jihad . ”
“ Beck later opined that this was the ‘ Islamists ' conspiracy to soften us up , so that we could later be attacked from inside , ” the letters said . “ When the guest sitting less than an arm 's length from Mayor Van Duyne called the pencil box a ‘ briefcase , ' she did not say a word . She just nodded , ” the letters added
Mohamed 's family decided to move to Qatar in October , so that the teenager could accept a full scholarship at the city 's innovation school , but to also distance the family from the flood of Islamophobia online that targeted the boy .
“ Ahmed has suffered severe psychological trauma during his involuntarily separation from his grandmother and extended family , ” the letters said , adding that the many threatening emails he received made him fear for his physical safety .
“ In the long-term , we adults should know that — despite Ahmed 's efforts to be strong , and to prove that he is ‘ a good boy ' — he will experience pain and suffering as result of this for the rest of his days , ” the letters said .
The school district told Reuters that they would ready a response after they reviewed the letter . City officials , Reuters said , were not immediately available for comment .

The NCAA has pulled seven championship events from North Carolina , including opening-weekend men 's basketball tournament games , for the coming year due to a state law that some say can lead to discrimination against LGBT people . In a news release Monday , Sept. 12 , 2016 , the NCAA says the decision by its board of governors came `` because of the cumulative actions taken by the state concerning civil rights protections .

The NCAA has pulled seven championship events from North Carolina , including opening-weekend men 's basketball tournament games , for the coming year due to a state law that some say can lead to discrimination against LGBT people .
In a news release Monday , the NCAA says the decision by its board of governors came “ because of the cumulative actions taken by the state concerning civil rights protections . ”
“ This decision is consistent with the NCAA 's long-standing core values of inclusion , student-athlete well-being and creating a culture of fairness , ” said Georgia Tech President G.P . “ Bud ” Peterson , the chair of the board of governors .
The law — known as HB2 — requires transgender people to use restrooms at schools and government buildings corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates . It also excludes gender identity and sexual orientation from local and statewide antidiscrimination protections .
HB2 was signed into law by Republican Gov . Pat McCrory earlier this year . A spokesman with McCrory 's office could n't immediately be reached for comment Monday evening , but a spokeswoman with the state Republican party blasted the decision in statement , saying it is “ so absurd it 's almost comical . ”
“ I wish the NCAA was this concerned about the women who were raped at Baylor , ” spokeswoman Kami Mueller said Monday night .
The only championship events that can be hosted in North Carolina this academic year are ones determined when a team earns the right to play on their own campus .
The NCAA said it will relocate the men 's basketball first- and second-round games that were scheduled for March 17 and 19 in Greensboro . The NCAA will also relocate :
— the Division I women 's soccer championship scheduled for Dec. 2 and 4 in Cary , just outside the capital city of Raleigh ;
— the Division III men 's and women 's soccer championships set for Dec. 2 and 3 in Greensboro ;
— the Division I women 's golf regional championships set for May 8-10 in Greenville ;
— the Division III men 's and women 's tennis championships set for May 22-27 in Cary ;
— the Division I women 's lacrosse championship set for May 26 and 28 in Cary ;
— and the Division II baseball championship from May 27 to June 3 in Cary .
North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham and North Carolina State AD Debbie Yow both issued statements Monday evening saying they were disappointed at the loss of the events .
“ We certainly hope there will be resolution in the very near future , ” Yow said .
The campaign spokesman for Democrat Roy Cooper , the state 's attorney general and McCrory 's re-election opponent in November , said the law needs to be repealed .
“ It seems that almost every day , we learn of a new consequence of HB2 , ” spokesman Ford Porter said . ” ... We need to repeal this law and get our state back on track . ”
The NCAA 's move leaves the Atlantic Coast Conference football championship game in Charlotte as the marquee college sporting event in the state this year as the men 's basketball tournament starts a two-year stay in Brooklyn , New York .
However , that event also could be in jeopardy . In May , the ACC announced that member schools discussed the law during their annual spring meetings and said it could impact whether the state hosts league championship events .
In April , the NCAA announced it was adopting an anti-discrimination measure that would affect the way the governing body evaluates bids to host sporting events and required sites to “ demonstrate how they will provide an environment that is safe , healthy and free of discrimination . ”
In a statement Monday night , NCAA President Mark Emmert said the governing body will delay announcements on future championship sites until early next year . That comes as it reviews responses to questionnaires required of prospective site hosts on how they would comply with the NCAA 's anti-discrimination measure .
In announcing its decision Monday , the NCAA stated current North Carolina laws “ make it challenging to guarantee that host communities can help deliver ” on that requirement .
The NCAA also took special note of four ways North Carolina 's law differs from other states . The NCAA pointed out that five states — Connecticut , Minnesota , New York , Vermont and Washington — and several cities prohibit travel by public employees and representatives of public institutions to the state of North Carolina . Those representatives prohibited to travel could include athletes , coaches and athletic administrators .
Monday 's action by the NCAA is the latest public and business backlash that has arisen since the law was enacted . The NBA moved its 2017 All-Star Game to New Orleans instead of hosting it in Charlotte as originally scheduled because of the law . Duke lost a men 's basketball game from its schedule when Albany backed out due to that state 's travel ban , while the Vermont women 's basketball team has canceled a December trip to play North Carolina in Chapel Hill .
Entertainers like Bruce Springsteen , Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr have canceled plans to play in North Carolina . And PayPal reversed plans to open a 400-employee operation center in Charlotte .

The NetApp® ONTAP® six-month release cadence was designed to bring new features in rapid succession , and ONTAP 9.3 does not disappoint .
Prior to ONTAP 9.3 , the list of supported features for NetApp FlexGroup volumes looked like this :
The New Stuff
What 's new in ONTAP 9.3 for FlexGroup volumes ? I 'm glad you asked .
Improved Home Directory Support
NetApp FlexGroup volumes provide a large , scalable NAS container that can span multiple nodes and grow to massive capacity nondisruptively , while providing a single namespace . That sort of container is a great fit for home directory workloads .
Prior to ONTAP 9.3 , some features that are critical to home directory workloads were not available . ONTAP 9.3 brings us closer to FlexGroup volumes being a perfect fit for home directories , with support added for qtrees , SMB change/notify , antivirus scanning , and quality of service ( QoS ) maximums .
Qtrees
Many customers use qtrees for home directory folders for users for several reasons :
They 're easy . You can manage them from the storage system , automate home folder creation easily , and apply dynamic homedir shares for multiprotocol SMB and NFS access .
You can manage them from the storage system , automate home folder creation easily , and apply dynamic homedir shares for multiprotocol SMB and NFS access . They 're flexible . You can apply individual export policy rules to limit access from the storage .
You can apply individual export policy rules to limit access from the storage . They 're granular . Qtrees provide a logical separation of data inside a volume , which is particularly useful in a large container such as a FlexGroup volume . You can apply quotas to qtrees to manage space allocation . Currently , FlexGroup supports only quota monitoring . Stay tuned for quota enforcement in future releases .
SMB Change/Notify
SMB change/notify allows clients to write data to shares and see that data immediately after writing it , without having to intervene by refreshing the window or closing and reopening the connection . This is especially useful in workloads with applications that must read files right after they are written .
Antivirus Scanning
FlexGroup volumes provide support for off-box antivirus scanning , which is crucial in home directory workloads . Antivirus in a FlexGroup volume works just like in a FlexVol® volume . Support is currently being qualified for ONTAP FlexGroup volumes with the following major antivirus scanning software vendors :
Kaspersky
McAfee
Sophos
Symantec
Trend Micro
QoS Maximums
In a home directory workload , you do n't want users stepping on production workloads , so you can apply QoS maximums to your FlexGroup volumes to limit the MBps and IOPS being used by the volume . QoS maximums are applied at the FlexGroup or storage virtual machine ( SVM ) level . Currently , only the command line is supported . At a high level , QoS maximums are shared across nodes where the FlexGroup volume lives . ( See Figure 1 . )
Improved Data Protection Support
FlexGroup volumes in ONTAP 9.3 also offer better support for data protection with the following feature additions :
Unified Replication and Version-Independent SnapMirror
ONTAP 9.3 introduces support for unified replication on FlexGroup volumes . This means that FlexGroup volumes will use the XDP replication engine by default , which allows SnapMirror® and SnapVault® , as well as version-independent SnapMirror . Version independence is when you can replicate between two different ONTAP versions ( within two releases ) with no issues . Previous versions of ONTAP required the destination to be on the same or a later release as the source to make sure of the ability to fail over in DR scenarios .
SnapVault
FlexGroup volumes also now support SnapVault , which means you can keep more Snapshot™ copies on a destination than on the source , for archival purposes . This is one way you can adequately back up a FlexGroup volume quickly by replicating to a DR site . From there , you can point protocol-based backups to the SnapVault destination and offload the jobs from the production system . ( See Figure 2 . )
FlexGroup Expansion Without Needing to Rebaseline
FlexGroup volumes can have their size increased in one of two ways : by growing the member volumes or by adding new member volumes . Adding new member volumes is known as “ FlexGroup expansion. ” This increases the member volume count , which , in previous ONTAP releases , would force you to rebaseline SnapMirror relationships . In ONTAP 9.3 , the expansion of a FlexGroup volume no longer requires a lengthy rebaseline of the relationship .
Improved FlexGroup Space Management
A NetApp FlexGroup volume is built with multiple FlexVol members . These FlexVol members are all limited to a finite amount of capacity and inode counts . When a FlexGroup member volume runs out of space or inodes , the entire FlexGroup volume reports as being out of space or inodes , even if other member volumes have available space . While this scenario is rare , it still requires consideration . In ONTAP 9.3 , a few improvements have been made to help avoid such scenarios .
Volume Autogrow
If a FlexGroup member volume runs out of space , the entire FlexGroup volume is considered out of space until the issue is remedied . That situation required administrator intervention until ONTAP 9.3 and volume autogrow .
Volume autogrow can get your FlexGroup volume out of sticky situations by growing the volume to avoid “ out of space ” errors .
Improved Ingest Heuristics
“ Ingest heuristics ” refers to the way ONTAP processes the balancing of file ingest into a FlexGroup volume . In addition to capacity , member volumes can run out of inodes , which creates an issue similar to what you 'd see with an “ out of space ” error . Previous ONTAP versions did not factor in a member volume 's inode count . ONTAP 9.3 does . As a member volume approaches its maximum capacity and inode count , ONTAP avoids that volume until the other volumes have caught up .
Conclusion
There you have it . ONTAP 9.3 is bringing even more feature functionality to FlexGroup volumes . This time it is better enabling home directory workloads , providing more robust data protection , and improving the space management of a FlexGroup volume on ingest of files .

I also go into detail about FlexGroup volumes and best practices in the following technical reports :
Driving is an important part of the United States economy and a major influence on American culture . As citizens of one of the most mobile countries on the planet , Americans drive thousands of miles every year .
American Driving Habits
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) , the average American driver logs 13,476 miles each year . That 's more than four times the distance from New York City to Los Angeles , California .
Although this number may seem high , it 's actually only a snapshot of how Americans drive . To further understand United States driving habits , it helps to look at the miles driven by various groups of citizens .
Men vs. Women
American men drive considerably more miles than American women , according to the FHWA . The average man drives 16,550 miles per year , while the average woman drives 10,142 miles . This gender difference holds true across all age groups .
Older vs . Younger Drivers
Americans do the most driving during middle age and the least driving during retirement . Americans between 35 and 54 years of age drive 15,291 miles per year on average . Those over age 64 average only 7,646 miles annually .
Who Drives the Least ?
Women over the age of 65 drive the least of any age group , averaging only 4,785 miles each year . This may be due to generational differences in male and female roles and the high rate of retirement in this demographic .
Who Drives the Most ?
Of all Americans , men aged 35-54 drive the most miles . These drivers , possibly commuting to and from work , log 18,858 miles each year .
Teenage Driving Habits
The average American aged 16-19 years old drives 7,624 miles each year . Teenaged boys drive slightly more than teenage girls , with males logging 8,206 miles annually to females ' 6,873 miles .
States with the Most Miles Driven Annually
The FHWA also keeps statistics about the miles driven by drivers in each state . According to the FHWA , these are the top five states for annual miles driven :
Wyoming , where the average driver in this state drives 21,821 miles annually
Georgia , where drivers travel 18,920 miles each year on average
Oklahoma , where the average driver logs 18,8891 miles each year
New Mexico , where the average miles per year per driver is 18,369
Minnesota , where the average licensed resident drives 17,887 miles annually
States with the Fewest Miles Driven Annually
Whether they have to commute a shorter distance or have alternate methods of getting from place to place , drivers in certain states log fewer miles than others . Drivers in the following five states drive the least of all Americans :
Alaska , where licensed residents drive only 9,915 miles each year on average
Washington , DC , where drivers log an average of only 10,045 miles each year
Hawaii , where licensed residents drive 11,104 miles each year
Connecticut , where drivers travel only 11,595 miles annually
Massachusetts , where the average miles per year per driver is 11,759
Do Families with Children Do More Driving ?
According to the Surface Transportation Policy Partnership ( STPP ) , mothers spend more time driving than non-mothers . STPP also reports that mothers make more trips in the car each day , likely to pick up and drop off kids from soccer games and other events .
Exactly How Many Miles Do Americans Drive Each Year ?
The FHWA reports that in 2000 , the last year with figures available , 190,650,023 United States citizens held drivers ' licenses . Since the average driver logs 13,476 miles each year , that means that in total , Americans drive more than 2.5 trillion miles annually .
More About American Driving Habits
In recent years , several factors may have begun to influence the way Americans drive . Higher fuel prices , economic and environmental concerns , and employment challenges may result in significant changes to the automotive industry and driving statistics .

Closeup side view of late 20 's couple making love in their bedroom while spending weekend in a hotel . They are just hugging and kissing at the moment
I was getting a manicure the first time I learned that not all wives want to , ahem , go for a roll in the hay with their husbands . I was 16 and had picked out orange nail polish ( oh , sixteen ) . I had a book with me but it was n't long before I found another source of entertainment . In-between buffings and polishings , the two women next to me talked about how much their husbands wanted IT and how little they wanted to give IT .
For a girl that had not even been asked out on a date this was a whole new world . I had a suspicion that their experience was more realistic than the articles I sneaky read in Cosmo while getting my hair done at the salon . ( I am supposed to put my hand WHERE ? while simultaneously doing WHAT ? ) So I kept my eyes on my book , let the words blur into lines and listened closely .
`` Does n't he know how tired I am by the end of the day ? As if after the kids are finally asleep I have the energy to do anything but sit down and watch some TV . ''
`` For me , it is n't even the energy it takes . I am still losing weight from the baby . I do n't feel sexy . I can hardly undress in front of a mirror , let alone in front of him . I honestly think it is selfish that he expects me to pretend to feel something that I do n't . ''
`` Selfish ? That 's a good word . Maybe if he took care of the kids when he got home or made dinner once in a while I would be more interested . Hell , just pick up the milk on the way home from work . I am not asking for much . Now that I think about it , I do n't think we have done it in the last three weeks . ''
`` Yeah . It 's been at least two for us . ''
Wait . These women were married ... they lived with a guy .... who slept in their bed . They could have sex all the time ! And they did n't want to ? It made no sense . It was like turning down a zero calorie but as delicious-as-creme-brulee dessert . ( Or at least I assumed . At that point everything I knew about romance was gleaned from Anne of Green Gables and Moulin Rouge . )
How sad . How wasteful . How stupid . When I got married , I would always want to have sex with my husband ! And I would never be too tired . My goodness , it was just ridiculous to want him to bring home a gallon of milk just to prove he cared . Was n't it just like a woman to make a grocery run a test of love . As the final coat of polish was applied to my nails , I swore to never be like them . My life would be different . I would be better . I would never feel too fat or too tired . Ever .
And then I grew up .
Intercourse , carnal knowledge , lovemaking , knocking boots , coitus , SEX ! is everything 16 year old me imagined plus a little whipped cream on top . ( Whipped cream , see what I did there ? ) And once Riley and I got married there were lots and lots and lots of it . Then we had a baby and I really was just so tired my bones hurt . And for a while I did feel fat . Even after I lost the pregnancy weight everything just looked different . Like a cut flower that has been left out in the sun , still lovely just a little ... wilted . I became a little distant . We started to fall asleep without talking or kissing .
Then one day while washing dishes , I realized that we had gone eight days without touching each other . Eight days was a quite some time for us . But the thing that bothered me the most was that I had n't missed it . And I knew that was a problem . So that night after we put the baby to bed , I gave Riley my best come hither glance . Yes , I was tired and felt about as desirable as the `` feed the birds '' lady in Mary Poppins . But while drying the dishes , it occurred to me that 16 year old Meg must have understood something about sex that 20-something Meg had forgotten . And maybe , just maybe it was worth remembering .
Without further ado here are five reasons you should have sex with your husband every night :
1 . Being a mother , one of the ultimate expressions of womanhood , can often leave a girl feeling stripped of her femininity . There is something about being covered in spit up and attending to the every need of another human being that makes one feel distinctly gender neutral . Most of my days are spent playing with dolls , wiping baby food off of my clothes , changing diapers , wiping snot off of my clothes , going to the park , and wiping what-the-heavens-is-that off of my clothes . There is something restorative about kissing the boy you love . There are times in Riley 's arms when I remember who I am before I even realize I have forgotten . Yes , I am a cook , cleaner , teacher , and wiper of all things disgusting . But I am also something more , something delightful and completely apart from my roles . I am a woman ! And there is potential and depth and heck , I am pretty darn good kisser , too . It is a lovely thing , finding yourself through the touch of someone else .
2 . If you want your husband to act like a man , you need to treat him like a man . Hold the eye rolls . I am not pushing for a return to the 1950′s . ( Although , heaven knows an era in which low rise jeans did not exist is basically alright by me . ) Women need any number of criteria met to feel loved . Men are far simpler . They need to be fed , they need to be appreciated , and they need to have sex . That is it . Really . So make or order dinner once in a while . Say thank you for the long hours spent at work with a hug and smile when he walks through the door each night . ( Better yet ? Smile as you hand him the kids and walk out the door for a long , much needed break . ) And my goodness , let the poor man see you naked . It is astounding what a good man will do for a good woman that has made him feel loved . After a few weeks of meals and make outs , you will sit back and wonder why you did n't insist on having sex every night sooner . Talk about a small investment and big returns .
3 . You need to have a moment in each day that is just about the two of you . Remember that boy ? The one that made your heart thump and hands sweat ? The one that called when you hoped he would , that made you run hot and high up to the stars until you thought you would never come down ? He is still there . Under the years and bills and worries , that smiling boy is still in love with and needs his smiling girl . Every night after the kids go to bed is a chance to find him again . A moment to remind yourself that you are living a picket fenced adventure and my goodness , there is nothing the two of you ca n't do .
4 . Sex relieves stress . I do n't know that this one needs much explanation . As a mother I eat stress for breakfast . So it seems to me I have a choice . I can let off steam by A ) driving around at night and bashing in strangers mailboxes or B ) I can get down and dirty with that one guy I married that one time . I choose option B . ( So far the mailboxes in my neighborhood have escaped unscathed , so Option B must be working . )
5 . It is so much blasted fun . Seriously . Why are we so quick to refuse the good things in life ? We will slog through our children 's Algebra homework , do Zumba in public and pluck the hair from our body ONE PIECE AT A TIME . But tell a girl to have sex every night and she looks at you like you are crazy , An orgasm ? Every night ? What do I look like ? A Nymphomaniacal Super Woman ?
Where is the logic in that ?
Are we really too busy doing dishes to participate in an activity that is so good it has inspired genius ( that saucy Shakespeare ) and changed history ( Okay , Helen of Troy , we get it . You were super hot ) ? My goodness , what a crazy way to live . Ladies , did it ever occur to you ( to us ! ) that we should have sex because WE DESERVE IT ?
Yeah , you deserve it .
So , tonight put the kids to bed . Leave the dishes in the sink and the floors unswept . They will wait . Take a moment to remember that you are the girl you hoped you would be and then go find that boy and remind him that he is the man you knew he could be .
Rinse . Repeat .
Illinois has become the first state where a groundbreaking internet privacy bill has reached the governor 's desk , according to data privacy experts , and advocates are urging Gov . Bruce Rauner to sign it into law . Katie Kim reports .
Illinois has become the first state where a groundbreaking internet privacy bill has reached the governor 's desk , according to data privacy experts , and advocates are urging Gov . Bruce Rauner to sign it into law .
House Bill 3449 – the Geolocation Privacy Protection Act – would require internet companies and entities to tell consumers what geolocation data they are collecting , why they are gathering that information and with whom they are sharing it .
Privacy experts contend that popular mobile apps used by consumers , including children , are frequently collecting geolocation data without a consumer 's knowledge and sending that data to third-party companies to turn a profit .
“ Geolocation data is in some ways the holy grail of personal data , ” said Peter Hanna , co-founder of the Digital Privacy Alliance and a data privacy attorney . “ Where we are , where we go – it 's among the most intimately private information about our day-to-day lives . ”
The bill 's advocates said the measure would not bar companies from gathering geolocation data but would empower consumers by giving them the right to know that this collection is happening .
Opponents said the language in the bill does not provide additional protections to consumers .
“ Location controls are already very strong , ” said Downers Grove-based internet trade association CompTIA , which is urging Rauner to veto the bill . “ The Federal Trade Commission oversees all regulation in regard to geolocation technology and has put forth guidance regarding the collection of device location information that includes clear and concise notification that the app collects user location . ”
The debate is unfolding at a time when some companies are facing potential consequences .
A California parent has sued The Walt Disney Company , alleging the company collected personally identifying information about children who were playing online games via smart phone apps . The lawsuit states the games have trackers that gather data , including geolocation information , and in turn selling it to third party companies for “ future commercial exploitation . ”
The complaint accuses The Walt Disney Company of violating the federal Children 's Online Privacy Protect Act , which prohibits developers of child-focused apps from obtaining personal information of children under 13 years of age without first obtaining verifiable consent from their parents .
A Disney spokesperson said the complaint is based on a “ fundamental misunderstanding of COPPA principles . ”
“ Disney has a robust COPPA compliance program , and we maintain strict data collection and use policies for Disney apps created for children and families , ” a spokesperson said . “ We look forward to defending this action in Court . ”
The lawsuit states that Disney subsidiary Playdom paid a $ 3 million civil penalty in 2011 for violating COPPA when it allegedly collected and disclosed personal information from hundreds of thousands of children without getting parental consent .
The popular AccuWeather app has also come under fire for reportedly collecting geolocation information and sending it to a third party , even though a user said he disabled location services . The issue was first reported by tech security researcher Will Strafach .
AccuWeather in a statement said no GPS coordinates are collected without opt-in permission from the consumer . But the company said it will be removing third party trackers from the app until it is fully compliant with appropriate requirements .
Parents said the transparency that would come from the Geolocation Privacy Protection Act is not a big ask .
“ It 's just a basic right to know issue , ” said Andre Delattre . “ If someone is going to collect and store information about me or my daughter or both of us , then the very least I ought to be afforded is to know that that 's the case . ”
Duo admit 'candle store ' prostitution front
Two men accused of operating a prostitution ring out of a Northwest Side storefront that was registered with the city as a candle store pleaded guilty Monday to aggravated promotion of prostitution .
Joshua Louis Edwards , 22 , will face up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced next month by state District Judge Maria Teresa Herr . Malcolm Deandre Copeland , 21 , agreed to a five-year prison term .
The duo operated the business , which they referred to as Black Stone Relaxation/Day Spa in online ads , during August 2012 and September 2012 in a shopping center that also included a magic shop , a children 's hair salon and a day care . Before then , the business was in Universal City .
The San Antonio Police Department 's vice unit began investigating the place last year after neighboring business operators noticed that only men would visit the store and the staff would lock the door after letting customers in , according to court documents .
During a sting last October , an undercover officer recounted an employee stripping down to her panties and offering to perform a sexual act for an extra $ 65 . Another employee was available for “ full service , ” she was alleged to have told him .
“ This was n't a massage place or a spa of any legitimacy , ” prosecutor Kirsta Melton said Monday . “ It was n't a full-on brothel , but it was clearly a place where prostitution was acceptable . ”
Aggravated promotion of prostitution , a rare charge in Bexar County that involves the alleged pimping of multiple women , is usually punishable by up to 10 years in prison . Had the cases gone to trial , both men could have faced enhanced sentence ranges of up to 20 years because of earlier convictions .

LaVine thinks better days for Chicago Bulls could arrive soon
hello
Two games into the regular season , the Chicago Bulls could use a better storyline than practice-punch recap or rookie Lauri Markkanen 's rebounding breakdown .
So Zach LaVine stepped forward Monday to remind fans that things could get better relatively soon .
LaVine is working out but still recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee suffered last Feb. 3 .
`` I should be doing contact ( in practice ) really soon , '' he said at the Advocate Center . `` It all depends on ( team doctors ) . I 'm pushing them as hard as I can , but at the end of the day we 've still got to be careful . I feel great . I 'm doing everything I was doing before . I 'm pretty sure I can do contact , but we 've got to stick to that schedule . ''
LaVine appears to be making great progress and has been doing basketball drills for a while . But doctors believe the 6-foot-7 swingman should wait the full nine months after surgery before returning to full practice .
`` Probably in the next two weeks , I would say he 'll start doing a little bit of contact , '' Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said . `` Probably three weeks , he 'll be back to full contact if everything stays on schedule . ''
If all goes well , LaVine could make his Bulls debut sometime around Dec. 1 . That 's a short wait in the scheme of an NBA season , but time may pass slowly while the rebuilding Bulls putter along without three projected starters .
Hoiberg did say guard Kris Dunn ( dislocated finger ) practiced Monday and could play later this week . The Bulls visit Cleveland on Tuesday .
`` I 'm pushing as much as possible because I want to go play with my guys , '' LaVine said . `` When that day comes and I 'm able to get on the floor , it 'll be a good day for everybody , because I 'm waiting . ''
LaVine has been watching practices and running through dummy offense . The hope is , once he 's healthy and cleared to play he should already be up to speed with Hoiberg 's schemes . So far , LaVine likes what he has seen from the offense , which is designed to be fast-paced and 3-point intensive .
`` I think it 's great , '' he said . `` With the team that we have and the system coach put in , we 're going to get up a lot of 3s . When we 're on , we 're going to blow some teams out with those 3s . When we 're off , as the last couple games have shown , it 's going to be a struggle to score sometimes , but I think that 's where I can come in and help . ''
LaVine , 22 , has improved his stats in all three of his seasons in the NBA . At the time of his injury , he was averaging 18.9 points for Minnesota , while shooting 39 percent from 3-point range .
The deadline passed for LaVine to sign a contract extension , so he will be a restricted free agent next summer . There 's no doubt both sides want to extend the relationship , especially since LaVine and Markkanen were the main pieces in the Jimmy Butler trade .
`` I think it 's fine , '' LaVine said of not signing an extension . `` Obviously , I want to be here for a long time . And I feel the deal is going to get done . ''
There 's no guarantee LaVine will ever turn the Bulls back into a playoff team . But after a rough start to the regular season , Hoiberg was able to think ahead to better times when the two-time slam-dunk champ is ready to play .
`` He 's got a skill set that you can do a lot with , starting with his athleticism , '' Hoiberg said . `` He 's the fastest guy on our team ; really , one of the fastest guys in the league .
`` His explosiveness , he 's already gotten that back . And his ability to shoot the ball from anywhere on the floor puts another shooter , floor-spacer out there . So , yeah , he does make our team a lot better . ''

Palestinian Worker Injured After Being Attacked In Tel Aviv
8:28 AM
A number of Israeli extremists attacked , Tuesday , a Palestinian worker in Tel Aviv , causing various injuries that required hospitalization.The worker has been identified as Mousa Hasan Shawahin , 44 , years of age , from Yatta town , south of the southern West Bank city of Hebron .
His cousin , Mohammad , said a number of Israelis attacked him while working in Tel Aviv , causing various cuts and bruises to different parts of his body , before he was moved to an Israeli hospital for treatment .
Mohammad called on different media , human rights and legal organizations , in Palestine and abroad , to expose the ongoing Israeli violations against the Palestinians , to seriously act on ending them , and to provide protection to the people , living under occupation .
Stockholm 's relations with Riyadh have nosedived since leftist Foreign Minister Margot Wallstroem , pictured , told parliament in a February speech the oil-rich state was a `` dictatorship '' that violated women 's rights and whipped bloggers ( AFP Photo/Jonathan Nackstrand )
Stockholm ( AFP ) - Sweden is seeking to quell an unprecedented diplomatic spat over human rights with Saudi Arabia which has seen ambassadors recalled and arms sales cancelled , drawing comparisons with Denmark 's Mohammed cartoons controversy .
Stockholm 's relations with Riyadh have nosedived since leftist Foreign Minister Margot Wallstroem told parliament in a February speech the oil-rich state was a `` dictatorship '' that violated women 's rights and whipped bloggers .
As Sweden faces growing criticism from the kingdom 's allies in the Middle East , Wallstroem 's detractors at home wonder whether the government thought through the consequences of denouncing the Gulf powerhouse .
`` All this has been badly planned , '' Paulina Neuding , editor of the right-leaning political magazine NEO , told AFP .
Sweden 's government announced a `` feminist '' foreign policy when it took power in September .
Right groups accuse Saudi Arabia of meting out brutal punishments to dissidents and religious minorities , and excluding women from most areas of public life .
The crisis in relations between Stockholm and Riyadh was cemented earlier this month when Sweden ended an arms agreement with Riyadh , despite warnings from business leaders about the potential impact on exports to the Gulf state , worth about $ 1.3 billion ( 1.2 billion euros ) .
- 'Moral superpower ' -
A storm of criticism ensued from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation .
The top religious authority in Saudi Arabia accused Sweden of disrespecting Islam and sharia law , which forms the basis of the Saudi legal system , while the foreign ministry accused Stockholm of `` flagrant interference '' .
Saudi Arabia blocked a planned speech by Wallstroem at the Arab League , halted business visas for Swedes and recalled its ambassador from Stockholm in protest .
The UAE , a close Saudi ally , also recalled its ambassador .
Wallstroem said her comments -- including calling Saudi Arabia 's whipping of dissident blogger Raif Badawi in January `` medieval '' -- were never directed against Islam for which she had `` the greatest respect '' .
But Neuding said the minister was trying to boost Sweden 's image as a `` moral superpower '' .
`` If you say that Saudi laws are medieval and those are sharia laws then the obvious response is 'do you have something against Islam ? ' And she was not prepared for that , '' she said .
Others argue that Wallstroem -- who has three decades of political experience , including a decade as European commissioner -- has revived the ideological style of assassinated prime minister Olof Palme , famed for his anti-US criticism of the Vietnam War in the 1960s .
`` Many asked what a feminist foreign policy would mean in practice and I believe this is an example ... ( that ) we will criticise violations of human rights , of women 's rights , '' said Ann-Marie Ekengren , a professor of international politics at Gothenburg University .
- From politics to religion -
Cherif Sayed , Middle East manager at the semi-state trade council Business Sweden , said the controversy has gone from being political to religious .
`` What we fear is that it may affect the day-to-day business between Swedish companies and distributors and partners ... who highly value Islam and their religion , '' he said .
Feeling the heat , Sweden 's government last week held talks with business leaders to discuss concerns over trade with Gulf countries .
Sweden 's King Carl XVI Gustaf also offered the government his help in defusing tensions .
Sayed says the spat is unlikely to spiral into Sweden 's version of Denmark 's Mohammed cartoons crisis in late 2005 and early 2006 , which triggered deadly protests , attacks on Danish embassies and an international boycott .
The crisis was sparked by satirical images of the Muslim Prophet published in newspaper Jyllands Posten .
`` I would n't say it would go that far as there 's no direct negativity from Sweden towards Islam . It 's more our foreign minister 's choice of words when it comes to sharia law , '' he said .
`` Now the time has come to approach the Saudis on a political level and have a dialogue about this ... We are waiting for that to happen . ''
But , viewed from Denmark , the controversy seems strangely familiar and potentially as intractable as the cartoon crisis , according to Bo Lidegaard , editor of Danish daily Politiken .
`` The problem is that Saudi Arabia no longer wants to have any dialogue with Margot Wallstroem , '' he wrote in an editorial .
`` And it has quickly become a bigger problem for her than for the ( Saudi ) Kingdom . ''
What do you get when you cross a female brown trout and a male brook trout ?
If you guessed tiger trout , you 're right !
We asked , and you told us Alberta .
A total of nine water bodies were selected for initial stocking trials of tiger trout . These waters were assessed during the summer of 2015 for both biological and social acceptability of stocking tiger trout .
The results – tiger trout were stocked in five Alberta lakes that met the requirements .
Black Nugget Mine Pit ( 10 km east of Tofield ) ;
Blood Indian Reservoir ( 100 km southeast of Hanna ) ;
East Twin Lake ( 160 km north of Peace River ) ;
Lower Chain Lake ( 40 km northwest of Athabasca ) ; and
Moonshine ( Mirage ) Lake ( 110 km north of Grande Prairie ) .
Why tiger trout ?
A tiger trout stocking program has been requested by Alberta Fish and Game members , Edmonton Trout Clubs and through angler interaction at fishing trade shows .
Tiger trout have attracted significant attention from Alberta anglers who are interested in catching a new large and aggressive trout species , provide unique recreational opportunities , stimulate economic activity to the area stocked and improve angler satisfaction .
Tiger trout from the fish culture program were assessed by the Alberta Introductions and Transfers Committee and determined to be of low risk for disease introduction , genetic interaction and ecological impact in stocked waters where escape is unlikely .
The fish culture system can produce 20,000 to 40,000 tiger trout annually allowing for the stocking of a limited number of destination quality fisheries .
The Federal Government has moved forward with changes to the Alberta Fishery Regulation ( 1998 ) . Specifically , this allows tiger trout to be listed as a sportsfish in Alberta . This allows Alberta to define quotas and size restrictions for tiger trout . Please review waterbody-specific regulations and visit the on-line regulations regularly .

Cars could soon monitor our EMOTIONS : Device reads facial expressions to prevent road rage
Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , Switzerland , developed the system , which could boost road safety
Prototype identifies a driver 's emotions using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel to film their face
Device is being developed with PSA Peugeot Citroën and researchers are also working on a fatigue detector measuring eyelid closure
Car manufacturers are always looking for ways to make driving safer
And in the future , dashboard emotion detectors could search for signs of irritation in a bid to identify the first signs of road rage .
A prototype of the device is able to read a driver 's facial expressions using a tiny embedded camera .
Scroll down for video
Scientists at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , Switzerland , developed the prototype device , which identifies a driver 's emotions - including anger ( pictured ) - using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel to film their face
Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , Switzerland , have developed the system which identifies which of the seven universal emotions a person is feeling : fear , anger , joy , sadness , disgust , surprise , or suspicion .
They believe their technology could be of use in medicine , marketing , gaming and in driver safety .
‘ We know that in addition to fatigue , the emotional state of the driver is a risk factor , the researchers said .
‘ Irritation , in particular , can make drivers more aggressive and less attentive , ' they added .
The scientists worked with PSA Peugeot Citroën to create the prototype , which had to overcome the challenge of measuring emotions in the confines of a small space without distracting the driver .
Researchers at EPFL 's Signal Processing 5 Laboratory came upon the idea of adapting a facial detection device for use in a car by using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel . Here , the device shows a driver with a 'neutral ' expression
Researchers at EPFL 's Signal Processing 5 Laboratory came upon the idea of adapting a facial detection device for use in a car by using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel .
‘ The problem was to get the device to recognise irritation on the face of a driver , ' they said , because everyone expresses this emotional state differently .
Research leaders Hua Gao and Anil Yüce chose to track only two expressions : anger and disgust , whose manifestations are similar to those of anger .
Irritation makes drivers more aggressive and less attentive ( stock image ) and while the researchers wanted to track this emotion , it was difficult to develop a system that could do this , which could also fit into a small space without distracting the driver
The system first learned to identify the two emotions using a series of photos of subjects making corresponding facial expressions and then the same exercise was carried out using videos .
Using this system of learning , the device could accurately detect irritation in most cases and when it failed it was because of an individual 's way of displaying anger .
The scientists will aim to create a system that can work in real-time with a more advanced facial monitoring algorithm .
The team is also working on a fatigue detector that measures the percentage of eyelid closure , which could one day be used to develop a safety system to stop people falling asleep at the wheel .
They are also striving to detect distraction and on using lip reading and voice recognition , to give more of a clue to a driver 's mental state .
Volvo has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists ( pictured ) and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent
AND VOLVO ADDS A SCANNER THAT APPLIES THE BRAKES WHEN IT DETECTS A BICYCLE SWERVING INTO A CAR
Volvo has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent .
The Swedish car firm says the camera and radar-guided technology , which is being introduced into cars from May , could save hundreds of lives .
The system comprises a radar scanner in the grille , a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror , and an onboard computer . It allows the car to identify cyclists who swerve into its path and reacts by slamming on the brakes .
The driver is given a loud audible warning and a visible warning of a row of red lights flashing up on the windscreen .
The new cyclist detector system comprises a radar scanner set into the car 's grille , a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror , and a computerised central control unit .
The radar measures the distance to any suspicious object while the camera compares its shape and size against an electronic visual catalogue of thousands of images – including bicycles and cyclists . It can even differentiate between a pedal cyclist and a motor cyclist .
Canada Post Claims Copyright Over Postal Codes , Meets Resistance
from it's-precedent-setting-time dept
Canada Post has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Geolytica , which operates GeoCoder.ca , a website that provides several geocoding services including free access to a crowdsourced compiled database of Canadian postal codes . Canada Post argues that it is the exclusive copyright holder of all Canadian postal codes and claims that GeoCoder appropriated the database and made unauthorized reproductions .
GeoCoder , which is being represented by CIPPIC , filed its statement of defence yesterday ( I am on the CIPPIC Advisory Board but have not been involved in the case other than providing a referral to CIPPIC when contacted by GeoCoder 's founder ) . The defence explains how GeoCoder managed to compile a postal code database by using crowdsource techniques without any reliance on Canada Post 's database . The site created street address look-up service in 2004 with users often including a postal code within their query . The site retained the postal code information and gradually developed its own database with the postal codes ( a system not unlike many marketers that similarly develop databases by compiling this information ) .
A few years ago , we wrote about the UK 's Royal Mail using a dubious copyright claim to bully a website into shutting down because it offered postal code data . In that case , the company chose not to fight the claim—and yet not long afterwards , UK officials decided to free up postal code data . Now , Michael Geist reports that a similar conflict is brewing in Canada—except this time , the company is fighting back
GeoCoder is putting forth a huge array of defenses . They point out that postal codes , as facts , should not be copyrightable , that Canada Post 's copyright claim over the database itself is questionable , that even if such copyright exists their crowdsourced database is not infringing , that free postal code data is in the public interest , and that Canada Post 's complaint represents anti-competitive copyright misuse . As such , this will prove to be a test case for a bunch of legal questions that have yet to be fully answered by Canadian courts .
Ultimately , attempting to control postal codes makes no sense . Making it harder for people to utilize them and build services around them just decimates their purpose , and speeds their path to irrelevance in a world with lots of much better and more accessible location data—not to mention a world where physical locations and permanent addresses matter less and less for many purposes . It also seems entirely unfair : since postal codes are required for all sorts of things , including most interactions with the government , how can Canada Post ( a state-owned corporation ) restrict access to them ? All these arguments and more are likely to be raised , and could attract some interesting interveners to the case . This will definitely be a trial to watch .

Sony Ericsson CEO : We Should Have Taken The iPhone More Seriously
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Sony Ericsson President and CEO Bert Nordberg made a number of interesting statements about the iPhone , Android , Windows Phone and Motorola .
Defending the decision to pick Android as the choice operating system for its mobile handsets , Nordberg posits that it was ‘ the best choice they could have made ' considering its rapid growth , but also acknowledges that the company “ should have taken the iPhone more seriously when it arrived in 2007 ” .
Asked whether he would have liked to buy Motorola Mobility rather than Google , he candidly responds :
“ Well sure , but before you go shopping you have to become rich . And a deal between us would have been extremely complicated , with us being a private company with two large owners and them being a listed U.S. company . ”
Nordberg says the goal is for Sony Ericsson to gradually shed its feature phone business and become a 100 % smartphone company – much unlike Nokia , I should note . He estimates that to happen in the middle of next year ( 70 % of its sales already stem from smartphones today ) .
Asked why Sony Ericsson has n't become the world 's largest maker of Android devices yet , Nordberg tells the WSJ that they 've underestimated the speed with which it could penetrate the United States , where he acknowledges the company to be a “ very tiny player ” .
Sony Ericsson has an estimated 11 percent share of the total Android market .
Asked whether the company would consider switching to Microsoft 's Windows Phone platform , Nordberg says ( emphasis ours ) :
Paris - Saracens became the first team to reach the European Champions Cup on Saturday with a 33-17 victory over Ulster with two-time winners Leicester poised to join their English rivals in the last-eight .
Irish centre Luke Marshall gave Ulster an early lead in the Pool 1 game but a try from Billy Vunipola helped the English Premiership leaders into a 13-7 advantage at the interval .
Duncan Taylor , Maro Itoje and Schalk Brits added further scores for Saracens in the second half which gave them a bonus point victory and a fifth win in five games .
It also allowed them to secure a home tie in the quarter-finals with the win helping to ease the disappointment of losing their unbeaten record in the Premiership at the hands of Harlequins last week .
Saracens , the runners-up to Toulon in 2014 , have 24 points while 1999 champions Ulster stays in second place in the pool on 13 points , still with a chance of making the knockout rounds as one of the three best runners-up .
`` This competition is massive - it 's the best of the best , '' said Saracens ' England fly-half Owen Farrell , who was named man of the match for his inspirational playmaking and his 13 points .
`` We do n't pick and choose when to turn up in matches , because we want to win every game , but we have been up there in the Champions Cup in the last few years .
Farrell , watched by England coach Eddie Jones , added : `` We 've been working hard this season to get off to a kind of start we 've had , but now we 've got to make sure it stays that way . ''
Four-time champions Toulouse slumped to the foot of the table after a 32-14 loss at French rivals Oyannax .
In Pool 4 , Irish province Munster severely dented the hopes of Stade Francais of reaching the quarter-finals with a 26-13 home win over the French champions .
The bonus point win was just their second success of the pool stages and leaves them in third place with 10 points .
Stade were left stranded on 14 points , four behind Leicester who were expected to pick up maximum points later Saturday at home to Treviso and clinch qualification for the next round .
The French side would then have to defeat Leicester in Paris in the final pool game to have any chance of advancing as one of the best runner-up teams .
Munster had the best of a physical first half at Thomond Park , scoring two tries to nil as Stade Francais struggled to compete .
The first came after 32 minutes when hooker Mike Sherry powered over after an impressive driving line-out , while the second was a solo effort from centre Keith Earls on the stroke of half-time , bursting through a gap in the Stade ranks from the halfway line and sliding in under a late tackle .
The French had only two Morne Steyn penalties to show for their efforts as Munster turned with a 12-6 lead and things went from bad to worse for the visitors one minute into the second half .
Fly-half Ian Keatley was the architect sending through an inch-perfect chip for winger Simon Zebo to collect and score between the posts .
Stade were guilty of squandering several good scoring opportunities due to turnovers , but they got themselves back into the game with 17 minutes to go .
There looked to be little danger to the home side before an overthrown line-out in their own half was gobbled up by flanker Jonjo Jones who thundered in under the posts from 25 yards out .
The door was briefly open for Stade but three minutes later it shut again as the Munster pack bossed their way forward and South African flanker and club skipper CJ Stander muscled his way over after Connor Murray took a quick tap .
The French side went out in search of a second try that would have given them a defensive bonus point but they came up short .
In Saturday 's other early game Bordeaux edged Exeter 34-27 in a Pool 2 thriller .
Welsh side Ospreys still lead the group after a superb 21-13 win over last year 's runner-up Clermont and remains two points clear .

Some 2008 50 Peso coins were issued with Chile misspelled .
In numismatics , errors and varieties are two of the most studied and collected areas in the field . Minting facilities often catch these mistakes before they are released into circulation . When missed , they can be highly collectible often with the accompanying values . With advanced technology , errors and varieties in many countries have become scarce or minor in comparison with those in the past . As a result , the temptation to capitalize on the demand for them has become so great that some individuals are making them intentionally .
In Chile , some of the 2008 50 Peso coins were issued with a significant flaw ; Chile was misspelled as “ CHIIE , ” with a second “ I ” in place of the “ L. ” This “ error ” was brought to light in 2009 , with worldwide news stories trumpeting that a country had misspelled its name on its own currency . Subsequently , Gregorio Iniguez , the director of the Chile Mint , and others were fired from their jobs . So , the question is , was the coin an honest error or an intentional variation created for profit ?
To understand how errors and varieties are produced , you must consider how coins are made . Die manufacturing starts with a hub , which is the intended image of the manufactured coin . The master hubs are used to create the dies which are installed on a press . When struck together with a planchet ( metal blank ) between them , a coin bearing the images of the die design is created .
Coin errors can encompass a variety of unintended mistakes in the manufacturing process resulting in a piece that falls outside of mint tolerance for the standard issue . Varieties are created when dies used to strike coins differ from one another to an extent that they can be distinguished and classified as such . Varieties are most often created at the time of die manufacturing .
The Chilean coin would fall under the variety classification , since the issue involved only a particular die and was repeated on each coin that was struck by that die . Since there are two varieties of the 2008 Chile 50 Peso issue ( one with the Chile spelled correctly and one incorrectly ) , it can only be assumed that there are at least two different hubs used to create the coins . To maintain a consistent standard of coinage ( such as the Santiago Mint does today ) , skilled engravers and manufacturers are needed . Considering modern technology , it is very unlikely that the misspelling was done by accident .
Coincidentally , around the same time a significant number of other “ errors ” turned up for sale in Chile . For example , some coins were struck on made-to-order “ off metal ” planchets and some were off-struck . Some pieces struck on mint equipment ( such as feeding fingers ) were offered for sale over the internet . Considering modern technology and stringent quality control procedures , it is safe to say that these pieces could never accidentally leave the mint either . In the end , it was the misspelling of the name of the country that became a national embarrassment for Chile .
While it is interesting that the variety coins were released for general circulation , and may contribute to the idea that this was indeed an accident , those that were released were quickly identified after the news broke . The coins were hoarded by the public and collectors , and were sold over the internet . In the legacy of this event , numismatists and collectors have an interesting variety to study and a prize for years to come .

Words used in a decade-old audio recording have had a profound impact on the trajectory of the presidential race — so much so that without my even spelling them out , you probably already know what I 'm referring to .
The audio tape The Washington Post released on Oct. 8 revealed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the midst of a flippantly crass discussion about sexually assaulting women . The reaction to the tape was immediate and intense with Trump 's polling numbers in national averages taking a nosedive . According to a survey NBC and the Wall Street Journal conducted Oct. 8 and 9 , Trump faced an 11 point deficit nationally after the tapes emerged .
In any average presidential race , a major party nominee 's apparent approval of sexual assault would override most other voter considerations . But Trump supporters continue to shrug away Trump 's comments by comparing them to Clinton 's shortcomings — i.e . her “ Crooked Hillary ” reputation .
The truth is that Trump 's potentially criminal actions , specifically his abusive treatment of women , are far beyond his Democratic rival 's . Equating Trump 's moral and character failings with Clinton 's has more basis in sexist attitudes than reality .
The revelation that Trump holds less-than-savory opinions about women and a history to match it fits with what close observers already knew about the candidate 's personality . Even during the Republican primary elections , conservative outlets including National Review apprehensively noted the candidate 's unhealthy self-regard , his penchant for abuse of power and general temperamental unfitness for the highest office in American government .
Combined with what most already knew about Trump 's unabashed bigotry , it might seem strange that this most recent revelation was what finally pushed some Trump supporters over the edge .
Conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer offered a list of what he saw of as equally disqualifying aspects of Trump in a column last week for the Washington Post , including “ habitual mendacity , pathological narcissism , profound ignorance and an astonishing dearth of basic human empathy . ”
While none of those claims about Trump 's character are untrue , there is still an important distinction worth making between criticism of Trump as a private person and as a public persona . Krauthammer 's breakdown points to a weak , bad candidate , but the fallout following the release of the 2005 tape and the ensuing flood of sexual assault allegations against Trump suggest that a potential criminal is running for president .
These are n't just comments on his personality — they 're personal character flaws relevant to choosing a national leader .
There 's an obvious response to this critique of Donald Trump , and the reality TV star 's campaign has repeated this response well past the point of being rational or even intelligible : Hillary Clinton is the true criminal and should be in jail . Additionally , in light of ballooning difficulties for his chances with female voters , Trump chose to focus on attacking Clinton for her husband 's numerous sexual indiscretions .
While the very idea that Clinton 's actions with respect to her husband 's sexual assault accusers could rank on the same level with Trump 's real , pervasive and practiced sexism is laughable , the strategy has nevertheless worked to a point . The common wisdom about Trump and Clinton is that “ to elect either would be a moral disaster . ”
Trump 's allegations that Clinton “ viciously ” attacked women who accused her husband of assault are unsubstantiated at best and in some cases are actually contradicted by the women involved .
In one instance , Juanita Broaddrick , who accused Bill Clinton of rape in 1978 while Bill was governor of Arkansas , reported that Hillary Clinton approached her at a fundraiser shortly after the event to ostensibly offer her thanks for “ the things you do for him. ” While a cynical take on the episode might potentially suggest coercion , evidence is slim that Hillary Clinton knew anything about her husband 's assault at the time and her words on their own hardly suggest anything ominous .
But that is n't keeping Trump from crudely taking advantage of the story for political gain .
Sexism and a gender bias compose a running similarity between most character assassinations directed at Clinton . The Democrat 's continuing struggle with the character “ issue ” of likeability are shamefully conflated to be on par with real character flaws . Concerns about the candidate 's truthfulness and perceived secretiveness are somewhat better-founded . But it 's important to note that much of the reason for the candidate 's reluctance to engage with the media stems from aggressive , accusatory and potentially prejudiced press coverage that began with her emergence on the national political stage a quarter-century ago and has n't stopped since .
Much of the criticism involving Clinton 's personality has been based on what critics call her cold , unemotional personality . Again , this is n't necessarily untruthful , but it 's not a disqualifier for holding the top position in the country .
This is n't to say that Hillary Clinton has no character issues — she is , after all , a human being . What 's shocking is the degree to which national media and voters ' consciousness have internalized the absurd belief that Clinton 's missteps are in some way equivalent to Donald Trump 's outrageous abuse of people , be they his ex-wives , contestants in his beauty pageants or those small businesses unfortunate enough to hold contracts with his sham of a business .
Character matters , and , despite her human flaws , Hillary Clinton has the character of a president . Revelations about Trump 's character from the past few weeks have shown beyond the shade of a doubt that his is utterly unacceptable .
This presidential election is a choice less of policy than of character . One candidate 's flaws are human — the other 's are disqualifying .

James Ashby : AFP search former political staffer 's parents ' home , warrant names Brough , Pyne , Wyatt Roy
Updated
Three frontbenchers in the Turnbull Government have been named in a search warrant executed on a house owned by the parents of former Peter Slipper staffer James Ashby .
Australian Federal Police went to the property at Beerwah on the Sunshine Coast Tuesday morning with a warrant for items that `` relate to the diaries of Peter Slipper '' .
Nine officers searched the property , which Mr Ashby also works out of .
James Ashby has provided the ABC with a copy of the warrant which shows police were looking for mobile phones , SIM cards , computers , electronic storage devices , photographs , diary records and other correspondence .
The search warrant includes mention of Special Minister of State Mal Brough , Industry Minister Christopher Pyne and Assistant Minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy .
The ABC has contacted the offices of all three MPs for comment .
Mr Ashby hit the national headlines in 2012 when he accused his then-boss Mr Slipper , who was then the speaker of the House of Representatives , of sexual harassment .
Mr Ashby later dropped his Federal Court case against Mr Slipper , who had denied the allegations .
Mr Ashby was accused of leaking extracts of Mr Slipper 's diaries to the media and to Mr Brough , who went on to win Mr Slipper 's Sunshine Coast seat and recently became Special Minister of State in the Turnbull Government .
Ashby shocked by search of parents ' house
Mr Ashby , who recently became an adviser and pilot to Pauline Hanson , said he was `` shocked '' and `` disappointed '' by the search .
Peter Slipper continues to pursue charges against me for the whistleblowing act of revealing his diary . James Ashby , former political staffer of ex-speaker Peter Slipper .
`` They 're looking for diary records , photographs , correspondence , notes , telecommunications records , travel records , accommodation records , postal records , receipts , spreadsheets , and newspaper articles that relate to the diaries of Peter Slipper , '' he said .
`` Some of those people that they are looking for evidence of is communication with Christopher Pyne , Mal Brough , Wyatt Roy , along with Channel Nine and News Corp reporters .
Mr Brough told Channel Nine 's 60 Minutes in 2014 that he asked Mr Ashby to procure a copy of Slipper 's diary because he believed Mr Slipper had committed a crime .
Mr Ashby however today said that he volunteered the diary .
`` Peter Slipper continues to pursue charges against me for the whistleblowing act of revealing his diary , which later led to charges in Canberra and aided my case , '' Mr Ashby said .
Now their past is catching up with them - it 's unravelling by the day . Graham Perrett , Shadow Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Attorney-General
`` Mal Brough never procured me to get those diaries .
`` I had copies of the diaries already , I volunteered those diaries to Mal Brough .
`` Copies of Peter Slipper 's diaries were handed over to the Federal Police when I first made my sexual harassment claim .
`` So these guys today will have nothing new , I do n't have copies of those diaries . ''
Mr Ashby alleged Federal MP Graham Perrett and his `` best mate '' Mr Slipper are keeping the issue alive with the Federal Police because they were bitter that Fisher was lost .
Past catching up with the frontbenchers
Federal Labor 's Graham Perrett said there were some serious questions to answer .
`` Mal Brough , Christopher Pyne and Wyatt Roy have all tried to run a mile from their roles in this , '' he said .
`` Now their past is catching up with them - it 's unravelling by the day .
`` It 's time they each came clean once and for all about what their roles were . ''
The third condition of the warrant said there were `` reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will afford evidence as to the commission of the following indictable offence ( s ) ''
They include Mr Ashby allegedly accessing Mr Slipper 's official diary , which is restricted data , without authorisation between March 23 and April 13 , 2012 .
Between those dates he also allegedly communicated or caused to be communicated the extracts to a third party without authority .
Mr Brough allegedly counselled and procured Mr Ashby to access and disclose the extracts and provide them to third parties without authority .
Karen Lynette Doane , who also worked for Mr Slipper , allegedly communicated or caused to be communicated extracts from the diary and provided them to third parties .

25 % of those polled said IT and technology could save the world . The majority of these ( 80 % ) believed its biggest impact would be related to health and medical advancements . Other ways they believed technology could save the world were :
Helping the environment ( 74 % ) ( e.g . combating climate change )
Artificial intelligence ( 66 % ) ( e.g . robots protecting humans )
Space ( 60 % ) , ( e.g . exploration , expansion and asteroid detection )
Evolution ( 43 % ) ( e.g . technology making us more intelligent )
Although the majority of respondents ( 57 % ) thought IT and technology would n't save or destroy the world at all , 13 % were more cautious about the impact of technology in the future , believing it could destroy the world .
Top ways the respondents who think IT industries could obliterate the world included :
Prevention of evolution ( 74 % )
Military and warfare ( 66 % )
Artificial intelligence ( 44 % )
Environment ( 38 % )
Some of the concerns raised were worries of increased laziness due to reliance , privacy worries , mass unemployment due to automation of human jobs and creating ineptitude of social skills in younger generations .
Over a quarter ( 27 % ) even believed the Terminator plot and Skynet ( which deploys the army of Terminators against us in the first place ) could become a reality in the future .

Arsenal 's hopes of signing QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar have received a boost after the Brazilian 's agent revealed the Gunners 'remain a concrete option ' .
Cesar has spent just one season at Loftus Road but following QPR 's relegation from the Premier League , both the club and the player are eager to part ways .
However , the 33-year-old 's wages , reported to be £90,000-a-week , are proving a stumbling block to any proposed deal .

The goalkeeper had looked certain at one stage to join Napoli however the Serie A side do not want to match his current wages and instead have been seeking a loan deal - something that does n't interest QPR .
His wages are also thought to be the issue that saw Arsenal withdraw their interest earlier this month , but Cesar 's agent Josias Cardoso hopes the goalkeeper 's future will soon be resolved .
He said : “ Arsenal remain a concrete option . In Italy recently I have only spoken to Napoli . President Aurelio De Laurentiis wanted him but did n't want to pay Julio 's current wages . He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and after a great Confederations Cup performance he showed his desire to come back to Italy by demanding nothing more .
“ It would 've been normal for someone in his position to ask for a pay rise but he did n't . Is there still hope of seeing him in Italy ? If I do n't have official contact with a club , then I can not have hope . ”

While many of the chemicals used in common personal-care products are benign , some are known carcinogens , neurotoxins or reproductive toxins . Others are endocrine disrupters that upset the body 's hormonal balance ( leading to weight gain and other hormone-related health problems ) , including chemicals that mimic estrogen in the body and can cause problems in sexual development and adult sexual function , as well as increase the risk of breast and prostate cancer .
Unfortunately , these toxic ingredients may be more prevalent than you think : More than one-third of all personal-care products contain at least one ingredient linked to cancer . And that 's just the tip of the iceberg , as less than 20 percent of the chemicals in personal-care products have been tested for safety . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) does n't regulate or limit the use of chemicals in personal-care products or require that all of the ingredients be listed on the label .
As a result , trying to choose safer personal-care products can be confounding . You can read labels , but because the FDA does n't regulate the health claims or labeling for personal-care items , the words “ organic , ” “ herbal , ” “ natural , ” “ hypoallergenic ” and “ nontoxic ” used on these products have no legal meaning . One particularly maddening example of this is the “ pink-washing ” of brands that have campaigns to fight breast cancer while continuing to use chemicals that have been linked to cancer .

No one should have to worry about inadvertently choosing toxic products while shopping in the personal-care aisle . That 's why a group of organizations , including the Breast Cancer Fund , have come together to form The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics , a coalition working to eliminate dangerous chemicals from cosmetics and personal-care products through legislative , regulatory and corporate reforms .
But you do n't have to wait for major reforms to find safer products . Here 's what you can do today to protect and promote your health and safeguard your family :
WASHINGTON -- Rep. Darrell Issa ( R-Calif. ) said Sunday that the media is unfairly questioning Republicans about Rudy Giuliani 's recent claim that President Barack Obama does n't love America , and insisted that the public should `` thank '' the former New York City mayor for his comments .
Earlier this week , Giuliani said he believes Obama is unpatriotic .
`` I do not believe , and I know this is a horrible thing to say , but I do not believe that the president loves America , '' Giuliani reportedly said during a fundraiser in New York . `` He does n't love you . And he does n't love me . He was n't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country . ''
Issa came to Giuliani 's defense on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday .
`` The reality is that Rudy has taken our debate -- and I think we should thank him for this part of it -- back to national security , to the key element that the president should be focusing on , '' Issa said , before carefully parsing Giuliani 's words in an effort to soften them . `` Rudy Giuliani said he 'did n't believe ' . He did n't say the president 'was n't , ' he said he 'did n't believe . ' Now the reality is that I do believe that the president believes strongly in America , I just think he views America differently . ''
Issa also criticized the media for asking Republicans to respond to Giuliani 's statements instead of focusing on comments made by Vice President Joe Biden . Though Biden is well-known in Washington for his propensity to gaffe , Issa did not cite any particular `` Bidenism . ''
`` If we wanted to get -- get on top of the vice president every time he says something flip and foolish or vulgar , we could have this discussion every Sunday , '' Issa said .
`` Congressman Issa , the vice president may very well be clumsy , but these remarks were hateful , '' CNN host Gloria Borger responded .
When critics assailed Giuliani 's comments as racist , the former mayor said that he could n't be guilty of racism against Obama because the president 's mother was white .
`` This is n't racism . This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism , '' Giuliani said .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan 's economy rebounded from recession in the final quarter of last year but growth was weaker than expected as household and corporate spending disappointed , underlining the challenge premier Shinzo Abe faces in shaking off decades of stagnation .

The annualized 2.2 percent expansion in October-December was smaller than a 3.7 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll , suggesting a fragile recovery as the hangover from last year 's sales tax hike lingered .
The preliminary reading for gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which translates into a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.6 percent , follows two straight quarters of contraction , data by the Cabinet Office showed on Monday .
Economic Minister Akira Amari told reporters after the data 's release that the economy was on track for a recovery with signs consumer sentiment is picking up .
But analysts pointed to the weak rebound in consumption and capital expenditure as worrying signs to the outlook .
“ These are somewhat disappointing figures , ” said Takeshi Minami , chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute . “ The situation remains weak and companies are clearly postponing investments . ”
BOJ ON HOLD
The rebound from recession , however , will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus for now even as slumping oil prices push inflation further away from its 2 percent target , analysts say .
“ The BOJ is expected to keep monetary policy unchanged for a while to see the impact from the latest easing , ” said Taro Saito , director of economic research at NLI Research Institute .
The data will be one of the key factors the BOJ will scrutinize at its two-day rate review ending on Wednesday , where it is widely set to maintain the current pace of asset purchases in its monetary stimulus program .
Private consumption , which makes up about 60 percent of the economy , rose 0.3 percent in the final quarter , less than a median market forecast for a 0.7 percent increase .
Capital expenditure also rose just 0.1 percent after two straight quarters of declines , suggesting the BOJ 's aggressive money printing has yet to nudge firms into boosting investment .
In a glimmer of hope , external demand added 0.2 percentage point to growth on robust shipments to the United States and China , Japan 's two biggest export destinations .
One of the biggest headwinds for Japan is a deteriorating global economic outlook , which has triggered a wave of monetary easings around the world to fight of deflationary pressures and prop up growth .
But Japanese policymakers are hoping a rebound in exports , which had been a soft spot in the economy despite support from a weak yen , and lower fuel costs will encourage firms to spend more on wages and expenditure .
“ The economy will recover backed by firm domestic demand as Japan 's terms of trade improves on oil price falls , ” Amari said .
Japan 's economy slid into recession in July-September last year , prompting Abe to delay a second sales tax hike initially scheduled in October 2015 .
The slump slowed Japan 's quest to beat off nearly two decades of grinding deflation , and forced the BOJ into expanding monetary stimulus in October last year .
Weird is a difficult thing to aim for . It 's one thing if a creative work generates an outré and off-center aesthetic by serendipitous accident or opaque genius . But executing so that something feels loopy is much harder if an entire audience knows that 's where you 're trying to wind up . It 's the problem that 's staring right in the face of the newest version of Doom Patrol .
The problem with Doom Patrol is that it was never supposed to have a legacy . When the team first appeared in one of DC Comics ' non-descript anthology titles decades ago , their popularity took folks by surprise . The miserable , self-loathing affect of characters like Robotman , Elasti-Girl and Negative Man made them stand apart from square-jawed paragons like Superman . That tone , combined with goofy enemies who were machine-gun-toting gorillas and disembodied brains , turned them into a cult curiosity in the publisher 's stable . The various re-imaginings that the team has undergone have either doubled down on the fringe flavoring—as with the legendary Grant Morrison and Rachel Pollack runs—or ignoring the weirdness for straight-ahead superhero stylings . The most radical re-invention that the Doom Patrol got in recent years was an attempt at making them more “ normal. ” But that 's not what 's happening this time .

Doom Patrol # 1 is more than just a first issue of a new series . It 's also the debut of Young Animal , a pop-up imprint from DC Comics where the titles and talent have been chosen and curated by musician Gerard Way . The mastermind of now-defunct alt-rockers My Chemical Romance has had a lifelong relationship with comics , including an internship at DC in his younger days . It makes a cyclical kind of sense that Doom Patrol is the flagship book for Young Animal , as Way is an avowed acolyte of both Grant Morrison and classic old-school Vertigo Comics .

The action in this first issue—written by Way , with art by Nick Derington , Tamra Bonvillain , and Todd Klein— starts by introducing young EMT Casey Brinke and her partner Samson as they hastily shuttle an elderly man to an emergency room so he can keep on living . Right away , Casey 's inner monologue reveals her to be an energetically determined sort of quirky , but she 's grounded by work responsibilities and everyday concerns . Things explode right in front of her multiple times in this issue and her reactions are concern and glee . The fact that she does n't recoil in horror on seeing Robotman shattered to pieces after getting hit by a garbage truck means that she 's going to deal reasonably well with whatever comes next .
Niles Caulder , Robotman , Danny the Street , and the signature Doom Patrol characters you came to see are here ... but they 're also not . The narrative flits around willy-nilly going from an existential consideration of what life might be like inside a gyro to Robotman fighting a micro-sized army that want to kill a fly on the aforementioned gyro to a hotel meeting of businessmen not of this world . Digestible plot causality is a secondary consideration here , and the puzzle pieces thrown at readers are meant to flood synapses and broaden horizons . You 'll understand it all eventually but do n't try so hard right at the outset . If there 's been any motto that ties the various Doom Patrol mutations together , it 's probably something like , “ to live through trauma is to change with the times. ” The Doom Patrol are heroes for a mutating world . They 're not supposed to come back the same as before .

This new attempt at Doom Patrol gives readers just enough by way of graspable anchor points to grab their attention , while also indulging in lyrical psychedelia , quick-cut glimpses of recognizable characters , and satires of late-capitalist awfulness .
Way knows you 're here for weird . The bizarre carnival that he and his co-conspirators are building might be dusting off and re-purposing the bones of Doom Patrols past , but it 's also shrugging off nostalgia in favor of an all-new umami . This is a self-aware slice of off-the-wall superhero pizza , served out of an establishment that you 'll probably want to come back to .

When coach Bret Bielema left Wisconsin for Arkansas in 2012 , SEC watchers were doubtful that his grunt-and-grind , pro-style scheme would work against like-minded bullies LSU and Alabama . After shutting out the Tigers and coming within a fumble of beating the Tide last year , the Razorbacks turned many of those skeptics into believers . Arkansas finished 7–6 but had more heartbreaking misses than Dustin Johnson at the majors .
Four starters are back on an offensive line that was the conference 's best , as are senior Jonathan Williams and junior Alex Collins , the country 's only tandem of 1,000-yard backs last year . Most SEC quarterbacks need name tags , but third-year starter Brandon Allen gives Arkansas consistency ( 20 touchdowns to just five interceptions in 2014 ) and experience ( 25 starts ) . He and new offensive coordinator Dan Enos will be limited in what they can do downfield , however , because the Hogs ' receiving crew is the weakest in the league .
Look for second-year coordinator Robb Smith 's defense to recalibrate after losing five starters . Immediate help comes from an unexpected place : freshman Hjalte Froholdt , a 6 ' 5 '' , 311-pound tackle from Svendborg , Denmark . He 's got huge upside , just like Bielema 's Hogs .
Opposing coach 's take
The offensive line revels in being the strength of the team ; they 'll push you until you surrender . To me , they show the value of having an identity and not wavering from it , even when the results are n't there [ such as during their 17-game SEC losing streak ] . It will be interesting to see , with Dan Enos calling the plays , how they evolve on offense . … Those two backs [ Williams and Collins ] are as good as any pair in the country . Brandon Allen is solid , and his best receiving threat is [ junior tight end ] Hunter Henry , who made ridiculous catches and is perfect for their play-action game . They love to get him lost behind the linebackers in space . … The D struggled against Auburn and A & M 's pass games last year ; as the season went on , they played faster and more confidently , but they 're not designed to win shootouts .
X-factor
Allen 's view was frequently frightening last year . “ A lot of defenses , ” he says , “ lined up nine guys in the box. ” Can junior wide receiver Dominique Reed ( 6 ' 3 '' , 4.3 speed ) force teams to deploy more troops downfield ? Reed , who had 16 TD catches at Coffeyville ( Kan. ) Community College last year , must quickly become a skilled route-runner.​
Schedule analysis
It 's realistic for Arkansas to start 5–0 and enter the national title conversation . After noshing on UTEP , Toledo and Texas Tech , the Hogs have a manageable stretch by SEC standards—erratic Texas A & M in Arlington ( Sept. 26 ) and a trip to rebuilding Tennessee ( Oct. 3 ) . Win those and the stakes will be high on Oct. 10 , when the Hogs head to Alabama .

Berlin 's relations with some of its main partners in the Middle East were under critical scrutiny on Tuesday after a leaked intelligence report linked the governments of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Qatar with Salafist movements in Germany .
It has long been suspected that states in the Middle East support the missionary efforts of Islamic fundamentalists . This report , carried out by Germany 's domestic and foreign spy agencies on behalf of the German government , is noteworthy in that it names three Salafist organizations it says are `` closely connected with government offices in their home countries . '' The report added that `` global proselytizing '' remains part of Saudia Arabia 's `` reason of state '' and an integral part of Saudi foreign policy . The report predicts that Salafist organizations will `` continue to expand their activities in Europe and Germany . ''
Germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the BND , declined to confirm the accuracy of the leaked excerpts or give any further details from the report , saying that it only provided information to the government . But experts say that the warning about state-sponsored Salafism should be taken seriously .
`` I think these reports are credible , '' Sebastian Sons from the think tank German Council on Foreign Relations told Deutsche Welle . `` It 's well known that for decades Saudi Arabia has been launching missionary initiatives throughout the world , both by using private foundations and by sending clergymen abroad . Saudi Arabia wants to present itself as the leader of the Sunni Islamic world . ''
The report says that it 's impossible to distinguish between missionary work and support for jihadist violence in one of the organizations , the Kuwaiti Revival of Islamic Heritage Society . The latest estimates put the number of Salafists in Germany at slightly below 10,000 - politicians agree that they represent a potential risk .
`` The danger is real and should n't be underestimated , '' says Social Democratic Member of Parliament and Middle East expert Rolf Mützenich . `` For quite some time we 've had indications and evidence that German Salafists are getting assistance , which is approved by the governments of Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Kuwait , in the form of money , the sending of imams and the building of Koran schools and mosques . ''
And there 's one group some observers fear could be particularly susceptible to radicalization :
Worries about refugees
The majority of refugees to Germany are Muslims
Germany took in some 900,000 refugees from crisis regions , most prominently Syria , in 2015 , and if significant numbers of them grow frustrated , they could represent potentially fertile ground for Islamic fundamentalism . Insiders say that Syrian refugees are sometimes surprised at how conservatively Islam is interpreted by some imams in Germany .
`` The danger exists , and we need to vigorously counteract it , '' Mützenich told Deutsche Welle . `` The best way of preventing refugees from being radicalized is speedy and successful integration . To achieve that we need professional prevention and de-radicalization programs . Concretely that means more money and resources for specialists in schools , government administration , police , youth welfare organizations , prisons and reform schools . ''
The Saudi Arabian royal family has been allied with Wahhabism , the Saudi form of Salafism , since the late 18th century . But although the German intelligence report concludes that support for missionary movements is part of a long-term foreign policy strategy of Saudi Arabia , Sons does n't think that Riyadh particularly has its sights set on Germany .
`` While we should n't underestimate the Saudi influence , I do n't believe that Germany is the primary target of Wahhabist proselytizing , '' the Middle East expert said . `` In the past that was always the Islamic world , in Asia , in the Balkans and in Africa . And I think those are the areas where this will prove increasingly relevant in the future . ''
The BND , however , has been tracking what it calls growing Saudi `` interventionism '' since the beginning of the year . And the leaked report is increasing pressure on the German government to counteract it .
A well-timed leak
Relations are cozy between the Saudi royal family and German defense ministry
Berlin has never been keen about attempts from within Saudi Arabia to promote Islamic fundamentalism in Germany , and many people object to Germany providing weapons to Middle East allies with questionable records on democracy and human rights .
Could the two issues become linked in the wake of the leaked report ?
`` The German government and the Foreign Ministry have called upon the governments in question to stop their support [ for German salafists ] , '' Mützenich says . `` In this context , the concrete question arises as to whether we should keep supplying arms to these countries and other crisis regions . I think the German government should send a clear signal . ''
Indeed , sources within the security community , who asked not to be named , think that the timing of the leak may be anything but accidental . Opposition to Germany providing Saudi Arabia with weapons seems to be growing within the intelligence community , and perhaps releasing parts of the report is an attempt to force the hand of politicians in Berlin .
Sons , too , thinks the time may have come for an arms embargo .
`` The government has to show that it has a clear strategy for how to deal with a difficult partner like Saudi Arabia , '' Sons says . `` In my eyes , weapons shipments should be off the table . And on state visits , it 's important to raise the topics of human rights and Wahhabist proselytizing . ''
All the same , there is little chance that Berlin will risk complete estrangement from a powerful ally in the Middle East .
`` We ca n't forget that Saudi Arabia is the most important Arab force in the region , '' Sons added . `` There 's no way we can do without this country , whether we like it or not . ''
Barely 500 m from the half-samadhi half-mazaar that is the monument to poet Kabir , Mohammad Asad tells a story about the growing number of abandoned cattle in the Maghar kasba of Sant Kabir Nagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh . “ A truck comes here at night . They ( Hindu farmers ) keep the animals that still give milk and send the others to be let loose here in the dark ” .

An hour away by road , the Hindu farmers of Nooruddin Chak village on the edge of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath 's home turf in Gorakhpur are also agitated about the stray cattle . “ Our crop has been damaged , 20 quintals have been reduced to five , ” says Simrita Devi . Here , they have their own version of the truck-and-cattle story .
The villain is not the malevolent neighbour of another community but the Machiavellian municipality .
“ The city administration and the dairies send trucks loaded with cattle into our villages in the night , to clear them from the city and release them into our fields , ” says Pappu Yadav .

Ever since the Yogi government strictly enforced the ban on cow slaughter , the “ awara bachcda ( stray calf ) ” , abandoned and set loose by the farmer to wander the fields and streets , has become a “ vikat samasya ( formidable problem ) ” , taking its place in the list of threats to the crop , alongside the Nilgai and wild boar .

And for Muslims , calves , cows and buffalos are giving a new name to an old insecurity .
“ A cow injured a girl but no one could say anything . But if we dare lead the cattle away from our neighbourhoods , we will be accused of slaughtering them , get beaten up ” , says Asad . Muslims must be careful not to get into any controversy in these times , he says , they must n't talk freely in “ mixed ” gatherings .
Qutabbuddin Ansari , BSP 's zilla mahasachiv , says : “ Declare the cow a national animal and hang those who do it harm . We will accept it . But at the same time , you must also ensure that those who rear cows look after them . ”

In the village of Sanjhain , district Gorakhpur , Ramghulam Nishad , who sells milk , quotes the chief minister 's answer when asked about the growing problem : “ Baba ( Adityanath ) says , you take its milk , so you must look after it. ” But “ how can we feed our cattle if we ca n't make our own ends meet ? ” counters Dhruvachand , a student . “ The animal will turn on the farmer — it is bound to happen if the Muslim does not slaughter it for beef ” .
In Mangoorgarh village in Azamgarh , not far from Gorakhpur , Kalavati speaks for many : “ If I had the money , I would collect all the cows and leave them at Yogiji 's doorstep . ”
In the neighbouring village of Sukhipur , Ram Pratap Singh says he has the means but fears the police . “ We will transport them at our own cost to Yogiji 's temple . But he must ensure we are not harassed by the police . We are Hindus , we are not against the cow ” .
Raju Singh points to a grievously wounded bull walking by : “ To save our crop , we are attacking our cattle . It 's a sin worse than slaughter . ”
For many Muslims , apart from stoking the fear of vigilantism , the Yogi government 's strict enforcement of the cow slaughter ban and clampdown on slaughter houses and meat shops has meant a grievous loss of livelihood — the local business of meat employs mostly Muslims while Hindus are a more visible presence in the export industry .
On the face of it , the government has moved only against “ illegal ” and “ unlicensed ” establishments . But in a meat economy operating mainly in the grey zone , this has had a wider effect .
Over the years , a weak regulatory system and those wanting to make a fast buck have conspired with a “ secular ” politics to subvert the licensing requirements and norms . For politicians cultivating the “ Muslim vote ” , extending a protective umbrella to illicit slaughter houses and meat shops was a way of doing secularism on-the-cheap — requiring only the wink and a nudge , not delivery on the substantive promises of bijli-sadak-paani and padhai .
In Khalapar locality of Muzaffarnagar town , Gulzar Ahmed nurses a cup of tea as he sits outside a small provision store and watches others go about their business . He lost his job as a munshi ( accountant ) in a small leather business that could not survive the double blow of demonetisation and new restrictions on meat . Finding another job will not be easy in these times and he is too old for manual labour . “ Unemployment here is now almost 90 per cent . The closing down of the meat business has also affected the sale of fruit , milk , tea — the entire economy has been hurt , not just the sale of meat ” , he says .
Licensed meat shops account for a fraction of the total , one estimate is barely 10 per cent . Many meat-sellers admit that what was happening before the Yogi government cracked down was wrong too : meat being sold in unsanitary conditions , shops violating norms on pollution and medical clearances for slaughter houses , refrigerators , automatic door-closers and walls with tiles . “ But how can there be compliance all of a sudden ? , ” asks Mohammad Yaqub Ansari , fruit seller , whose business has also taken a hit . “ Surely , there were other ways of cleaning up , addressing the problem ” .
“ Dil hi nahi karta ( I do n't feel like eating ) ” , says Zakia Khan , a young mother of three , whose husband runs an NGO for Hindu-Muslim unity in Khalapar . “ We only get frozen meat now from outside , it goes from one freezer to another ” .
In his home in Rampur , affluent businessman and president of the Veneer Association , Muslim Moin Qureshi , puts into words the fear that is straddling the class divide : “ My son is a doctor in the Indian army . If I offer to pack kebab for him when he travels back to work after a vacation at home , he says , no daddy , I will not take meat . If something happens , who will prove whether the meat is of the cow or buffalo ? No one controls the gau rakshak . ”
Qureshi talks of inflammatory WhatsApp videos doing the rounds . And shows one on his phone — a string of grainy visuals suggesting the Rohingya Muslims are man-eaters . “ I forward them to my children who tell me they are fake . But I receive several every day ” .
Inside the Gorakhpur math , Dwarika Tiwari , Yogi 's senior aide , who has spent 46 years at the math , talks about the ban on cow slaughter : “ Jaisa khaye ann , vaisa ho mann ( you are what you eat ) ” . There are “ achche Musalman ( good Muslims ) ” , says Tiwari , who do n't eat meat .
He defends the vigilantism in the name of the cow : “ If you are carrying meat , who knows what meat it is . If you are wearing a burqa , who knows what is inside the burqa ” .
General secretary of the Hindu Yuva Vahini P K Mall , underlines the Yogi government 's commitment to the cow : “ The title of the ‘ Gorakhnath Peeth ' ( the monastic establishment headed by Yogi ) derives from the ‘ Goraksh Peeth ' , it is associated with gau raksha ( cow protection ) ” . And Yogi 's stature as “ Gorakh Peethadheeshwar ” , head of the mutt , is much bigger than his position as “ chief minister ” , he says .

He says the Vahini is determined to take the state their “ Maharajji ” now rules back in time . “ Gochar ki bhoomi kahan gayi ( where has the village grazing land gone ) . We will make gau shalas , punish those who built on it and made multi-storeyed buildings. ” Outside the spacious complex of the Gorakhnath Math , where Mall speaks , traffic crawls , the movement of vehicles , men and animals , a daily act of give and take .
A new front for Islamic terrorists is emerging and it is being called the New Great Equalizer . Hold on to your seats , a large scale attack may be looming . You have to know about this . Unfortunately , this type of news is not always reported by the mainstream media .
In a new study conducted by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology ( ICIT ) revealed that terrorists are now arming themselves with technological and technical skills for targeting online systems that support Western businesses and infrastructure . ( Note : I have a link to the complete study at the end of this article if you want to read the whole thing . It 's actually quite interesting . )
This directly impacts anyone who uses the internet or relies on the internet for business or personal reasons .
Dubbed as `` Cyber-Jihadists '' , these terrorists communicate via the Dark Web to exchange attack ideas , solicit services from hacker mercenaries and purchase readily available malware for mass distribution .
`` They do not solely seek to exfiltrate valuable data or information , '' the report warns , `` These threat actors seek to cause chaos , disrupt operations , and inflict devastating impacts on organizations in every critical sector . ''
As they try to amass resources and evolve their technological skills , the Cyber-Jihad movement is also aiming to recruit via Jihadist chat rooms and social media platforms .
They 're targeting socially disenfranchised citizens and radicals who may not have the technical expertise yet , but have the physical access and insider info to the Western institutions and targets they wish to disrupt .
You really need to be careful as ISIS moves online in a big way . It 's not just recruiting and communication efforts . Experts in terrorism are expecting a rise in ISIS-distributed malware and online operatives .
One of the popular Islamist terror groups , ISIS , even offers a 24-hour cyber help desk to assist with securing and encrypting online communications and offer technical training on basic hacking .
This help desk is staffed with senior operatives with a minimum requirement of a college degree in information technology . The cyber help desk also acts as a recruitment tool through a `` sense of community and mentorship , '' to spread fear and increase attacks on Western targets , the study further reveals .
Another cause of concern is the availability of compromised servers through underground channels , which could be springboards for these Cyber-Jihad attacks .
In a report from Reuters , researchers found a major underground marketplace called xDedic selling access to more than 70,000 compromised servers around the world for as little as $ 6 . Even major government servers could be accessed for as cheap as $ 7 .
As the government is fighting physical terror attacks , a new front is now in our midst .
Think of everything ISIS has now online . First , there is the availability of thousands of controllable servers . Add to this the proliferation of commercial malware , tech savvy recruits , insider access to computer infrastructure , communications via the dark web and money . That 's right , they also have a workable budget .
All combined , this is the beginnings of a massive Jihadist virtual army capable of launching the next big attack in cyberspace .

Four UN staff members have been sacked for distributing and storing child abuse images on work computers and email accounts in the last 18 months , while ten more have been fired for child rape and sex abuse cases in the last decade , according to an internal UN report .
But the UN has no record of any criminal actions having been brought against the members of staff . Commentators suggest that the way the cases have been dealt with raises questions about how the UN responds to sex abuse allegations .
UN criticised for failure to pursue rape allegations against staff Investigation finds two thirds of internal UN probes into alleged rapes by peacekeepers not passed on to national courts Read more
The cases are among several hundred cases in an internal annual report on disciplinary matters and cases of criminal behaviour in the organisation for the period July 2014 to June this year .
The staff , who are not named , are accused of distributing “ pornographic material involving a minor ” using their UN email accounts , as well as storing material on the organisation 's computers .
Reports going back to 2007 reveal that four more staff members have been disciplined for distributing child abuse images in the last eight years .
In 2007-8 , a member of staff was found to have “ repeatedly used UN laptops to download and view paedophile material ” . The staff member is reported to have “ persisted with such conduct even after being formally warned for misusing UN property ” .
As punishment , the individual was “ separated from service with compensation in lieu of notice , without termination indemnity ” . Three more staff members were dismissed in 2011 for distributing child abuse images . A further ten cases going back to 2004-5 were found where UN staff members engaged in sexual activity with minors , including several rape cases .
None of the reports refer to any criminal action being brought against the personnel .
A spokesperson from the UN said the organisation has referred all “ credible allegations of criminal conduct , including those relating to sexual exploitation and abuse and the distribution and storage of child pornography images , by officials and experts on mission ” to the states of nationality since the General Assembly adopted resolution 62/63 on criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission in 2007 .
However , the spokesperson also said the UN was “ not aware of any criminal convictions relating to cases of sexual exploitation and abuse and child pornography ” . He said that the organisation “ has not been requested to cooperate in any national proceedings ” .
The reports also highlight other criminal acts committed by UN officials , including one staff member who was dismissed for using an official vehicle “ to transport approximately 173kg of marijuana ” . One member of staff was disciplined for trying to transport a chainsaw on UN passenger plane without authorisation , while another was reprimanded for stealing $ 2,200 from the luggage of a passenger travelling on a United Nations flight .
The UN has been dogged by sexual abuse allegations against staff members and officials throughout this year . In April , the Guardian revealed that a UN official had been suspended for leaking a report detailing sexual abuse committed against street children in the Central African Republic to French authorities . Weeks earlier , an internal report described sexual abuse as a “ significant risk ” to UN peacekeeping missions
Brian Concannon , executive director at the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti , an advocacy organisation which advocates for human rights in the country , which has a significant UN peacekeeper presence , said that the way the UN has handled these cases is far from ideal .
“ The UN 's response shows just how deeply the UN 's head is buried in the sand regarding sexual abuse , ” said Concannon .
“ An organisation seriously committed to reducing abuse would track the cases it refers to the staff 's home countries , so it knows how well its own investigations are working , and whether it needs to require improvements in accountability before accepting more staff from that country . ”

Whatever happened to that Gatchaman CG movie that was announced long ago ?
Imagi was a new company based on Hong Kong that had amazing talent and their CG was topnotch even if they were new in the industry . This was a company I thought would be huge . After the announcement of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie for 2007 named TMNT they announced they were working on a movie based on the Gatchaman which was a classic Tatsunoko anime adapted twice for western audiences , first as Battle of the Planets and later than G-Force .
We first got a poster but then were treated with a trailer circa 2007 which is the one we see above and later we got another one circa 2009 which is the one we see below , with the movie aiming for a 2011 release . Sadly TMNT 2007 under performed int he cinemas and failed to get a sequel . The project kept getting delayed and eventually a movie based on the popular manga/anime character Astro Boy got priority for Imagi ; This movie did even worse at the Box Office . Even though they also had a few smaller projects after having no real hits they ran out of money and went bankrupt .
It 's a shame that this movie was never able to released as it looked like a great take on the franchise and had very nice concept art and designs . Story was n't one of Imagi 's strong points however since both TMNT and Astro-Boy had rather generic stories but who knows if it would 've been the same here . All we have from this movie is the two teasers and some concept art and video which you can see below .
Typically associated with destructive military campaigns , drones—the unarmed kind—are becoming an essential tool for civil society . From a bird's-eye view , they are exposing the truth about everything from the size of demonstrations to the obscene wealth illegally hoarded by corrupt political elites .
As a watchdog of government activity and an investigative journalism center , our organization has used drones to offer Hungarians a new perspective—both literally and figuratively—on key narratives unfolding in their country .
Through drone footage , we 've revealed the hidden assets of government politicians and pro-government oligarchs , including castles acquired by companies tied to the son-in-law of Hungary 's prime minister . Such concrete signs of personal enrichment—which , in many cases , can only be filmed from the air—give citizens a clear picture of the corruption and inequality that is all around them .
At the same time , drones are useful for throwing into relief the power of civil society . In 2014 , we captured aerial footage of the protests against the government 's internet tax . More recently , we filmed refugees marching across Budapest—showing their tragic situation helped us counter government narratives about migrants being dangerous enemies or conquerers .
In each instance , using drones helped us calculate the number of people present , a task that has proven difficult even for the press . Other Hungarian journalists using camera drones to cover these events have faced police resistance on a number of occasions , although the laws around the usage of drones remain fuzzy .
As people increasingly turn to drones for a wide variety of purposes , it is important to set up a legal framework within which they can be operated . Authorities should consult with civil society organizations and journalists to jointly develop regulations , while taking into consideration the right to privacy , freedom of the press , and the importance of keeping the public informed .
DEAR SUGAR , The Rumpus Advice Column # 95 : The Dudes In the Woods Debacle
Dear Sugar ,
Three of my best college buddies and I go away for an annual guys weekend at a cabin in the woods .
We 're all in our mid-thirties and we 've been doing these get-togethers for close to a decade . It 's our way of staying in touch , since we 've all got busy lives and some of us reside in different cities . Though at times I 'll go months without talking to them , I consider these guys my closest friends . We 've seen each other through several relationships , two weddings , one divorce , one of us coming out as gay , one of us realizing he 's an alcoholic and getting sober , one of us becoming a father , dysfunctional family issues , the death of another one of our close college friends , professional successes and failures , and—you get the picture .
On our most recent get together a few months ago , I overheard my friends discussing me . Before this incident occurred , the four of us had been on the subject of my love life . My long-time girlfriend and I broke up last year for reasons I wo n't go into here , but I did go into with my friends back when she and I decided to end things . Not long before my weekend with the guys , she and I got back together and I told them my ex and I were making a go of it again . They did n't say much in response , but I would n't have expected them to .
Later that day I stepped out for a walk , but soon realized I 'd forgotten my hat , so I returned to the cabin to get it . The moment I opened the door I could hear my friends in the kitchen discussing me . I was n't trying to eavesdrop , but I could n't keep myself from listening , since they were talking about my girlfriend and me . I would n't say they were trashing me , but they did make critical remarks about the way I “ justify ” my relationship and other things about my personality that were unflattering . About five minutes into this , I opened the door and shut it hard so they would know I was there and they stopped talking .
I tried to pretend I did n't hear what they 'd said , but soon I told them what had happened . They were extremely embarrassed . Each of them apologized , assured me they meant nothing by what they said , and claimed they were only concerned that I 'd gotten back together with my girlfriend , who they do n't think is good for me . I played it off like it was cool and acted like I wanted to let bygones be bygones , but it 's been a few months and I 'm still bothered by what happened . I feel betrayed . It 's none of their business who I choose to date for one thing and for another I 'm pissed they were running me down like that .
I recognize that I 'm possibly taking this too hard . I 'll admit that I have talked about each of them with the others over the years . I 've made statements I would n't want the person in question to hear , even secondhand . The rational part of me understands that these sorts of discussions among friends are to be expected . It sounds weak to admit this , but I 'm hurt . Part of me wants to tell them to go fuck themselves when it comes to the weekend at the cabin next year . What do you think ? Should I forgive and forget or find new a batch of buddies ?
Odd Man Out
Dear Odd Man Out ,
What a disaster . How dreadful it must have been to hear your friends saying negative things about you . How mortified they must have felt when they learned you 'd been listening . You have every reason to be upset and hurt . And yet….and yet—you knew there was going to be an “ and yet , ” did n't you ? —in the scheme of things this is quite small , quite ordinary . I 'm positive you should not toss these friends aside for a new batch of them .
Besides—those new friends ? They 'd only talk about you behind your back too . But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
Perhaps the first step in getting over this is to talk to your friends and collectively acknowledge that what happened was indeed deeply unfortunate . By hearing what you were not meant to hear you punctured a social code that 's in place to protect your feelings . You heard your friends express opinions about you that they are too polite to tell you and they expressed them in blunt language they would not have used had they known you were listening . You witnessed a discussion that was being had about you that was unbound by concern for your feelings . No wonder you feel so stung . Anyone would .
That your friends have those opinions , however , does not mean that they do n't love you or value you as a friend or otherwise think you are one of the best people they know . That may be difficult to believe at this moment , when your feelings are so raw , but it 's true .
We talk about our friends behind their backs . We do . Ask any social scientist who has studied human communication behaviors . Even you admitted to doing this . Our friends are witness to our attributes and flaws , our bad habits and good qualities , our contradictions and our contrivances . That they need to occasionally discuss the negative aspects of our lives and personalities in terms less than admiring is to be expected . Like anything , there are healthy and constructive ways to do this and unhealthy and destructive ways .
A healthy way is rooted in respect and love . In this case , we make critical assessments and uncomplimentary observations entirely within the context of our affection and concern for the individual in question . Sometimes we talk behind a friend 's back in order to grapple with our doubts about or disapproval of the choices he or she has made . Sometimes we do it because our friends possess qualities that confound , confuse , or annoy the shit out of us , though we love them anyway . Sometimes we discuss our friends with others because we had a weird or rude or dumb interaction with one of them and we simply need to blow off steam . The baseline of these discussions is a grounded knowledge that we love and care for the friend—regardless of the things that irk , confuse , or disappoint us about him or her . The negative thoughts we express about this friend are outweighed by the many positive thoughts we have .
An unhealthy way to talk about a friend behind his or her back is rooted in cruelty , ill will and oftentimes jealousy . There is a lack of generosity and a cutting glee ; one takes pleasure in ripping the so-called friend to shreds . Though we may pretend otherwise , we do n't truly want good things for him or her . We like to take him or her down a peg . We are judgmental and petty . We will not protect that friend , but are instead willing to betray him or her if the situation serves us . On the other hand , we are happy to use this “ friendship ” to our advantage , should the opportunity arise . Our affection is one of convenience rather than heart .
So . There 's a good way and a bad way to gossip , but either way it pretty much sucks to overhear it if you happen to be the subject of the conversation . There is no question that given what happened , Odd Man Out , you and your friends are going to have to repair a bit of damage . I believe that with some time , you can do that .
It seems clear to me that your friends were discussing you from a place of love and concern—the healthy place . My hunch is that your friends were unconsciously attempting to strengthen their bond with you rather than rend it when they were discussing you that day at the cabin . After all , when this “ incident ” occurred , you 'd just informed them that you 'd reunited with a woman they all apparently believe—fairly or not—is a negative force in your life . If they did n't care about you , they would n't have bothered to discuss this turn of events . Because they do care about you , they began speaking about it the moment they believed you were out of earshot . Collectively , they hashed out their feelings—in preparation , perhaps , to share a watered down version of them with you .
This is this because they love you . Do n't lose sight of that just because you all got caught in an embarrassing situation that I 'll guess every last one of us can imagine being on both sides of .
I suggest that you talk to your friends again about what happened , only this time you do it more forthrightly . No doubt , your hurt feelings are lingering in part because you so quickly attempted to brush them aside . Let the dudes in the woods debacle bring you closer to your friends rather than force you apart . Use this awkward experience as an opportunity to clear the air on the subject of your girlfriend and whatever it is your dearest friends think you 're justifying about your relationship with her . Tell them how hurt you were to hear what they said . Tell them why you think they are wrong . Tell them why you love your girlfriend and why they should be open to loving her too . Then ask them why they said what they did about you and her and do your best to listen .
Your choice of romantic partners is none of their business , it 's true , but the reason they have an opinion about it is because they want you to have a good life . They know you . They have listened to what you 've told them about your relationship with this woman and they 've made their own observations . I 'm not suggesting that you dump your girlfriend because your friends do n't like her , but rather that you hear what they have to say . Perhaps they have a negative opinion of her because when you broke up with her and shared the story of that break up with your friends you cast her in an inaccurately unflattering light . Perhaps they simply do n't know what they 're talking about and you need to set them straight . Perhaps they see something you can not see right now , blinded as you may be by desire for this relationship to work .
We ca n't know . Time will tell . But I encourage you to swallow your pride and hear your friends out , to look at the image of yourself they 're reflecting back to you . It might be useful . It might piss you off . It might help you get over the tender feelings you have about what happened at the cabin . The complicated thing about friends is that sometimes they are totally wrong about us and sometimes they are totally right and it 's almost always only in retrospect we know which is which .
I have this dear friend I 'll call Beth . She fell in love fast and hard with a guy I 'll call Tom . Over the course of a year or two Toms took Beth on a ride of highs and lows . There was love , deception , abandonment , lies , passion , promises , and a whole bunch of absolute bullshit . She was up . She was down . She was standing on my front stoop shaking and crying or calling me to say how amazing Tom was . When I 'd been witness to this relationship long enough that I 'd formed my own opinion about it , I began sharing my concerns with Beth . I was gentle at first , but before long I could not keep myself from telling her exactly what I thought in the most blunt terms : this man was a player and by not ridding herself of him , Beth was only bringing pain upon herself .
It took another several months and false starts and betrayals before she believed I was right . By then she 'd wished she 'd listened to what I said way back when , but the thing is , I would n't have listened either . Who does what a friend tells her to do ? I ca n't say I ever have , even when later I fully recognized that I should 've .
After a while Beth began dating another guy . I 'll call him Dave . About a month into their relationship she called me up and told me they were engaged .
“ To be married ? ” I stuttered , trying to conceal my disapproval and fear that this Dave person was going to be another disaster , another Tom .
“ Yes ! I know it 's fast , but we 're in love and we 're getting married , ” she said . She was sure . He was great . She was so happy . She knew this was right .
I spent a half hour asking her one question after another in tone of voice that I hoped sounded upbeat , but when I hung up I did n't feel upbeat . I felt worried . I immediately emailed another of Beth 's close friends—a woman with whom I 'm only acquainted . I asked her what she thought about this crazy business of Beth getting married to this guy she 'd only been dating for a month . We went back and forth , discussing Beth . We shared with each other her tendencies when it came to men , our observations of her strengths and her weaknesses , the things we hoped for her and also feared . We knew her . We loved her . We wanted her to be happy , but we were talking shamelessly about her behind her back .
Months later , after Beth married Dave , after I realized Dave really did make Beth happy and that he was good not just to her , but for her , I told her what I 'd done . I told her how I 'd emailed her friend because I 'd been distressed about how quickly she and Dave had committed to each other . I could see the tension cross her face as I informed her that two of her best friends had been discussing her . I could understand why it made her feel defensive and uncomfortable . Who were we to weigh in on the subject of who she married and how fast ? I understood that completely .
But I also understood who it was we were . We were two of her best friends . We were the people who listened to her tell all those awful and glorious stories about Tom and we would be the people who would be there for her regardless of how things turned out with Dave . We would be her friends no matter what . Because we loved her . If she needed us , we would go to her any time . We would stand by her . She knew this and I knew the same about her . I knew she 'd always tell me the truth , even if it hurt , and I also knew that she 'd take care not to hurt me . I knew over the course of our friendship she too might have opinions or concerns about me that she 'd opt to discuss with someone else in words that would be best for me not to hear . And I knew that was okay , that it was a perfectly natural part of sustaining a true friendship over many years , that it was n't a betrayal , but a blessing .
That 's what you have in these men , Odd Man Out . True friends . Real blessings . Forgive them . Feel lucky you have them . Move along .
Yours ,
Sugar
Features :
- Backup root before OTA & Restores it right after .
- Temporary un-root your device .
Requirements
- Device must be already rooted .
- Protection is effective only for devices with Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 /system partition
- Non ExtFS devices will still be able to use the temporary un-root feature
Android 4.3 Notes
Quote : Restrict Setuid from Android Apps
The /system partition is now mounted nosuid for zygote-spawned processes , preventing Android applications from executing setuid programs . This reduces root attack surface and likelihood of potential security vulnerabilities .
Hi EveryoneBecause I 'm lazy and was tired re-rooting manually my devices after installing manufacturers OTA updates , I wrote an app that protects root in one touch event.It is available for free on Android market and its source code is Open Source under WTFPL ( github ) Translations and code contributions are welcome.OTA RootKeeper will detect what 's possible or not and display available options accordingly.Typically works for : Nexus S , Every Honeycomb tablets.On ExtFS partition , root survives anything but true formating or partition wiping.It means some update tools like KIES/Odin for Samsung device will wipe the whole thing anyway because they write complete new partition.I needed this app so I wrote it , hopefully it will be useful to you too ! Based on Android 4.3 release notes , on Enterprise and Security , Restrict Setuid from Android Apps , su binaries and Superuser apps designed for previous Android generation will simply not work on 4.3 : It means preserving root with OTA Root Keeper wo n't be possible anymore as new rooting techniques rely on more than just a setuid su binary in /system.I 'll look into solution of course to preserve the functionality if possible , but until then please follow Chainfire 's job on SuperSU betas .

“ The same people who betrayed Mobutu are now with Kabila , telling him he 's God , telling him he 's whatever . It 's bullshit . ”
For a man many see as the natural heir to the presidency of the vast and populous Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , Moïse Katumbi cuts a fairly reserved figure . A gentle and sometimes bashful tycoon-turned-politician , one gets the sense that if he were his biblical namesake , his instinct would be to strike a behind-the-scenes deal with the Red Sea rather than command it to part with booming authority .
Whatever his approach , however , it has put him in good stead . The son of a Jewish father from Greece and a Congolese mother , Katumbi , now a youthful 52 , first made his mark in business . He inherited a role in the already-successful family company in Katanga province , but expanded its activities in mining and logistics . All of which helped make him one of the Congo 's richest people .
From 2007 to 2015 , he was governor of Katanga , which saw impressive economic growth and development . Under his presidency of the Lubumbashi football team TP Mazembe , the club has won the African Champions League three times .
Now Katumbi wants to be president of the country . If free and fair elections were held , he probably would be . He has significant popularity and the support of much of the opposition . But when he 'll get a chance to test this hypothesis is anyone 's guess .
President Joseph Kabila , who has led the DRC since 2001 , was meant to step down when his second mandated term expired on 19 December 2016 . But he simply failed to organise elections . Protests escalated until an agreement was made on 31 December that a transitional government would be established − with Kabila still as president − and that elections would be held in 2017 . Yet more than halfway through the year , the polls are no closer and the electoral commission recently announced that they have been delayed indefinitely .
Moreover , in 2016 , Katumbi was sentenced to 36 months in absentia for selling a property illegally . The charges are widely considered to be politically-motivated , but they mean he is stuck in exile in Brussels .
African Arguments caught up with the wannabe Congolese president :
You 've said repeatedly now that you 'll be returning to the DRC shortly . Do you know when yet ?
I 'm going as quick as possible . I went with my lawyer to the High Commission for Human Rights in Geneva and got a good answer , so I 'm definitely going back . I miss my country and my people .
Do you have a date ?
The date is soon . I 'm like a general . I need to plan everything properly .
You have much support in the DRC , but many also distrust you , including various grassroots movements that are doing much of the mobilising on the ground today . They see you as someone who 's always lived in luxury , eating at expensive restaurants and flying in private jets , while two-thirds of Congolese live in poverty . Why should they believe in you ?
In a democracy , not everyone will love you . The majority would like me to run as president . I was first a businessman . 95-97 % know the true story about Moïse Katumbi . I was a hardworking person , 30 years in business , a successful businessman . I did n't go bankrupt .
When I started as governor of Katanga , the province was sending $ 150 million to the national level per annum . After one year , it went to $ 3 billion because I fought corruption . When I am president , all the people will see the change . They can look on my website , they can talk to Katangese people to see my contribution .
How will you convince the doubters ?
Kabila is attacking me – only me – because he knows in the first round I will win the elections . When I arrived as governor of Katanga , Congo was producing just 8,000 tonnes of copper per annum . I stopped exports of unprocessed material and told people to build new factories . We went from 8,000 tonnes to 1.3 million tonnes . My province was the size of France , with 4.5 million people . Within one year , the population doubled as people came from their provinces to look for good governance and jobs .
You criticise Kabila now , but you were very close to him for many years . How is substantively different from him ? What specific policy changes would you make if you were president tomorrow ?
I ca n't deny I worked with Kabila . The constitution allowed me two terms , which I did . President Kabila today is illegal . He finished his mandate in 2016 . The difference between us first is that I respected the constitution . I did n't kill anyone . I did n't jail anyone .
What is important is the future . I would first establish the authority of government and law . I 'd fight corruption . Create jobs . We need to have a strong economy . How ? First , you need energy . Congo has a lot of water and no energy . I would call the private sector and all partners to help us and use money you have locally to improve energy .
You need to create the middle-class . Also transparency , which is very important in the mining sector and all sectors . You 've got the best place for tourism . You have to develop this . And develop education . The future of Congo is not mining but the brains of our young people . And develop agriculture . At the moment , our money is going to other countries for imports . We need to create jobs in agriculture . And the money must go to the central government and be published . You must not violate the budget . The president is going over the budget sometimes by 700 % .
Surely everyone , including Kabila , would largely agree that all these things are important . What specifically would you do ?
What I say is that I 've done it when I was the governor . It 's not just theory . Take education . When I started , we had 300,000 students at school and less than 10 % were girls . I built good infrastructure and paid teachers well . We went to over 3 million children after 9 years , 50 % of whom were girls . When I began , we were importing 98 % of our agriculture . When I left office , we were importing 25 % , because I put everyone to work on agriculture .
The main difference you emphasise between you and Kabila seems to be that he violated the constitution . If he 'd stepped down last year , would he have been a good president ?
Kabila missed the train . He was supposed to leave on time , not kill the people . If he left , the international community and Congolese would be happy . No matter what he did wrong , people would respect him as the first president to bring democracy .
He did good things , he did bad things . Now everything has become very bad because of the killing .
From Kabila 's perspective , his strategies have worked . The elections are no closer , while the opposition 's divided . Veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi has passed away . You 're in exile . And the wealthy businessman and recent critic of Kabila , Sindika Dokolo , has just been sentenced to a year in prison . What 's your plan to change things ?
These are short manoeuvres . You think Sindika Dokolo can steal $ 1 million ? His father was the first black banker in the country . Because Dokolo is telling Kabila to step down , the president 's only strategy is to take him down with fake charges , like he did with me . He thinks this is successful , but this is a short road .
And how will you bring that road to an end ?
We are bringing it to an end because our constitution gives us the right to remove him . At the moment , he does n't have any legal frame . The people are going to chase Kabila because Article 64 of our constitution allows us . We 're going to say “ Mr President , the game is over ” . In life , you have to always be true . You ca n't be clever to more than 80 million people . The end is sure to come this year . Kabila will no longer be president .
Yes , but how will you bring this about ? At the moment , he seems to hold all the cards .
Killings are not a card , killing is evil .
But it helps keep him in power .
It works for some time . You have read widely . All the people who killed , what is their end ? Their end is very bad .
Perhaps , but sometimes only after decades of rule .
For us , it is not going to take decades . Congo is not other countries . 80 million people need change . Kabila should wake up .
Ok , so would you encourage people to go onto the streets to force this change ?
Yes . I 'm also going on the streets and will encourage the people , because today people are dying and no serious investors have come to the country since 2016 .
Going back to Dokolo , there are rumours the two of you are forming a political alliance . Is this true ?
Sindika is a Congolese brother first . He 's a businessman and just inaugurated a cement factory in Angola . He works hard . He wants to contribute to change in Congo . You see how they are killing pregnant women and children in the Kasai . Sindika wants change in the country like any Congolese person .
Given you share that goal , does it make sense to join forces ?
Not just the two of us . I was with Sidika Dokolo and Félix Tshisekedi . It 's all the Congolese people , civil society , everyone . We need real change . Congolese people today are determined . I have met a lot of Congolese children born in Europe who want to go back and contribute .
Before you resigned from the ruling coalition , you talked to President Kabila . He offered you something , but you declined . What happened in that meeting ?
I went to see the president to tell him “ Mr President , in life there is a time to come to office and a time to go ” . I said Congo is not about you , it 's about 80 million people . It 's not about Moïse Katumbi , it 's about the people .
I advised him not to continue , but to have the first peaceful democratic transition . The same people who betrayed Mobutu are now with Kabila , telling him he 's God , telling him he 's whatever . It 's bullshit . He should look at how Mobutu was finished because the people of Congo at that time needed change .

Monkey Island is full of examples where the inventory puzzles are just a basis , not what passes for the meat of the sandwich . Often , dialogue would provide that . There 's another puzzle where you buy a ship with a stolen note of credit , but doing so also requires lengthily haggling the salesman down with colourful discussions of the ship 's features interspersed with lowball offers . You do n't just Use Credit On Man and be on your merry way .
I look at people chucking out adventure games these days that do little more than string a few inventory puzzles together , call it a day , and then announce that they have done their bit for the preservation of a classic genre , and I despair . It 's like watching someone chuck a brick out of the window of a moving car and announce they 've done their bit for the construction industry .
Another interesting example is Loom , one of LucasArts ' earliest adventure games . The thing most worth noting about it was that it had no inventory at all . You solved the puzzles by playing specific songs from your distaff to alter the fabric of reality , or - and this was the clever part - you could also play songs backwards to reverse their usual effect . Admittedly , though , Loom was less about the puzzles and more about creating a strange , mystical world through which the main character journeys , learning the significance of his power and his origins .
Come to think of it , of all the classic adventure games , Loom was probably the one that played the most like the modern adventure game , in that progression was fairly linear and you only had one button to generically 'interact ' with objects in the world . And that 's another problem , I think - adventure games that had big verb lists , allowing such diverse activities as both Pushing and Pulling , allowed the player to explore myriads of possibilities for every object they found , providing opportunities for more complex puzzling . Think of , say , the puzzle in Day of the Tentacle where you have to push an old lady down a flight of stairs . It was also possible to talk to the old lady first to understand why this measure was necessary .
Could n't do that in your modern adventure game , could you , where you 're lucky to have one click for 'interact ' and another for 'examine ' . There is only one thing you can do to every object in the world . They represent an eggshell-thin layer of complexity over a vast emptiness . How would you have done such a puzzle in a modern adventure game ? The first click has you converse with the old lady , and the second pushes her down the stairs ? But this removes all conscious agency on my part from the decision to push the old lady down the stairs . At no point did I specify such a thing . That old lady 's broken hip is on your hands alone , game . How am I supposed to get hard ?

While there are more than three months left in 2013 , we can look at the year 's top 50 highest grossing films so far and get a pretty accurate picture of what audiences most wanted , which studio investments paid off best , and which genres were most or least consistent in their performance throughout the year . The numbers might surprise you , even if they arguably should n't . It paints a pretty clear picture of the smartest bets for Hollywood , and the numbers cut sharply against some of the narratives dominating a lot of entertainment writing these days -- especially popular notions regarding troubles in the industry and big-budget tentpoles .
First , let 's start off reminding ourselves that 2013 has been another record year . The summer was the biggest of all time , increasing by about 11 % . The year to date is also up over last year , and several different months and weeks have seen box office records being broken . This past weekend , for example , saw an increase of 31 % over the same period last year . 2013 will probably hit around $ 11 billion or more in total box office , after 2012 's 6.5 % increase over 2011 . Ticket sales are also up year-to-date , for those of you who would try to argue the increase in box office is just inflationary in nature .
Now , let 's take a look at the top 50 highest grossing films worldwide as of today ( note : these rankings are different from the domestic box office rankings , as foreign receipts create a lot of differences in this list compared to purely North American receipts ) ...
The top 10 highest grossing movies on this list combined for more than $ 6.7 billion in box office , off of budgets that combined for a total of $ 1.7 billion ( at least four of those films are still in theaters doing decent business overseas , so this total will continue to rise a bit ) . If we factor in marketing , as some folks like to do , that pushes the expenditures up to a combined total of about $ 2.5 billion for the top 10 films on the list . That leaves around $ 4.2 billion after we subtract budgets and marketing . That figure will be split with theaters , obviously , and the overseas box office returns a smaller percentage to the studios , so that all has an impact on the bottom line .
But the thing is , most of the rest of the top 50 had films with much more modest or low budgets , aside from a few exceptions , so the bulk of the really large budget filmmaking is contained in the top 10 , the point being look again at the box office compared to budgets , and that 's the general outcome of most of the biggest expenditures on budgets that you 've likely heard about all year in stories insisting Hollywood is spending too much and making too little in return for the risks .
Now that you have that in mind , let 's move on to assessing what worked and what did n't this year , and what it tells us about the smartest investments for Hollywood to make .
In the top five grossing films worldwide , three were animated features , one was a superhero movie , and one was a traditional action film . The top 10 changes the dynamics a bit , with another superhero film entering the mix along with the first horror movie to break the list , and then three sci-fi/fantasy films leap into consideration . So while the top five list is dominated by a strong showing in the animated category , the top ten ends up with 20 % superheroes , almost 33 % animation , and another nearly 33 % sci-f/fantasy , while action and horror genres take 10 % each .
But when we expand out to the top 15 films of the year , superheroes gain ground by adding two more movies while the other primary categories fail to see an increase in their representation , moving the list to almost 25 % superhero films , 20 % animated movies , 20 % were sci-fi/fantasy pictures . Action , horror , comedy , thrillers , and dramas now all have just under 7 % each at this point .
In the top 20 , we see animation get a boost with two more films , while action , sci-fi/fantasy , and horror likewise add one each to their rosters . So the standings change to 25 % animation , 20 % sci-fi/fantasy , 20 % superheroes , 10 % action , 10 % horror , while comedies , thrillers , and dramas decline to 5 % each .
Moving into the top 25 , sci-fi/fantasy add to its strength with two more movies , and superheroes up their numbers with another entry , as do horror and comedy genres . The superhero genre therefore holds at 20 % , but sci-fi/fantasy rises again to 24 % , animation dips to 20 % , horror bumps up to 12 % , comedy and action are both at 8 % , and the thriller and drama genres each see a drop to 4 % .
With the top 30 , the numbers continue to shift . Sci-fi/fantasy adds yet another two entries for a boost up to more than 26 % , while comedy adds three new entries and sees its fortunes rise to nearly 17 % . Everybody else takes a tumble , so animation and superhero flicks are down to the same level as comedy , with just under 17 % each , horror declines to 10 % , action is just over 6 % , while thrillers and dramas continue their steady drop down to just above 3 % each .
Turn the page to keep reading which genres dominated the box office in 2013 , and what it all means !
The next set of numbers are less about the strength of certain genres over the long haul , and more about demonstrating the lower performance of some genres that had their main displays show up farther down the lists . From this point down to the last films rounding out the top 50 , animation will add three more movies to its count , superheroes will add no more titles , sci-fi/fantasy will add two more films , action will add five to its numbers , horror adds five additional movies , comedies and dramas each increase by two , and thrillers get only a single new addition .
What this tells me is : Action films and comedies are more likely to end up in the bottom half of the top 50 listings ; dramas and thrillers are generally no-shows in the top-50 ; horror makes a stronger appearance the farther down the list we go , and is weighted mostly toward the bottom half of the top 50 ; superheroes make most of their showing in the top half of the list , but mostly toward the end of that top 25 ; animation dominates the very top of the list and shows up most often in the top 25 , but quickly tapers off to just occasional but consistent entries the rest of the way through the top 50 ; and the strongest and overall most consistent showing is from sci-fi/fantasy movies , which are absent from the top 5 but make up for that with the most entries in the top 50 , spread almost evenly between the top and bottom halves of the list .
So animation won in a big way at the very top of the list , and remained a powerful contender , but the cartoon genre was edged out by sci-fi/fantasy as the surest bet in the top 50 films of the year . If we just kept moving down the list of worldwide gross , sci-fi/fantasy in fact continues to turn up more entries and remain in the 20-25 % range for a long way further down the list , too . At that point lower on the box office gross listings , horror starts to come back stronger again , but this just demonstrates the point that the horror genre was n't a top performer in pure box office dollars , even though the genre consistently demonstrated some of the most impressive profit margins due to the focus on low-budget productions that managed relatively impressive receipts against that smaller investments .
Also important to note , of course , is that five of the top six films of the year were new entries in an existing franchise ( four sequels and one reboot ) . And eight of the top 10 films are based on existing brands of some sort -- sequels ( five ) , reboots ( one ) , or adaptations ( two ) . Of the top 15 movies , nine were sequels or reboots , three were adaptations , one was a reboot , and three were original concepts . At the end of this piece , you 'll find a more detailed breakdown of which genres had how many entries per section of the top 50 list , to better demonstrate at a glance how each genre performed from start to finish on the list .
Animation , sci-fi/fantasy , and superheroes ruled the year , especially sequels in those genres , which clearly dominated the top 10 and top 15 for the year . With a few expected blockbusters left to come later this year from some of those main genres , these trends does n't look like they 'll really change between now and the start of 2014 , either . And paying attention to how many of these films were tentpoles and big-budget investments that turned out successful , it 's safe to say that the big-budget tentpole animation , superheroes , or sci-fi sequels/reboots/adaptations are exactly what audiences consume the most , and so that 's the smartest bet when studios are choosing which productions to invest in , regardless of what the public or press claims about being tired of those genres and of remakes , sequels , and whatnot .
We should note , however , that profit margins are important , and the investment in multiple successful lower-budgeted higher profit margin horror movies is one way for studios to give themselves some backup to make it easier to risk larger budgets on those big tentpoles mentioned above . Likewise , in recent years , while a lot of micro-budgeted indie fare has failed to really light up the box office , modestly budgeted award-season films have for several years now done at least moderately well and even very well in the Fall and Winter , which probably reflects audiences starting to find a balance for their consumption -- gobble up the big-budget summer blockbusters , then settle down for the more serious content later .
Here is the breakdown of each genre and their film entries as the top 50 list progressed ...
Animation had 3 top 5 entries , 5 top-20 entries , 6 top 35 entries , 7 top 40 entries , and 8 top 50 entries .
Superheroes had 1 top 5 entry , 2 top 10 entries , 4 top 15 entries , and 5 top 25 entries .
Horror had zero top 5 entries , 1 top 10 entry , 2 top 20 entries , 3 top 25 entries , 4 top 35 entries , 5 top 40 entries , 7 top 45 entries , and 8 top 50 entries .
Sci-fi/fantasy had zero top 5 entries , 3 top 10 entries , 4 top 20 entries , 6 top 25 entries , 8 top 30 entries , 9 top 35 entries , and 10 top 50 entries .
Action had 1 top 5 entry , 2 top 20 entries , 4 top 35 entries , 6 top 40 entries , and 7 top 45 entries .
Comedy had zero top 5 entries , zero top 10 entries , 1 top 15 entry , 2 top 25 entries , 5 top 30 entries , 6 top 40 entries , and 7 top 50 entries .
Dramas had zero top 5 entries , zero top 10 entries , 1 top 15 entry , and 3 top 45 entries .
Thrillers had zero top 5 entries , zero top 10 entries , 1 top 15 entries , and 2 top 50 entries .
Like it or not , Hollywood 's investments in big-budget tentpoles mostly paid off , as it usually does , and that 's because those are the films most audiences consistently wanted to see . By investing heavily in the key genres audiences frequent , using branded properties via sequels and adaptations , focusing on releasing those movies during the right time of the year to reach the largest portion of the target audiences for those particular genres and brands , Hollywood set a summer box office record and will have the biggest total year in history . They balanced risks by relying on multiple tentpoles and also investing in lower-budget fare in certain consistently popular genres with higher profit margins ( notably , horror and adult comedies ) , so while not everybody fared as well as others did this year , for the most part the industry should be very happy and most studios saw successful results from this straightforward strategy .

A decade ago , the Raiders ' fate in Super Bowl XXXVII presumably was sealed by the weekend disappearance of center Barret Robbins . Hall of Fame finalist Tim Brown believes that the blame for the 48-21 loss to the Buccaneers should go to Oakland 's head coach .
“ We get our game plan for victory on Monday , and the game plan says we 're gon na run the ball , ” Brown said Saturday on SiriusXM NFL Radio , which provided us with the audio . “ We averaged 340 [ pounds ] on the offensive line , they averaged 280 [ on the defensive line ] . We 're all happy with that , everybody is excited . [ We ] tell Charlie Garner , ‘ Look , you 're not gon na get too many carries , but at the end of the day we 're gon na get a victory . Tyrone Wheatley , Zack Crockett , let 's get ready to blow this thing up . ' ”
According to Brown , coach Bill Callahan then “ blew this thing up ” on the Friday before the Super Bowl , changing the game plan from a run-heavy attack to an intent to “ throw the ball 60 times . ”
“ We all called it sabotage . . . because Callahan and [ Tampa Bay coach Jon ] Gruden were good friends , ” Brown said . “ And Callahan had a big problem with the Raiders , you know , hated the Raiders . You know , only came because Gruden made him come . Literally walked off the field on us a couple of times during the season when he first got there , the first couple years . So really he had become someone who was part of the staff but we just did n't pay him any attention . Gruden leaves , he becomes the head coach . . . . It 's hard to say that the guy sabotaged the Super Bowl . You know , can you really say that ? That can be my opinion , but I ca n't say for a fact that that 's what his plan was , to sabotage the Super Bowl . He hated the Raiders so much that he would sabotage the Super Bowl so his friend can win the Super Bowl . That 's hard to say , because you ca n't prove it .
“ But the facts are what they are , that less than 36 hours before the game we changed our game plan . And we go into that game absolutely knowing that we have no shot . That the only shot we had if Tampa Bay did n't show up . ”
Brown explained that the change had a specific impact on Robbins . “ Barret Robbins begged Coach Callahan , ‘ Do not do this to me . I do n't have time to make my calls , to get my calls ready . You ca n't do this to me on Friday . We have n't practiced full speed , we ca n't get this done . ' ”
Brown tiptoed around the question of whether the change caused Robbins to go off the deep end , suggesting that it had an impact and then explaining that there 's no way to know if it did . “ I 'm not saying one had anything to do with the other , ” Brown said . “ All I 'm saying is those are the facts of what happened Super Bowl week . So our ire was n't towards Barret Robbins , it was towards Bill Callahan . Because we feel as if he would n't have done what he did , then Barret would n't have done what he did .
“ Now , should Barret have manned up and tried to do it ? Absolutely . But everybody knew Barret was unstable anyway . So to put him in that situation — not that he was putting him in that situation — but for that decision to be made without consulting the players the Friday before the Super Bowl ? I played 27 years of football . The coaches never changed the game plan the Friday before the game . I 'm not trying to point fingers at anybody here , all I 'm saying is those are the facts of what happened . So people look at Barret and they say all these things , but every player in that locker room will tell you , ‘ You 'd better talk to Bill Callahan . ' Because if not for Coach Callahan , I do n't think we 're in that situation . ”
Well , we now know what Tim Brown will be asked about next week in New Orleans . Continuously .
There 's only one potential flaw in Brown 's logic . He assumes that the new game plan came from Callahan . Who 's to say that the order to throw the ball 60 times did n't come from the late Al Davis , who had a special affinity for throwing the football , and also for meddling directly in the coaching of the team ?
Thus , while it 's easy to blame Callahan , Callahan may have simply been the messenger .
Regardless , Brown and Callahan and Gruden and quarterback Rich Gannon and anyone/everyone who was part of that team will soon be hearing from reporters and radio/TV producers , just in time for the 10th anniversary of the game .
Exclusive : The CIA 's covert war in Laos – in the 1950-60 's – has remained a model for U.S. proxy wars through today 's “ war on terror , ” but the forgotten lesson was the conflict 's destructive failure , recalls war correspondent Don North .
By Don North
In the first of many mistakes of the Vietnam War , President Dwight Eisenhower said in 1954 , “ You have a row of dominoes set up , you knock over the first one , and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over quickly . ”
By January 1961 , Eisenhower had warned his successor John F. Kennedy that Laos was the most pressing foreign policy issue in the world and he had initiated Operation Momentum in Laos , for the CIA to train and arm a small force of Hmong tribesmen to fight the communist Pathet Lao and their North Vietnamese supporters .
But history would prove the “ domino theory ” in Southeast Asia was a misconception of tragic proportions . Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines would all confidently resist communist influence and would surely have done so without the bloodbath of millions of deaths across Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos .
As a young freelance journalist in 1965 , I tried to cover the secret war in Laos . In the capital Vientiane , I encountered CIA pilots running supplies to the Hmong army in Long Chen and urged them , over many beers at the bar of the Continental Hotel , to take me along but without success .
Now , more than a half century later , author Joshua Kurlantzick , a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations , has published a book , A Great Place to Have a War , based on recently declassified documents and interviews with major players behind the secret war in Laos .
He also analyzes how the conflict in Laos was the genesis of the CIA 's support for clandestine paramilitary operations around the world , a pattern that continues through today . He concludes that the strategy in Laos set a sinister precedent for American presidents to conduct war without congressional or media oversight .
Kurlantzick writes , “ The Laos program would balloon in men and budget . It would grow into a massive undertaking run by CIA operatives . CIA leadership saw that an inexpensive proxy war could be a template for wars when U.S. presidents were looking for ways to continue the Cold War without going through Congress or committing ground troops . The CIA leadership thought that Laos was a great place to have a war . ”
An army of hill tribes , mostly Hmong under the command of General Vang Pao , who initially led a ragged band of 5,000 guerrillas recruited and equipped by CIA officers . For 14 years , this irregular army fought the communists with Vang Pao 's guerrilla forces finally numbering 100,000 irregular troops .
Over those years , more bombs were dropped on Laos than were dropped on Japan and Germany during World War II . By the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 , some 200,000 Laotians , both civilian and military had been killed , including at least 30,000 Hmong , with another 750,000 Laotians made homeless by the bombing . Some 700 Americans , mostly CIA officers , contractors and U.S. military also died in the Laos conflict , although those American deaths would not be revealed for decades .
Today , Laos is a failed country still strewn with landmines and other ordnance that take the limbs and lives of Laotians every day . Only 1 percent of the unexploded ordnance is believed to have been cleared and an estimated 20,000 Laotians have been killed or injured since the bombing ceased .
A Destructive Debacle
By most measures , the CIA 's war in Laos was a debacle that virtually destroyed a civilization . Plus , the war was “ lost ” from the U.S. government 's perspective when the country disappeared into the communist Vietnamese orbit . But by the CIA 's yardstick , it was a great success .
“ In the opinion of many officers in the CIA Clandestine services , the paramilitary programs that the agency operated in Laos between 1963-71 were the most successful ever mounted , ” according to a quote from newly declassified CIA records cited by author Kurlantzick . “ Small in numbers of personnel and even smaller in relative dollar costs , the CIA Laos operations shone in contrast to the ponderous operations of the US military forces in Vietnam . ”
CIA Director Richard Helms declared that the agency had proven itself in Laos and had tied down 70,000 North Vietnamese troops who might otherwise have fought Americans in Vietnam . Laos would become the template for a new type of large , secret war for decades to come .
In his book , Kurlantzick concentrates on four remarkable individuals who in partnership with the CIA would control the agency 's war in Laos . All four have died recently , but Kurlantzick interviewed three of them .
There was Bill Lair , an American veteran of the U.S. Army 's 3rd Division in World War II who joined the CIA in Bangkok to train Thai troops for a possible invasion by China . Lair , adept at the Thai and Lao languages , was later sent to Laos where he would become the first chief agent to deal with the Hmong warlord Vang Pao .
There was Vang Pao , who met Lair in January 1961 and promised that if Lair would provide weapons he would gather 10,000 men to be trained by the CIA . Vang Pao had a reputation of having a sharp mind but his rage , sadness and energy sometimes overtook his abilities and knowledge .
There was Ambassador William Sullivan , who took his post in Vientiane in 1964 and soon became the most powerful U.S. ambassador in the world , in charge of the secret war in Laos . Sullivan 's power encompassed far more than the usual duties of filing reports on the political situation and attending diplomatic receptions . He had a strong respect for the CIA , unlike many U.S. ambassadors .
Sullivan also had a close relationship with President Lyndon Johnson , which Sullivan felt gave him a free hand to run the war in Laos . Called to testify before Congress , Sullivan drew the ire of Sen. William Fulbright , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , who complained : “ We pretend Laos is a sovereign country . We are pretending we are not there ? You are deceiving the American people and Congress . ”
Sullivan , who did n't mention that he had commanded nearly every aspect of the operation in Laos , later became National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger 's right-hand man at the Paris peace talks . ( Sullivan was the only one of the four principals whom Kurlantzick did not interview . )
The fourth principal in the Laotian war was Tony Poe , who had experienced heavy combat with the U.S. Marines island-hopping across the Pacific during World War II . When the Korean War broke out in 1950 , Poe signed up to train Korean saboteurs . In 1961 , Poe arrived in Laos to help train the Hmong who had become the center of Operation Momentum .
Poe was a hard-drinking combat trainer who sought opportunities to fight with the troops he had trained . He had a reputation of ruthlessness that included tales of cutting heads off North Vietnamese troops and dropping them from a helicopter . He is said to have shipped bags of ears cut from enemy soldiers to the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane .
In the mountains with his private army and drinking heavily , many of Poe 's colleagues believed he had gone mad . However , in 1975 , Poe was awarded a second CIA intelligence medal for “ extraordinary heroism. ” It is believed Poe was the model for Marlon Brando 's portrayal of Col. Kurtz in the film “ Apocalypse Now . ”
Enduring Lessons
The lessons from Laos had long-term effects on how the CIA would operate for years . After 1975 , agents with Laos experience took over CIA stations all over the world and held senior jobs in agency headquarters . They brought with them a conviction the CIA could handle large-scale war fighting skills , reported Kurlantzick .
The secret war also had echoes up to the present . “ The post-9/11 war on terror replicates the Laos war in other critical ways : CIA activities are totally unwatched by the public and the media . The strategies used to keep most of the war on terror secret … would have been completely familiar to the CIA operatives running the Laos war . ”
In his last foreign trip , President Obama went to Laos , the first sitting U.S. president to ever do so . In a speech in Vientiane in September that got little notice back home , he offered no apologies , but pledged to increase funding for clearing unexploded bombs by $ 90 million over the next three years .
“ Given our history here , the United States has a moral obligation to help Laos heal , ” Obama said . “ At the time the U.S. did not acknowledge America 's role . Even now , many Americans are not fully aware of this chapter in our history , and it 's important that we remember today . ”
Kurlantzick did n't complete the research and transcript for his book until October , before the election of Donald Trump as president , but in an article for the Washington Post 's Outlook section Jan. 22 , he analyzed the new administration 's likely policy toward the CIA :
“ The incoming President seems eager to cut some of the agency 's spies and analysts . Instead , power would flow to operatives in the field – those who help arm allied foreign military forces and manage drone strikes … the Trump administration is poised to accelerate a transformation that has been happening since the 1960 's , with the CIA becoming less focused on spying and more on paramilitary organizations with a central role in violent conflicts . ”
The first secret counter-terrorism operation under Trump 's orders took place on Jan. 29 in Yemen against an “ Al Qaeda affiliate ” and appeared to have been a botched mission though the Trump administration hailed it as a success . It was reported to have been carried out by U.S. Special Operation Forces , with no mention of CIA participation .
A senior Navy Seal was killed during the raid and Yemeni officials reported 30 civilians also killed , mostly women and children . The New York Times said the civilian casualties triggered widespread anger across Yemen toward the U.S. , adding to the tensions over President Trump 's entry ban on Yemeni citizens .
Kurlantzick 's A Great Place to Have a War could help Americans remember the chaos and destruction visited upon one of the world 's most primitive societies . Whether the book will influence the future history of America 's way of war remains to be seen .

The world is ready for takeoff now that Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 , the world 's first private orbital launch site , has completed construction in New Zealand .
According to a report from Space , the Los Angeles-based commercial spaceflight company Rocket Lab is planning to use the complex for the launch of the Electron rocket , which will carry small satellites and payloads . The site 's main objective is to provide and enable more affordable and more frequent access to space .
Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck revealed that the complex is authorized to conduct a launch every 72 hours , although they are expecting to only launch around four or five times a month . This impressively high frequency is due to the sparsity of air activity near the site .
The complex marks a historic milestone as the first private orbital launch complex in the world . Competitors include Blue Origin , which has a private launch facility but only operates suborbital flights , and SpaceX , whose own private orbital launch facility has n't opened yet .
`` Completing Launch Complex 1 is a significant milestone in the buildup to our first Electron test flight , '' Beck said in the statement . `` It 's wonderful to celebrate the completion of the site with those who have helped us get this far and welcomed us into their community . Launch Complex 1 presents a considerable opportunity to change how we access space . ''
Rocket Lab is already planning to begin test launches of the Electron before the year ends .
Economic Development Minster Steven Joyce , who opened the site , hinted at the country 's interest in space-related activity , according to a report from Scoop .
He explained , `` Rocket Lab will be a catalyst for other space-related activity in New Zealand . Space activity is pervasive in our lives , to such an extent we are no longer aware that our internet , our decision-making around energy and resource management , our marine surveillance to name only a tiny fraction , all rely on what we are doing in space . ''
The idea behind Operation American Spring is simple : the restoration of constitutional government , the rule of law , freedom , and liberty . The plan calls for the removal from office of President Barack Obama , Vice President Joe Biden , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-NV ) , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-KY ) , House Speaker John Boehner ( R-OH ) , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) , and Attorney General Eric Holder . And that 's just to start .
The organizers of the operation have picked Friday to kick things off . Phase one of “ Operation American Spring – Beginning Of Tyranny Housecleaning ” calls for as many as 10 million “ patriots ” to assemble in a “ peaceful , non-violent , physically unarmed ( Spiritually/Constitutionally armed ) , display of unswerving loyalty to the US Constitution and against the incumbent government leadership , in Washington , D.C. , with the mission to replace with law abiding leadership , ” according to the organizers ' website . Phase two calls for at least a million of the protestors to remain in Washington until the aforementioned officials are forced from office . Phase three hopes to see a governing tribunal made up of a who 's who of conservative icons .
“ Those with the principles of a West , Cruz , Dr. Ben Carson , Lee , DeMint , Paul , Gov Walker , Sessions , Gowdy , Jordan , should comprise a tribunal and assume positions of authority to convene investigations , recommend appropriate charges against politicians and government employees to the new U.S. Attorney General appointed by the new President , ” according to the website .
As Raw Story reported on Tuesday , the leader of Operation American Spring , retired Army Col. Harry Riley , gave in an interview in January explaining his group 's plans .
“ It is unclear how this will all unravel but we are calling for the removal of Barack Obama , Joe Biden , Harry Reid , Mitch McConnell , John Boehner , Nancy Pelosi , and Eric Holder as a start toward constitutional restoration , ” Riley told Beforeitsnews.com . “ They have all abandoned the US Constitution , are unworthy to be retained in a position that calls for servant status . ”
The interviewer brought up past protest actions , “ Ride For The Constitution ” plan last year , that fizzled out when it came time to realize their plans . Riley said he and his group had learned from the truckers ' example .
“ We learn from every event , ” he said . “ I do n't agree the the Truckers effort was a total failure . They have paved the way , we will expand on it…the difference is that Operation American Spring will not be just a ride through Washington , D.C. , we will be there in massive numbers and intend to remain there until acceptable solutions are gained . ”
In the birthplace of democracy , near the Acropolis in Athens , there are caves where people with no homes are living . Twenty-five centuries after the classical philosopher Socrates , the caves are occupied again . Tradition says one of these caves was his prison .
The jobless tenants forage for food in the city by day ; they 're back on Fillopapou hill at night , better in a cave than on the street , they say .
Georgia Maϊmanoglou has a shack . She 's 66 . She used to work as a cleaner . She told us she just wants a room for her and her companion , if she finds a job again .
“ I got food from the rubbish at the market today . I am not the first or last to live like this . Whole families do . ”
Mathaios Monselas was in a cave near the Prison of Socrates but left because of the rats . Now he 's got a tent . He 's well-known in Greece , for serving 12 years in prison for murder with the victim 's consent . He 's 58 .
Monselas said : “ In a cave you 're sheltered from the cold . It 's better than living on a bench or on the street . But it 's still a miserable side of life . ”
NGO Klimaka estimates there are about 20,000 homeless Greeks , mostly in Athens – far more than the official figure . Klimaka says nearly half the homeless have children and one in every five has a degree .
Michalis Arampatzoglou of the Athens euronews bureau said : “ The main target of the Greek government this year is a primary budget surplus – that is a surplus excluding interest payments on outstanding debt . Achieving that comes at a high cost for people 's lives . The homeless under the shadow of the Acropolis want a job . They had a right to dignity . They want it back . ”
Darksiders 2 got to remaster treatment last week in the form of the dubiously titled Deathinitive Edition . It was a welcome move for Darksiders fans as it demonstrated that Nordic Games – the publisher that acquired the IP from THQ when it shuttered in 2012 – has n't abandoned the series . Indeed , according to new comments made by Nordic Games executive producer Reinhard Pollice on Steam , the company has further plans for the Zelda-like adventure .
`` Darksiders 2 Deathinitive Edition was just the start , '' Pollice wrote on the Darksiders 2 community forum . `` Since we acquired the franchise we were looking for options for doing a DS3 . To remaster was just a way to get some spotlight on the franchise again , reactivate the community and have a better starting position for DS3 . ''
Despite technical issues at launch , Darksiders 2 reviewed reasonably well when it released in 2012 . `` Darksiders II offers a rewardingly deep system of combos that must be exploited with intelligence and precision , '' Marsh Davies wrote in his review . `` It 's this that makes the lack of challenge in platforming or puzzling an amiable respite rather than a bore . ''
The human brain is capable of 1016 processes per second , which makes it far more powerful than any computer currently in existence . But that does n't mean our brains do n't have major limitations . The lowly calculator can do math thousands of times better than we can , and our memories are often less than useless — plus , we 're subject to cognitive biases , those annoying glitches in our thinking that cause us to make questionable decisions and reach erroneous conclusions . Here are a dozen of the most common and pernicious cognitive biases that you need to know about .
Before we start , it 's important to distinguish between cognitive biases and logical fallacies . A logical fallacy is an error in logical argumentation ( e.g . ad hominem attacks , slippery slopes , circular arguments , appeal to force , etc. ) . A cognitive bias , on the other hand , is a genuine deficiency or limitation in our thinking — a flaw in judgment that arises from errors of memory , social attribution , and miscalculations ( such as statistical errors or a false sense of probability ) .
Some social psychologists believe our cognitive biases help us process information more efficiently , especially in dangerous situations . Still , they lead us to make grave mistakes . We may be prone to such errors in judgment , but at least we can be aware of them . Here are some important ones to keep in mind .
Confirmation Bias
Advertisement
We love to agree with people who agree with us . It 's why we only visit websites that express our political opinions , and why we mostly hang around people who hold similar views and tastes . We tend to be put off by individuals , groups , and news sources that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure about our views — what the behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner called cognitive dissonance . It 's this preferential mode of behavior that leads to the confirmation bias — the often unconscious act of referencing only those perspectives that fuel our pre-existing views , while at the same time ignoring or dismissing opinions — no matter how valid — that threaten our world view . And paradoxically , the internet has only made this tendency even worse .
Ingroup Bias
Advertisement
Somewhat similar to the confirmation bias is the ingroup bias , a manifestation of our innate tribalistic tendencies . And strangely , much of this effect may have to do with oxytocin — the so-called `` love molecule . '' This neurotransmitter , while helping us to forge tighter bonds with people in our ingroup , performs the exact opposite function for those on the outside — it makes us suspicious , fearful , and even disdainful of others . Ultimately , the ingroup bias causes us to overestimate the abilities and value of our immediate group at the expense of people we do n't really know .
Gambler 's Fallacy
Advertisement
It 's called a fallacy , but it 's more a glitch in our thinking . We tend to put a tremendous amount of weight on previous events , believing that they 'll somehow influence future outcomes . The classic example is coin-tossing . After flipping heads , say , five consecutive times , our inclination is to predict an increase in likelihood that the next coin toss will be tails — that the odds must certainly be in the favor of heads . But in reality , the odds are still 50/50 . As statisticians say , the outcomes in different tosses are statistically independent and the probability of any outcome is still 50 % .
Relatedly , there 's also the positive expectation bias — which often fuels gambling addictions . It 's the sense that our luck has to eventually change and that good fortune is on the way . It also contribues to the `` hot hand '' misconception . Similarly , it 's the same feeling we get when we start a new relationship that leads us to believe it will be better than the last one .
Post-Purchase Rationalization
Remember that time you bought something totally unnecessary , faulty , or overly expense , and then you rationalized the purchase to such an extent that you convinced yourself it was a great idea all along ? Yeah , that 's post-purchase rationalization in action — a kind of built-in mechanism that makes us feel better after we make crappy decisions , especially at the cash register . Also known as Buyer 's Stockholm Syndrome , it 's a way of subconsciously justifying our purchases — especially expensive ones . Social psychologists say it stems from the principle of commitment , our psychological desire to stay consistent and avoid a state of cognitive dissonance .

Neglecting Probability
Very few of us have a problem getting into a car and going for a drive , but many of us experience great trepidation about stepping inside an airplane and flying at 35,000 feet . Flying , quite obviously , is a wholly unnatural and seemingly hazardous activity . Yet virtually all of us know and acknowledge the fact that the probability of dying in an auto accident is significantly greater than getting killed in a plane crash — but our brains wo n't release us from this crystal clear logic ( statistically , we have a 1 in 84 chance of dying in a vehicular accident , as compared to a 1 in 5,000 chance of dying in an plane crash [ other sources indicate odds as high as 1 in 20,000 ] ) . It 's the same phenomenon that makes us worry about getting killed in an act of terrorism as opposed to something far more probable , like falling down the stairs or accidental poisoning .
Advertisement
This is what the social psychologist Cass Sunstein calls probability neglect — our inability to properly grasp a proper sense of peril and risk — which often leads us to overstate the risks of relatively harmless activities , while forcing us to overrate more dangerous ones .
Observational Selection Bias
Advertisement
This is that effect of suddenly noticing things we did n't notice that much before — but we wrongly assume that the frequency has increased . A perfect example is what happens after we buy a new car and we inexplicably start to see the same car virtually everywhere . A similar effect happens to pregnant women who suddenly notice a lot of other pregnant women around them . Or it could be a unique number or song . It 's not that these things are appearing more frequently , it 's that we 've ( for whatever reason ) selected the item in our mind , and in turn , are noticing it more often . Trouble is , most people do n't recognize this as a selectional bias , and actually believe these items or events are happening with increased frequency — which can be a very disconcerting feeling . It 's also a cognitive bias that contributes to the feeling that the appearance of certain things or events could n't possibly be a coincidence ( even though it is ) .
Status-Quo Bias
We humans tend to be apprehensive of change , which often leads us to make choices that guarantee that things remain the same , or change as little as possible . Needless to say , this has ramifications in everything from politics to economics . We like to stick to our routines , political parties , and our favorite meals at restaurants . Part of the perniciousness of this bias is the unwarranted assumption that another choice will be inferior or make things worse . The status-quo bias can be summed with the saying , `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it '' — an adage that fuels our conservative tendencies . And in fact , some commentators say this is why the U.S. has n't been able to enact universal health care , despite the fact that most individuals support the idea of reform .

Negativity Bias
People tend to pay more attention to bad news — and it 's not just because we 're morbid . Social scientists theorize that it 's on account of our selective attention and that , given the choice , we perceive negative news as being more important or profound . We also tend to give more credibility to bad news , perhaps because we 're suspicious ( or bored ) of proclamations to the contrary . More evolutionarily , heeding bad news may be more adaptive than ignoring good news ( e.g . `` saber tooth tigers suck '' vs. `` this berry tastes good '' ) . Today , we run the risk of dwelling on negativity at the expense of genuinely good news . Steven Pinker , in his book The Better Angels of Our Nature : Why Violence Has Declined , argues that crime , violence , war , and other injustices are steadily declining , yet most people would argue that things are getting worse — what is a perfect example of the negativity bias at work .

Bandwagon Effect
Though we 're often unconscious of it , we love to go with the flow of the crowd . When the masses start to pick a winner or a favorite , that 's when our individualized brains start to shut down and enter into a kind of `` groupthink '' or hivemind mentality . But it does n't have to be a large crowd or the whims of an entire nation ; it can include small groups , like a family or even a small group of office co-workers . The bandwagon effect is what often causes behaviors , social norms , and memes to propagate among groups of individuals — regardless of the evidence or motives in support . This is why opinion polls are often maligned , as they can steer the perspectives of individuals accordingly . Much of this bias has to do with our built-in desire to fit in and conform , as famously demonstrated by the Asch Conformity Experiments .
Advertisement
Projection Bias
As individuals trapped inside our own minds 24/7 , it 's often difficult for us to project outside the bounds of our own consciousness and preferences . We tend to assume that most people think just like us — though there may be no justification for it . This cognitive shortcoming often leads to a related effect known as the false consensus bias where we tend to believe that people not only think like us , but that they also agree with us . It 's a bias where we overestimate how typical and normal we are , and assume that a consensus exists on matters when there may be none . Moreover , it can also create the effect where the members of a radical or fringe group assume that more people on the outside agree with them than is the case . Or the exaggerated confidence one has when predicting the winner of an election or sports match .
The Current Moment Bias
Advertisement
We humans have a really hard time imagining ourselves in the future and altering our behaviors and expectations accordingly . Most of us would rather experience pleasure in the current moment , while leaving the pain for later . This is a bias that is of particular concern to economists ( i.e . our unwillingness to not overspend and save money ) and health practitioners . Indeed , a 1998 study showed that , when making food choices for the coming week , 74 % of participants chose fruit . But when the food choice was for the current day , 70 % chose chocolate .
Anchoring Effect
Also known as the relativity trap , this is the tendency we have to compare and contrast only a limited set of items . It 's called the anchoring effect because we tend to fixate on a value or number that in turn gets compared to everything else . The classic example is an item at the store that 's on sale ; we tend to see ( and value ) the difference in price , but not the overall price itself . This is why some restaurant menus feature very expensive entrees , while also including more ( apparently ) reasonably priced ones . It 's also why , when given a choice , we tend to pick the middle option — not too expensive , and not too cheap .

WAYNE Bennett has ordered Anthony Milford to find his attacking mojo as it emerged the pivot has not made a line-break or created a try in 320 minutes for the Broncos .
As Milford prepares for this Friday night 's derby against the Titans , Brisbane coach Bennett has issued the star recruit the first legitimate challenge of his Broncos career .
Bennett will not resile from deploying Milford at five-eighth , but the master coach says it 's time for the 20-year-old to step up and run the ball after a patchy opening month at his new club .

Official NRL statistics show Milford has no tries , line breaks or try assists from 144 possessions in his first 320 minutes in Broncos colours .
MGMT : Hunt teaches Johnson a lesson
FIVE THINGS : Parker , Glenn star as Milford struggles
They are the type of numbers that saw Brisbane 's previous big-name buy , Ben Barba , pilloried last season as he struggled to adjust to a new environment at Red Hill .
Milford showed more promise in Brisbane 's 24-16 defeat of the Warriors on Sunday , but Bennett urged the playmaker to back his instincts and impose himself on the Titans at Cbus Super Stadium .
“ There are a few little things for Anthony to tidy up , ” Bennett revealed .
“ He is getting there . He is a dynamic runner with the ball , so the next step is having that confidence to run with the ball .
“ I 'm pleased with him , but it 's a new club ... Anthony is still feeling his way . ”
At former club Canberra last season , Milford was easily the Raiders ' most potent attacking weapon . He led the club in three key attacking indicators , including most line breaks ( 17 in 24 games ) , try assists ( 14 ) and line-break assists ( 16 ) .
Milford looked sharp against the Cowboys a fortnight ago , making six tackle busts , but committed two errors against the Warriors , including a kick out on the full in the 51st minute .
Former premiership-winning coach Phil Gould believes the Broncos should shift Milford to fullback , but Bennett is determined to keep faith in the Milford-Hunt halves alliance .
“ Anthony got better as the ( Warriors ) game went on , ” he said .
“ He was good in the last 10 minutes , he made some better decisions .
“ Ben ( Hunt ) has been good . I 'm not unhappy with where they are going at the moment ... they have n't got backwards or lost confidence . ”

Hunt kicked with authority against the Warriors and vowed to help Milford recapture the spark to ignite Brisbane 's backline .
“ I reckon I can help Anthony to run the ball more , ” Hunt said .
“ That 's one of his best skills _ running the ball . He is lightning on his feet , he can make defenders miss so I 'd like to see him get the ball in his hands and have more of a crack . ”

Burak Yilmaz is attracting interest from a host of Premier League clubs ( Picture : Getty Images )
Tottenham Hotspur are looking into the possibility of hijacking West Ham 's move for Galatasaray striker Burak Yilmaz , according to reports .
Yilmaz , who is thought to be attracting a host of Premier League goals after establishing himself as a prolific goalscorer in the Turkish Super Lig , is high up the list of West Ham transfer targets .
Galatasaray want to sell the 30-year-old in a permanent deal this month worth £5million , but would sanction a loan deal with a view to a permanent solution in the summer , Sky Sports reported .
However , given his impressive record in front of goal , West Ham boss Slaven Bilic could face competition for Yilmaz 's signature as both Tottenham and Stoke City have declared an interest , according to the Mirror .
Burak Yilmaz has has scored 139 times in 233 games for since he joined Trabzonspor including 81 goals in 140 games for Galatasaray — Turkish-Football.com ( @ Turkish_Futbol ) January 25 , 2016
Dr. Ben Carson got it right when he said that taqiyya `` allows , and even encourages , you to lie to achieve your goals . '' The prophet makes that clear .
Muslims deceived non-Muslims not because they were being persecuted for being Muslim — according to the Washington Post 's definition of taqiyya — but in order to make Islam supreme .
Tell that to Ka ' b ibn Ashraf , whose head was cut off . for The prophet of Islam allowed his followers to lie to the Jew to slaughter him .
Dr. Ben Carson 's recent assertion that the Islamic doctrine of taqiyya encourages Muslims `` to lie to achieve your goals '' has prompted the Washington Post 's Glenn Kessler to quote a number of academics to show that the presidential candidate got it wrong :
The word `` taqiyya '' derives from the Arabic words for `` piety '' and `` fear of God '' and indicates when a person is in a state of caution , said Khaled Abou El Fadl , a professor of law at the University of California at Los Angeles and a leading authority on Islam . [ ... ] `` Yes , it is permissible to hide the fact you are Muslim '' if a person is under threat , `` as long as it does not involve hurting another person , '' Abou El Fadl said .
The other academics whom Kessler quotes — including Omid Safi , director of the Duke University Islamic Studies Center , and Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School — make the same argument : yes , taqiyya is in the Koran but it only permits deception in the case of self-preservation , nothing more .
Not exactly .
Although the word taqiyya is related to the Arabic word `` piety '' and its root meaning is `` protect '' or `` guard against '' — and the Koran verses that advocate it ( 3:28 and 16:106 ) do so in the context of self-preservation from persecution — that is not the whole story .
Dr. Ben Carson asserted that the Islamic doctrine of taqiyya encourages Muslims `` to lie to achieve your goals . '' ( Image source : Wikimedia Commons/Gage Skidmore )
Unfortunately , none of the academics quoted by Kessler acknowledges that the Koran is not the only textual source to inform Muslim action . They ignore the Hadith , the collected words and deeds of Muhammad . Koran 33:2 , for instance , commands Muslims to follow Muhammad 's example , and his example — also known as the prophet 's Sunna — is derived from the many volumes of Hadith .
The importance of Muhammad 's example is seen in that the Sunnis , approximately 90 % of the world 's Muslim population , are named after his Sunna . As one Muslim cleric puts it , `` Much of Islam will remain mere abstract concepts without Hadith [ whence the Sunna is derived ] . We would never know how to pray , fast , pay zakah , or make pilgrimage without the illustration found in Hadith ... ''
It is therefore either careless or disingenuous for Kessler and his `` experts '' to ignore Muhammad 's example as recorded in the Hadith in their discussion of taqiyya .
As usual , for the complete truth , one must turn to scholarly books written in Arabic . According to Dr. Sami Mukaram , an Islamic studies professor specializing in taqiyya , and author of the only academic book exclusively devoted to it , `` Taqiyya in order to deceive the enemy is permissible . `` [ 1 ]
This sounds quite close enough to Carson 's assertion that taqiyya allows Muslims `` to lie to achieve your goals . ''
As proof , Mukaram documents two anecdotes from Muhammad 's Sunna — his example to Muslims — that make clear that the prophet allowed his followers to lie and deceive non-Muslims above and beyond the issue of self-preservation :
The Assassination of Ka ' b ibn Ashraf
An elderly Jewish leader , Ka ' b ibn Ashraf , mocked Muhammad , prompting the prophet to exclaim , `` Who will kill this man who has hurt Allah and his messenger ? '' A young Muslim named Ibn Maslama volunteered on condition that to get close enough to Ka ' b to murder him , he needed to be allowed to lie to the Jew .
Allah 's messenger agreed . Ibn Maslama traveled to Ka ' b and began to complain about Muhammad until his disaffection from Islam became so convincing that Ka ' b eventually dropped his guard and befriended him .
After behaving as his friend for some time , Ibn Maslama eventually appeared with another Muslim pretending to have apostatized , slaughtered Ka ' b ' and brought his head to Muhammad to the usual triumphant cries of `` Allahu Akbar ! ''
The Disbanding of the Confederates
In another account , after Muhammad and his followers had attacked , plundered , and massacred a number of non-Muslim Arabs and Jews , the Jews and Arabs assembled , poised to annihilate the Muslims , to try to neutralize the Muslims once and for all ( at the Battle of the Trench , 627 ) . But then Naim bin Mas'ud , one of the leaders of these `` confederates , '' as they became known in history , secretly went to Muhammad and converted to Islam . The prophet asked him to return to his tribesmen and allies — without revealing that he had joined the Muslim camp to try to get the Jews and Arabs to abandon the siege . `` For , '' Muhammad assured him , `` war is deceit . ''
Mas'ud returned , pretending to be loyal to the Arabs and Jews , and began giving them bad advice . He also subtly instigated quarrels between the various tribes until , no longer trusting each other , they disbanded .
Mas'ud became a hero in Islamic tradition . He is often seen as being responsible for helping an embryonic Islam grows at a time when its existence was threatened . One English language Muslim site even recommends his actions as illustrative of how Muslims can subvert non-Muslims .
In the two examples above , Muslims deceived non-Muslims not because they were being persecuted for being Muslim — according to the Washington Post 's definition of taqiyya — but in order to make Islam supreme . ( The Arabs and Jews met Muhammad at the Battle of the Trench because Muhammad and his followers first attacked them at the Battle of Badr and massacred hundreds of them on other occasions . )
Despite these stories being part of the Sunna to which Sunnis adhere , UCLA 's Abou El Fadl — the primary expert quoted by the Washington Post in an effort to show that Islam does not promote deceit — claims that `` there is no concept that would encourage a Muslim to lie to pursue a goal . That is a complete invention . ''
Tell that to Ka ' b ibn Ashraf , whose head was cut off for believing Muslim taqiyya . The prophet of Islam allowed his followers to lie to the Jew to slaughter him .
Dr. Ben Carson got it right when he said that taqiyya `` allows , and even encourages , you to lie to achieve your goals . '' The prophet makes that clear .

On the eve of Israel 's independence in 1948 , as the new nation faced the challenge of building a country in the midst of war , early leaders debated many hot-button issues : what to do with Arab refugees ; how to settle hundreds of thousands of immigrants ; and , perhaps most unexpectedly , should raising pigs be permitted .
Pork was so controversial not just because its tasty incarnations are forbidden under Jewish law , but because the nature of Israel 's Jewish character was seen as an issue that would define the young state . Politicians and writers all weighed in on the subject . While Orthodox politicians made their case on religious grounds , even Natan Alterman , a secular poet , saw the symbolic importance of a nationwide pork ban . He wrote in a Mapai party newspaper column , “ When a Jewish nation makes a pig a sine qua non , its history shudders. ” Yet , many socialist Zionists philosophically rejected basing national dietary laws on traditional Judaism . Secular journalist Meir Bareli , who appreciated the gravity of the pork taboo , saw the cheap price of pork during a decadelong meat shortage as a primary reason to keep its production unrestricted .
The story of Israel 's contemporary pork industry dates back 50 years , when the Knesset passed a law banning the production of pork in Israel . The law—considered to be one of the most controversial in Israeli history—was designed with a loophole that permitted raising hogs in majority Christian regions in the North as a concession to Israel 's religious minorities and the young democracy . As a result , Christian-Arab towns became hog country . Although ultra-Orthodox politicians over the years have attempted to fully ban pork production , the law has limited the growth of the industry while simultaneously protecting Christian pork interests .
A little over a month ago , a panel of Israeli government officials recommended out of the blue that Israel change its pork law to transfer Israel 's industrial hog farms to the South to “ reduce the density in which swine are raised ” and regulate the farms . When pigs are the topic of the day , they usually get caught in the middle of a political firestorm . While it should come as welcome news to casual observers of Israeli politics that the government is taking an interest in the welfare of its domestic animals , moving Israel 's hogs would most likely disassociate pig farming from Israel 's Christians and could spell the beginning of the end for both Israeli-grown ham and the livelihood of Christian Arabs .
Pork is often considered more verboten than shrimp or crab ( also not kosher ) because over the course of millennia various peoples have persecuted Jews by singling out the pork taboo to humiliate and punish them . Greeks forced Jews to eat pork against their will during the Jerusalem conquests in 167 B.C . ; the Spanish forced Jews to eat pork to prove their newfound allegiance to the Catholic Church during the Inquisition . Pork is therefore more than just a food restriction in Israel ; it is symbolic of broader conflict within Israeli society , reflecting not just prosciutto preferences but , more importantly , the delicate balancing of secular and religious interests in a Jewish democracy . Over the years , religious Israelis and their secular counterparts have grown divided and tensions over religious restrictions on society have been a consistent source of political strife . Pork is a particularly thorny issue in this regard : Many secular Israelis enjoy openly , and many ultra-Orthodox Israelis try to fully ban—and have tried for decades—just as they have supported banning buses from riding on the Sabbath and shunning women who dress immodestly .
Until the 1990s , the Israeli pork industry was somewhat clandestine , but with an influx of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and a progressive Supreme Court , pork became more common in Israel . As the political tide of the nation has swung to the right under Benjamin Netanyahu , certain pork eaters have reason to fear that the religious interests in government will attempt—as they have done many times prior—to limit pork production in Israel .
While I was in Tel Aviv last summer investigating the pork industry , Haaretz food columnist Ronit Vered explained to me that the Ministry of Agriculture scarcely pays attention to pigs . Hog farms have never been regulated quite like cattle ranches , and talk of the animal welfare has been virtually nonexistent . “ There is no pig desk in the offices , nor is there a lobbying group as there is for other industries . ”
The Ministry of Agriculture 's recent interest in pig farms claims to be singularly focused on the poor environmental and health conditions . It is certainly true that the farms of the North in the towns of Ibilin , Mailya , Kafr Yasif , and Nazareth are crowded and unsanitary , a fact that I corroborated by personally driving through Ibilin nearly four years ago . As much as I tried , I could not escape the noxious smell of pig excrement , even with the windows rolled up .
“ Ibilin farms are wall to wall with one another , ” Tzachi Lipka , co-founder of Tiv Ta'am , Israel 's largest producer and seller of pork , told me . “ If one is sick , they all get sick . [ Israel has ] an open market , which allows for all of these farms to exist . ”
The recent government panel 's report recommends that Israel move its pig farms to the South where the creatures can have more space , and that Israel adopt “ the European [ Union ] directive on the matter of animal rights . ”
Israel could very well enforce stricter standards on its existing farms rather foot the bill to relocate 26 industrial operations , though when asked , the Ministry of Agriculture did not respond to my question on the matter .
“ There is a problem with ecology , ” Vered acknowledged , “ but in a way , most of them [ Christian Arab pig farmers ] feel that people are using this issue just to attack them because they are pork raisers , not because of concrete ecological problems . ”
If the initiative passes , the implications for the fate of Christian Arab local economy would be grave , in a region that has seen its Christian numbers dwindling . Plus , Christian Arabs are unlikely to abandon the villages they 've populated for generations to relocate to the harsh desert climate .
Egypt set an unfortunate precedent three years ago when under the guise of “ a general health measure , ” former President Hosni Mubarak gratuitously culled the country 's 300,000 pigs during the swine flu outbreak . The Coptic Christian pig farmers were hit hard in what was seen as a bigoted attack against a vulnerable population .
Ultimately there is a chance that all Israeli pork eaters could be the losers , not just Israel 's Christians . As it stands , the minister of interior must assess the panel 's recommendations and if he accepts them , begin the process of revisiting Israel 's pork laws . Eli Yishai , the minister in question , heads the ultra-Orthodox Shas party whose constituents regularly rally for pork to be banned and who criticize Russian Israelis for eating forbidden flesh . Once the law is revised to no longer stipulate that pig farming is legal within Christian zones , banning hog farms completely may be within reach .
The recent report noted that Yishai “ not hesitate to deal with the issue , given that pigs are considered the epitome of non-kosher animals , ” an indication of the religious biases of the panel .
Of course , even if the pigs were to stay in the North , the area is not without its own fraught history . In the Christian Bible 's account of Jesus ' travels in the Gadarenes , Jesus encounters a man who is overcome with devils . Jesus cures the man by transmitting the devils to a herd of swine , which he then sends to drown to its death in the Sea of Galilee . *
Given the region 's track record , maybe pigs wandering in the Southern desert wo n't be so bad after all .
Correction , Aug. 13 , 2012 : This article incorrectly referred to the man overcome with devils as a legion . It also stated that Jesus transmitted the devils to a swineherd instead of a herd of swine . ( Return to the corrected sentences . )
The United States Patent and Trademark Office today published a patent filed by Apple last August , which detailed an Apple Watch band accessory that could double as a `` protective cover '' for the device itself when not on a user 's wrist ( via AppleInsider ) . Referred to as the `` Magnetic wristband , '' the accessory would be similar in function to the Leather and Milanese Loop bands sold today but include multiple `` configurations '' to introduce more utility to users.The first configuration would essentially turn the band into the Apple Watch 's own protective casing , coiling around the device and linking together magnetically the same way it would when placed on a wrist . The patent iterates on the fact that when removed , the Apple Watch `` can be subjected to even greater forces and damage than when worn by the user , '' and as such , a way to protect the wearable device without any outside , third-party equipment could be greatly beneficial to each wearer.Another configuration of the proposed band includes multiple ways to display the watch when it 's not in use on a wrist . Using the band 's magnetic technology , Apple 's patent proposes simple solutions of being able to attach the entire product onto surfaces like a refrigerator or computer 's bezel to keep it in sight . Another idea suggests the magnetic wristband could be rolled up into itself to create a sort of on-the-fly stand for the Apple Watch.As with any patent story , the magnetic wristband is far from a confirmed lock for the upcoming `` Apple Watch 2 , '' but since it 's long been rumored the company will most likely introduce new bands for the second generation device , it is an interesting possibility of where Apple could go with the wearable this year . With news surrounding the possible start of a trial production run on the next Apple Watch as early as this month , it 's not too long that users should have to wait for the official announcement of the device . Current estimates place the reveal in March with a launch in April .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military will let women serve in all combat roles , Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Thursday in a historic move striking down gender barriers in the armed forces .
“ As long as they qualify and meet the standards , women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before , ” Carter told a Pentagon news conference .
“ They 'll be allowed to drive tanks , fire mortars , and lead infantry soldiers into combat . They 'll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets , Navy SEALS , Marine Corps infantry , Air Force parajumpers and everything else that was previously open only to men , ” he said .
President Barack Obama called the move a “ historic step forward , ” saying it would “ make our military even stronger . ”
“ Our armed forces will draw on an even wider pool of talent . Women who can meet the high standards required will have new opportunities to serve , ” Obama said in a statement
Related Coverage Republicans see 'consequential ' impact of women in combat
Carter said the opening to women would take place following a 30-day review period , after which they would be integrated into the new roles in a “ deliberate and methodical manner ” as positions come open . The waiting period enables Congress to review the decision and raise any objections .
He acknowledged the decision could lead to more debate over whether women would have to register for the draft , an issue he said was already under litigation . The U.S. military is currently an all-volunteer force , but young men are still required to register in case the draft is reactivated .
Asked whether the decision opened the door to women being required to serve in front-line combat positions , Carter said members of the military had some choices but not “ absolute choice . ”
“ People are assigned to missions , tasks and functions according to need as well as their capabilities , ” he said . “ And women will be subject to the same standard and rules that men will . ”

MARINES HAD SOUGHT EXCEPTIONS
The decision drew a rebuke from the Republican chairmen of the armed services committees in the Senate and House of Representatives . But some other lawmakers welcomed the move .
“ Secretary Carter 's decision to open all combat positions to women will have a consequential impact on our service members and our military 's warfighting capabilities , ” Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry said in a statement .
They asked the Pentagon for details on a Marine Corps request for exceptions , which was overridden by Carter , and information on how draft registration might be affected .
Two Democratic members of the armed services panels welcomed Carter 's decision . Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said it would “ strengthen our armed forces ” and Representative Niki Tsongas called it a “ long overdue ” move that would eliminate some of the barriers to advancement that women face in the military .
Carter 's decision comes nearly three years after the Pentagon first instructed the military to open all positions to qualified women , including front-line combat roles . A restriction on such roles was seen as increasingly out of place during a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan in which women were often in harm 's way .
Women represented about 2 percent of U.S. casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan , with some 300,000 deploying to the conflict zones .

Since the Pentagon directive in 2013 , the services have been examining whether women should be excluded from any military positions . Three women recently passed the rigorous Army Ranger course , but some 220,000 military jobs are still closed to women .
Carter said most of the services favored opening all jobs to women , but the Marine Corps had sought a partial exception for roles such as infantry , machine gunner , fire support reconnaissance and others . He said he considered the Marines ' request and believed its concerns could be addressed .
General Joseph Dunford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Marine commandant , said he had given Carter his best advice on the issue and would now fully integrate women “ in a manner that maintains our joint warfighting capability . ”
Women already serve in combat roles for the armed forces of a few developed nations , including Canada and Israel , but officials have said demand from women for such jobs in most NATO countries is very low .
a charming bunch of rejects and fuck-ups
I was riding the escalator from the Chuo line platform down into the main concourse of Tokyo station . The escalators criss cross in the typical way that allows you to see people on the opposite escalator . Right as I passed it I saw another foreigner—a gaijin . As we passed he smiled and nodded at me in recognition . I could n't help but to involuntarily smirk before I realized the absurdity of doing so . I 'm not antisocial or mean but I do n't see why strange gaijin are so eager to be so familiar with me .
It seems that something strange happens when a small group of foreigners is put in a place where they are very easily apparent to one another ( Japan being populated with black-haired Asian people , brown haired whities tend to stick out ) . On more than one occasion I was walking through a busy train station—let it be Shinjuku or Tokyo , whatever—and I spotted another gaijin , always white , and unwittingly made brief eye contact . If this ever happens back home or any place where there is an abundance of white people , there is no effect . But in Japan this brief recognition of a fellow foreigner gets me a nod or a smile or even a –sup . This is so fucking weird . I do n't know these people and where do they get the notion that we are in some elite club of honkies carousing around Tokyo giving each other secret handshakes ?
Clearly I 'm offended . But that brings me to another interesting phenomenon among some gaijin in Japan : hatred of other gaijin . For some reason I relish in the fact that I 'm here , and I want nothing more than to be one of a select few foreigners in Tokyo so that I may be a wonderful and unique snowflake to which everyone Japanese can desperately flock . Why is this ? Because I was a loser back home and I have a fleeting chance to be the cool center of attention . It 's pathetic , I know . The thing is I 've spoken with many foreigners who share this odd sentiment . I hope we 're not all pathological narcissists but rather this is some psychological effect of being an obvious expatriate in a foreign country , particularly a nation which tends to glorify western ( especially American ) culture .
Though I sound like a complete asshole , I 'm actually very cordial when I meet other foreigners and usually return their acknowledgements rather warmly . As for desiring to be the only foreigner in all of Japan and enviously resenting other foreigners—in truth most of my friends are not Japanese ( though I really want to befriend more locals to practice speaking but all I do is work and work is populated with English speaking gaijin ) . Maybe that 's the source of my frustrations . I came here to be friends with Nihonjin and to speak Nipponese with them , but instead I 'm friends with a bunch of fucking Americans . At least the mainland Europeans I 'm friends with are a step in the right direction .
The fortunate thing is , despite not achieving the cultural exchange I 'd like , I do really like the expatriates I 've met . They 're an eccentric and charming bunch of rejects and fuck-ups . I love ‘ em .
New Delhi : The government has so far this year asked social networking sites to block 1,208 web addresses , or uniform resource locater ( URLs ) , Parliament was informed today .
Social networking sites were requested to block these web pages in order to comply with court orders , Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal said in a written reply to Lok Sabha .
`` Social networking sites were requested to block 8,21,352 and 1,208 URLs during 2010 , 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , respectively to comply with the court orders , '' he added .
That apart , 362 , URLs were blocked in 2012 , of which 312 URLs were blocked in a single instance at the time of exodus of North East people from different parts of the country , the minister said .
A total of 62 URLs have been blocked so far during the current year , Sibal added .
`` The web pages were hosting objectionable information and had the potential to disturb the public order in the country and blocked for access to public in the country on the request of law enforcement agencies , '' he said .
Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-In ) gets requests for blocking of objectionable content from individuals and organisations , which it forwards to the social networking sites for appropriate action , Sibal said .
Section 69A of the IT Act , 2000 empowers government to block any information generated , transmitted , received , stored or hosted in any computer resource in interest of sovereignty and integrity of India , defence of India , security of the state , friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to the above , he added .
`` There is no institutional monitoring mechanism for monitoring social networking sites . At present , law enforcement and intelligence/security agencies make searches on the Internet on specific case-to-case basis , '' he said .

About a year ago I was trying to come up with a Christmas gift for a close friend who happens to be a big Calvin and Hobbes fan . I could n't find any perfect themed gifts online , so I decided to try to make something . I 'd experimented a bit with paper cutting ( perhaps I 'll post about those projects later ) , and I thought I might be able to make my own versions of some of the illustrations . I choose this strip , which was the last one in the series .
I started by finding some reasonably good quality ( digital ) versions of the first and last panels , blowing them up , cropping them to 8″ squares and printing them out . Then I went to a craft store and spent entirely too long deciding which individual sheets of cardstock most closely matched the colors in the strip .
Then , I started cutting . I taped the printed copy to a white sheet and used an Xacto knife to cut out everything that was n't snow .
Then came all the tiny colorful pieces . I decided to let all the black lines just show through from the back sheet , but the colorful bits all needed to be cut out just right to fit into the spaces in the white sheet . Some of them took lots of tries , but I eventually got them to work . I glued them down to get this .
Finally , I added the white sheet back on top and put the whole thing in a frame to keep it together . ( I decided not to glue the white sheet down , just because . )
Then I repeated the process for the last panel of the strip .

Story highlights San Diego Mayor Bob Filner 's lawyer writes to city attorney about city paying legal fees
He says Filner never got sexual harassment training as mayor , congressman
Filner is being sued by a former spokeswoman for sexual harassment
The mayor 's lawyer says the city would be liable if the ex-spokeswoman wins
A lawyer for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner criticized the city for not providing sexual harassment training to the mayor , saying its failure to do so violated the law .
In a letter to the city attorney , Harvey Berger wrote that Filner might never have been sued for sexual harassment had he been properly trained .
`` If there is any liability at all , the city will almost certainly be liable for 'failing to prevent harassment , ' `` Berger wrote in a letter dated Monday and obtained Wednesday by CNN from City Attorney Jan Goldsmith .
An intent of Berger 's letter was to urge the city to pay Filner 's legal fees associated with a sexual harassment filed against him by his former spokeswoman , Irene McCormack Jackson . The city is named as a co-defendant in that lawsuit .
On Tuesday , the City Council voted 9-0 to deny the mayor 's request for taxpayers to pay his legal fees , according to Matt Awbrey , spokesman for council member Kevin Faulconer .

Filner never received sexual harassment training while serving in Congress from 1993 to December 2012 , Berger wrote . He was set to get such training -- which is required within six months of one 's start date -- after becoming mayor , but the trainer canceled the session and never rescheduled , according to the lawyer .
`` There is very , very good reason for mandatory sexual harassment training , '' Berger said . `` If nothing else , it makes people think about the subject and how they interact with fellow employees . ''
While the mayor has admitted unspecified inappropriate behavior in the past , he denies the allegations against him by Jackson .
`` This is not a request for the city to agree to pay any verdict ; it is simply a request for defense against unverified claims being brought against the mayor -- claims which are denied , '' Berger said .
Jackson is n't alone . Seven other women have said they were subjected to `` crude and disgusting '' comments and inappropriate touching -- including groping and kissing -- by Filner . Many of the alleged incidents of which he 's being accused took place during his five terms in a U.S. representative , before he was elected mayor last year .
Berger contended that those alleged incidents took place so long ago that the accusers likely would n't be allowed to testify as part of Jackson 's lawsuit or in their own lawsuits .
Nonetheless , the wave of accusations has put tremendous pressure on Filner . His chief of staff quit , the Democratic Party of San Diego voted to call for his resignation and even his fiancee left his side .
Earlier this month , Filner admitted `` I need help , '' adding , `` I 'm clearly doing something wrong . '' The 70-year-old later announced he would take a two-week hiatus for `` intensive counseling . ''
Still , he has fought Jackson 's lawsuit and for the city to pay his legal fees .
The City Council believes San Diego should n't be part of the Jackson lawsuit in the first place because it had no role in the mayor 's behavior and because of the city 's zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment .
In fact , the council decided Tuesday to file suit against Filner and seek from paying any damages should Jackson win her lawsuit .
`` Bob Filner ca n't pay back San Diegans for the damage he 's done to our city 's reputation , but he can and should repay the city if there are any taxpayer costs as a result of this lawsuit , '' Faulconer said in a statement .
The Energy and Climate Change Committee were back on the subject of shale gas yesterday , hearing from two panels of witnesses - one for and one against ( video here ) . This is an improvement for the ECC who have tended to want to hear only the green side of the debate , with only token voices against ( see the windfarm inquiry for example ) .
The stars of the show were Francis Egan , CEO of Cuadrilla , and Professor Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre . Egan was measured and sensible and even managed to put over his frustration with bureaucratic delays at DECC without looking exasperated . This was the kind of man you 'd want running things . I do n't think I 'd twigged that the figure of 200TCf shale gas resources is for Lancashire , not the UK . The UK will be much bigger .
Anderson meanwhile was the archetypal academic - somewhat eccentric , full of interesting bits and pieces , but with the unfortunate feature of having swallowed the global warming story whole . If you accepted this rather dogmatic position , then he had some sensible things to say , for example noting that it was probably better to extract gas in the UK than have the Russians extract it for us .
There was a measure of agreement on one issue : that there 's a great deal we do n't know . Just how much gas will flow from the Beast of Blackpool is anyone 's guess , although Egan said that the geology looks good . There really is only one way to find out and that 's to drill .
So let 's get fracking and find out what we 've got .

Three Tennessee high school basketball players were charged Tuesday with raping and assaulting one of their teammates on Dec. 23 while the team was out of town for a tournament .
According to Shamar Walters and Alexander Smith of NBC News , the alleged incident took place in a rental cabin in Gatlinburg , Tennessee , and it involved students from Ooltewah High School .
Per David Carroll of WRCB-TV , the freshman victim underwent surgery to treat his injuries and was released from the hospital after an eight-day stay .
While details surrounding the alleged attack have yet to be officially released , an anonymous family member of the victim provided a statement to the Chattanoogan :
He was not given a proper exam and collapsed the following day . Once he collapsed , he was taken by ambulance to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville . He had to undergo emergency surgery , as his colon and bladder were ruptured . He is still in the hospital recovering at this time .
The family member also told the Chattanoogan the victim was sodomized by a wooden pool stick ; however , that has n't been confirmed .
Carroll reported , citing police , the accused are being held at the Sevier County Juvenile Facility prior to a bond hearing scheduled for Wednesday .
All of them were dismissed from the Ooltewah High School basketball team .
Image caption Mr Carter was taken to the Metro Health Hospital in Cleveland
Former US President Jimmy Carter is to spend the night in hospital after being taken ill with an upset stomach on a flight to Cleveland .
`` He is resting comfortably and is expected to resume his book tour this week , '' his grandson Jason Carter said .
The 85-year-old was travelling to promote his new book , White House Diary , which was released last week .
Mr Carter was elected as the 39th US president in 1976 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 .
The former president was taken to Metro Health Hospital at about 1130 local time ( 1530 GMT ) on Tuesday after developing an upset stomach . His doctor advised him to remain in the hospital 's care overnight , the Carter Center said in a statement .
According to the website for Joseph-Beth Booksellers , Mr Carter had planned to attend a book-signing in Cleveland , in the US state of Ohio .
He intends to continue his book tour in Washington DC on Wednesday , the Carter Center said .
White House spokeman Bill Burton said President Barack Obama had called Mr Carter from Air Force One to see how he was doing .
Mr Carter has recently called for the US to develop stronger ties with Iran and North Korea .
Last month , Mr Carter secured the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes , a 31-year-old American citizen detained in North Korea .
He founded the Carter Center a year after leaving the White House to promote elections and mediate conflicts around the globe .
Fierce clashes erupted between pro-Assad militias from the National Defense Forces and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Homs this week in an unusually public confrontation between allies .
In the days following the deal , Homs residents have flooded back to their battered and abandoned homes in the Old City , where the rebels had been penned in under an intense government siege for over two years .
Some reports suggested the battle broke out after NDF troops looted Christian homes .
Phillip Smyth , a researcher at the University of Maryland who specializes in Shiite militant groups and uses open-source material to track their movements , said that while it remained unclear how this incident erupted , `` there have been others '' .
He noted that as Assad forces , backed by a host of various militias , including Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite forces , have made gains , factionalism has become more pronounced , with the SSNP in particular appearing to assert control of territory .
The SSNP , itself split between pro- and anti-Assad factions , is considered a political `` loyalist opposition '' group , advocating reform inside Syria . The party has maintained a tenuous historical alliance with the Assad regime under both Bashar Assad and his father and predecessor , Hafez , tolerated within limits and used as proxy force in Lebanon at other times .

An Oregon administrative law judge recommended today that the bakers who refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding should be fined $ 135,000 .
“ [ T ] he forum concludes that $ 75,000 and $ 60,000 , are appropriate awards to compensate [ the same-sex couple ] for the emotional suffering they experienced , ” wrote Alan McCullough , administrative law judge for Oregon 's Bureau of Labor and Industries in his proposed order .
Aaron and Melissa Klein , owners of Sweet Cakes by Melissa located in Gresham , Ore. , say the fine is enough to potentially bankrupt their family of seven .
The dispute began in January 2013 , when Aaron denied Rachel Cryer a wedding cake after learning there would be two brides in her wedding .
Aaron and his wife Melissa are both Christians and believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman .
Rachel and her partner Laurel Bowman-Cryer , who are now married , filed a complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries under the state 's public accommodation law , which bans discrimination based on a person 's sexual orientation .
The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries pursued charges against the Kleins on behalf of the same-sex couple .
In January 2015 , an investigation by the bureau found the Kleins guilty of violating the state 's public accommodation law by denying Rachel and Laurel full and equal access to their bakery , which the state considers a place of public accommodation .
The Civil Rights Division of the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries is responsible for enforcing the state 's public accommodation law , and the judge who issued today 's proposed order works for the bureau .
In order to reach $ 135,000 , Rachel and Laurel submitted a long list of alleged physical , emotional and mental damages they claim to have experienced as a result of the Kleins ' unlawful conduct .
One of the women , whose name was redacted to protect her privacy , listed 88 symptoms as grounds for compensation . The other , whose name was also redacted , listed 90 .
Examples of symptoms include “ acute loss of confidence , ” “ doubt , ” “ excessive sleep , ” “ felt mentally raped , dirty and shameful , ” “ high blood pressure , ” “ impaired digestion , ” “ loss of appetite , ” “ migraine headaches , ” “ pale and sick at home after work , ” “ resumption of smoking habit , ” “ shock ” “ stunned , ” “ surprise , ” “ uncertainty , ” “ weight gain ” and “ worry . ”
> > > Read the full complaint below .
Anna Harmon , the Kleins ' lawyer , told The Daily Signal that during the hearing “ there was no expert testimony . ”
The witnesses at the hearing were the two women who were requesting a cake , one of their mothers , one of their brothers and another family member . There was no doctor , there was no psychologist , no expert testimony at all .
In collecting the fine , Harmon said the state is n't just pursuing the Kleins ' business assets , but their personal livelihood as well .
“ An important thing to understand about the damages the state is claiming in this case is that the [ fine ] is n't going to come from liquidating business assets , ” she said .
Their business is gone . They do n't have business assets so when we talk about [ the fine ] , it 's personal . It means that 's money they would have used to feed their children that they ca n't use anymore .
In September 2013 , after facing public backlash , the Kleins had to close their bakery .
The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries did not respond to The Daily Signal 's multiple requests for comment .
Paul Thompson , the attorney representing the lesbians , previously said he has “ a policy of not discussing cases that are the subject of open litigation . ”
> > > Farmers to Lesbian Couple : ‘ We 're Not Hateful People '
Aaron , in an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal on Sunday , said the state of Oregon is attempting to “ obliterate ” his family .
“ The state is now saying that we can award damages above and beyond what you have already suffered … and they have no qualms about doing this , ” he said . “ It is really showing the state is taking a stance on absolutely obliterating somebody that takes a different stance than the state has . ”
The recommended fine will now go to to state Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian , who can either accept it or adjust the amount in issuing a final order .

Rafa Benitez wants to be installed as Newcastle manager by the end of Friday and begin work with the players ahead of Monday 's trip to Leicester .
Talks between the Spaniard 's representatives and managing director Lee Charnley are at an advanced stage and a £4million-per-year three-year deal – with a break clause should the Magpies be relegated – has been agreed in principle .
Benitez , however , had expected Newcastle head coach Steve McClaren to be sacked yesterday , freeing the way for his move to St James ' Park to be finalised .

Steve McClaren receives a pat on the back from security guard Graeme Crombie as he leaves the training
McClaren took training with the players in preparation for their game against Leicester on Monday
NEWCASTLE 'S REMAINING FIXTURES March 14th : Leicester ( A ) March 20th : Sunderland ( H ) April 2nd : Norwich ( A ) April 9th : Southampton ( A ) April 16th : Swansea ( H ) April 23rd : Liverpool ( A ) April 30th : Crystal Palace ( H ) May 7th : Aston Villa ( A ) May 15th : Tottenham ( H )
That did not happen – even though McClaren is expecting the axe – and it has delayed Benitez 's arrival by at least 24 hours .
The former Real Madrid boss is ready to leave his home in the Wirral and travel to the North-East to take up the role , once final details such as backroom staff have been agreed .
Newcastle is desperate to land the 55-year-old and they have been encouraged by a positive reaction to the news among supporters , who are growing increasingly exasperated at the club 's failure to fire dead-man walking McClaren .
Jonjo Shelvey , who had been appointed captain in recent weeks , believes the players have let down their outgoing boss .
‘ He ( McClaren ) is at the forefront of it , which he does n't deserve , ' he said .
‘ I think the players have let the club down . I do n't feel as though the manager has . I feel it 's the players .
‘ I feel like I 've let the club down because I 've had the captain 's armband twice and we 've lost . It 's lovely to be made captain . ‘ The manager has shown a lot of faith in me to do that . I obviously adore him for that . It 's just a shame I have not been able to pick up the wins . '

Image caption French President Nicolas Sarkozy has called for all meat to be labelled
Muslim and Jewish groups have reacted with dismay after French PM Francois Fillon suggested the religious slaughter of animals was out of date .
The row began when a TV documentary said last month that all abattoirs in Paris region were producing halal meat .
National Front presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen then complained they had `` succumbed to the rules of a minority '' .
With the election next month , Mr Fillon has also weighed in , saying religions should re-think their traditions .
The Jewish and Islamic method of slaughter involves the use of a razor-sharp knife on conscious cattle while non-religious butchers stun the animal first .
Although officials have made it clear that most of the meat consumed in the Greater Paris is slaughtered outside the Paris area , the issue has not gone away .
President Nicolas Sarkozy , who is trailing Socialist candidate Francois Hollande in the opinion polls , addressed the issue at the weekend , pronouncing himself in favour of the `` labelling of meat according to the method of killing '' .
'Scapegoats '
Mr Fillon told French radio station Europe 1 on Monday that `` religions should think about whether they should keep traditions that do n't have much in common with today 's state of science , technology and health problems '' .
Religious slaughter Jewish method called shechita
Muslim method called dhabiha
Stunning prohibited in Jewish law , which says animals must be healthy and uninjured at the time of slaughter
Islamic law also says animals must be uninjured , but some authorities allow a form of stunning ( in the UK , dhabiha usually involves stunning ) Should animals be stunned before slaughter ?
His remarks prompted France 's Grand Rabbi Gilles Bernheim to argue that there was no place for such a debate .
`` France 's problems are so important , as we are in a period of crisis , so how can the issue of kosher meat and halal meat be a major problem for France ? ''
Mohammed Moussaoui , head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith , said the council `` can not understand why Islam and Muslims are being used as scapegoats in this campaign '' .
France has an estimated 3.5 million Muslims and President Sarkozy 's former justice minister Rachida Dati , herself a Muslim , said Mr Fillon was `` mixing everything up '' and many religious people were upset .
Francois Hollande , currently leading in the polls , called on his rivals to `` avoid these false debates and futile rows '' , warning that they had left Muslims and Jews in France hurt , regardless of their politics .
Mr Fillon is due to meet the grand rabbi on Wednesday .
circa 1625 by A cardinal 's hat worn by St Jerome as depicted1625 by Rubens
A galero ( plural : galeri ; from Latin : galerum ) is a broad-brimmed hat with tasselated strings worn by clergy in the Catholic Church . Over the centuries , the red galero was restricted to use by individual cardinals while such other colors as green and violet were reserved to clergy of other ranks and styles .
Description [ edit ]
When creating a cardinal , the pope used to place a scarlet galero on the new cardinal 's head in consistory , the practice giving rise to the phrase `` receiving the red hat . '' In 1969 , a Papal decree ended the use of the galero . [ 1 ] Since that time , only the scarlet zucchetto and biretta are placed over the heads of cardinals during the consistory . Some cardinals continue to obtain a galero privately so that the custom of suspending it over their tombs may be observed . Cardinal Raymond Burke has been known to wear the galero on occasion in the 21st century . [ 2 ]
A few cardinals from eastern rites wear distinctive oriental headgear . Other ecclesiastical hats are used by ministers of other Christian communities . Alongside Catholic clergy , the Scots Public Register records its use by Episcopalian and Presbyterian ministers . The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland uses a black hat , with blue cords and ten tassels
Traditionally , the galero remains over the tomb until it is reduced to dust , symbolizing how all earthly glory is passing . In a cathedral that has no crypt , the galeri are suspended from the ceiling . For example , following the death of Cardinal Basil Hume , Archbishop of Westminster ( UK ) , in 1999 , his relatives had a galero installed above his tomb in Westminster Cathedral , alongside those of his predecessors . [ citation needed ]
History [ edit ]
The privilege of wearing the red galero was first granted to cardinals by Pope Innocent IV in 1245 at the First Council of Lyon . [ 3 ] Tradition in the Archdiocese of Lyon is that the red color was inspired by the red hats of the canons of Lyon . [ 4 ] Pope Innocent wanted his favorites to be distinct and recognizable in the lengthy processions at the council . [ 5 ]
Anachronistically , some early Church Fathers are shown wearing a galero , notably Jerome frequently is pictured in art either wearing a galero , or with one close by . Even though the office of cardinal did not exist in Jerome 's day , he had been secretary to Pope Damasus I , which in later days would have made him a cardinal ex officio .
Cardinal Jean Cholet used his galero to crown Charles of Valois in 1285 at Girona during the Aragonese Crusade , pronouncing him King of Aragon . As a result , roi du chapeau ( `` king of the hat '' ) became Charles 's nickname .
The use of the galero was abolished in 1969 with instruciton Ut sive sollicite . [ 6 ]
Ecclesiastical heraldry [ edit ]
galero Coat of Arms of Cardinal Lorenzo Antonetti , with
The galero continues to appear today in ecclesiastical heraldry as part of the achievement of the coat of arms of an armigerous Catholic cleric . The ecclesiastical hat replaces the helmet and crest , because those were considered too belligerent for men in the clerical estate . The color of the hat and number of tassels indicate the cleric 's place in the hierarchy . Generally , priests and ministers have a black hat with cords and tassels , the number depending upon their rank . Bishops generally use a green hat with green cords and six green tassels on each side , archbishops have likewise a green hat with green cords and ten green tassels on each side , and cardinals have a red hat with red cords and fifteen red tassels on each side . Depiction in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist 's style . [ 7 ]
Gallery [ edit ]
Saint Jerome in the Wilderness by the 15th century artist Pinturicchio shows the galero , as do many portraits of Jerome
Archbishop Giovanni Colombo wearing a galero with ten green tassels on each side .
Chinese bishops occasionally avoid having a green galero in their arms , as wearing a green hat is the Chinese idiom for a cuckold ; for some years as an auxiliary bishop of Hong Kong , Bishop John Tong Hon used a violet galero with violet tassels ( which is actually the galero proper to an Honorary Prelate of His Holiness ) . However , he resumed the use of the green galero on his coat of arms when he became the bishop of Hong Kong until he was created cardinal in 2012 .

How to create custom JavaFX controls using inheritance
Ken Fogel investigates on the best method for making a custom JavaFX control , without FXML , that is available to the Scene Builder .
This article brings together information I reviewed from numerous sources to learn how to carry out a specific task—how to create a custom JavaFX control . There is much written on this topic and the general assumption is you are planning to group multiple standard components in an FXML layout that can be used as if it were a single control .
That is not what I wanted to do . Instead , I wanted to use a custom control created by extending an existing control in a class and without any FXML and then I wanted to make that custom JavaFX control available to the Scene Builder .
Let 's begin by looking at the final user interface of the application as seen when the program executes :
There are only two input fields . They are the ComboBox to select a letter and a TextField where the number of hours are entered . This simple application is a billing calculator with rules left over from the days of the dial up modem .
The custom control I wanted to create was a specialization of a JavaFX TextField into which the hours used in a month are entered . I wanted to use a regular expression to validate what was being entered into the text field . To accomplish this I needed to override a TextField 's “ replaceText ” and “ replaceSelection ” methods . Here is the code for the specialized TextField :
public class DoubleTextField extends TextField { public DoubleTextField ( ) { super ( ) ; } //http : //utilitymill.com/utility/Regex_For_Range String numberRegEx = `` \\b ( [ 0-9 ] { 1,2 } | [ 1-6 ] [ 0-9 ] { 2 } |7 [ 0-3 ] [ 0-9 ] |74 [ 0-4 ] ) \\b '' ; @ Override public void replaceText ( int start , int end , String text ) { String oldValue = getText ( ) ; if ( ( validate ( text ) ) ) { super.replaceText ( start , end , text ) ; String newText = super.getText ( ) ; if ( ! validate ( newText ) ) { super.setText ( oldValue ) ; } } } @ Override public void replaceSelection ( String text ) { String oldValue = getText ( ) ; if ( validate ( text ) ) { super.replaceSelection ( text ) ; String newText = super.getText ( ) ; if ( ! validate ( newText ) ) { super.setText ( oldValue ) ; } } } private boolean validate ( String text ) { return ( `` '' .equals ( text ) || text.matches ( numberRegEx ) ) ; } }
The regular expression accepts only numbers and only within the range of integers from 0 to 744 . Unfortunately the web site http : //utilitymill.com/utility/Regex_For_Range is not online as of this writing . It was one of the easiest web sites to use when you needed a regular expression .
I wrote this DoubleTextField class over a year ago and while it worked as desired there were a few issues . I did not know how to make Scene Builder aware of the control . If I could make Scene Builder aware then I might be able to use this or other controls I create in other projects .
I could make Scene Builder accept the name of the control in the FXML file . All that was necessary was to edit an XML file and add the import for the DoubleTextField and then change the TextField for hours to a DoubleTextField . Here is an excerpt from the hand modified FXML file :
. . . < ? import com.kenfogel.controls . * ? > . . . < HBox alignment= '' CENTER '' GridPane.columnSpan= '' 2 '' GridPane.rowIndex= '' 4 '' > < children > < DoubleTextField fx : id= '' planHours '' alignment= '' CENTER_RIGHT '' > < font > < Font name= '' Tahoma '' size= '' 14.0 '' / > < /font > < /DoubleTextField > < /children > < /HBox > . . .
This eliminated errors from the FXML file but the problem was that Scene Builder could not display the custom control . Here are two views in Scene Builder :
Notice that the TextField for the hours used in the month does not appear . It was fine when the application ran . The DoubleTextField does appear in the graph of the container but Scene Builder does not know how to display it .
Notice that the node labeled DoubleTextField has a yellow caution symbol . This indicates that Scene Builder does not know how to display this control even though it is an acceptable in the FXML .
In my research I learned that Scene Builder could import JAR or FXML files that contained custom controls . Since the custom control was defined in my project I decided to import the project 's jar file into Scene Builder . This is easy to do by clicking on the gear/settings icon adjacent to the Library label .
I browsed to my target directory in the project and included the project 's JAR . Doing this brought up a display of the custom controls that were found in the JAR .
I clicked on Import Component and a new category of control appeared called Custom . The JAR file was copied into Scene Builder 's library folder which on a Windows system is found at C : \Users\Ken\AppData\Roaming\Scene Builder\Library .
In the Custom list was my DoubleTextField .
All that was left to do was to delete the DoubleTextField in the Hierarchy and then drag the new DoubleTextField into its position in the HBox . Now Scene Builder displayed the field .
At this point I could have declared success and ended this article right here . However , two things bothered me . The first was the fact that the JAR file imported into Scene Builder 's library contained unused classes and libraries . The fix for this was simple . I created a new project , all my projects are Maven based , and copied just the package with the DoubleTextField class into the project . I edited the POM file removing anything not required for the control such as creating a shaded JAR and executing the code . I changed the default goal to :
< defaultGoal > clean compile package install < /defaultGoal >
The installation setting installed the JAR into the local Maven repository . I used the import JAR command in Scene Builder and added the JAR file from the repository into Scene Builder . Placing the JAR in the local repository resolved the second problem : how to easily reuse the component in other projects . While Scene Builder was now aware of DoubleTextField , the location where Scene Builder copied the JAR to was not on the project 's classpath . The solution was to add a dependency for the control in the POM file .
< dependency > < groupId > com.kenfogel < /groupId > < artifactId > doubletextfield < /artifactId > < version > 1.0 < /version > < /dependency >
Now , anytime I want to use this DoubleTextField all I need to do is add the dependency to a project and it can be imported into the source code . The custom control will remain available to Scene Builder as long as its JAR is in the Scene Builder library .
Now go forth and make custom controls !

it is a good try and a great spoof series but even Communist propaganda was a bit more subtle .
The Communist propaganda movie heroes did not drink heavy or sleep around carelessly ( albeit seducing an imperialist woman in the service of the Party would have been perfectly fine ) . The filmmakers there were also all too conscious that the Soviet block realities were grittier so usually the movies would show more prosperity and modernity than was the case for the vast majority of the population . Only the best buildings and the nicest parts of the city would appear on screen . The main character of a Communist propaganda movie would be a happy worker or collective farmer ( if he was a policeman he would have started as factory worker and then promoted for his qualities ) , wise and good-mannered , uninterested in material wealth and devoted to the building of the `` multi-lateral developed socialist society and steady advancement toward the golden dream of humanity - the Communism '' . His parents would have been also of `` healthy social origin '' - also workers , peasants , socialist intellectuals , etc .
Albeit snitching for the regime was encouraged it would have been glorified - the persons reported to the authorities would be portrayed in a more negative manner and the person reporting to the authorities would appear more heroic and occupying the higher moral ground ( eventually he/she would have tried to educate the `` traitor to the people '' but be rebuffed/ laughed at ) .
Communist moviemakers watched Hollywood movies and would know how to tweak its recipes in the service of the Party .

Thousands of Aghans protested at Bagram Air Base , the main U.S. military base in Afghanistan , on Tuesday , as local laborers found out that NATO personnel had been burning Korans at the base . With news of the protest still coming in , MSNBC is reporting that the base saw 2,000-3,000 protesters today . `` Afghan demonstrators used slingshots and fired guns in the air while U.S. helicopters responded with flares , '' reads the MSNBC report . `` The demonstrators — shouting `` Die , die , foreigners ! '' — started gathering in the morning after learning of the incident . '' According to MSNBC and The New York Times , local Bagram employees reportedly found the charred remains of Korans in the trash .
NATO Commander Gen. John R. Allen has already issued an apology for burning . `` ISAF personnel at Bagram Air Base improperly disposed of a large number of Islamic religious materials which included Korans , ” Allen said , referring to NATO 's International Security Assistance Force , in The New York Times report , which politely went with Allen 's `` disposal '' euphemism in its headline . `` When we learned of these actions , we immediately intervened and stopped them . The materials recovered will be properly handled by appropriate religious authorities . ''

According to Worldwatch , there 's been an upward revision in UN population projections . As things now stand , the end-of-century tally settles out just short of 11 billion ( medium forecast of 10.9 billion , with a range of 6.8 to 16.6 ) .
The change is due to higher than expected fertility :
Compared to the UN 's previous assessment of world p opulation trends , the new projected total population is higher , particularly after 2075 . Part of the reason is that current fertility levels have been adjusted upward in a number of countries as new information has become available . In 15 high-fertil ity countries of sub-Saharan Africa , the estimated average number of children pe r woman has been adjusted upwards by more than 5 per cent .
The projections are essentially open loop with respect to major environmental or other driving forces , so the scenario range does n't reflect full uncertainty . Interestingly , the UN varies fertility but not mortality in projections . Small differences in fertility make big differences in population :
The “ high-variant ” projection , for example , which assumes an extra half of a child per woman ( on average ) than the medium variant , implies a world population of 10.9 billion in 2050 . The “ low-variant ” projection , where women , on average , have half a child less than under the medium variant , would produce a population of 8.3 billion in 2050 . Thus , a constant difference of only half a child above or below the medium variant would result in a global population of around 1.3 billion more or less in 2050 compared to the medium-variant forecast .
There 's a nice backgrounder on population projections , by Brian O'Neil et al. , in Demographic Research . See Fig . 6 for a comparison of projections .
What is Tor ?
Short for `` The Onion Router , '' Tor is a free tool that keeps a user 's Web browsing private and anonymous . Beyond those with personal privacy or censorship concerns , Tor has been a valuable tool for those in oppressed parts of the world helping activists and others reach parts of the Internet they otherwise would not be able to . Tor is available as a free download for your PC ; it also stands for the Tor network , which is made up of voluntary Tor users worldwide . It 's through this network where Tor users ' Internet traffic is directed in order to conceal the user 's location .
In parts of the world where surveillance is conducted over the Internet or by analyzing network traffic , Tor is an important piece of software to preserve anonymity online.Tor organizers point to a number of use cases for the software and network , including reaching sites or services online that are blocked by local Internet service providers , keeping sensitive communication anonymous–for example between crisis counselors and patients in the medical community , between journalists and their sources , or non-governmental organization ( NGO ) volunteers wishing to preserve their anonymity in countries hostile to their cause .
How does it protect your identity while on the Internet ?
Creating anonymous resources is possible due to the distributed network of servers called `` nodes '' or routers that operate on the principle of onion rings ( hence its name is The Onion Router ) . All network traffic ( i.e . any information ) is encrypted repeatedly as it passes through several network nodes on its way to Tor . In addition , no network node knows either the source of the traffic or the destination or its content . This ensures a high level of anonymity making it impossible to determine who is behind the network activity , i.e . a real person .
How do browsers affect Tor ?
There are some known techniques that exploit bad browser configuration which may lead to revealing information about the user . For example , if Flash or Java is enabled in the browser , it may be exploited to establish the victim 's real IP address . However , these and other plug-ins are disabled by default in Tor browser and at first sight it leaves no room for exploitation . But there is a different situation with JavaScript : it is enabled by default and is unlikely to be turned off by the majority as many web sites do n't work properly without JavaScript . Thus , technique known as user 's fingerprinting can be used with the help of JavaScript which may lead to further deanonymization .
For instance , Tor Browser can be identified with the help of the HTML5 canvas measureText ( ) function , which measures the width of a text rendered in canvas . If the resulting font width has a unique value ( it is sometimes a floating point value ) , then we can identify the browser , including Tor Browser .
It should be noted that this is not the only function that can acquire unique values . Another such function is etBoundingClientRect ( ) , which can acquire the height and the width of the text border rectangle.When the problem of fingerprinting users became known to the community ( it is also relevant to Tor Browser users ) , an appropriate request was created . However , Tor Browser developers are in no haste to patch this drawback in the configuration , stating that blacklisting such functions is ineffective .
Is it possible to monitor users protected by Tor ?
Yes it is possible though different methods require different resources and work with different effectiveness . In general , it is not an easy task and the more approaches are implemented by an attacker , the greater the probability of collecting valuable information .
Attacks on the communication channel . If the attacker has access to many nodes in the network , he can carry out traffic analysis using statistical correlation of traffic measurements , thus , he can identify the source of anonymous traffic .
Passive Monitoring : Exit nodes being an end link in traffic decryption operations may become a source that can leak interesting information , for example unencrypted user passwords , usernames and other identifying information .
Active monitoring : Apart from just sniffing traffic on the exit nodes , the more severe operations can be performed on them , such as injecting malicious code into that binary files being downloaded . In other words , the malicious exit node can conduct a so-called MITM-attack .
Browser fingerprinting : The JavaScript code installed on many sites , both internal for Tor and external , can 'fingerprint ' users . That means that , the attacker could , in theory , find out , for instance , sites on which topics are of interest to the user with the unique fingerprint 'c2c91d5b3c4fecd9109afe0e ' , and on which sites that user logs in . As a result , the attacker knows the user 's profile on a web resource , and the user 's surfing history .
What is HTML5 canvas data ? How can it be used to identify a user protected by Tor ?
HTML5 has brought us not only WebRTC , but also the interesting tag 'canvas ' , which is designed to create bitmap images with the help of JavaScript . This tag has a peculiarity in how it renders images : each web-browser renders images differently depending on various factors , such as :
l Various graphics drivers and hardware components installed on the client 's side ; l Various sets of software in the operating system and various configurations of the software environment .
The parameters of rendered images can uniquely identify a web-browser and its software and hardware environment . Based on this peculiarity , a so-called fingerprint can be created . This technique is not new – it is used , for instance , by some online advertising agencies to track users ' interests . However , not all of its methods can be implemented in Tor Browser . For example , supercookies can not be used in Tor Browser , Flash and Java is disabled by default , font use is restricted . Some other methods display notifications that may alert the user . However , some loopholes are still open at this moment , with which fingerprinting in Tor can be done without inducing notifications .
Are other anonymous networks like I2P vulnerable as well ? Different anonymous networks provide different tools for the users ( for example , being only a network layer as I2P , or also having its own browser as Tor ) and take different approaches to traffic encryption . For example , I2P has a better implementation of encryption being more resistant to traffic eavesdropping and MITM-attacks as it is in the case of Tor . But still , as the user can use any browser by his own choice he is still vulnerable to attacks on browsers ( Flash , Java , fingerprinting ) and , thus , can be identified .
FCC Proposes Broadband Data-Privacy Protections
Consumer Data
Get ready for a potentially sweeping set of changes governing the use of data by ISPs . Tom Wheeler , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , submitted a proposal to regulate the use and disclosure of the data that ISPs collect about their customers ' online activities . If adopted by the FCC , it would require ISPs , including broadband and cellular providers , to obtain consumers ' consent for many uses of their data , disclose other uses , protect personal information , and report data breaches . Since its release , the proposal has been hailed as a significant improvement in online consumer privacy—but also has been criticized for singling out broadband providers while doing nothing about the use of data by large-scale collectors such as Google , Facebook , and Amazon .
The proposal arises out of the FCC 's newly claimed authority to regulate broadband providers in the same manner as other telecommunications companies . The FCC asserted this authority as part of its 2015 Open Internet Order , which also gave the organization its Net Neutrality authority . Under this order—which is being challenged in court—the FCC gained the power to address industry practices such as data discrimination , throttling , and the use of consumer data .
Consumers ' use of the internet results in the creation of huge amounts of data , which can include their searches on Google , complete social media life , video viewing habits , banking and healthcare information from public and secured websites , memberships in organizations , and use of adult sites and services—a complete array of information . Websites collect the data that is generated when customers use their sites , and they can communicate it to third parties ( often advertisers ) to encourage more use of the site and to generate more revenue . The privacy rights of consumers in their use of these sites is a patchwork of click-through—and rarely actually read—privacy policies , with scattered laws and regulations covering certain types of data .
The gateway to all of this information is the consumers ' ISPs , both their broadband provider and their cellular service provider . The ISPs generate data about network traffic , including websites visited ( even in “ incognito ” or “ private ” mode ) , applications used , the amount of time spent at particular sites , and in the case of cellular services , the customers ' location . Unlike websites that customers can choose whether to go to , or ones that allow them to make selections about privacy ( such as tightening privacy settings on social media sites , restricting or clearing cookies , or using a browser 's incognito or private mode ) , consumers must use their ISPs to access all of this information .
Choices , Transparency , and Security
The Wheeler proposal focuses on giving consumers a choice in what data the ISP uses and shares with third parties , transparency in providing clear descriptions about what information is being collected and how it is used , and security in protecting consumer data .
To achieve the first and second goals—consumer choice and transparency—the FCC would separate the use and sharing of information into three categories , with differing levels of consumer choice depending on the category . The first category would be data that is “ Inherent in [ the ] Customer Decision to Purchase ISP 's Services . … ” This would include basic billing information , email and IP addresses associated with the account , and basic data involving use , such as bandwidth and streaming practices , etc . The broadband company would be empowered to use that information for its own internal purposes without additional consent . This would include billing as well as data packet and email delivery activities , but it could also include promotions for new services such as increased or faster bandwidth by the carrier itself . It would not include the sharing of this data with others .
The second category would cover the use of data for marketing “ other communications-related services ” and sharing data with “ affiliates that provide communications-related services . … ” This might encourage customers to “ bundle ” the various services of the provider . For this use of consumer data , the ISP would have to provide customers with an affirmative opt-out mechanism so they can deny the ISP the ability to use information for those purposes . Opt-out clauses are not uncommon in privacy policies and are considered friendlier to the company , because many consumers will not exercise their opt-out rights ; yet those who are interested or concerned enough can choose to protect their information by opting out .
The third ( and broadest ) category would be “ all other uses and sharing of consumer data ” and would require an affirmative opt-in from customers before the ISP could use the data beyond internal and affiliate marketing use . This would include sharing information with advertisers , app operators , online stores such as Amazon or eBay , or similar third parties . Opt-in clauses are considered less friendly to the company , because they automatically restrict the use of information absent an affirmative decision by consumers to allow it . In many cases , the use of this information is more in the company 's interest than consumers ' , so making a case to consumers to affirmatively allow the company to use their data is often an uphill battle .
The Wheeler proposal will also impose new requirements on broadband providers to secure consumer information . Among these are stronger authentication requirements and better risk management practices . Additionally , ISPs would have to “ take responsibility for [ the ] use and protection of customer information when shared with third parties. ” This could include restrictions that would limit the third party 's ability to further share the data . The FCC would impose affirmative obligations to provide notice to consumers of any data breach no more than 10 days after its discovery , and to inform the FCC , the FBI , and the Secret Service of breaches involving more than 5,000 customers within 7 days of their discovery .
Reactions to the Proposal
Not surprisingly , initial reaction to the proposal is mixed . Privacy advocates strongly support it : The New York Times quotes one privacy advocate who describes it as “ a historic moment ” that will “ allow an individual to have real control over how their information can be gathered and used. ” An executive for Public Knowledge , a well-known consumer advocacy and privacy group , tells The Christian Science Monitor that “ it certainly makes sense to have the FCC apply its expertise to this area . ”
ISPs and broadband providers are quite critical of the proposals . AT & T asserts that existing privacy policies already do an effective job of protecting consumer privacy and that ISPs are “ mischaracterized ” as having no access to data , although the level of data they collect is more limited than that collected by Google , Facebook , and other internet companies . According to The Washington Post , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) already heavily regulates privacy in the internet space , but it “ has only a limited ability to establish new rules . … ” Verizon says that any FCC rules should remain consistent with those of the FTC .
The Wheeler proposal will go before the FCC on March 31 , 2016 . If the commission approves the proposal , it will be formally adopted as a proposed rule and will be submitted for a period of public comment . If the initial reactions at both ends of the spectrum are any indication , there will be a lot of comments . FYI : Any citizen is allowed to submit comments on this or any other federal proposed rule via the federal government 's Regulations.gov .

TARGETING China 's rapidly emerging middle class rather than traditional group tours , has helped Australia attract more than a million Chinese visitors in a year .
The tourism milestone was revealed in the Australian Bureau of Statistics ' overseas arrivals data for the 12-months to November which showed a 22 per cent growth in short term visitors from China to 1,001,200 .
The massive growth has made China the country 's most valuable tourist market , worth an incredible $ 7.7 billion a year , and the second largest source of visitors after New Zealand .
Tourism Australia Managing Director John O'Sullivan said the million visitor milestone was the result of an aggressive strategy to move away from traditional group tours and target China 's booming middle class .
“ Our marketing , distribution and partnership strategies are all now geared towards targeting this new breed of young , independent travellers with the desire and the financial means to explore our country , ” said Mr O'Sullivan .
“ That 's where we 're focusing our resources and I 'm delighted to say that is what is driving these impressive results . ”
Federal Tourism Minister Richard Colbeck said China was “ vitally important for Australia 's tourism industry growth ” .
“ Visitor arrivals from China grew three times faster than the overall increase in the past year , and spending increased 43 per cent – double the previous year 's growth rate , ” said Minister Colbeck .
State-by-state , Victoria scored the biggest growth in overseas arrivals in November , with figures up 17 per cent on the same time last year .
Tasmania and New South Wales also achieved double digit growth in international visitors of 13.5 per cent and 10.9 per cent respectively .
Queensland 's share of the overseas visitor market improved 5.2 per cent , South Australia 's 8.2 per cent and Western Australia 4.1 per cent .
Mr O'Sullivan said those Australian tourism businesses which understood and were willing to adapt to the needs of Chinese visitors would derive the biggest benefits .
Chief Operating Officer at Accor Hotels , Simon McGrath said they had worked hard to make Chinese visitors feel welcome and comfortable with touches such as language translations , cultural training for staff and even mini-bar additions like green tea and dry noodles .
“ Every key destination around the world is seeking Chinese travellers , ” said Mr McGrath , who revealed one in eight Chinese tourists now stayed at an Accor property .
“ They want to know they 're welcome , they 're not being treated as a vast group of people but as individuals , and they want safety and security . ”
Sydney Bridgeclimb spokeswoman Charli Beale said they began a Mandarin-speaking tour in 2013 and bookings had increased 50 per cent .
“ We recognise the significance of the Chinese market , and we 're doing everything we can to make Bridgeclimb appealing , ” said Ms Beale .
“ For Chinese New Year from February 1 to 21 we 'll be doing a karaoke climb with a microphone and two screens on top of the bridge . ”
Sir Mix-a-Lot 's got Blake Lively 's back .
Days after the actress created an Internet firestorm for referencing the rapper 's lyrics to “ Baby Got Back ” in an Instagram post , the 52-year-old artist felt that Lively was recognizing the evolving standards of beauty .
“ For her to look at her butt and that little waist and to say , ‘ L.A . face with an Oakland booty , ' does n't mean that the norm has changed , that the beautiful people have accepted our idea of beautiful ? That 's the way I took it , ” Sir Mix-a-Lot shared with Pret-a-Reporter .
While online critics were quick to slam Lively , 28 , for using the lyric in a racially insensitive manner , the musician does n't see it that way .
“ Now let me do this , as far as the critics are concerned : I do n't want to come off like , ‘ Oh , he 's an Uncle Tom , ' because I 'm not , ” Sir Mix-a-Lot explained . “ If what Blake Lively meant by that comment was , ‘ Oh my goodness , I 've gained weight , I look horrible , ' if that 's what she meant — and I doubt that she did — then I 'm with the critics .
“ But no one in the world is gon na tell me that a woman wears that dress is thinking that she 's fat . No , I 'm sorry , it just does n't happen . It sounds like to me like she was giving the line props . ”
Sir Mix-a-Lot also noted that this incident opens the door for a much larger conversation .
“ I think she 's saying , ‘ I 've got that Oakland booty , ' or ‘ I 'm trying to get it . ' I think we have to be careful what we wish for as African-Americans , because if you say she does n't have the right to say that , then how do you expect her at the same time to embrace your beauty ? I mean , I do n't get it , ” Sir Mix-a-Lot said . “ I think it 's almost a nod of approval , and that was what I wanted . I wanted our idea of beautiful to be accepted .
“ That 's my thing . I 'm not telling people what they can like and not like . That song was written with African-American women in mind , but trust me when I tell you that there are women out there with those curves everywhere , and they were once considered fat . And that 's what the song was about . It was n't about some race battle , ” he added .
This article originally appeared in the New York Post 's Page Six .
A couple of months ago , Runner 's World magazine published an article entitled , “ Less is More. ” The essence of the article was about a guy who followed the basic Hanson 's marathon schedule and achieved success with it . I read the article , which we really had nothing to do with , and was left feeling a little frustrated . The dozens of emails that we received afterwards , furthered my frustration . Not with the readers of the article , but with the author of that article . I feel like it is misleading . From the title alone , it suggests that you can run a marathon on less training , particularly the long run . For the purpose of simplicity , let 's begin with the long run and where the 16 mile long run came to be .
I want to begin this discussion by pointing out that the 16 mile length is not a magic bullet , not is the 20 mile distance . Somewhere along the last 40-50 years , the 20 miler was deemed a necessity for marathon success . It probably comes from the idea that most people tend to “ bonk ” at 20 miles . That still leads to the question , “ Why do we use 16 mile long runs in our training programs ? ” To that question , there are several answers . Let 's examine them .
The Time Factor : By this I am talking about time on your feet . Research has shown that there are two critical time thresholds for enhancing aerobic fitness at the cellular level . The first is 30 minutes and the second is 90 minutes . Since we are talking about long runs , 90 minutes seems to be a good introductory time frame . Research also shows that after 3 hours of running , you have crossed the point of diminishing returns . What I mean by that , is the structural damage to your muscles , along with fuel depletion , that you are going to have to take several days to recover from a singular run . Take a look at this chart :
Per Mile 16 miles 20 miles 7:00 min/mile 1 hr 52 mins 2 hrs 20 mins 8:00 min/mile 2 hrs 8 mins 2 hrs 40 mins 9:00 min/mile 2 hrs 24 mins 3 hrs 00 mins 10:00 min/mile 2 hrs 40 mins 3 hrs 20 mins 11:00 min/mile 2 hrs 56 mins 3 hrs 40 mins 12:00 min/mile 3 hrs 12 mins 4 hrs 00 mins
Table 1 : Total time a 16 and 20 mile long runs would take for common long run paces .
The point here is that there has to be a delicate balance between optimal aerobic development and avoiding significant structural damage . Too little of a long run and you do n't stimulate the proper adaptations . Too long of a run and you have to take too much time to recover from one singular training run . This takes away from other valuable training before and after the long run .
The Percentage Factor : When you look through popular coaching books , you will see that a long run will constitute 25-30 % of one 's weekly long run . However , when they get to the marathon sections of their books , they seem to abandon those basic training principles . In some programs you will see long runs constitute 50 % , or more , of the weekly mileage total .
There are a couple problems I see with this . The first is that it means a person is probably only running 3-4 days a week , counting the long run . This means that the mileage over the other days is very small- probably 3-5 miles over the other days . That is ok if a person wants to simply complete the act of finishing a marathon , but to me , it seems like the runner would want the best experience possible for such a grueling event .
Some people may argue that a longer long run will better prepare them . I will disagree . That completely goes against another basic training principle , which is balance in training . When you are focusing on one run a week , that 's not training . That is preparing every week for a single run that breaks you down so much that you need 3-5 days to recover from . There 's no continual adaptation occurring .
25 % 33 % 50 miles/week 12-13 miles 16-17 miles 60 miles/week 15 miles 19-20 miles 70 miles/week 17-18 miles 23 miles 80 miles/week 20 miles NA 90 miles/week 22-23 miles NA
Table 2 : Long run distance for marathon weekly mileage .
As you can see from the chart that when you look at basic long run principles , for the average person training for a marathon , a 20 mile long run falls outside from the basic principles . Now remember the time factor as well . You may be running 60 miles a week , but a 20 miler may take you 3:20 , while a 16 miler may take you 2:40 minutes . The 16 miler is a much better fit because it fits into the time frame sweet zone , as well as meets the percentage criteria .
Cumulative fatigue : The idea of cumulative fatigue centers around the long run . When you look at a lot of other training programs , there is also a primary focus on the long run . However , the idea of cumulative fatigue means that the runner is going into the long run slightly fatigued from the training during the previous days . It also means that training will resume as normal the days following the long run . There is n't a single day that is overly difficult for the runner , but every day is tough enough that there is n't a full recovery between all runs of major importance . In other words , the long run is literally in the middle of the training cycle , not the end of the training cycle ( weekly ) .
Putting it all together : So , with the information presented , it becomes clear that it 's not the 16 miles that is the magic number and it 's not 20 miles . It 's what works based on the numbers . A long run needs to be in the sweet zone of time on your feet , but also within a reasonable percentage of training volume for the week . The reason we use the 16 mile run in the clinics and free schedules is that it fits with the mileage that our runners are hitting and the paces that they are running . The long run provides the training stimulus needed for marathon training , but also provides enough freedom to engage in runs that are just as important for marathon training during the rest of the week .
I know that the next question will be , “ Well how fast do I run my long runs ? ” That is a topic for another blog and I will try to address it .
Starbound is a procedurally-generated universe , where you have a ship , a star-map , and an infinite number of planets to visit and plunder . It is a game that makes almost no definition between single and multiplayer , allowing you to bring your character across the void and back again , visiting the same places online and offline , and sharing those worlds with friends . Its first beta just welcomed weary travelers , and though it is missing a framework that would make it an easier game to follow , the foundation is strong . I 've spent the weekend exploring the stars .
My friend Owen lives in Stockholm , so we play lots and lots of games together online . He is a lovely man and everyone should have an Owen in their life . We unlocked Starbound on Steam at the same time , before roping in another of Owen 's friends , Eld , and going on an adventure . That 's us asleep up there . I love that screenshot .
It says a lot about a game that it 'll enable three grown men to have a restorative slumber in a basement carved out of an alien world . We landed there after we 'd all gathering on Owen 's ship . Each player has their own craft , and if you 're in a party together you can pay visits to each person 's space-abode . The ship can fulfil a multitude of tasks – it can be a backpack , carrying your collected items ( weapons , tools , decorative items ) from planet-to-planet and it can be a showcase of your adventures , a decorated missile of loot . It can also serve as a meeting point , a place for players to transport themselves and then beam down onto the planet the ship is currently orbiting to meet up with chums .
That 's what we did . Owen had parked over a forest planet , though it had giant plants where trees ( and more importantly wood ) should be . There are no classes in Starbound but there are races , and so it was that a robot with an exposed brain , a totally hot redhead human ( that 's me ! ) , and a guy with purple hair all moved in together . Eld immediately began creating a house from wood that he 'd already scavenged from another planet , drawing out lines on the land that would become walls and floors , then adding a backdrop of planks . Suddenly , we had a home .
Owen and I were still trying to peel back the game 's foil : you begin with a matter manipulation device , which is basically a tool for placing items in and removing them from the world . A few quests , picked up by clicking an exclamation mark on the right of the screen , taught us the basics : how to make a crafting table so we could eventually create tools and more ( much much more ) , and how to hunt and gather meat . Events escalate quickly . The first step asks players to collect an item from a locker and the sixth has them calling down an alien invasion of level 10 creatures that will ultimately unlock the rest of the map . It 's a bit messy , the opening , and for a game as large as this , with so many potential experiences for the player , it risks leaving people a bit lost . It 's the “ what does this button do , what does that mean , why are there levelled creatures when I ca n't level myself ? ” kind of lost , in addition to the “ what sort of things is down this hole ? ” lost .
As Eld crafted a home , Owen and I excavated . We hunted beneath the house for interesting things , including ores , creatures , pixel pods ( little capsules containing the game 's currency ) . We did n't last long underground . Your character starts with a flashlight , and although we took turns to keep the way lit for one another , it was clear that we needed torches we could place to keep the route lit . Crafting torches requires wood and the planet , apparently , did not have any . However , we returned to the surface to discover a lovely house , with beds and even a fire , roaring away against the night to keep the cold away . Yeah , when it gets dark you need to stay warm or you 'll eventually freeze to death . That Eld 's a keeper .
We picked a direction and started to walk . There are creatures in Starbound 's world , and they are either hostile or friendly , and there are both animals and NPCs . The animals are basically fodder – aggressive mobs will attack on sight , while friendlies will simply totter about . The area of aggro is pretty low , so you wo n't always know whether a creature is friendly before you 're in striking distance , and it 's possible to whack the friendly mobs , accidentally or otherwise , turning them against you . Ground forces tend to run and jump , and I struck lucky fairly early on when I found a Legendary weapon that spits out explosive bones and has a speedy swing – most ground attacks are easily resolved with it .
More interesting attacks come from above . There are birds that drop bombs , spit out electrical charges and attempt to freeze you , though they 're pretty easy to avoid . You can even knock enemies out using walls . I 've yet to have a really satisfying fight in Starbound though . Combat feels functional and pretty robotic , only serving to slow the player down in dungeons and give them something to do while exploring above ground . Even with a mixture of diverse weapons , it 's the sort of combat you try to find a quick escape from and continue to do so .
But fighting was never the point for me . I just wanted to see things . This planet , a place of toxic ponds and giant plants , was interesting enough , but I died and returned to our little house , leaving Owen to continue on . Eld noticed that we needed more wood to make anything of the game we were in and suggested we move on . I agreed , but Owen interrupted , Welshly : “ You 're not going to believe what I found guys : a sci-fi underground prison ! ”
And he was n't just being Owen–who operates with a level of childlike wonder that would shame Spielberg–he had found a dungeon , and he 'd found it in the most Owen way possible , by falling in a hole and spotted it under the ground . We started to dig . At this stage we 'd found a tree ( it turns out that a single planet can have different kinds of forests ) and crafted some picks to help with the digging – the matter manipulator is slow going , and discovering that there are upgradeable tools to help you hoe , dig , and chop really sped our prison break-in along .
The dungeon was a vast facility , dedicated to some sort of techno-ape society . We started wandering through the eerie and empty world before we made a discovery – we could take anything we liked . The world is full of objects that you can pick up , mostly for decorative purposes . Like the kids from The Goonies , we grabbed everything : we pulled tiles from walls , we yanked lights and TV screens , posters and beds . Things you might do little more than glance at , insignificant little details , are placed for you to loot should you so wish . To help you understand how much you can pick up , I 've circled everything ( from a different world , in an ape city I found ) in this screenshot that 's yours to collect . Clicky .
That is both a joke and the truth . We could even grab the parts that made up the electrified walls . The entire building is a jumping puzzle made of loot , and by the time we reached the end to find a small chest with a blueprint in it , we had so much stuff that we could have built a mini-techno dungeon of our own . Elsewhere , in worlds away from this place , I have found gongs , plasma discs , prison entrance signs , brains in jars , an anchor , statues , bookcases . I 've found these things in all manner of places , from a medieval robot village to a prison that 's been taken over by the prisoners .
Just knowing there 's that stuff out there has been a hell of a draw for me . When Owen and others are n't online ( and there 's no easy way to check in-game , stupidly ) I 'll just go off on my own . I had to stop at one world because I 'd used up all of my ship 's fuel ( wood or coal ) , and I found a dungeon guarded by a wheelchair-bound ape with a raygun . The reward for completing that dungeon was a double-jump ability . Sometimes , you 'll only find blocks , pixels and ore , but if you 're digging with friends , working together to adventure deeper and deeper till the warm glow of lava tells you you 've hit bottom , even that 's good enough .
And if you 're on your own , you get to see things like this .
Which is just lovely . Here , have another screenshot just because I like it .
And there are the little details that ca n't be screenshotted , like the music dipping when you enter water , the way fish chase spilled pixels in the water , or the fact that rain makes your character colder . It 's comforting to be part of a world where everything feels like it has attention ( or is going to be attended to , according to some of the missing item texts ) . Starbound 's pretty enough and witty enough that the technical hitches do n't really bother me . And what 's there is already in flux – levelling is going to be explained and simplified greatly in a coming patch , and there 's no story yet . That 'll be coming in an update . I 'd hope they 'll also focus on a better friends system , because that 's what I think it needs . The current server solution is good , and Owen easily hosted our game on his home machine , but it needs a more robust method of creation , bookmarking , and helping in-game friends to connect . If Chucklefish do that , Starbound will keep me coming back for months .

One big reason agribusiness interests and the trapping lobby are pushing for Amendment 71 is because The HSUS banned the use of steel-jawed leghold traps and snares in the state 20 years ago through a constitutional amendment . Photo by Dick Randall
Special interest groups and some Colorado politicians have crafted a constitutional amendment , Amendment 71 , that masquerades as an election reform proposal but really amounts to an attack on the voting rights of the citizenry . If approved , it will disable future efforts to advance animal welfare and conservation reforms in Colorado through the initiative process . It should be lumped into the same category as other constitutional amendments being promoted by special interest groups arrayed against us — measures like the outrageous State Question 777 , which seeks to create a “ right to farm ” in Oklahoma and prevent any future local or state regulations to govern agricultural practices .
For years , our opponents have tried to make the ballot initiative process unworkable , either by increasing signature gathering requirements to make it impossible to qualify a measure for the ballot or by creating a supermajority standard for passage that is virtually impossible to reach . In Utah , for example , the trophy hunting lobby and the trappers some years ago did succeed in requiring a two-thirds vote of the people to pass any wildlife protection measure ; but , we defeated similar measures in Alaska and Arizona . In Oklahoma , also some years ago , we defeated a measure to double the number of signatures needed for an animal welfare measure .
Amendment 71 combines the worst elements of these measures – by adding in a distribution requirement for signature gathering ( stipulating that a petition drive draw a substantial number of signatures from every state senate district ) and requiring a supermajority standard for passing a constitutional amendment ( 55 percent ) .
Amendment 71 would make it virtually impossible for grassroots groups like The HSUS to qualify and pass any future constitutional ballot measures to help animals . In fact , one big reason that agribusiness interests and the trapping lobby are pushing for Amendment 71 is because we banned the use of steel-jawed leghold traps and snares in the state 20 years ago through a constitutional amendment . They 've been wanting to overturn that ballot measure ever since , and Amendment 71 is their latest maneuver to go down that path .
If voters adopt Amendment 71 , the only entities that could qualify a constitutional ballot measure would be monied interests who could hire signature gatherers and pay for them to get signatures in every corner of the state . It 's documented in the campaign finance reports for the Yes on 71 campaigns that the oil and gas industry is funding the measure to the tune of millions of dollars , and the state 's Democratic governor is helping to front for them . They do n't want to see a ballot initiative to restrict fracking in the state . But the factory farming industry and the trapping lobby are also pushing the measure . They do n't want The HSUS and other animal welfare groups to advance a ballot measure in the state , and this is their way of getting there .
Normally , we have no quarrels with advancing a citizen initiative to amend a statute ( as compared to a constitutional amendment ) . But when we advanced a ballot measure in Colorado more than two decades ago to stop spring bear hunting and the unsporting and reckless practices of bear baiting and hounding , lawmakers immediately tried to overturn it , even though we got an astonishing 70 percent of the vote . Still , some lawmakers aligned with the trophy hunting and agribusiness industry , and defying the mandate of the voters in their own districts , tried to overturn it . That 's why , when we took on commercial trapping with steel-jawed traps and snares four years later , we opted for a constitutional amendment , so we could protect against a knee-jerk , ideologically based override effort by lawmakers . And to top it off we continue to see the legislature year after year – and as recently as this past session – try to overturn the ban on spring bear hunting and reckless methods to kill bears .
If it 's okay for a politician to be elected with a simple majority or even a plurality , it 's okay for an initiative to be approved by a simple majority – rather than a supermajority . Many of the biggest gains in the movement – along with important gains for conservation , voting rights , taxpayer rights , and so many other important civil society reforms – have come through the ballot initiative process . In fact , a women 's suffrage constitutional amendment passed in Colorado with 54.7 percent of the vote in the early part of the 20th century . If Amendment 71 had been in place , that voting rights measure for women would have been defeated . We must protect this process if we want to protect our ability to advance reforms .
There is a growing left-center-right coalition opposing Amendment 71 , from the American Civil Liberties Union , Common Cause , and NARAL on the left to the Independence Institute , Colorado Shooting Association , and Colorado Right-to-Life on the right . They all care about the erosion of citizen power . Many of the state 's leading papers have also panned the measure :
“ Paying for a signature gathering effort in 35 districts across the state , and defending signature challenges in all of those districts , would easily render the cost of presenting a ballot unaffordable to all but the wealthiest of campaigns , ” wrote the Denver Post . “ Amendment 71 would only undermine the critical power of untouchable legislation held by voters to protect themselves from partisan scams . This is no time to surrender that power…only questions asked by the oil industry and big interests , such as those funded by the Koch Brothers , big labor unions and others , would ever see Election Day… , ” opined the Aurora Daily Sentinel . The Greeley Tribune wrote : “ …the backers of Amendment 71 have n't applied these new , tougher standards to themselves . They could have easily written into the language of this measure that for it to take effect it would need at least 55 percent of the vote . They did n't . Nor did they reach their own bar for signature gathering … it 's likely the only groups that could afford to reach such a high bar are those funded by out-of-state special interest groups that want to use Colorado for one of their pet projects. ” And the Boulder Daily Camera said , “ Adoption of Amendment 71 would allow the oil and gas industry to checkmate Colorado environmental interests… Aside from civil disobedience , the only remaining alternative for community and environmental groups is pursuing the initiative process to win back local control over land-use decisions . ”
Amendment 71 is a power grab . Let 's defeat it , and give them a real lesson on direct democracy .
Apple appears to have discontinued the iPad Smart Cases and Smart Covers designed to fit the second , third , and fourth-generation iPads.As noted by iLounge , Apple 's Online Store is no longer offering the products online for shipping , but there are a limited number of cases and covers ( in dark gray ) that can be ordered for in store pickup . It is possible that retail stores may also have other colors as well , but the covers and cases for the older iPads can no longer be obtained online and will have a limited lifespan in stores too.While it makes sense to discontinue the older varieties of Smart Cases and Covers to prevent customers from confusing them with the newer options developed for the iPad mini and the iPad Air , it is an odd move considering Apple still sells the iPad 2 to customers . The iPad 2 can only be used with a traditional Smart Cover or Smart Case , and is incompatible with the newly released iPad Air accessories.Though Apple is no longer selling Smart Covers and Cases for the iPad 2 and other now-discontinued iPads , it does still list a number of third party options on its website . Currently , the remaining in-store Smart Cases are selling for $ 49 , while the Smart Covers are available for $ 39.Apple is no longer listing the older Smart Covers as discontinued and is now offering them both in-store and shipped .
As thousands in Khartoum , Sudan , and surrounding areas took the streets at the end of September and Twitter blew up under the hashtag # SudanRevolts , I waited patiently for Western media to catch up . When it finally addressed that something was happening in Sudan , their message was clear : “ Amidst Riots , President Bashir wo n't be attending the UN conference. ” read one headline . I probably should n't have been surprised . Even though the same media had been enthralled by the mass protests in Egypt , Turkey , Brazil , Greece , and Spain ; Sudan 's mass protests received three short paragraphs , focused on their effects on the nation 's president , with “ Riots ” in the headline .
I 've been to protests In Istanbul and Greece . I 've seen windows smashed , graffiti drawn , Molotovs prepared , and things set alight . Still , the situations where lighter skinned people were filling the photographs : protests . When darker skinned people are involved ? Riots . The decision to call one riots and the other protests has nothing to do with the amount of violence in the demonstrations . Violence is a realistic factor , and sometimes , a tactic , in all of these protests . Resisting is never peaceful . If the State fears you , it will crack down on you violently , despite your kumbaya circle .
Protesters ' natural response to a State 's violent crackdown ( usually police brutality ) is self-defense . The self-defense is often barricades — blocking the police from getting to the crowd of people . Barricades can be formed with large objects , fires , or human beings . Those on the front lines can use their bodies as buffers between the police and the rest of the crowd , stopping the police from getting to the masses . Rocks may be thrown at the police to push them back . In the face of police brutality , without self-defense , a protest usually can not survive .
With the destruction of property , violence can turn from an aspect of self-defense to a useful offensive tactic . Nothing gets the attention of the elite like taking away or destroying what they value above all else : property . In America , property is racial . It always has been . Consider the racist violence which stretches from slavery to lynching to the ongoing extrajudicial killings of black men and women . For 300 years , the very idea of a black person 's freedom was a direct threat to white men 's property . After slavery , lynchings were often targeted at blacks who had gained relative wealth and therefore , challenged the wealth and property of white men . This year , George Zimmerman was found not guilty for killing an unarmed black child-who he assumed was breaking into homes in his gated , white community , or threatening the property of his white neighborhood . When property is destroyed by black protesters , it must always be understood in the context of the historical racialization of property . When the same system that refuses to protect black children comes out to protect windows , what is valued over black people in America becomes very clear .
One can not discuss the immorality of damaging property without devaluing the rage that brought protesters to this point . You , too , have to decide which one you value more : human life or property . As Vinz so eloquently says in the film La Haine , when rage spills into the streets after a brutal police beating left a young man from the ghetto on life support : “ A homeboy 's dying ; fuck your car . ”
In Sudan , where IMF-backed austerity measures have hiked gas prices so high that the average person ca n't afford to get to work or eat a basic meal , destroying gas stations and signs of wealth has an obvious symbolic significance . Forcing the question once more , who do you answer to : starved citizens or a fancy building ?
But for the darker skinned ( Africans and Blacks in the Diaspora ) , the violence of a few always represents the actions of the whole . In fact , it is our entire colonized history in a nutshell . For us , there is no nuance . No acknowledgement that in a group of thousands , a handful of people decided to break a window . Compare this to Greece , where media takes the time to emphasize that “ 99 percent of the protests in Greece are completely peaceful . ”
To say that what 's happening in Greece or Istanbul are protests that involve violence is to say that they are fighting non-peacefully for a greater cause . This is , from what I saw , true . But to diminish Sudan 's protests as “ riots ” because of their violence is to say the people protesting are violent beings absent of complex thinking and tactical strategies . In short , it 's racist .
The term “ riot ” implies disorganization , running amok with no end means , goals or demands outside of individual gain . Rioting implies you 're not on the streets for a greater cause or a greater advancement . It implies you 're more interested in looting a store for a television than breaking and taking property as a subversive act . It reproduces the racist claims about black subjects : that they are violent , ignorant , selfish , and depoliticized .
Many on the left called the predominantly black 2011 London uprisings a “ consumer riot , ” arguing that they were not a moment of resistance but a reflection of greed run amok . Breaking and taking property happens in pairs . Since the elite detest both , they are equally effective . But for black protests , it 's easy for others to fixate their colonial gaze and forget the breaking aspect while focusing in on the looting since , you know , black people steal . The historical context is , of course , conveniently ignored . Since colonization and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade , white wealth has been and continues to be built off the backs of black labor , off the exploitation of African resources and bodies . But wait for the courts to grant reparations , and remain waiting . Looting is the opposite of apolitical ; it is a direct redistribution of wealth . And yet , even on the left , when a black or African protester destroys and takes property , they are stripped of the tactical or historical will inherent in the decision . It is instead understood through the colonial conception of the political backwardness of black communities : they become apolitical rioters , pure and simple .
The media 's method is clear with regards to African resistance : quietly declare the demonstrations “ riots ” and then move on to the next piece of news . No more than three paragraphs , if that . No nuance , no debate , no critical thinking so that it is an easy argument to make when the state puts rioters down like one would a rabid dog . Like in Newark , 1967 , where the National Guard occupied the city , complete with snipers on rooftops that shot and killed black people for looting , or running , or coming out of their homes . Or in Sudan , where police forces opened live ammunition on demonstrations and killed over 200 people in a week . State-sanctioned killing and military force is all of a sudden a “ complicated ” issue where there is no clear “ good ” side . Yet , while one group is destroying property , the other group is murdering human beings . When oppression from the state breeds outrage that is then silenced with state murder , how do we respond ? Do we internalize and blame ourselves or are we persistent in our refusal to back down ? At times some say protesters are “ provoking ” the police based on their tactics but how do we equate people destroying property to the state mass murdering its people ? Why is property on the same level as living , and breathing human beings ? When the state kills , we must ask ourselves how we got to the point where the blame is on anyone but the state and its actors .
Throughout the 20th century , the KKK and white rioters destroyed massive swaths of black property , not to mention murdering black people , usually with implicit or actual state support . More recently , the Greek Neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn would go into immigrant neighborhoods in Athens and destroy their stalls and storefronts ( and also , murder immigrants ) , with little state resistance ( indeed , many Athenian police are Golden Dawn supporters ) . The destruction of property is a red herring , used to divert attention from the fact that it is the goals , not the methods , of the protests that the media and the state object to .

“ Nobody in the world , nobody in history , has ever gotten their freedom by appealing to the moral sense of the people who were oppressing them. ” -Assata Shakur
Most resistance is nonviolent , but those who choose to be nonviolent should not dismiss or distance themselves from others who use violence strategically . When demanding change , all tactics must be brought to the table . Selective historians consider this unnecessary ; they will use the Civil Rights Movement 's nonviolent resistance as an example . They will demand that you stand perfectly still as you get sprayed by water hoses and attacked by police dogs . They 'll conveniently forget to mention that while MLK was leading non-violent resistance in the form of sit-ins and marches , “ riots ” were raging through America 's black ghettos . It was the potential for more riots , like those that exploded in Birmingham in 1963 as the freedom riders campaign grew increasingly resistant to police violence , that had Robert Kennedy convincing his brother to pass Civil Rights legislation , lest the whole country follow suit .
In a world where blacks are forced to wear their perceived violence on their skin , many will see violent tactics as moving backwards . Some will caution the masses against using violence towards property as a tactic . They will ask everyone to stay calm and collected . Pay attention to where they are yelling from ( their luxury apartment , perhaps ) . The State and the elite are counting on this : the notion that all ( black ) violence is uncivilized or barbaric . But what is more realistically threatening than “ moving backwards ” is staying right where we are . In a society where black people are always-already guilty , pleading for change instead of demanding it will do just that .
Trying to change tactics in a desperate attempt to fit the media 's narrative is not an option , because the media 's narrative always ends with the world fundamentally unchanged . The media is obsessed with protests that receive a large scale of police brutality and at the same time , uncompromising in the idea that protesters must be “ peaceful ” by all means necessary . It 's pretty obvious that one can not both defend themselves and fit this accepted profile . It 's almost as obvious that one can barely survive— both individually and as a movement— and fit this profile . The state kills us ; the media wants us silent .
All this begs the question : Is mainstream media needed ? Do we need its support ? Despite media 's non-coverage , when the government in Sudan realized protesters were n't going home after a week ( despite the threat of death from live ammunition ) , they first promised they would give cash out to needy families and raise salaries . This , of course , did n't stop the protests . When people still did n't go home the government then arrested and detained 800 activists and journalists . This crackdown-generosity-crackdown vacillation is a tactic often used by the state when those in the streets have a chance of winning .
Instead , in order to win support , we should look no further than our communities . Protesting , after all , is just one form of resistance . When thousands are n't out on the streets ( or preferably , while thousands are out on the streets ) , we should be working on building and existing in the type of world we 'd like to see . Our communities should always be at the forefront of our minds . So these questions must always be asked : Which windows are being broken ? Who are we hurting ? What exactly are we destroying ?

There was a great moment in Istanbul that happened over and over again . Police would shoot tear gas canisters into a crowd of people . People would panic and start running . To escape the gas , they would duck into a nearby building , all the while coughing , spitting , eyes watering . Ten minutes later , with lingering tear gas still in the air , the crowd would re-emerge , smiles wide and looks that said , “ we 're still here. ” They would start moving forward , chanting louder , clapping in rhythm .
It 's no wonder that shooting protesters dead in Sudan only resulted in more people out on the streets . After being detained , beaten , tortured and threatened with rape by security forces in Sudan , Rania Mamoun said , “ Some experiences strengthen you , while others break you . When you 're beaten to a pulp , your dignity is assaulted , your safety compromised , your freedom stolen , there is only one way forward – to continue what others initiated . There is no return , we can only go ahead , and that 's what they do not know . Your beating and your torture do not frighten me nor break me . It will not force me to retreat…You ask me : Are you not afraid ? And I say : I 've become stronger . ”
When our bodies are beaten and dismissed , our survival is dependent on our persistence . We do n't need the mainstream media ; instead , we should recognize that the media is a part of what we 're up against : the dismissal of our dead bodies , the excuses for the hands that kill us .
So I 've had several very illuminating conversations about spirituality with people over the last month or so .
I call myself a spiritual person , though I do n't like the word because of the religious connotations , because I can not find a better word to describe the sense of awe of wonder and adoration I feel when I think about the universe .
Or when I look at the sky on a starry night . I stare and I think , “ I am so small . ”
Even when the stars are n't out , I feel that way . On cloudy nights , as the stars blink between patches of billowy cloud and midnight sky , I think , “ There is a whole universe in that black patch of nothing at which I 'm staring. ” And I feel this indescribable feeling ( which I shall now attempt to describe ) of connectedness , of self-awareness of myself within the cosmos–which I personally find it 's difficult to lose sight of on a day-to-day basis as we run around doing this or that . I close my eyes and imagine reality , that I am on Earth , orbiting around what could be called a big ball of fire in our solar system , which is part of a galaxy called the Milky-way . That in turn , is just one of many , many , many galaxies . And this is our universe , which could be one of many others .
That to me , that wonder , is the essence of being human .
But the word spirituality scares atheists away sometimes , not always . Admittedly even I hesitate to use it . But then again , I use the word God all the time and even “ goodness ” which is derived from that word without a blink of the eye . Yet , in my opinion , by what I have just described , we are all spiritual people in some way or another .
Do n't get me wrong , I do n't believe there is a thing inside of us called a “ Spirit ” which is transcendent . Instead I think spirituality is very natural , very Earthly . What it stems from–the desire for knowledge and wonder–is what makes us human . It makes us unique to this world and maybe even to this Universe as a whole .
I do n't think I got that quite right though . Here is a video I find particularly effective at attempting to tackle this :
Also , I 'm getting hundreds of reads ; D. Thanks for dropping by and if you want , leave a comment and subscribe . You could always just say , “ I liked it ” or “ I hated it , die ! ”

The Path to Dijkstra 's Handwriting
Follow Up
Read my follow-up blog post from Oct 2017 about how I received an email from Edsger Dijkstra 's son .
My handwriting used to be terrible . I think I got to a point in fourth grade where it just stopped getting better unlike most people . It did n't bother me either . It was still semi-legible to others and perfectly readable to myself .
My letters lacked consistency . Things were n't spaced very well and it just looked messy . I have no idea how my professors put up with it .
Inspiration
I 've mentioned why I 've admired Dijkstra before , but I 've read some of his EWDs and really liked his handwriting . Here 's a sample of what his handwriting looked like . This was taken from his EWD called On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science ( pdf ) :
The first thing that I noticed when I saw it was just how simple and neat it is . I 'm not calligrapher by any means , but the letters just fit together well and flow nicely .
I came across a comment on Reddit by someone that had Dijkstra as a professor . Here 's what it said :
I 've always had horrible handwriting . When I was a computer science student I was in a class taught by Edsger Dijkstra . During the class he asked us to occasionally turn in our notes , because he wanted to see what we thought was important . The final was an oral final and after going through a few questions to his satisfaction he said “ You seem competent , but your handwriting is horrible… ” The remaining 30 mins of my final exam by Dijkstra was me writing phrases repeatedly on a pad of paper while he said , ‘ no , you need to round the o 's a bit more , the A is misformed , etc… ' . It was surreal . I 'm sad he died .
Dijkstra seemed like a really caring professor . When I read this comment , I put it in the back of my head in case I ever wanted to improve my handwriting . It was n't until the summer of 2011 that I decided to spend some time to refine my handwriting so that it looked similar to Dijkstra 's .
The Process
The first thing that I wanted to do was just develop the muscles around my hand that helped with consistency and spacing . I did some Googling and came across a site that had a few exercises .
The basic idea is to repeat the exercises over and over until the marks start to look really , really good . I went through pages and pages in a notebook repeating the exercises until my hand was numb . Whenever I had some free time , I 'd just take out the notebook and continue practicing . Eventually my lines and loops got very consistent .
Next I found an image of the complete alphabet in Dijkstra 's handwriting by someone who turned his handwriting into a font . I printed it off and then used that to base my handwriting off of .
The next step was to write out the alphabet over and over again for a similar reason as the above exercises . If you do it long enough , eventually your letters will become more consistent over time and look a lot nicer .
Once again , I used up a ton of paper for this and did it whenever I was n't busy . Here are a couple pictures of a scrap of paper I was able to find .
Obviously it is n't perfect and I never want it to be . I only wanted to use it as a base and customize it from there . I tried to incorporate a few of my own differences over time .
The Result
After three months and a few notebooks later , I had a pretty nice and new handwriting . Curiously enough , it looked like a hybrid between my mom 's handwriting and Dijkstra 's .
Like I said , it is n't perfect and I can still tidy it up a bit but it certainly is better than where I started .
I rewrote the sample that I provided above in my own handwriting to compare it with Dijkstra 's . My script does n't flow as well as his and mine is a bit sharper in the lines . Still though , it is a lot better than what it was before .
Conclusion
The thing that I learned is that often someone 's handwriting is n't exactly “ bad ” , usually the person just does n't take the time to slow down and write things nicely . There are still sometimes when my handwriting becomes a bit sloppy during times when I 'm trying to write quickly like taking notes or taking a test . It is pretty inevitable . As long as I 'm not in a rush I 'm always able to write the way I learned to .

Eric Davies said the chainsaws were on site and the big trees were coming down . I said I 'd meet him right away . Where ? Bloor West , at the corner of Pacific . What trees ? The old-growth black oak , across from High Park . In what is surely the Toronto way , Daniels Corp. got permission from the Ontario Municipal Board to cut the big trees down in order to make way for condos .
Making way for condos : A tree being cut on Bloor St. across from High Park .
Never mind that the trees are important for the genetic diversity of the black oak savannah in the park . Never mind that the black oak savannah in the park is a wonder of nature on the continent . Never mind that this is nesting season . Eric is studying forestry at the University of Toronto . He is smarter about trees than anybody I know . He looked up as an urban lumberjack lopped off a limb ; the spray of sawdust was a pale spume in the air .

He said , “ You see the white of the wood ? That 's solid . You see the trunk ? There 's no rot , it 's solid to the middle. ” Birds flew overhead . The tree specialist for Daniels Corp. insists that these trees are landscape trees , perhaps 80 years old , not worth preserving at all . Other specialists , including Eric , insist that these oak are pioneer trees , likely 200 years old , and here before the houses . Eric said , “ I suggested taking a core from one of the trees to count the rings. ” That did n't happen .
He said , “ I suggested taking the leaves and comparing the genotype to the trees across the way. ” That did n't happen . You may guess why not .

The cries of the birds were drowned out by the chainsaws . I noticed two men in white hard hats standing around . I asked them if I could step inside and get a picture of the fallen trees . One of the men said , “ You need a hard hat and boots. ” I said , “ My boots are good ; lend me your hat. ” He said , “ You need to be certified. ” I said I grew up in northern Ontario ; I know about construction sites , and the cutting of trees . No . No . No . A man from the neighbourhood walked by and stopped to look . He said , “ Well , those old buildings that used to be there , they were in decrepit condition . But this is an extension of the park. ” He 's right . Eric said , “ This is the biggest missed opportunity I 've seen since I 've been here . They could have moved a few trees . They could have collected acorns. ” They did not . Councillor Doucette ?

I loved the trees so much . There was a petition ; nothing happened. ” I asked if I could look down at the site from her balcony . She took me up and apologized for the mess . Her place was spotless . Biljana said , “ My love for trees is huge . I feel a pain . I ca n't breathe. ” Alas , her balcony was not positioned for a good shot . When I went back down , I noticed a woman looking at the scene from a higher balcony . Lynn was just back from the airport . Her bags were still unpacked . She had been studying in England . She said , “ I could n't believe the trees were gone. ” You get the picture . Back on the ground Victor , another neighbour said , “ It 's no good , the cutting of trees . The trees are alive , like people. ” The saddest thing ? A songbird landed on a nearby wire , with a caterpillar dangling from its beak . Eric said , “ See that ? Birds tend not to fly with food in their beaks unless they are feeding their young. ” This , of course , is nesting season . The songbird was on its way to feed its young . It was looking for a tree , and for a nest that was no longer there . The nestlings would have been too young to fly from the chainsaws ; dead now , crushed . There was no study or inventory done of the diversity of bird , animal and insect life in and among those trees . And the songbird with the caterpillar in its beak flew above the site as if , by flying , its tree and its young would somehow reappear . There is a sign on hoarding around the site of the condos : “ Love Where You Live. ” Yeah , whatever . Joe Fiorito appears Monday , Wednesday and Friday . Email : jfiorito @ thestar.ca

In a statement , the family of the 52-year-old said her `` radiant and creative spirit '' would be sorely missed .
Mr Kennedy , a lawyer and radio host , is the nephew of President John F Kennedy and son of Senator Robert F Kennedy , both assassinated in the 1960s .
His marriage to the former Mary Richardson in 1994 , in a ceremony aboard a boat on the Hudson river , was his second .
'Always kind '
The couple had four children over the 16 years of their marriage before he filed for divorce in 2010 .

Mary Kennedy , an architect , had brushes with the law over drug and alcohol abuse , and was arrested twice for driving under the influence at about the time they separated .
`` We deeply regret the death of our beloved sister Mary , whose radiant and creative spirit will be sorely missed by those who loved her , '' the family said in a statement issued by lawyer Kerry Lawrence , who had represented Mary Kennedy in a drink-driving case .
`` Our heart goes out to her children who she loved without reservation . ''
A neighbour , Leslie Lampert , told the Associated Press news agency that Kennedy was `` community oriented '' and `` a lovely individual '' .
`` She was always kind in our presence . ''
Police confirmed a body had been found on the Kennedys ' property in Bedford , north of New York City , but would not release the name .
The incident was under investigation by the Bedford Police Department with assistance from the Westchester County Medical Examiner 's Office . An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday .
US broadcaster ABC News cited a family member and other sources as saying Kennedy appeared to have hanged herself . She was found inside a barn behind the family home , according to the New York Daily News .
CHIGAGO – The first step of the six-week grind leading up to the NBA draft is complete and the Miami Heat now are 20 interviews into the process .
The Heat contingent led by President Pat Riley , CEO Nick Arison , GM Andy Elisburg , vice president of player personnel Chet Kammerer , coach Erik Spoelstra and director of basketball development Shane Battier conducted 20 interviews , watched hours of workouts and set up private workouts during their three days at the draft combine in Chicago .
Next up is Tuesday 's draft lottery in which Alonzo Mourning will represent the Heat in front of the cameras and Elisburg will be behind the scenes before about 30 private workouts in Miami . And then the June 22 draft .
The Heat enter the lottery with the 14th pick and have just a 1.8 percent chance of moving into the top three .
Most of the players the Heat interviewed this week are projected to be selected in the second round or go undrafted .
Although Miami enters the draft with just one pick , it could trade into the second round .
The following list includes 17 of the 20 players who confirmed to the Palm Beach Post that they met with the Heat this week :
OG Anunoby , SF , Indiana
Jordan Bell , PF , Oregon
Chris Boucher , PF , Oregon
Thomas Bryant , C , Indiana
PJ Dozier , SG , South Carolina
Josh Hart , SG , Villanova
Isaiah Hicks , PF , North Carolina
Wesley Iwundu , SG/SF , Kansas State
Peter Jok , SG , Iowa
Monte Morris , PG , Iowa State
Jonathan Motley , PF , Baylor
Semi Ojeleye , PF , SMU
Devin Robinson , SF , Florida
Kobi Simmons , PG , Arizona .
Sindarius Thornwell , SG , South Carolina
Derrick White , SG/SF , Colorado
Nigel Williams-Goss , OG , Gonzaga
Anunoby and Boucher both tore an ACL last season . Anunoby is one of the highest ranked among those interviewed and is projected to be taken in the mid-first round . But he still is unable to work out so the Heat did their vetting at the combine . He is hoping to be ready before training camp . Boucher , a projected second rounder , said his target date for full recovery is Oct. 1
The next step is to bring in about 30 players for private workouts . These workouts will include most every player projected to fall somewhere between No . 10 and 25 in the draft , among others . In other words , the player Miami takes with the 14th overall pick – assuming it does not get lucky – likely will be working out at AmericanAirlines Arena in the next month or so .
Florida State shooting guard Dwayne Bacon has a workout scheduled for Friday . Other players who said this week they expect to come in for a workout include TJ Leaf , PF , UCLA ; Ivan Rabb , PF/C , California ; and Justin Jackson , SF , North Carolina .
Look for players like Wake Forest power forward John Collins , Gonzaga center Zach Collins , FSU power forward Jonathan Isaac , Louisville shooting guard Donovan Mitchell , Creighton center Justin Patton , UCLA center Ike Anigbogu , Purdue power forward Caleb Swanigan , Texas center Jarrett Allen , Duke shooting guard Luke Kennard , Duke power forward Harry Giles and shooting guard Terrance Ferguson , who played in Australia last season , to work out for the Heat .

The Soothing Sound of Silence July 31 , 2012
Noise . We are surrounded by it more than we know . Whether it 's the television , our phones or airplanes overhead , we are subjected to a great deal of sound every day .
Silence is very rare indeed . Yet it is in the silent inward gaze that we gain the most power for ourselves . It is not in the distractions of every day life that we find what we are looking for . It is within .
A wise friend of mine once said much can be said in silence . And I have a few special friends that enjoy that silence with me . Nothing must be spoken outloud because we already share a knowingness . It is simply there .
And that is extremely comforting because some things are beyond words , beyond our comprehension , beyond our understanding of reality .
Invite some silence into your day and see what you experience . You might surprise at what you find lurking just beneath the surface , waiting to be heard in the soundless space of your heart .

Certain Chevrolet Cruze models and thousands of large vehicles being recalled for possible axle fractures and transmission issues
General Motors is recalling certain Chevrolet Cruze models for possible axle fractures and more than 490,000 trucks and SUVs for potential transmission cooler line issues , the company said in a statement that was issued late on Friday .
The recalls , the latest in a series at the company , come as the head of the country 's biggest automaker , chief executive Mary Barra , prepares to face Congress next week regarding who is to blame for faulty ignition switches linked to crashes and at least 12 deaths .
The GM Cruze recall targets the 2013 and 2014 1.4L turbo gasoline-powered model , to replace a right front axle half shaft that can fracture without warning during normal driving .
`` The interconnecting tubular bar on the front right axle half shaft on some of these vehicles may not meet GM specification and could fracture and separate , '' the statement said .
GM said if a fracture and separation does occur while driving , steering and braking control would be maintained . However , the vehicle would lose power to the wheels and coast to a stop . If a vehicle with a fractured half shaft is parked on an incline without the parking brake engaged , the vehicle could move unexpectedly and result in a possible crash or injury to pedestrians , the company said .
GM said it knows of several dozen half-shaft fractures through warranty data covering about 172,000 cars to be recalled , and roughly 2,500 US service parts used to fix Cruzes with manual transmissions that were recalled in September 2013 . GM said it is not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the axle condition and repairs will be made free of charge .
Also being recalled are the company 's line of 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 pickups , as well as 2015 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL SUVs equipped with six-speed automatic transmissions .
The truck and SUV recalls involve approximately 490,200 vehicles that may have a transmission oil cooler line not securely seated in its fitting . If the line is not secure and transmission oil leaks from the fitting , the oil could contact a hot surface and cause a vehicle fire , the company said .
GM said it is aware of three incidents and no injuries as a result of the issue . Its dealers will inspect the fittings for leaks with some vehicle owners expected to be reached by mail as early as the week of 28 April .
Our client Angela went on a job interview .
`` It 's supposed to be a Marketing Manager job , but they sure talk a lot about graphic design in the job ad , '' said Angie . `` And the job 's been posted on the company website for six months . ''
Angie went to the interview and sat in a lobby for half an hour . A nice woman came to get her and deposited her in a small interviewing room . A not-as-nice lady came in and started grilling Angie with questions , taking notes as Angie spoke ( no eye contact - all business ! ) .
`` Tell me about your experience with Adobe Illustrator . ''
`` Tell me how much you know about InDesign . ''
`` Tell me what you know about search engines . ''
Wait a second , thought Angie . Something is off - this lady is just reading questions from a script . She does n't know how the pieces fit together . She does n't know anything about this job !
Angie is a marketer , not a graphic designer . She knows tons about search engines , but none of what she knows would have impressed her interviewer , who kept her eyes glued to her notepad and scribbled furiously throughout the interview .
`` May I ask a question ? '' asked Angie finally . `` Sure , '' said the lady .
`` This job has been open for a while , '' said Angie . `` What would you say is the reason it 's taken some time to find the right person ? ''
`` I 'm choosy , '' said the interviewer , and that was that .
Angie never heard from the company again , but she had n't waited around after the interview , either . She could see in a flash that no one with spark and self-esteem would thrive in that company . As far as I know , that job is still open .
A job search is a test of your fortitude . The struggling economy does n't make it easy , and an even bigger challenge is the dysfunctional recruiting process used by nearly every medium-sized and large employer .
I want you to keep in mind that it 's not you - the system itself is broken beyond repair . You are fine . It 's the combination of talent-repelling job ads , Black Hole application systems , and thoughtless , soul-crushing interview processes that make a job search so hard on your emotions .
The good news is that slowly , the tide is turning . I 've been writing about putting a human voice in business for twenty years , but since we put a name and mission to the the Human Workplace cause in 2012 , the pace of change toward a mojo-fueled work world has accelerated dramatically .
These days , we get as many inquiries in our office from employers looking to boost the mojo level in their organizations as we do from job-seekers looking for Human Workplaces to join .
Still , you ca n't assume that when you go on a job interview , your interviewers will be as Human Workplace-aware as you are . They may be just the opposite , like Miss Choosy in our story above .
They may ask you idiotic interview questions and work hard to make the relationship `` I 'm in charge - you 're dogmeat '' abundantly clear throughout your interview conversation .
When you 're asked a foolish , irrelevant question on a job interview , it 's hard to know how to respond . Do you answer the question sincerely , ironically , or a mix or the two ? Is it best to play the part of the The Good Little Interviewee and give no sign that your time is being wasted and your IQ is seeping out through your ears ?
If you play that part too well , you may get hired into a job that will suck your life force away . So what do you do , when the brainless interview questions start flying ?
Here 's our guide to stupid interview questions , to bookmark and pull out before your next job interview .
1 . If you were an animal , what kind of animal would you be ?
This question is so pointless and by extension , insulting ( Do you have a job opening to fill or not ? Why would you use our precious time together asking me fanciful kindergarten questions ? ) that it 's a red flag .
Either this firm lets its interviewers ask any random questions they want on a job interview , or they 've actually talked about it and decided this question is worth asking . Either way , if a fresh-faced baby interviewer or HR screener asks you this question , I 'd hate for you to get up and leave before you 've made it to the hiring manager , the person who has the Business Pain we came to learn about .
( If your hiring manager asks you this question , you have my permission to get up and leave . Just say `` Oh , look at the time ! So sorry , I forgot that I have an appointment in eight minutes . Lovely to meet you , though ! '' ) Hit the road , and go get yourself a nice gelato .
You might want to answer this way : `` I 'd be an ebola virus , and infect your competitors ! '' but I fear your interviewer would n't pick up on the satire . Better to answer the question with a short answer and then ask your own question , like this :
INTERVIEWER : If you were an animal , what kind of animal would you be ?
YOU : Hmmm , probably some kind of wild cat , like a jaguar - I enjoy the hunt . Can I ask you a question about that ?
INTERVIEWER : Er- sure !
YOU : I 'm always interested in the interview questions that companies ask . Is that your own addition to the company 's interview script , or does everyone here use that question ? I 'll bet you hear some fascinating answers !
A human being in the chair across from you will enjoy telling you about all the wild and domestic animals s/he 's met on past interviews . If your interviewer ca n't handle unscripted conversation and looks panicked at your question , you can just say `` That 's okay ! We can talk about that later . ''
During your job search , you 'll decide whether and how far to push the frame `` I 'm the interviewer -- I ask the questions , and you answer them ! '' over and over again . I encourage you , if you have n't done it already , to try a meta-question like `` I 'm curious how that question helps you make better hires ? '' if you can ask it with a smile on your face .
I understand that if you 've recently endured a string of interviews studded with stupid interview questions , that smile could be hard to maintain .
2 . With all the talented candidates , why should we hire you ?
This interview question comes from the genre called `` How badly do you want it ? '' that still plagues corporations and institutions decades after we all realized that the most-grovelly applicants do n't make the best hires . We still love to test job-seekers on their DESIRE for the job , asking insulting questions like this .
I hate this interview question , because it asks a job-seeker to do two awful things . First , the question asks a job-seeker to assume a supplicant position and beg for the job . Secondly , it asks a person to compare him- or herself to people s/he 's never met and likely never will .
Here 's how you can handle this one :
INTERVIEWER : With all the talented candidates , why should we hire you ?
YOU : Great question , and I think that 's really the point of our conversation today -- to determine whether I 'm the person for the job and whether this is the job for me . It might be that you should hire me . I love this field and I 'm excited to keep growing muscles in it . That being said , I have n't met the other candidates and I 'm sure there are smart and capable people in that group . That 's going to be your challenge , to consider what 's ahead for you and which person can best fill that role . I have total faith that if we 're supposed to be working together , we 'll figure that out .
3 . What 's your greatest weakness ?
This question comes down from our Puritan forefathers , who saw life as a joyless quest to surmount personal deficiencies and weaknesses . Cheery vision , right ?
I reject the view that people have weaknesses . People come in a fascinating array of types , and part of the fun of being alive is that we get to figure out where we shine and maneuver ourselves into that spot .
The old idea of weaknesses-to-correct is giving way to the new idea 'figure out what you love to do , and do it all the time . ' Who has time to work and work to get slightly better at things we 'll never love and never be great at ?
I recommend that you handle this horrendous question this way :
INTERVIEWER : What 's your greatest weakness ?
YOU : Great question ! I used to obsess about my weaknesses when I was younger . I took classes and read books like you would n't believe , and then over time it occurred to me that I should be focusing on the things I do well , like designing financial reports . Other things -- graphic design , for instance - are n't for me , so I steer myself toward the work that jazzes me and where I can make the biggest impact .
4 . Where do you see yourself in five years ?
Really , are people still hearing this ancient interview question in 2014 ? Yep , interviewers still pull out this lame Mad Men era question and ask it , so you 've got to be prepared . The truth is that no one can make a five-year-horizon career plan in 2014 ( maybe the Pope - and maybe not even him ) .
This may have been a great question to ask when The Beverly Hillbillies was filming new episodes . Today , it 's a waste of interview airtime , but you still have to answer it .
Try this approach :
INTERVIEWER : Where do you see yourself in five years ?
YOU : I love Finance , and I do n't have plans to move out of it but then again you never know what influences will hit you . I 'm interested in getting my MBA , so five years from now I could be one year out of school and I may think totally differently at that point than I do now . The things I can say for sure are that if I 'm alive five years from now , I 'll be working hard at something I love and supporting the people around me . For me , the team is as important as the work .
What interview questions should replace these stupid , old ones ?
When you get into your new job and start interviewing people yourself , what questions will you ask them ? When you adopt the Interviewing with a Human Voice approach , you wo n't ask lame interview questions like the ones on our list . You 'll ask job-seekers to bring their questions to the job interview instead , and invite them to go first , asking questions of you to start the interview .
You 'll learn much more about your candidates from the questions they ask you than you ever would from their answers !
Once the applicant 's questions are exhausted , here are some questions an interviewer can pose :
1 ) Given what you know about our company and this role so far -- and this is your chance to ask me anything you want to know , by the way -- what would you see as the most likely goals for the new hire in this position , over the next six months ?
2 ) Here 's what we 're dealing with in Tech Support . ( Explain your situation . ) What would your approach to that set of conditions be ? What would be your attack plan , if you got this job ?
3 ) How does this job mesh with your career plan for yourself ? How will it grow your flame ?
Job interviews can be fun and enriching for everyone involved -- and they should be !
When we interview folks at Human Workplace , we tell them `` This is a job interview , and potentially a coaching session . We have an opening to fill and you might be interested in that job , but that is just our starting point . If this is n't the right job for you , let 's talk about you and your career instead . '' Sometimes , candidates say `` I 'm not sure I want this job , but I wanted to meet you guys . '' We say `` Cool ! We had booked the time anyway . It 's great to meet you . ''
Fifty percent of our interviews veer into career coaching and that 's absolutely wonderful . After all , a job is just a job . Your flame is everything !
Our company is called Human Workplace . Our mission is to reinvent work for people !
We help job-seekers grow their flames and get great jobs with employers that deserve their talents . We help employers brand themselves and reinvent their recruiting processes to snag and keep smart and capable people and we help them grow the Team Mojo on their teams . We invite everyone to step into the Human Workplace . We launched in November 2012 and have over 200,000 members already . You can join us , too !

A small , independent anti-piracy firm—you could call it “ boutique ” —has quietly surged to the front of its industry , is directly responsible for getting hundreds of users being disconnected from the Internet , and is calmly collecting settlement funds from tens of thousands of users .
RightsCorp , founded in 2011 , is , by its own claim , the new “ leading provider of monetization services for artists and holders of copyrighted Intellectual Property. ” On the surface , they 're nothing new under the sun : There 's a long history of independent firms , often headed by an entrepreneurial copyright lawyer , agreeing to be a bully on behalf of a handful of music or movie studios .
Though RightsCorp has n't reinvented the wheel , however , it very well may the most severe , widespread anti-piracy firm yet .
In a sense , RightsCorp 's business is the natural extension of the U.S. 's law on online copyright , the Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1988 , best known as the DMCA . ( If it strikes you as antiquated that a law from 1988 governs how the U.S. treats a sizeable chunk of the Internet , you 're not alone . ) Long gone are the days in which the music industry formally sued people for the maximum damages for each pirated song , like Joel Tenenbaum , who still owes $ 675,000 for pirating 30 songs in 2002 .
Instead , RightsCorp works with a two-pronged attack . If their software catches someone pirating on a peer-to-peer program like BitTorrent—and that 's pretty common for users who do n't take steps to hide their identity—RightsCorp will , on behalf of the music or movie company they represent , send a little letter that says , essentially : You 've been caught pirating . But if you pay $ 20 , we 'll forgive you .
“ When you torrent a file , we see it . For lack of a better description , we capture a red light photo of the transaction . We send your Internet service provider a notice , ” RightsCorp founder Christopher Sabec , a former music manager and entertainment lawyer , described to the Daily Dot in a phone interview .
Alleged pirates get a notice from RightsCorp that they 've been caught , but that these specific charges will be dropped if they pay $ 20 , a fee split with the firm and whichever company owns the copyright .
This tactic is , shall we say , controversial .
“ RightsCorp is definitely doing something new and troubling here , ” Parker Higgins , an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , told the Daily Dot .
Aram Sinnreich , professor of media and journalism at Rutgers University and author of The Piracy Crusade , agreed . “ A $ 20 ticket makes it seem like it 's legitimate , like it 's running a red light or carrying a small quantity of contraband , ” he said . However , he added , it can be a slippery slope :
“ But these are n't tickets in the sense that we usually use the term because they 're not really statutorily sanctioned . This is much more of shakedown . There 's no law saying that somebody needs to pay $ 20 if they 're suspected of infringing copyright . It 's just sort of cherry-picking people who do n't have adequate funds or representation or expertise , and shaking them down for such a small amount of money that they 're likely to say yes . It 's the kind of thing that the mafia 's been doing for hundreds , if not thousands of years . ”
RightsCorp only began issuing large numbers of successful copyright notices in the past year , Sabec said , and in the past six months in particular . In May , the company announced it had settled 75,000 cases in its existence , and each of those either related to a $ 20 ticket or a user who had been disconnected and was begging to be let back on , Sabec said .
More impressive , though , is that 15,000 of those settlements came in the last two months of its existence , meaning it accepted roughly $ 300,000 from alleged pirates in that period . Sabec said that while he did n't have more recent figures , business had been similarly rising in June and so far in July .
Sabec also refused to divulge numbers on how many users had been disconnected , but indicated the number is at least in the hundreds , and perhaps the thousands . As noted by TorrentFreak , RightsCorp has deals with 140 different American ISPs—most of them small , but some among the ten biggest in the country , Sabec said—and has convinced the majority to terminate the accounts of people RightsCorp identifies as repeat copyright infringers .
“ Every single day , our call center lights up with people who have been disconnected , ” Sabec says . “ That 's our hammer . ”
Sabec prefers calling them “ disconnections , ” even though the law calls it “ termination , ” because if a user can settle with his company , she can be reinstated online .
“ [ The DMCA ] is vague , and it has n't really been litigated and thoughtfully defined , but it is there , and it 's the law of the land , ” Sabec said .
“ It 's ‘ hey ISPs , you have 315 customers who have been been actively and repeatedly infringing our content , and we want you to take action , we want you to terminate them as the law says . ' That 's what we 've been able to do . ”
Literally speaking , Sabec is right : That practice , hard as it may be to swallow , is explicitly allowed by the DMCA . But this “ hammer , ” as Sabec calls it , is rarely swung with such frequency .
Disconnection “ is historically very uncommon in the U.S. , ” Sinnreich said , and given how hard they make it for regular customers to leave for other providers , it 's likely the case that few ISPs want to cut their customers off completely , or to develop a reputation for doing so . But the language is right there in the law . In fact , ISPs are only granted liability from their customers ' copyright infringement if they have “ a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider 's system or network who are repeat infringers . ”
Options are limited for users who get a RightsCorp infringement notice . They can just pay it , of course—and Sabec stressed only accounts repeatedly flagged for piracy were terminated . They can try to challenge it in court , though as Ars Technica has reported , those notices threaten lawsuits of up to $ 150,000 . They can take pains to hide their Internet protocol ( IP ) address , as one would to hide from the Copyright Alert System .
( Note : The Daily Dot is n't giving anyone legal advice here , and while Sabec said customers are identified by their IP address , we 're certainly not promising that taking pains to hide yours will absolve you of anything . )
Or they can hope somebody takes up the cause for the common people . As Sinnerich said :
“ The FBI should be going after these guys on racketeering charges . It 's disgusting . I hate to depart from my usually more relaxed tone , but this is the kind of situation [ that ] copyright law in its current problematic form enables . It would be one thing if there were some kind of federal law saying if you 're caught infringing you should pay $ 20 and these guys were registered with the copyright office to act as agents on their behalf . But no . These guys are entirely private , entrepreneurial shakedown arts who are using tenuous 3rd party claims of intellectual property ownership to squeeze more money out of people . ”
Though RightsCorp currently only operates in the U.S. , it 's looking to increase its range of operations to the Philippines and Canada , Sabec said , and “ is in the early stages ” of expanding to China , Russia , and Thailand . The company , which went public in October , reported a 284 percent increase in revenues from the quarter ending March 14 , 2014 , a total of $ 188,933 . And unless something changes , that number is going to keep growing .

From Neverpedia
( not to be confused with other things called `` Lost Boys '' )
The Lost Boys are Peter 's companions in Neverland , and he is their leader . As pre-teen boys lacking any adult supervision , they are often ill-behaved , and enjoy the freedom their wild lifestyle offers , but they usually have a hidden ( or not-so-hidden ) desire for a `` mother '' ( even when they do n't know exactly what those are ) . They were introduced in J. M. Barrie 's play Peter Pan , or The Boy Who Would n't Grow Up , developed further in the novel Peter and Wendy , and appear in most adaptations and extensions to the story . The Lost Boys – as well as Peter – were inspired by the Llewelyn Davies boys , whom Barrie befriended in 1897 . The Lost Boys are widely known for their animal pajamas/costumes , as seen in the 1953 Disney adaptation ( though these did not appear in the original play ) .
Peter and Wendy
The Lost Boys , Peter , John , and Michael , greet Wendy after building a house for her , illustrated by Alice B. Woodward
In the novel , Barrie explains that the Lost Boys are boys who fell out of their prams while their nannies are looking the other way , in places such as Kensington Gardens . After going unclaimed for seven days , they are whisked off to Neverland , where they live with Peter Pan . There are no `` Lost Girls '' , because ( as Peter explains ) girls are too clever to be lost in this manner . Although it 's popularly thought that they remain boys forever ( and Barrie states that time operates differently in Neverland ) , Barrie comments about them routinely getting killed , or they `` seem to be growing up '' and Peter `` thins them out '' when they do that . ( After all , if they never grew up , and new boys continued to be lost by their nannies , Neverland would eventually overwhelm with them ) .
The six Lost Boys in Barrie 's story are :
Tootles - the least fortunate and most humble , always missing adventures that happen when he 's not around
- the least fortunate and most humble , always missing adventures that happen when he 's not around Nibs - `` gay '' and debonair
- `` gay '' and debonair Curly - gets into trouble so much that he habitually takes the blame even when he did n't do it
- gets into trouble so much that he habitually takes the blame even when he did n't do it Slightly - the most conceited , because he believes he remembers his life before being lost
- the most conceited , because he believes he remembers his life before being lost First Twin - indistinguishable from his brother , and Peter is n't quite sure what twins are
- indistinguishable from his brother , and Peter is n't quite sure what twins are Second Twin - ditto
Silent film
Herbert Brenon 's 1924 silent film introduces animal costumes for the Lost Boys . They do n't wear these outfits all the time , however : just when they 're playing at being animals .
Disney films
Nibs , the Twins , `` Cubby '' , Slightly , and Tootles , in Disney 's 1953 animated film , at attention and saluting
The Lost Boys gained distinctive animal costumes but lost most of their individual characterization in the Disney movie , acting mostly as a group . Likewise , in some related Disney material , they are named for the animal costumes they wear rather than their somewhat more proper names :
Foxy = Slightly
Rabbit = Nibs
Skunk = Tootles
Cubby = Curly ( actually named Cubby throughout )
the Raccoon Twins = the Twins
In Return to Neverland they are again named as their book counterparts , with the exception of Curly , who remains Cubby ( a name The Walt Disney Company seems inordinately fond of ) . Skunk/Tootles is the only Lost Boy to never speak in either of the films ( but arguably makes up for that by being the only one of the group to appear ( as an old man ) in the film Hook ) .
A big difference between their Disney treatment and the original work is that the Lost Boys do not leave Neverland with the Darlings and grow up . They are tempted to do so , but change their minds and remain with Peter Pan . In Return to Neverland , which takes place many years later , they are still with Peter and have remained children , reinforcing the notion that living in Neverland automatically means never growing up .
Питер Пэн
in the 1987 Soviet adaptation
In the 1987 made-for-Soviet-TV adaptation Питер Пэн by Belarusfilm , the original Lost Boys are portrayed by six young boys , presumably Russian or Belarusian . They are credited as :
In an iconoclastic bit of directing , the twins do n't always stand next to each other .
The Only Children
In Gilbert Adair 's unauthorized 1987 sequel Peter Pan and the Only Children , there is a different group of Lost Boys , who refer to themselves as the Brotherhood . They are `` only children '' ( i.e . they have no brothers or sisters ) who fell from passing ships and now live with Peter underwater . They include :
Tom-Tom – who slavishly imitates Peter
– who slavishly imitates Peter Bee – short for `` Be quiet ! `` , a rare Lost Girl
– short for `` Be quiet ! `` , a rare Lost Girl Ralph – Peter 's second-in-command
– Peter 's second-in-command Second Helping – named for his appetite and size
Direct-to-video film
in the 1988 animated adaptation
In the 1988 Burbank Films Australia direct-to-video adaptation , the six original Lost Boys are shown , wearing caveman-like furs . In keeping with the tone of the adaptation , they are very childlike and innocent , eager to have mothers . Only Tootles and Nibs have significant dialog .
Neverland novel
In the 1989 novel Neverland , there are Lost Boys named Bins , Colin , Hardly , Looter , and two unnamed twins .
Hook
Thud Butt , Do n't Ask , No Nap , Too Small , Ace , and Latchboy
In Hook , a 1991 film about a Peter Pan who chose to grow up 25-30 years earlier , there are dozens of Lost Boys of various ethnicity living in Neverland , whose clothes and accents suggest that they came to Neverland from different places at various times over the past century . They live in a giant tree on a tall rocky outcropping just offshore of the island ( because Hook had burnt their underground house after Peter left Neverland ) . The Lost Boys named in the film are :
Unnamed Lost Boys are played by Bogdan Georghe , Adam McNatt , and René González Jr , with a large cast of uncredited extras .
The boys are led by Rufio , who took over as leader after Peter left Neverland to grow up and became Peter Banning . Initially , Rufio does n't believe that Peter is their former leader , nor do most of the boys . However Tinker Bell knows him , and the glimpse of Peter Pan that Pockets finds in Peter Banning 's face convince them to train him for a showdown with Captain Hook . The Lost Boys gradually come to believe in Peter , a turning point being when he manages to beat Rufio in a name-calling match . When Peter finally relearns how to fly , Rufio gives Peter the Pan sword . The Lost Boys follow Peter into a climactic war with Captain Hook and the pirates , armed with improvised childlike weapons . Rufio valiantly takes on Hook while Peter rescues his son and daughter . Hook manages to stab Rufio , whose dying words to Peter are `` I wish I had a dad ... like you . '' Before leaving Neverland , Peter selects Thud Butt to be their new leader .
Meanwhile , Tootles appears as an old man . He was one of the many `` orphans '' whom Granny Wendy is said to have found homes for over the decades . He now seems senile , and lives with Wendy because she could not bear to send him to a retirement home . However , he is the first to recognize that Hook has returned to London . He is seen searching for something on the floor , and explains `` I 've lost my marbles , '' which Peter Banning readily agrees with . Later in Neverland , Thud Butt gives Peter a small bag containing ... Tootles ' marbles . Tootles is ecstatic to get them back in the end , and with the help of some fairy dust that spills out of the bag , he flies out the window toward Neverland .
2003 film
Curly , Tootles , Slightly , Nibs , and the Twins in the 2003 film
In P. J. Hogan 's 2003 adaptation of Peter and Wendy , the original six Lost Boys appear as Peter 's band . They wear clothing apparently patched together from scavenged materials , including worn fabric , leather belts , and animal pelts , a bit like castaways who have `` gone native '' . In an apparent homage to the Disney costumes , the pelts include a fox and perhaps skunks , but Curly wears the fox pelt ( not Slightly ) , and the Twins ( not Tootles ) wear the possibly-skunk pelts as hats . The actors are all English , around 11-12 years old , except the Twins , who are played by 9-year-old Australians ( where the movie was filmed ) .
Starcatcher books
In the prequel Starcatchers series of books , an earlier group of Lost Boys are presented . They include boys whom Peter knew from St. Norbert 's orphanage , and who return to England with the family of Molly Aster ( the books ' heroine ) during the series . This of course contradicts Peter 's explanation in the original story .
Prentiss - a rather new boy at St. Norbert 's
- a rather new boy at St. Norbert 's James - James seems to be closer to Peter then any other boy at St. Norbert 's
- James seems to be closer to Peter then any other boy at St. Norbert 's Tubby Ted - as a running gag , Tubby Ted is always hungry
- as a running gag , Tubby Ted is always hungry Thomas - a boy from St. Norbert 's
In Peter and the Secret of Rundoon , some other boys from St. Norbert 's - Barrie 's set of Lost Boys - end up going to Neverland with Peter . In the end , Prentiss , James , Tubby Ted , and Thomas decide to go back to London with Leonard Aster , realizing that they would become men someday and could not keep up with Peter . This left Peter and Tinker Bell with the familiar Lost Boys from Barrie 's story .
Kingdom Hearts
The Lost Boys do n't appear alongside Peter Pan and Sora - the central character - in the Kingdom Hearts video game , but they do appear in the Kingdom Hearts manga as comic relief , fighting Donald Duck over some treasure they found in Captain Hook 's ship .
NeverWorld
A different set of boys appear in Peter Pan 's NeverWorld , as per the idea that there are always new boys coming to the Neverland . The boys who travel to NeverWorld are :
Bricks – a bear of a boy who is n't the brightest , wearing a bearskin and real bear claw slippers .
– a bear of a boy who is n't the brightest , wearing a bearskin and real bear claw slippers . Duvitch – always second in everything . Believes himself to be second in command . Wears overalls and sports two feathers in his cap .
– always second in everything . Believes himself to be second in command . Wears overalls and sports two feathers in his cap . Halfway – always “ halfway ” in everything ( i.e . can only carry half as much as the others , makes it halfway to a site and tires out , etc . ) His hair is split between blonde and brunette . Only speaks in clichés ( but only utters half of the sayings . ) He wears a cut off shirt , shorts and sandals .

He wears a tiger outfit and brown booties .
Cultural references
The 1980s film The Lost Boys adapts the concept of a tribe of unaging youths to a gang of vampires .
The 1990s comics series The Lost uses the same vampire concept , applying it to Peter and the Lost Boys themselves , not just as a metaphor .
The 1997 short story `` Lost Girls '' by Jane Yolen subverts the idea a bit by looking at it from a female perspective .
The 2004 novel The Lost Girls by Laurie Fox applies the term to Wendy Darling and her female descendents .
The video game Grand Theft Auto IV : The Lost and Damned is centered around a biker gang called The Lost . Although the gang is supposedly named for dead friends that they have lost , it is a likely metaphor for their refusal to grow up , i.e . abandon their hard rock lifestyles for steady jobs .
Despite the TV series ' name Lost , the setting of a hidden island outside the normal passage of time , an old sailing ship , and a few other apparent references to the Peter Pan mythos , the producers of the show say that Peter Pan was not a conscious source for its mythology . The show contains numerous deliberate references to Alice in Wonderland , however .
Recently he was involved in the formation of the Nationalist Front , an alliance of far-right groups that agreed to put aside the habitual bickering that has long characterized the white nationalism movement in America . Among the members of the alliance were the Nationalist Socialist Movement , the U.S. 's largest neo-Nazi group , as well as several smaller groups . “ We have to work together , ” Heimbach told me about the Front . “ And we have to realize that the violent , white supremacist rhetoric of old only hurts us . ”
To this end , members of the Nationalist Front agreed not to use the Swastika and to sign a common manifesto explicitly disavowing supremacism . “ I 've never been a white supremacist , ” he said . “ No race is better than another , it 's just that we ca n't play nice together. ” Still , for its purportedly post-racist ideology , the alliance , as Heimbach himself admits , is fully committed to fighting the Jewish oligarchy , which Heimbach firmly believes has its claws in every part of society and is hell-bent on the eradication of the white race .
Heimbach had put on a collared shirt for the inauguration and was wearing it under a heavy , gray coat . Blythe wore his usual red beret , decorated with a Trump button , while Hess , who claimed to be immune to cold , wore only a short-sleeved shirt and a pair of oversized Aviators .

“ I need to pee , ” Hess said as they stepped out of the metro station . L'Enfant Plaza was one of just two metro stations close to the Mall and parade route that would be open that day , and most of the people attending the inauguration came through here . All around were vendors selling hats , flags , buttons , towels , T-shirts , and anything else that would fit a Trump logo .
“ You 're kidding right ? ” said Heimbach . “ You need to pee now ? There is literally nowhere to pee here . Hold it in . ”
Scott said he could n't and that he would go back into the metro station to find a bathroom . Heimbach and Blythe , who did n't feel like waiting around , plunged into the crowd . Up the street , a small group of protesters is holding flags and banners about water preservation . Heimbach and Blythe stood off to the side and watched as the demonstrators chanted . “ Look at these fools , ” Heimbach said . “ You need force backing up your talk , and do these people have that ? No . They need the force of the capitalist state to protect them from us . ”
A black SUV with police plates drove up and stopped in front of the demonstrators . An officer leaned out the window and asked them to step aside so that they could pass . “ Do n't stop , officer , ” shouted Heimbach as the SUV slowly made its way though the throng . “ Fucking step on the gas ! ”
He looked with disdain at a group of demonstrators who were playing drums . “ Stand up , fight back , bongo your way to revolution , ” he scoffed .
They walked west along Independence Avenue , trying to find someplace to cross the Mall , with no luck . Hess , Josef Weiss , and Katherine Weiss trailed Heimbach and Blythe . Hess saw enemies everywhere he looked . He shouted , “ Oy Vey ” to a couple of Jewish kids . As they passed a small group of people holding “ Dump Trump ” signs , he said , “ I ca n't wait for Trump to give us the go-ahead to start beating the shit out of you people. ” It was not quite loud enough for them to hear , but loud enough for it to seem like he had wanted them to .
“ Take it easy , Scott , ” Heimbach said . “ No incitement . I do n't want to fight over something we started. ” On 12th Street they came across a group of horses being prepared for the parade . “ Hey , Matt , ” Josef Weiss shouted . “ I better not see any protesters punching a horse . If I see anyone punching a horse , they 're done . ”
“ OK , ” said Heimbach .
The original plan for the weekend had been a sit-down with Richard Spencer , another high-profile leader of the alt-right . Heimbach and Spencer had a long-running and deep mistrust of each other . Heimbach thought Spencer was a tea-drinking elitist who had no idea how to create a real movement outside the dark corners of the internet , and Spencer thought Heimbach was an anachronism , caught up with groups and ideas whose time had long passed . The meeting , which was to formalize a détente , had been canceled when Spencer stopped answering texts the day before . Heimbach said it did n't matter . “ We do n't need him , ” he said . “ After today we 'll have much better allies than Spencer . ”
“ Ours is a youth movement . It 's against political correctness , democracy , and equality , and it 's building , ” Heimbach said .
He was feeling optimistic . He had recently performed a purge in the ranks of the Nationalist Front , kicking out several Klan groups that had had difficulties adjusting to the guidelines of the alliance . He and the National Socialist Movement were also planning to unveil a new internet forum in week after the inauguration . With the catastrophic implosion of The Right Stuff , his forum was poised to be the main meeting place for the far right .
“ This feels like the beginning , ” he said as they turned back towards L'Enfant Plaza , realizing that crossing the Mall would be impossible . “ We like some of what Trump is saying , but he 's not our guy . I do n't trust Trump to do right by us at all , and the left are galvanized like never before , but we 're ready . This last year saw over a billion anti-Semitic impressions per month online . We won the meme war . Ours is a youth movement . It 's against political correctness , democracy , and equality , and it 's building . ”
Back at L'Enfant Plaza they came across another protest . A small group of young people had gathered on the corner . One of them was shouting at the crowds as they walked passed . “ Do you really want a president that grabs pussy ? ” he asked .
“ Rather that than someone who grabs babies right out of the womb , ” Heimbach replied .
The interaction soon descended into screaming . Heimbach tried to explain that all he wanted was a world where ethnic communities could decide their own fates , while the protester responded that perhaps not everyone wanted to live in racially homogenous societies . Meanwhile Hess was telling a female protester that when they came to power he would have her put in a concentration camp , but that he would call it a “ fun camp ” and that she would be forced to make toys . The altercation only lasted a few minutes before the demonstrators moved on .
“ A few years ago the GOP would n't be able to even sit in the same room as you , but things have changed and now we need each other , ” the GOP contact said . “ This is a big day . ”
They took the metro to Capitol South , where Heimbach 's Republican contact , who wished to remain anonymous , invited everyone to dinner before Heimbach 's meeting at the Capitol Hill Club . Over burritos in a noisy Mexican restaurant overlooking the Congressional Library , he described being there when Governor Wallace got shot in 1972 and how the murder was probably connected to the deep state . ( Arthur Bremer , a former janitor , was convicted of attempting to assassinate Wallace , and was sent to prison for 35 years . )
“ Today is a big day , ” the contact said . “ Make no mistake about it . This is the time to mobilize . The Left are bringing 200,000 people to D.C. tomorrow and we need to be able to do the same . We need to bring thousands of people into the movement . ”
Heimbach 's contact said that the movement needed money and that the GOP needed the movement , and that today would be the first step in bringing the nationalists and the GOP together : “ A few years ago the GOP would n't be able to even sit in the same room as you , but things have changed and now we need each other . This is a big day . ”
He threw a hundred dollar bill on the table and took Heimbach with him to the Capitol Hill Club , where he said many people were excited to meet him .
The rest of the crew waited for a couple of hours , first finishing the cocktails that Heimbach 's friend had bought them , then walking around the Capitol as the crowds began to head home .
Finally Heimbach came back . He was elated . The meeting had gone well , he said . In a room full of GOP operatives and state legislators he had been introduced as “ the next president of the United States. ” He said that he had made no attempt at hiding his politics or his affiliations , and that no one had seemed to have a problem with it . He said that he 'd spoken at length about the white working class , their problems , and how to strengthen the GOP 's hold over them . When he finished , he had been given a resounding applause .
They got back on the metro towards Virginia . “ It 's crazy , ” Heimbach said on the train . “ Remember how only a year ago we were sitting in a pizza restaurant in Kentucky , hardly 10 members in our party . Today , a year later I 'm giving a speech in the most important Republican club to a group of Republican operatives . Things are happening . I can feel it . ”
“ I always believed it , ” said Miles . “ We president now . ”
It 's official : Legends of Tomorrow has found their Stargirl . According to an exclusive from IGN , it looks like the CW 's hit-show has cast actress Sarah Grey to play the heroine .
Set to star in the series ' second season , Stargirl will join heroes Hourman ( Patrick J. Adams ) , Dr. Mid-Nite , and Obsidian . The latter two characters have yet to be cast , but EW was able to confirm that Commander Steel would be played by Matthew MacCaull . Amaya Jiwe will also be joining The Justice League of America as Vixen .
For those unfamiliar with Stargirl , the heroine was created by Geoff Johns back in 1999 . Also known as Courtney Whitmore , Stargirl receives her stellar powers by wielding Starman 's Cosmic Staff and donning the Cosmic Converter Belt which gives her agility and enhanced reflexes . Stargirl stands as one of the JSA 's most recognizable characters , and Whitmore has even appeared in other live-action DC adaptations before . Most famously , actress Britt Irvin played the hero in several episodes of Smallville during Seasons 9 & 10 . The hero has also been featured in several of DC 's animated series like Justice League Unlimited . With Legends of Tomorrow 's JSA line-up filling out , fans are growing more excited for Legends of Tomorrow 's upcoming season . The show did tease during this year 's Comic-Con that the JSA would stand as heroes this season while their villains would be found in the Legion of Doom . Familiar baddies like Malcolm Merlyn , Captain Cold , Damien Darhk , Reverse Flash will make up the team of villains .
A relatively new actress , Sarah Grey is probably best known for being cast in the upcoming Power Rangers film by Lionsgate . Playing Amanda , the Canadian actress began her film career back in 2013 when she landed a role in Cinemanovels . Since then , Grey has gone on to star in projects like Almost Human , Bates Motel , and iZombie .

Microsoft
Microsoft 's Windows Phone operating system has largely missed out on the smartwatch and fitness tracker fun , but with the new Microsoft Band it 's finally in the game . And what 's more , the Band actually works with more than just Windows-based mobiles : it syncs with your iPhone or Android phone too .
In terms of features , the Microsoft Band covers the field . It has common fitness tracker features like step tracking and more premium features such as GPS and a heart rate monitor . And it also offers features more typically found in smartwatches such as a colour touchscreen , notifications and payments when you 're in Starbucks .
If that sounds good to you , then there 's more good news : it 's available today . That 's if you 're in the US and you have a spare $ 199 ; UK and Australian prices have n't been announced , but the US price converts to around £125 or AU $ 230 .
The plastic band boasts an adjustable strap and a full-colour touchscreen . It 's dust- and splash-resistant and powered by two 100mAh rechargeable lithium-ion polymer batteries that give you 48 hours on standby .
Don your running shoes or hop on your bike and the Band uses GPS to record the route you 've run , biked , or hiked . There 's a stopwatch and lap timer when you 're on the track . You can set a target for the number of steps or calories you want to burn through in a day , or follow guided workouts set by experts the likes of Gold 's Gym or Men 's Health .
Even when you 're not working out the Band is looking out for you : it monitors your heart rate 24 hours a day , records how long and how well you sleep and how often you wake , and checks UV levels when you 're going out in the sun .
The data collected by the Band is synced up with an online service and app called Microsoft Health -- not to be confused with Apple Health or Samsung 's S Health , of course . As well as working on most phones , Microsoft Health plays well with others , linking up with other fitness apps and services including MyFitnessPal , RunKeeper and MapMyFitness .
That 's where many fitness bands stop . But because the Microsoft Band syncs with your phone , it can also offer you notifications about new messages , events and social network updates , showing your incoming calls and texts or a short preview of new emails and reminders from your calendar . When you get a new message you can fire back a pre-set response ( although that does n't work if you have an iPhone ) . There 's an alarm too , to wake you up or let you know when it 's time for your next appointment .
Or if you prefer to be undisturbed when you 're in the zone , turn on the do-not-disturb mode and you wo n't get any notifications .
When you 've finished working out and you 're ready to reward yourself with a venti sugarcino , the Band stores your Starbucks card details so you can scan your wrist to pay without reaching for your wallet .
The Band works with Cortana , the voice-controlled Windows Phone personal assistant . As long as you have a Windows 8.1 device in your pocket , you can talk to the Band and dictate notes or set reminders . Cortana also gives you updates on current information like traffic conditions , sports results or the weather .
To use the Microsoft Band and Microsoft Health , you need a Windows Phone device with the 8.1 update , an iPhone running iOS 7.1 or 8 , or an Android phone running 4.3 or 4.4 . You need Bluetooth to pair the Band with your phone .
A petition for Sega to port more games to PC , particularly those made in Japan , is gathering steam , as more than 6000 people sign their name in support .
Sega has even publicly acknowledged the campaign , saying on Twitter that , `` The community team is aware of the movement , but no official comment to be made at this time . ''
The petition suggested porting three games to PC as a way of testing the market . Those games are Bayonetta , Vanquish and Virtua Fighter 5 : Final Showdown .
The thinking is that these games would n't take too much effort to port , and that there 's a proven audience who 'd appreciate them .
Bayonetta is similar in style to Metal Gear Rising , which was released recently on PC to some success , and Bayonetta and Vanquish use the same MGR engine .
Virtua Fighter 5 : Final Showdown would fill the modern 3D fighting game hole on PC , and has some Windows blood in its RingEdge board core , apparently .
The petition duly noted that Sega is actually a very strong PC publisher thanks to Football Manager and Total War ( and now Company of Heroes and Relic ) .
It concluded : `` Most importantly we want you to note that this is a petition staged not around these three games but around your future as a publisher in the PC space .
`` We 're requesting that you port these initial three so that we can demonstrate that the PC market will support this type of content , allowing you to then make a better determination as to which games will best suit your PC audience going forward , as well as allowing you to bring renewed consideration to those other titles if this effort proves successful . ''
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Advocates for campaign finance transparency sued the Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday to force it to deny tax-exempt status to groups spending funds on political activities , launching a legal case that tax lawyers said faced long odds .

Ahead of the 2012 elections , liberal and conservative tax-exempt groups raised hundreds of millions of dollars from anonymous corporate and individual donors , then spent the money on political advocacy , usually negative television ads .
The lawsuit , filed in federal court , centers on the tax code 's definition of political activity for these tax-exempt , 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups . The law says they must operate “ exclusively for the promotion of social welfare . ”
But the federal regulations the U.S. Treasury wrote to enforce the law says the groups must spend their time and money “ primarily ” on social welfare causes .
The leeway in the definition of “ primarily ” has been criticized as a loophole allowing the groups to attack candidates running for office without disclosing their donors ' names .
The lawsuit asks the court to rule the IRS is unlawfully interpreting Congress 's intent in the 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) law , and that 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups must be barred from all political activity .
“ The public has a right to know who 's bank rolling these election campaigns , ” said Representative Chris Van Hollen , a Maryland Democrat suing the IRS with Democracy 21 , Campaign Legal Center and Public Citizen Inc , liberal-leaning groups that advocate for more campaign finance transparency .
The IRS did not immediately comment on Wednesday .
These 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups were at the center of a May IRS inspector general 's report that criticized the IRS for unfairly scrutinizing applicants linked with the conservative-leaning Tea Party movement .
Ahead of the 2012 elections , Van Hollen and the three advocacy groups were unsuccessful in getting more campaign spending transparency , either through Congress or the courts .
Conservative tax-exempt groups dominated their liberal counterparts in spending during the 2012 campaigns , according to figures from the Center for Responsive Politics .
The lawsuit also asks the court to halt the IRS 's new “ fast track ” approval program for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups .
The IRS said in June it will quickly approve such applications from groups that promise to limit their political campaign intervention to 40 percent of their spending and time .
Lawyers specializing in tax-exempt law said the lawsuit faces little chance of succeeding in court . The challengers first must convince the court they have enough grievances for the lawsuit to proceed .
The challengers must also persuade the court to overturn a 50-year-old tax code rule that Congress has never revisited to say the IRS is wrong in its interpretation .
“ It 's hard to see courts intercede in this conflict , ” said Jeffrey Altman , a partner with Whiteford Taylor Preston LLP .
The case , in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , is Hollen v Internal Revenue Service No . 1:13-cv-01276 .
FEARS of being caught up in terror attacks abroad have driven millions of Brits to opt for `` staycations '' this year - giving a much-needed boost to the UK economy .
According to travel company Abta there has been `` strong sales '' for holidays in Devon , Cornwall and the Channel Islands as many people opt for a domestic break .
Alamy 6 million Brits will opt to holiday in the UK this year rather than go abroad - mainly due to the terror threat
Alamy 6 After a week of blazing hot weather many will be heading off for the school holidays this weekend
The move to holidaying at home follows a string of recent terror attacks in once popular destinations such as France , Turkey and Egypt - including the horrific massacre on a beachfront in Nice last week in which 84 people were killed .
Holidays to Egypt have nearly halved following the downing of a Russian passenger plane in October 2015 official figures show , while the number of tourists arriving in Turkey has fallen for nine consecutive months to 1.75 million in April this year .
Twinned with the effect of the falling pound after Brexit on the cost of holidaying in Europe - many Brits now opting to stay home this summer , instead choosing a `` staycation '' in the UK .
Uncertainty has also come in the last week from the collapsing of travel agent Low-Cost Holidays - which has left many fearful of being stranded abroad should their booking firm go bust .

Holidaying at home has grown more and more popular since the beginning of this year - with a record breaking 7.3million people taking a break in England in the first quarter of 2016 , up 10 per cent on the same time last year according to Visit England .
Separate research by vouchercodes.co.uk , which sells last-minute discounted holidays , predicts an extra 2.5 million people will decide to holiday at home this year .
Tourism boards across the UK are reporting record-breaking numbers of bookings over the past few weeks - suggesting workers will pump billions of pounds back into the UK instead of spending their cash abroad , reports the Daily Telegraph .
Speaking to the newspaper , Justin Urquart Stewart , economist and director at Seven Investment Management , said : `` More people holidaying in the UK will hugely boost our economy at a time when we greatly need it .
`` Families spend around 20 per cent of their net incomes on holidays so the impact will be disproportionately large . As demand rises prices of UK AirBnb and hotel rooms will increase very quickly too , however . ''

So finally , the first step in the creation of Telangana has been taken . After at least half a century of agitation , the demand for this state has been conceded by the Union government . Yet , there can be no denial that the decision was driven totally by political expediency . The United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) government , which faces a tough general election in less than a year , decided to use statehood as a weapon to garner parliamentary seats .
There is no denying that India needs smaller states . Some states are simply too unwieldy—due to large populations spread over huge areas—to be effective administratively . The question is how to reorganize these states in an effective and least partisan manner ? It is not possible to avoid political considerations in the process as by its very nature the creation of new states is a political act . But at the very minimum concerns about administrative and financial viability of new states have to be addressed . The UPA 's handling of Telangana pushed all these issues to the background until only the maximization of political gains remained important .
There are three issues—one financial and the other two political—that need to be addressed carefully while forming new states .
First and foremost is the question of administrative and financial viability of the new states . Usually , when demands for statehood are made , there are equally strong claims about the viability of these states . In the case of Jharkhand , for example , it was claimed that abundance of mineral resources was enough to make the state prosperous . A decade later , the reality is different . Similar claims are being made in the case of Telangana . This welter of claims and doubts needs to be disentangled carefully . Otherwise , states are sure to fall back on an old demand : special status . Even mineral-rich states are not immune , Orissa is a good example .
The denial of a special status demand is not the end of special and extraordinary fiscal transfers from the Union government to the states . Very often , new states continue to get special grants and outright transfers for extended periods . A proliferation of such demands will be an unhealthy trend . Even as the demand for Telangana was agreed to , immediately there were cries for new states such as Vidarbha and Gorkhaland . If , hypothetically , the latter two are conceded they will certainly require financial help from the Centre for a long time . This has other repercussions . Transfers of resources from the Union government to the states are governed by the recommendations of the Finance Commission ( FC ) , a constitutional body . What will happen to FC recommendations when more and more states demand resources over and above what this body recommends ? It will , for starters , dilute FC 's recommendations and move away from rule-based fiscal transfers to a more ad-hoc system where political concerns will dictate such transfers . This will be a dangerous trend with unforeseen consequences .
Second , in the din of these demands the dangers of emergent federal imbalances have been lost sight of . In India , political representation of states in Parliament is not based on any theory of “ equality of states '' as , for example , in the US . The population of each state determines the number of members it sends to the Lok Sabha . Similarly , there is no notion of equality in the Rajya Sabha . Creation of smaller states automatically gives greater political power to large states . For example , the division of Andhra Pradesh—which had 42 members in the Lok Sabha—will undo this large majority . This also means one less state with 40 MPs or more . This means more political power to states such as Uttar Pradesh that have one less big state to contend with . To be sure , India is not a Union of warring or fractious states . But creating small states without ensuring equity in representation can have unforeseen political consequences . It will certainly upset the inter-state political equilibrium in the country .
Finally , there are strategic and national security issues in creating new states with ethnic majorities especially in border regions . The demand for Gorkhaland is one such example . Take a look at the map of the country and you will see the demand is being made in a region that provides a vital link to the North-Eastern states . This is a politically sensitive issue : the needs of ethno-linguistic minorities need to be balanced with broader concerns about national security .
The question of new states in India needs to be deliberated with care and sensitivity . It also requires a hard-nosed look at financial , administrative and national security concerns .

President Obama 's decision to reopen the US embassy in Havana and to begin easing commercial and travel restrictions continues to be regarded by supporters as the highpoint of Obama 's foreign policy agenda to date . But the move has its fair share of detractors , too . To understand the predominantly Republican opposition to trade liberalization with Cuba , we must look beyond the Cold War . We must look further back into America 's imperial past .
More Than a Cold War Hangover
The Democratic leadership has explained Obama 's sizeable shift in US policy toward Cuba . ‘ We will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests ' , Obama stated . ‘ Neither the American nor the Cuban people are well-served by a rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born . ' Nancy Pelosi similarly noted that ‘ we must acknowledge our policy towards Cuba is a relic of a bygone era that weakens our leadership in the Americas and has not advanced freedom and prosperity in Cuba . '
Obama and Pelosi should look much farther back than the 1961 Cuban Embargo . The unequal US-Cuban power relationship stretches back to the turn of the 20th century .
Americans may have largely forgotten the first 60 years of US interventions in Cuban affairs - from the late 19th century to the mid-20th - but Cuban memories are longer . When Fidel Castro took power in 1959 , his justification for doing so was not in stark cold-war anti-capitalistic terms . Rather , he harkened back to an earlier era of US-Cuban relations and to Cuba 's right to international freedom of trade . In a January 1959 speech , he warned that American diminution of Cuban sovereignty , stretching back to the late 19th century , would no longer be tolerated , and in front of the United Nations in 1960 , Castro denounced American economic nationalist policies toward Cuba , declaring that it was an inalienable right that Cuba be allowed to freely ‘ sell what it produces ' and to see its exports increase : ‘ Only egotistical interests can oppose the universal interest in trade and commercial exchange . ' So when the Eisenhower administration showed itself indisposed toward normalizing US-Cuban relations , Castro turned instead to the other major geopolitical player , the Soviet Union , ‘ to sell our products ' .
In January 1961 , stemming in part from the Cuban-Soviet trade agreement , the United States put in place the now infamous trade embargo against Cuba and severed diplomatic relations . The embargo has since stunted Cuban political and economic growth , and has accordingly served as an easy scapegoat for Fidel and his brother Raúl by allowing them to blame the United States for any and all economic woes befalling Cuba .
Even a cursory look at US trade policies toward other communist states shows how the US embargo against Cuba was - and remains - far more than a Cold War hangover .
Republican Imperialism of Economic Nationalism
In other words , if the embargo were merely an antiquated relic of the Cold War , how do we reconcile the contradiction of American trade liberalization with communist China during the Cold War , but not with Cuba even a quarter century after Cold War 's end ? Is it perhaps from political pressure from anti-Castro groups within the United States ? Considering that a majority of Cuban-American voters and US business interests would now favor easing political and economic restrictions against Cuba , that line of argument looks increasingly flimsy .
The primary inspiration for the Cuban embargo is something much more emotional and irrational than some outdated fear of communism at America 's backdoor . It is something that reaches back more than a century to America 's imperial past , something ingrained in the American psyche , a collective unconscious support for the nineteenth-century Monroe Doctrine : the self-ordained , unilateral US right to intervene in Western Hemispheric affairs . More specifically , the Cuban embargo is a modern-day manifestation of the Republican party 's longstanding imperialism of economic nationalism .
After the American Civil War , the Republican party stood proudly upon a political economic platform of high protectionism . And by the 19th century 's fin de siècle , it also stood proudly in demanding American colonialism . These two Republican planks - imperialism and economic nationalism - became entwined .
Republican President William McKinley , the ‘ Napoleon of Protection ' , oversaw the acquisition of a formal American empire following a successful US war against the Spanish in 1898 . Newly obtained American colonies now included the Philippines and Puerto Rico , and , more informally , Cuba .
Cuba had been guaranteed ostensible independence from the United States , but the 1901 Platt Amendment allowed the United States ‘ the right to intervene ' in Cuban affairs , including through military occupation , throughout the early twentieth century . The Republican administration of Teddy Roosevelt soon thereafter doubled down on undermining Cuban sovereignty through the restrictive 1903 Reciprocity Treaty , which maintained a discounted protective policy toward Cuban exports to protect US sugar growing interests . Following the treaty 's passage , Roosevelt expressed his private delight at the coercive idea of pulling Cuban political-economic strings through Republican-style trade reciprocity .
This despite the fact that Cuban liberals wanted free trade with the United States . In 1902 , for example , the Corporaciones Económicas , an influential conglomerate of Cuban creole businessmen , lobbied the US Congress for Cuban-American free trade . Luis V. de Abad , representing Cuban tobacco interests , at the same time was also appealing to Washington for trade liberalization instead of ‘ prohibitive ' tobacco duties of over 125 percent , which had left the Cuban worker with ‘ less bread and butter in his home ' , and more ‘ worse off than under Spanish domination ' . And Juan Gualberto Gómez , leader of the Cuban Liberal Party , similarly castigated the 1903 Reciprocity Treaty , calling instead for unrestricted free trade with the United States .
But Republican economic nationalist politicians ignored such cosmopolitan Cuban demands . As historian Mary Speck has explored , Republican protectionist unwillingness to grant free trade to Cuba would thereafter culminate in the 1930 Hawley-Smoot Tariff , ushering in a new Cuban ‘ era of economic depression and political unrest ' .
Cuba 's Century-Long Desire for Free Trade
So when Raúl Castro called for an end to the embargo based on economic and humanitarian grounds in late December , he was therefore just reiterating a century-long Cuban call for free trade with the United States – a call that has for so long fallen on deaf American ears .
From this longer perspective of US-Cuban trade relations , the 1961 Embargo Act marked not the beginning , but the high-water mark of American economic nationalist imperialism towards Cuba .
When Republican politicians today like former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida say liberalizing trade ‘ undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba ' , or when House Leader John Boehner suggests that normalizing relations ‘ should not be revisited ... until the Cuban people enjoy freedom ' , they are in fact undemocratically ignoring a century of Cuban demands for free trade .
Republican opponents of diplomatic normalization and trade liberalization also appear woefully ignorant of the fact that since the Second World War , Democratic and Republican administrations alike have advocated international trade liberalization for the expressed purpose of increasing political and economic freedom throughout the globe , even more so since the end of the Cold War . As Bill Clinton 's National Security Council advisor Anthony Lake put it in 1993 : ‘ On one side is protectionism and limited foreign engagement ; on the other is active American engagement abroad on behalf of democracy and expanded trade . '
Thus , when Florida 's Republican Senator Marco Rubio says ‘ this entire policy shift ... is based on an illusion , on a lie , the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people ' , he is reflecting a bygone Republican sentiment that was used to justify American imperialism toward Cuba a century ago : a protectionist sentiment that baldly contradicts the Republican party 's own neoliberal free-market rhetoric that it has espoused in the decades following the Second World War .
Rubio and other Republican detractors of Obama 's Cuban policy must throw away the antiquated remnants of America 's imperial past . Ending the Cuban embargo would be an excellent start .

Formed in the early 90s , the East Coast-based Hip Hop collective Hit Squad served as one of rap 's earliest crews and according to New Jersey emcee Redman , Hit Squad were the originators of the Hip Hop crew . He says the collective , which consisted of himself , EPMD , Das EFX , and a handful of other members , helped influence the likes of Wu-Tang Clan and Odd Future .
Redman spoke on the crew while breaking down a line from his Dare Iz A Darkside record , “ Rockafella R.I.P. ” On the song Redman raps , “ Sat down and opened my mind and said it 's time for me to design the right lines . ”
He later revealed that that particular lyric from “ Rockafella R.I.P. ” was his way of establishing himself as a solo artist .
“ At that time when I wrote that I was in the midst of establishing myself from a crew , ” he said during an interview with Rachel Leah . “ From a very large crew that really opened the door of crews out there like Wu-Tang and Odd Future and Young Money . We are the originators of having a crew . Hit Squad , do your homework . EPMD , Das EFX , K-Solo , Keith Murray . We the original ones . So , when I wrote that line I was in the midst of establishing myself to be different from the rest of my crew . Because everyone was large . Das EFX had a platinum record in '91 and they were from the East Coast . That 's unheard of . EPMD was constantly gold . K-Solo was spelling on the records to make himself stand out . So , when I was doing my albums and stuff I was still generated with my crew , but I had to let everybody know I was more funk . I was more lyrics . And I was lyrical skill . ”
Although Redman has n't released a solo studio album since 2010 , he says he has “ three treats ” prepared for fans this year , which include a Muddy Waters 2 mixtape , EP , and a studio album .
“ I got Muddy Waters 2 the mixtape . I got Muddy Waters 2 the EP . And Muddy Waters 2 the album , ” Redman said . “ So , y'all getting three treats this year . And the Red and Meth single for the Blackout 3 album . At the end of the year . ”
Primarily known for his work behind the mic , Redman has flaunted his production talents occasionally , but says it 's a craft he was never able to fully focus on and therefore put it to the side .
“ It started getting more advanced and I was doing a lot of other things too , ” the Newark , New Jersey rapper said . “ Just overall whenever you say you 're gon na do something I like to do it to the fullest and do it big . And I do n't like considering myself—I would n't stamp myself to be official unless I had more work and more practice in it . And when you call yourself a producer you have to be in it to win it every day learning and going through music and beats and trying to shit every day to call yourself a producer . And I was n't doing that every day . I would freelance with it here and there , but my thing was writing to be an emcee . So , I just stuck to that . ”

Since 2011 , French photographer Laurent Kronental has been working on an ongoing series documenting life on the edge of Paris in the “ grands ensembles. ” These monumental housing projects were built between the 1950s and the 1980s on the outskirts of major French cities as answers to a dearth of housing and an influx of foreign migrants . Aging monolithic concrete structures with an almost alien presence in the French landscape , they are a far cry from the Haussmannian apartment blocks that dominate central Paris and the world 's collective imagination about how the French live .

Kronental said in an artist 's statement that he is “ fascinated by these projects ' ambitious and dated modernistic features ” that “ are today often stigmatized by the media and marginalized by public opinion. ” He hopes that his images provide “ sharp contrast with these cliché views ” and celebrate the often overlooked “ urban veterans who have aged there . ”

The European Commission has said there is no legal obligation for countries to use recovered state aid to pay down national debt .
Speaking in Brussels on Wednesday , in the wake of a record ruling by the commission against Apple , a spokesman for commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that , like all state aid cases , “ the amounts that are recovered by a member state in a state aid investigation simply go back to the member state 's budget , and they can then , of course , use it for their own decisions . ”
EU sources told The Irish Times that , while the commission could not legally instruct Ireland how to use the recovered aid , it would likely strongly recommend that any windfall gains are used to pay down the national debt .
In its most recent country-specific recommendation for Ireland , which marked Ireland 's exit from the EU 's excessive deficit procedure , the commission said Ireland should “ use windfall gains from strong economic and financial conditions , as well as from asset sales , to accelerate debt reduction ” .
In addition , the country should “ reduce vulnerability to economic fluctuations and shocks , inter alia by broadening the tax base . . . enhance the quality of expenditure , particularly by increasing cost-effectiveness of health care and by prioritising government capital expenditure in R & D and in public infrastructure , in particular transport , water services and housing . ”
Policy recommendation
A high-ranking source in the European Commission said there is a “ policy recommendation , not a legally binding requirement ” , that Ireland should use any windfall cash for debt reduction .
He pointed to the “ long-standing policy recommendation ” of the commission that Ireland 's high level of debt should be reduced with any windfall , rather than using the cash for current or capital spending . This was reiterated as recently as earlier this year when the commission published its recommendations for Ireland .
They found that Ireland should use “ windfall gains from strong economic and financial conditions , as well as from asset sales , to accelerate debt reduction ” .
This is not a legal requirement , although any budget spending would have to conform to EU rules that limit the amount of current spending increases in any given year .
The revelation is likely to strengthen the hand of those arguing for the Government to retain the Apple cash . Government Ministers had previously insisted that even if Ireland kept the money , it would have to be all used for deficit reduction .
While the established procedure in EU state aid cases is that recovered money returns to the national exchequer , officials pointed out that the Apple ruling is unprecedented in size .
The previous record for an EU state aid judgment was a €1.3 billion ruling in 2014 involving Nürburgring racetrack in Germany .
The Apple judgment is also the first finding of its kind since the EU 's two-pack and six-pack rules were introduced at the height of the financial crisis . Like other bailout countries , Ireland is subject to additional layers of fiscal scrutiny because it is continuing to repay bailout loans to other euro zone member states through the ESM fund .
All euro zone countries must submit their budgets to the European Commission by October 15th this year .
Artificial reduction
After more than three years of investigations , the commission ruled on Tuesday that Ireland had helped Apple to artificially reduce its tax burden for more than two decades through two tax rulings it offered the company in 1991 and 2007 .
EU politicians widely welcomed the European Commission 's decision . The centre-left Socialist and Democrats group in the European Parliament congratulated the commission on the finding and called on the EU to establish a common corporate consolidated tax base ( CCCTB ) that would be mandatory across the EU . Ireland has previously opposed such a move . A revised CCCTB proposal is expected from the commission by the end of the year .
The payment of €13 billion , plus interest , demanded by the European Commission covers the years 2003-2014 . Ireland will be permitted to keep the payment in an escrow account pending appeal .
An appeal by Ireland and Apple could take up to six years , according to European Commission officials , as it is likely to go through both the General Court and European Court of Justice .
It is in our nature to look at the universe and wonder , `` How are all these great shows streaming for free on my phone ? `` A deceptively simple process begins in the distant reaches of space .
Immense pressure causes the nuclei of two humble hydrogen atoms to combine and release heat . This happens again and again , a chain reaction that reaches out across the vast emptiness of space from our star to arrive on our planet as that most precious catalyst for life : energy . It is this force that imbues plants and bacteria with the energy needed to reproduce and process carbon dioxide . The very first of these simple organisms created our atmosphere , but now we enjoy the protection of billions and billions of cubic meters of gas surrounding us and pressing down upon us .
Four billion years of evolution , countless failed species disappearing into the darkness of history , whittled down to the most successful . Above them all , standing on two legs , is mankind . We are no longer a part of this natural order . We no longer fear the woolly mammoth or the lobster . We collect our knowledge , one generation to the next , gradually building layers like the sediments of rocks .
As we compete for the sun 's energy with the plants and various lesser beings such as goats , we devise new and better ways to harness that energy . Batteries and windmills . The stored energy of fossil fuels . And as our knowledge has grown , century upon century , we have managed to construct , by overlapping schools of learning and ever-greater understanding of the world around us , a telephone .
Nothing is quite so sublime in this cosmos as realizing that two people might have just liked your photograph of dinner.It is small and robust , a black brick of metal and glass that sits in the palm of your hand . Without wires it can reach out across the planet , far beyond the horizon , and allow you to communicate with friends or loved ones . You can align similar jewels , communicate by written language to someone named KayCEEEEE , record six second videos of yourself trying to jump over a car off of your roof , and watch entire movies and TV shows including every episode of Cheers .
You can recall when Cheers aired originally . It was alright . But now , in the palm of your hand , the events surrounding Sam the bartender and the quirky patrons of the bar now seem enthralling . Certainly more interesting than a passing cloud , a nebula , or something as ludicrously uninteresting as the bacteria in a drop of water .
A child 's laugh can be heard from a nearby room . You can hear a child 's laugh whenever you want . The movie Babies is streaming directly to your phone . You can send texts to KAYCEEEEE while watching .
Imagine if you were completely flat , and you were inside your phone , enjoying the incredible games you can download for free . Imagine if you could watch pornography while driving in a car . This and more is possible through the scientific miracle of your phone , for what is a miracle but science that we fail to understand .
We have spent thousands of years as a species preparing for level 21.Science like wind or tectonic plates . You can watch videos about them on Youtube while you are on the bus and when you get off the bus and while you are eating and also while you are not eating . Watching videos is now possible in every setting . You can listen to audiobooks about zombies . You can play games about zombies and send texts about them . Talking trash . Texting trash . Checking your email and your stocks .
On August 14th , at around 2:15 AM in the northern hemisphere , if you look down at your phone you might just see the reflection of the Astrid Meteors passing overhead . They travel from the distant cold of the oort cloud once every 600 years and create a show so spectacular that its passing has been recorded in texts almost 3,000 years old . But do n't worry , someone will post a video of it . And you can watch that on the toilet , enjoying the boundless ingenuity of the upright two-legged mammals called mankind .
Stop looking at things around you , at the sights of nature and the sounds of your life , because you have the audiobook of Sarah Vowell 's Unfamiliar Fishes to get through and then all those podcasts have been piling up . You 're never going to get caught up at this rate .
As you enjoy your Candy Crush and your comment section posts , just be mindful that the lobsters are still here , that they , too , are deserving in inheritors of this process we call evolution . They are watching us and waiting for us to slip up . Waiting for us to stop paying attention completely .

Several months back I wrote a review of the Really Right Stuff SOAR BAI-AT adapter mount for the Accuracy International Chassis System . In the article , I discussed how there is a steadily increasing demand for tripod shooting solutions by precision rifle shooters for field expedient use in combat , competitions , hunting , and other shooting scenarios where a prone position is not suitable .
Since the time I wrote the review , the desire for shooters to utilize tripod has also expanded to a form of marksmanship exercise . Shooters want to learn and develop their skills shooting off of a tripod in order to enhance or otherwise expand their marksmanship capabilities . This is particularly true for shooters who are already proficient in the prone position , and want to challenge themselves further .
When I started using and experimenting with tripod shooting using the RRS BAI-AT , I used my Manfrotto 488RC2 ballhead ( Arca-Swiss clamp converted ) and Manfrotto 055XPROB tripod . The shooting experience was far from ideal and rather disappointing .
While the RRS BAI-IT Arca-Swiss dovetail mount adapter works great , the Manfrotto platform is not up to the task of providing a stable platform for the rifle .
I have always wanted a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead for photography . When I converted my 488RC to use an Arca-Swiss style clamp , it was mainly to keep my cost to start using L-plates on my cameras to a minimum .
But since I wanted to start experimenting with tripod shooting , I finally shelled out for the BH-55 .
There are several reasons why the Really Right Stuff BH-55 is a superior ballhead than the Manfrotto 488RC2 . The quality control and craftsmanship of the BH-55 is impeccable . The load capacity is 50 lbs vs 17.6 lbs .
The ballhead itself does not suffer from any lock up slack . This means that when you adjust whatever is mounted to the tripod and get it into the position you want , and then tighten the ballhead and let go of the device , it will not move . The Manfrotto 488RC2 suffered from significant lock up slack and it always annoyed me in my photography applications .
Then there is the thickness and rigidity of the ball stem to the clamp of the BH-55 . The stem is where the wobble of a heavy load manifested itself on the 488RC2 and I noticed significant movement .
When I acquired the BH-55 , I also acquired another set of tripod legs , but I did not go with Really Right Stuff . I ended up going with an Induro GIT-204 Stealth . The GIT-204 is a four section , carbon fiber tripod with a load capacity of 44.1lbs . I opted for the Induro because I was able to get them for a good price ( $ 209 USD ) and felt they were low risk .
I have never actually handled a Really Right Stuff tripod , I will say that they must be incredible tripods assuming they are better than the Induro , because the Induro GIT-204 is actually quite nice . Out of the box , the Induro shows good quality .
The twist lock legs function fine . The feet can be changed out for other feet or spikes that utilize a 3/8″-16 thread pitch . It comes with leg pads and the load capacity is sufficient for rifle shooting .
When I took the new RRS BH-55 and Induro GIT-204 setup out to the range and try it out , there was surprisingly more disappointment .
I discovered that while the RRS BH-55 ballhead was excellent in eliminating all the issues the Manfrotto RC2 introduced to the supporting platform , the carbon fiber legs of the Induro GIT-204 became the limiting factor . More specifically , the tripod leg segments were the limiting factor .
When shooting from the standing position , and all of the segments extended , the weakest point in the tripod support platform is where the legs are segmented . If any horizontal force is exerted or torque is introduced to the rifle , the legs will flex at the segment points / leg locks .
So in my experiments and practicing shooting the standing position with a tripod , I found that the elevation dispersion was minimized and mitigated by the rigidity of the RRS ballhead , but the windage / horizontal dispersion is still an issue ( while nowhere near as much as before ) due to the tripod leg flex .
I continued experimenting with the sitting position off of the tripod , and this rendered a far more stable shooting platform simply due to how the leg segments are not fully extended , and how the footprint is widened by the leg angle . This results in minimal horizontal play due to minimal flex in the tripod legs .
Up until that point in time , all of my tripod shooting was with the AICS due to the direct RRS SOAR BAI-AT mount adapter . My Savage 10FP in the McMillan A-5 stock has been getting a lot of range time ever since I revamped it with a new barrel , new detachable box magazine bottom metal , and a new scope .
But since the McMillan A-5 has no direct Arca-Swiss dovetail mount capabilities without a modification to the stock itself , I decided to acquire the Really Right Stuff SOAR VYCE Equipment Support Mount .
The VYCE Equipment Support Mount is essentially a vise clamp style adapter , similar to the more prevalent HOG Saddle currently in use by many military personnel ( refer to the first two Marine Corps photos at the beginning of this article ) .
The VYCE is hard anodized , CNC machined 6061-T6 and 7075 Aluminum and jaws open to three inches wide , which should accommodate most rifle forends .
The jaws have textured rubber pads to aid in gripping the rifle or other devices clamped into the VYCE .
While the VYCE jaws have ample clamping power , the jaws themselves are angled inward , which also aids in keeping the rifle clamped into the VYCE .
A while back I was looking at the HOG Saddle , and most of the examples of use involved direct mounting the HOG Saddle to the tripod itself ( and not via a ball head ) . There was not much emphasis placed on designing the bottom interface of the HOG Saddle to Arca-Swiss dovetails ( either directly or via an Arca-Swiss plate ) .
Since RRS products utilize the Arca-Swiss dovetail , they made sure the VYCE was machined to direct mount to an Arca-Swiss adapter for a rock solid platform . By default , the VYCE does not come with an Arca-Swiss plate and is setup for direct mount . But I elected to add the QR plate / VR-76 VYCE Rail with the VYCE when I ordered it .
Two screws secure the plate to the VYCE which eliminates rotation , and there are two stop screws specifically designed for RRS clamps , which help to keep the plate ( and VYCE ) from accidentally sliding off if the clamp is not fully tightened . So the RRS BH-55 and VYCE clamp interfaces quite nicely .
The rifle initially felt quite secure in the VYCE with no noticeable concerns about balance or stability .
After live firing the Really Right Stuff VYCE , I found it to be more pleasant to shoot as opposed to the directly mounted AICS with BAI-AT mount .
For some reason , the rifle in the VYCE seems to respond better when setting up the shot . I am not sure if is because the rubber pads of the VYCE jaws dampen the vibration .
During my initial use of the RRS VYCE , the QR plate actually came loose resulting in play between the VYCE and the plate . I hazard a guess it was not tightened adequately at the factory . I immediately torqued it down to using a 25 in-lb Fix-It Sticks / Sloky torque limiter . Also during the initial testing , I actually did not have the BH-55 clamp fully tightened onto the VYCE plate , and the VYCE slid back towards me during recoil . Thankfully , the stop screws did their job and kept the VYCE from completely sliding off the ballhead .
I was surprised by how well the VYCE grips the rifle stock . There is no slippage whatsoever between the VYCE jaws and the rifle stock . I think my only concern right now is the longevity of the rubber pads of the jaws and if they can be replaced easily .
Note that the Really Right Stuff SOAR VYCE is referred to by RRS as an Equipment Support Mount . This VYCE can also be used to grip other objects that can fit in the jaws of the VYCE such as laser rangefinders . This is useful if you have an optic that you need to use on a sturdy support platform , but the device does not have a direct tripod mount or compatible plate .
So after playing around with tripod shooting , I have a few thoughts on the matter .
The first is that tripod shooting is not easy . Even if you spend a lot of money on a tripod rig , you are not going to get a rock solid platform like a benchrest rig or simply shooting the prone position with a quality bipod and rear bag . Yes , a good tripod rig will be relatively stable , but it is not going to be so solid you wo n't have wobble or movement in the sight picture . A tripod is simply too big a support system with a lot of parts and adjustments that while convenient , leave room for intolerances when it comes to rigidity and stability . This is especially evident when trying to shoot from the standing position off of a tripod .
As I mentioned earlier , once you extend the legs of the tripod and utilize all of the sections , you introduce more instability due to the gradual reduction in section thickness from top to bottom ( due to the telescoping design of tripod legs ) . This results in more horizontal / windage instability .
So do not dump $ 1500 on a tripod rig and expect to shoot sub-MOA groups out of the box . I am not going to say you ca n't shoot tight groups off of a tripod . But it does take practice .
Along those lines , you can not skimp on a tripod rig without resulting in detrimental stability . I indicated earlier that I started playing around with rifle tripod shooting using my Manfrotto 488RC2 and 055XPROB tripod . While this setup was just barely enough to support the rifle ( approximately 17 lb load capacity ) , there was just too much wobble in the entire setup due to an aggregation of all the weak points in the tripod rig ( thin ball stem , sloppy ball head friction controls , etc . ) .
At the very least , spend on a high quality ballhead like the RRS BH-55 . When it comes to supporting a regular still camera , one could argue the BH-55 is over-engineered with its 50 lb load capacity .
But when you place a large object like a rifle on a ballhead , where you can exert lots of torsional force during the shot process , this begs for a very stout ballhead design .
As far as using a sling to stabilize the rifle and tripod platform , I honestly did not play around with this much at all and I do not think it adds much to the stability equation . If anything , I think it can hurt stability . Before everyone jumps on me for this statement , understand that I shot High Power Service Rifle for many years , and this is all shot using a sling for the sitting and prone positions . When trying to support the rifle with the body , a sling is excellent in that it helps to draw the rifle into the shooter firmly , eliminating all of the slack and rifle movement with respect to the shooter . The problem with trying to employ a sling with a tripod is that the positions that the tripods are used in keep the rifle relatively far away from the shooter 's body . The tripod itself is the support in this situation . So the sling does n't offer anything in this regard .
Now using the sling to somehow tighten up the rifle and eliminate movement in the platform is a bit misguided . If for instance you put a sling on the forend and bring it around/under the tripod and to the shooter 's body , this is no adding another vector or torque that is going against the tripod ballhead or mount point . Unless the position allows you completely draw the rifle into your body , the sling tension is going to amplify movement in the rifle while on the tripod .
I do feel that a sling can be helpful for recoil management when shooting off a tripod , and maybe this is enough to justify the use of a sling in some capacity with a tripod ( such as anchoring the tripod via a hook or eyelet on the tripod base ) .
In summary , I find tripod shooting to be a very challenging , but worthwhile method of shooting . While it is not meant to provide way to shoot benchrest-style groups , it is a excellent field expedient support mechanism for non-prone , non-traditional shooting position . Anyone that shoots “ in the field ” will benefit from the skills of shooting off of a tripod . With practice , shooting at least 2MOA should be a fairly speedy achievement . Getting to that 1MOA ( and sub-MOA ) hold with a tripod is where you need to invest the time ( and money ) in order to maximize your capabilities with a rifle and tripod setup .

Gaming peripheral manufacturer Razer filed a patent application for a peculiar type of keyboard and mouse , which might take the firm 's signature Chroma LED effects to the next level — by integrating LCD displays directly underneath the keys themselves .
If that sounds an awful lot like the Optimus keyboard of yore , do n't worry , this one appears to take a different path . Filed back in August and published on January 19 , the application is for an “ optically transmissive key assembly for display-capable keyboards , keypads , and other user input devices . ”
Instead of having a tiny OLED screen for each key , like the Optimus keyboard , Razer 's patent suggests that a single display would be embedded beneath the keys or body of a mouse , which would be optically transmissive , or transparent .
In the accompanying drawings , Razer gives up a few examples of how it might be used in practice . Seen here , an LCD panel lies beneath an optically transmissive layer on an individual key , or optically transmissive areas on , say , a gaming mouse .
“ A significant drawback or limitation associated with conventional keyboards is the static information , for instance static letters and numbers , that is displayed by individual keys of said keyboards , ” the patent reads . “ Unlike touchscreen interfaces , existing keyboards do not provide a user with dynamically changing interface via which a user can introduce inputs , instructions , and/or commands . ”
So , it appears that Razer aims to combine the customizable , interactive , and dynamic aspects of the touchscreen interfaces we all know and love , with the tactile feel of a mechanical keyboard or mouse . In another image included in the patent application , we can see a crude example of how this might work on a gaming mouse .
A display beneath the body of the mouse enables the device to have a customizable and interactive interface . Or as the Razer patent application describes it , “ a display screen configured to output variable image content ” which may or may not be a rigid display screen , or a flexible polymer-based screen .
It 's a very interesting patent application , and it goes on to describe some really innovative uses for OLED and LCD screens on , presumably , gaming peripherals . Still , do n't get too excited , this is just a patent application and the devices it describes could be months or even years away from hitting store shelves .
AURORA | Nothing at the old Fan Fare site at East First Avenue and Havana Street has ever moved with any notable pace .
For decades , the dilapidated old Fan Fare building sat vacant , a hulking and bizarre structure that irked generations of city leaders .
And after the wrecking ball finally tore through those gray-ivory covered slabs and the strange bulbous roof in 2014 , not a whole lot has changed at the site since . Dust to dust .
But now , local leaders say new life to the dirt lot is coming — albeit slowly .
Finally , after a few misses on the city 's initial request for development plans at the site , a developer is working with the city to turn the sprawling field into something cool .
“ It 's probably not going to be until late 2018 or 2019 when we see things happening , ” said Gayle Jetchick , executive director of the Havana Business Improvement District .
Jetchick said the development will likely include townhouses for sale and some rental apartments . The project will also include some retail and office space , she said .
For now , she said , crews have been at the site taking soil samples , and city officials are working to rezone the area so the project can get rolling .
Andrea Amonick , manager of the city 's Development Services Division , said the city has a “ pre-development ” agreement in place with Dillon Place Development Group . That January deal between Dillon Place and the Aurora urban Renewal Authority allows the developer 120 days to conduct due diligence for the Fan Fare redevelopment .
“ During this time , AURA staff has worked with the developer and reviewed preliminary financial feasibility . The proposed project meets the goals of the Havana North Urban Renewal Plan , and if it is determined that the project is financially feasible , staff will initiate negotiations for a purchase and redevelopment agreement , ” Amonick said in a statement .
The proposal as it stands now calls for 207 mid-rise multifamily rental units , 86 for-sale townhomes , 19,700 square feet of retail and commercial space and a 14,000 square foot mixed-use building , she said .
The site has long been a troubled one for Aurora leaders .
Built in 1961 , Fan Fare was originally a sprawling indoor discount market . Some documents say the original spelling of the building was “ Fan Fair , ” though city documents in recent years spell it Fan Fare or Fanfare .
After just four years in business — years marked by what was reportedly a massive grand opening and one of the first large-scale shopping centers open on Sundays in metro Denver — the business went under in 1965 and Western Electric moved in , using the building for training purposes .
In the mid-1980s Western Electric left , and for two decades the building has been fenced off with weeds poking up from every crack in the asphalt .
In 2004 , the building 's owners filed plans with the city to tear down Fan Fare and build two high-rise condominiums on the site . The building would have been the largest in the city , and officials said they could help turn that stretch of Havana Street into a posh , upscale neighborhood .
But the developers needed some incentives from the city to pull off the project and as those negotiations dragged on , the plan fizzled .
After that , the owners briefly floated an idea to clean up the building and use it as a storage facility until they could get the tower project moving again . But that idea flopped , too .
There were later rumors of smaller condos on the site but that idea , like seemingly everything with Fan Fare over the years , went nowhere .
Along the way , Fan Fare found some supporters , including the Aurora Historic Preservation Commission , who in 2010 launched an effort to save the building . The building was one of the first large-scale shopping centers in the area , and the commission pointed to its unique architectural design that used exterior supports instead of interior columns to prop-up the ceiling as a reason to save it . But their efforts did n't go far and eventually the city stepped in .
In late 2014 , after the land was purchased through Aurora Urban Renewal Authority — the city 's de facto organ for urban renewal projects — and the building had been demolished , AURA put out a request for plans to redevelop the area . Just two developers presented projects , and neither fit the city 's requirements for the sort of mixed-use development that could revitalize the neighborhood .
The Air Force 's robotic X-37B space plane , encapsulated in its fairing , being readied for attachment to its Atlas V rocket ahead of a planned May 20 , 2015 launch .
The United States Air Force 's robotic X-37B space plane will carry a NASA experiment to orbit when it launches on its next mystery mission Wednesday ( May 20 ) .
The NASA payload , called the Materials Exposure and Technology Innovation in Space ( METIS ) investigation , aims to test how the space environment affects certain materials . The experiment is packed aboard the unmanned X-37B spacecraft , which is scheduled to blast off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on Wednesday at 10:45 a.m. EDT ( 1445 GMT ) from Florida 's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station .
`` By exposing materials to space and returning the samples to Earth , we gain valuable data about how the materials hold up in the environment in which they will have to operate , '' said METIS principal investigator Miria Finckenor , a materials engineer at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center . [ See photos of the X-37B 's fourth mission ]
`` Spacecraft designers can use this information to choose the best material for specific applications , such as thermal protection or antennas or any other space hardware , '' Finckenor added .
METIS will use some of the same materials as those placed on the International Space Station for the Materials on International Space Station Experiment ( MISSE ) , which operated between 2001 and 2013 and flew more than 4,000 samples into space . Part of the goal is to look for more environmentally friendly materials that can be used in space , researchers said .
`` When we flew newly developed static-dissipative coatings on MISSE-2 , we did not know they would be used for both the Curiosity rover and the SpaceX Dragon , '' Finckenor said in the same statement . ( MISSE included several sets of experiments , and MISSE-2 was the second one . ) `` Some program we do n't know about now will be successful because engineers found the data they needed '' on this experiment .
The reusable X-37B , which takes off vertically and lands horizontally on a runway , last landed in October 2014 after spending 674 days in orbit . It has flown three space missions so far , conducting activities that are mostly classified .
The Air Force owns two X-37B spacecraft , both of which were built by Boeing 's Phantom Works division . The vehicles look like NASA 's now-retired space shuttle orbiters , but are much smaller — just 29 feet long by 9.5 feet tall ( 8.8 by 2.9 meters ) , with a wingspan of 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) . In fact , two X-37Bs could fit inside the space shuttle 's payload bay .
The X-37B mission launching Wednesday is called OTV-4 ( short for Orbital Test Vehicle-4 ) . Air Force officials have not said how long the mission will last .

When troops placed Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe under house arrest Wednesday in what appeared to be a military coup , it was n't just the possible unseating of the country 's long-time president . It was the political unraveling of a man who had , in many ways , often seemed to be Zimbabwe personified – in both its brightest days and its most troubled .
By the time tanks rolled into Harare the day before , Mr. Mugabe had presided over nearly four tumultuous decades of Zimbabwean history . His time in office stretched from the country 's early years as the international poster-child for the hopeful possibilities of African independence to its slow-motion economic collapse at the turn of the 21st century . That longevity earned him a dubious distinction – the last remaining independence-era president still in power in Africa .
But on Wednesday , Mugabe 's legacy was suddenly thrown against a stark new backdrop . As the military patrolled the streets of the capital , Zimbabwean Army officer Maj. Gen. Sibusiso Moyo assured citizens that the military was not staging a coup , simply “ targeting criminals. ” But semantics aside , the set up was a familiar one : Mr. Moyo had made his announcement after seizing control of the state broadcaster , and tanks idled near important government buildings .
However the military takeover ultimately plays out , it marks an abrupt chapter break in the history of a country where , until two days ago , the president 's 37-year rule seemed almost entirely unshakable .
For Mugabe 's supporters , after all , he was a living icon , a man “ who stood for the economic empowerment of the Zimbabwean people , [ giving ] land to the black majority who had lost it to colonialists , ” says Fortune Mloyi , a supporter of Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front ( ZANU–PF ) who asked to be identified by a pseudonym because of the current political uncertainty . “ It is a legacy that many other African countries are still trying to follow . ”
'The greatest leader '
Mugabe 's rule , indeed , began with almost unimaginable promise .
Just after midnight on April 18 , 1980 , at a soccer stadium in Harare , Mugabe and thousands of other onlookers watched as a cadre of white soldiers dressed in the scarlet uniforms of the colonial government marched lockstep with the camouflage-clad guerrilla fighters they had spent more than a decade locked in a brutal civil war against . Then the two groups stopped , pivoted , and in unison saluted the flag of their newly independent black nation .
“ If yesterday you hated me , today you can not avoid the love that binds you to me and me to you , ” promised Mugabe , a bespectacled intellectual and former guerrilla leader – and now the prime minister of the minutes-old country . “ Oppression and racism are inequities that must never again find scope in our political and social system . ”
It seemed to many the beginning of a new era , a remarkable rewrite of an earlier generation of African independence struggles , which had seen white settlers flee en masse the day a black government took the reins . And few doubted that the man at the podium was the right person for the job .
Mugabe 's “ intellect and vision has no obvious equal among the continent 's leaders , ” effused The New York Times at the time , and his country was “ the linchpin of peace and the model of racial harmony ” for the region .
“ The way he transformed the country 's education by providing free and compulsory primary education to all , the way he led an agricultural revolution , and the way he negotiated peace around the world made us believe we had the greatest leader we could ever get , ” says Simba Makoni , who in the years after independence was a rising star in ZANU–PF .
During , the first decade of Zimbabwe 's independence , the country 's rates of infant mortality and malnutrition plummeted , while literacy and life expectancy shot up . In the 1980s , Mugabe 's government resettled about half a million people on land it bought from willing white farmers , a project The Economist would later call “ perhaps the most successful aid programme in Africa . ”
But even then , the cracks were beginning to show .
An unimaginable departure
As Zimbabwe found itself celebrated around the world for its progress in health , development , and racial reconciliation , the country 's Army was carrying out a brutal campaign against the president 's political rivals . Between 1983 and 1987 , as many as 20,000 people – many connected only loosely , if at all , to the Zimbabwe African People 's Union opposition party – were murdered across southern Zimbabwe by Mugabe 's notorious North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in an operation that became known as Gukurahundi , or “ the rain that washes away the chaff . ”
“ He carried some wartime grudges for the rest of his life , ” says Mr. Makoni , who later became finance minister . “ He thought he was surrounded by enemies , especially among fellow liberation war fighters. ” And so , he says , it became increasingly difficult for him to imagine anyone else taking over his party and his country – and increasingly it became difficult for other Zimbabweans to imagine it , either .
“ We have lived with this guy for all of our lives , ” says Mavuso Tshabalala , who was 3 years old when Mugabe came to power and remembers no other president .
That has meant that even as Zimbabwe has slid into startling economic collapse in recent years , few could imagine it would mean regime change . In late 2008 , hyperinflation in the country reached a darkly comical 79.6 billion percent as the country scrambled to print enough one hundred trillion notes . Between 2000 and 2015 , the economy halved , and emigration escalated . Today , estimates place the number of Zimbabweans living abroad as high as 3 million in a population of 14 million .
Civil servants frequently go unpaid , currency values are sharply different on the black and legal markets , and there are so few formal jobs that as much as 95 percent of the working population does so informally .
“ Whether educated or not , we all have been reduced to [ street ] vendors , that is if you chose the route of staying in the country , ” says Jackie Manemo , who is trained as a scientist but now sells clothing she buys from South African shops at a markup in the central Zimbabwean city of Kwekwe .
Uncertain hope
Still , few in Zimbabwe expected the events of recent days . Even last week , when the president abruptly fired his vice president , Emmerson Mnangagwa , a longtime ally and fellow liberation fighter , few predicted Mugabe was on his way out . Instead , it looked like he had simply cleared the way for a dynastic succession – the most likely new vice president being his own wife .
“ We knew that the military had sympathies towards [ Mr. Mnangagwa ] and that they would n't take too kindly to his ouster , however , the manner and speed with which this was all undertaken took us by surprise , ” says Maggie Mzumara , a Harare-based political analyst .

And that surprise , she says , brought with it hope , but also profound uncertainty . There has , after all , never been a Zimbabwe without Robert Mugabe .
“ It is good news that he is finally leaving us , but my worry is on who is next and what his stance will be towards the people of Zimbabwe , ” says Mr. Tshabalala . “ People have suffered enough . ”
While both Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross are undoubtedly firm Uncharted fan favorites , it 's fair to say that , until now , they have very much been ‘ supporting players ' in Naughty Dog 's long-running saga . Of course , that changes with Uncharted : The Lost Legacy , with the pair snatching the starring role away from Nathan Drake .
It 's a big , ballsy move for a series with such an iconic hero attached , and adds a fascinating , unexpected new dimension to its impending return . So , ahead of the game 's August launch , I caught up with the game 's creative director , Shaun Escayg to talk a little more about the challenges the team faced in sidelining Drake , and learned a little about what we can expect from Chloe and Nadine .
Nadine and Chloe are an uneasy alliance
“ There 's a lot of fandom around Chloe – people liked her – but we knew very little about her. ” Shaun explains , discussing the team 's decision to make Chloe the game 's main playable character .
“ As you saw in Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3 , she was a sidekick character who always bailed out when things got too tough ; always chose self-preservation over heroism and that 's really what led us to her as a character . Why does she always bail out ? Why wo n't she finish the job ? Does she have what it takes ? We wanted to answer those questions . ”
What defines the Uncharted series as much as the eye-popping set-pieces is the banter that plays out between its characters – duly , Drake has almost always had a tag-along for company . The Lost Legacy was keen to keep the tradition alive .
“ When we settled on Chloe we tried pairing her up with a whole line of different characters : Sullivan , Cutter… And then we thought , okay , who 'd be the best and worst person to pair with Chloe Frazer ? Nadine Ross was the obvious choice .
“ Nadine is pragmatic ; a militant leader suffering the loss of her father 's business and desperate to regain control of that . Chloe is an enigmatic , double-dealing hustler – the complete opposite really – but they both share a common thread : self-preservation . Together they provided the perfect brew for storytelling – will these characters betray each other or will they stick it out ? ”
And this idea of unpredictable heroes seems to be a key theme for the writers in The Lost Legacy . As Shaun explains , “ Just the nature of Chloe herself is… shifty . She 's not a character who you would normally think of as a hero . And as for Nadine Ross – I mean , she was the villain in Uncharted 4 !
“ This world of thieves is complex . Everyone has perks : they 're still human , they still have personal goals , they still have a backstory you can relate to . Once you find out what makes them interesting – for us it was self-preservation versus self-sacrifice – you have to give them that goal , give them that reason to put everything at risk for the greater good . ”
The story opens up the Uncharted franchise in new ways
What this ultimately means for gamers is that they have the chance to really get a feel for both Nadine and Chloe , outside of their familiar antagonist roles .
“ You will learn some stuff that you would have never known about Nadine – there 's a side of her you really would n't expect , ” says Shaun .
“ Chloe has a very interesting past – there 's a struggle there coming from some very deep-rooted pain . Seeing Chloe 's perspective of the world opens up the world itself – in my opinion it 's the best of Uncharted . ”
The team are clearly passionate about the story and the characters , and they do n't want it to feel like an accompanying act to the gameplay – they want it to be an integral part of the experience . So , as detailed in our recent hands-on report , a more open , less linear structure to how the game plays out has given Chloe and Nadine room to breathe .
“ There are some side quests where you can get treasures and emblems that give you a little more context of the region and the history of The Eleven Kings . It also gives you a little more time to spend with these characters and build that bond – or splinter it . ”
To leave discovery of so many details up to the curiosity of the player is a brave move for the Uncharted franchise , where story has always taken the role of a central thread that unfolds over the course of play . But it was a conscious decision .
“ In this open world space you have options . You can go straight across it , moving from point to point , or you can spend many hours in one spot and learn a lot more about the world , the characters and their relationships . ”
Your relationships affect how the action plays out
While all this is definitely * ahem * uncharted territory for the series , Shaun and the team wanted to take things a step further and try something slightly more radical .
“ One area that we 're really proud of is the ‘ spilling ' of narrative into gameplay , ” Shaun explains . “ If the characters are doing well – if they 're having a good time and bonding – then gameplay is at its most efficient : you 're fighting and Nadine is there kicking some ass .
“ If the characters are at odds , though , you may have more difficulty . Your partner may be upset with you , may leave you – abandon you – may go do her own thing and this is really , really exciting for us at Naughty Dog because we 're always trying to blur the line between cut-scene , in-game and gameplay . ”
Since the very first entry way back in 2007 , one of the key philosophies behind the Uncharted series was ‘ always on the stick ' . Put simply , if a moment of action or drama could be controlled by the player rather than being a cut-scene that 's how the team would do it . So while The Lost Legacy is trying plenty of new things with its characters and gameplay dynamics , in this regard it 's as true to that founding philosophy as the series has ever been .
With the game 's 23rd August release just a few weeks away , you 've not long to wait until you get to experience this new take on Naughty Dog 's enduring series for yourselves .
With perovskites having achieved conversion efficiency increases from 3.8 % to 21 % in a short period , Lux Research reported today that , `` the efficiency question has been answered . '' While questions remain as to perovskite 's cost effectiveness and the `` feasibility of real-world efficiencies , '' Lux reports that new partnership opportunities with universities are available .
The durability of perovskites , when exposed to real-world conditions , is also an ongoing concern with the technology , indicating the importance of encapsulation for perovskite PV applications .
Lux has presented its findings today in a new report , The Rise of Perovskites : Identifying Academic Partners to Work With .
`` Demonstration of their [ perovskites ] potential for high performance by academic labs has caused research groups to consider spinning off start-ups , meaning companies need to consider opportunities now ,  Lux Research Associate and lead author Tyler Ogden notes .
The Lux report notes that opportunities for companies to partner with perovskite researchers still exist , including with Nam-gyu Park of Sungkyunkwan University and Yang Yang of University of California Los Angeles .
`` The Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore are also promising developers , '' writes Lux .
Some early-stage companies have already established partnerships with perovskite developers . These include Australia 's Dyesol , which is partnering with organic PV pioneer Michael Grätzel at the Ècole Polytechnique Fédérale ( EPF ) , and Oxford PV , which has teamed up with Henry Snaith at Oxford University . Poland 's Salue Technologies has links to the University of Valencia and Fron Materials , from the National Taiwan University .
In an interesting finding , Lux notes that Chinese researchers are leading the academic publication race in the perovskite field , while `` more impactful '' research has emanated from countries such as Israel , Switzerland , Singapore and the UK .
Perovskite tandem applications are particularly promising , with Lux noting a perovskite/CIGS tandem cell has achieved 21.7 % efficiency . PERC pioneer Martin Green , from the University of New South Wales , is pursuing perovskite/crystalline silicon PV applications . A team from Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin ( HZB ) and the EPF recently achieved 18 % efficiency on a perovskite/heterojunction cell using a low-temperature process .
What may be the earliest remaining neon sign in Los Angeles—the 1927 sign that once sat atop Westlake 's Hotel Californian near Mac Arthur Park—will blink back to brilliant life tomorrow .
The 40-foot-by-15-foot , red-and-blue sign will light up for the first time since it was rescued from a city storage yard near Griffith Park , where it and a companion sign had languished since the 1925-era Hotel Californian at Sixth and Bonnie Brae streets was demolished after an arson fire in 1995 .
`` It 's one of the earliest—if not the earliest—remaining signs in Los Angeles , which in and of itself gives it a cachet that not many other things have , '' said neon sign restoration specialist Paul Greenstein , who painstakingly restored and renovated the sign over the course of three years .
The sign will sit atop the newly constructed Paseo at Californian on the site of the old hotel . The building comprises 53 affordable apartments for low-income families and was developed through a partnership of city and state agencies , according to Richard Schave , an LA architectural historian and founder of Esotouric , which will take part in Thursday 's ribbon-cutting ceremony .
The sign almost did n't make it . Owners of the Hotel Californian constructed two neon signs in 1927 , two years after the hotel opened . That was only a few years after the first neon signs appeared in the United States around 1923 , Greenstein said .
The signs sat in a city storage lot near Griffith Park for nearly two decades after they were removed . One was in pretty good shape ; the other was “ just trashed , ” Greenstein said . Rumors say actress Diane Keaton got the good one to put in her backyard ; Curbed was not able to confirm that .
Greenstein was commissioned to restore the remaining one , working with Sign Image in Chatsworth on the project .
`` It was cut in half . It was rusted out . It was graffitied . It was smashed . It was bent . It was on the cusp of not retrievable , '' he recalled .
Ultimately , Greenstein determined he could salvage the sign . He cut the sign 's letters off the old twisted frame , which had been cut into pieces to be removed from the old building . He straightened them out and reworked them , adding new metal where necessary .
`` When I stripped it , there 's always bits of original paint left over . ... And I could see the interior was cream-colored , and the exterior was ... orange . Like a Creamsicle , '' Greenstein said . `` And the letters 'Hotel ' are neon red . And the word 'Californian ' is mercury argon blue . ''
Finally , he and his crew reinstalled the sign on a new frame the builders of the Paseo constructed on the roof . Greenstein only began relighting the sign this week . It will light up completely for the first time in decades on Thursday .
Schave said the sign 's restoration is important for Los Angeles . `` Neon signs are really important , '' he told Curbed . `` Electrographic architecture , as Tom Wolfe called it . And it is one of the most iconic aspects of Los Angeles design and its silhouette and landscape ... So this is really important . It 's one of the earliest , and it should be celebrated . ''
For Greenstein , the sign 's revival is personal . `` I 'm proud of it , '' he said . `` When it 's running , it 's going to be a pretty impressive thing . You 're going to be able to see this thing from any of the office towers downtown . ... So that it gives it a kick in the ass . And then just the fact that someone 's putting some money into something in the MacArthur Park area is a kick in the ass . ''
Greenstein will speak at Thursday 's ceremony , as will civic leaders responsible for the Paseo . The ceremony begins at 10:30 a.m. at 1907 West 6th Street .
Iran said over the weekend that it had recovered the RQ-170 , the same drone deployed over Osama bin Laden 's compound before he was killed in May . Senior intelligence officials were disturbed that the drone was publicly discussed in the coverage of the Bin Laden raid , in part because of the fear of exposing its use over Iran .
A statement Sunday from the American-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said Iran might have recovered an “ unarmed reconnaissance aircraft ” lost while “ flying a mission over western Afghanistan. ” But several experts noted that the stealth technology of the RQ-170 — which greatly reduces the chances that the drone can be detected by radar — had little use in western Afghanistan , because the Taliban have no radar to detect flights .
Iranian officials have said that the aircraft was detected near the town of Kashmar , 140 miles from the Afghan border , and that it was shot down or crashed because its control systems were hacked by the Iranian military . American officials say that those stories are fanciful , and that the drone was lost because of a malfunction .
Either way , the centerpiece of what had been a covert program is now in the hands of Iranian forces , which may share the captured technology with other countries . There are differing accounts of the extent of the damage to the craft ; Iran has not published photographs of the wreckage , though officials have said video of the drone may soon be broadcast on television .

Two officials said that the United States briefly considered going in to retrieve the downed drone , or to destroy it , as first reported Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal , but the operation was deemed too risky . There are questions about whether Iran could reverse-engineer the technology , though they certainly could sell the vehicle to China , Russia or other countries with a deep interest in it .
“ The flights from Moscow and Beijing to Tehran were probably quite full the last few days , ” said P. W. Singer , who studies military robotics at the Brookings Institution .
Mr. Singer said that the most sought-after technology on the craft is probably its array of sensors , which may include sophisticated radar that is more advanced than anything Russia or China use currently .

Dennis M. Gormley , a missile and drone expert at the University of Pittsburgh , said reverse-engineering the aircraft itself would be difficult even for a sophisticated military . “ Unless somebody put the engineering drawings in the U.A.V. , ” he said , using the abbreviation for unmanned aerial vehicle , “ it wo n't be easy . In any complex piece of aviation equipment , you have to replicate the tolerances precisely . ”

In Abbottabad , Pakistan , the RQ-170 was used to model the Bin Laden compound . In Iran , among other missions , it is looking for tunnels , underground facilities or other places where Iran could be building centrifuge parts or enrichment facilities .
One such site , outside Qum , was revealed by President Obama and the leaders of France and Britain in 2009 , though it appears that Israel played a major role in detecting that site . One senior official said recently that “ we 've got nothing of that scale yet , ” but added “ we are looking every day . ”
Surveillance of Iran is nothing new : American satellites have been trained on its nuclear facilities , their missile bases and their defenses for many years . But the RQ-170 Sentinel , which can fly at an altitude of 50,000 feet , is considered vital to the effort .
While an orbiting surveillance satellite can observe a location for only a few minutes at a time , a drone can loiter for hours , sending a video feed as people move about the site . Such a “ pattern of life , ” as it is called , can give crucial clues to the nature of the work being done , the equipment used and the size of the work force .
“ It 's basically like staking out a Mafia social club , ” said John Pike , who tracks military technology at the Web site GlobalSecurity.org . “ If I 'm just looking at brick-and-mortar targets , satellite 's fine . But if I want to see what people are doing all day , the drone is a whole lot better . ”
In addition to video cameras , independent experts say the drone almost certainly carries communications intercept equipment and sensors that can detect tiny amounts of radioactive isotopes and other chemicals that can give away nuclear research .
News reports in South Korea in 2009 said the United States planned to base the RQ-170 drone there to fly surveillance missions over North Korea , whose nuclear and missile programs are a top American intelligence target .
Zimbabweans celebrate outside the parliament building immediately after hearing the news that President Robert Mugabe had resigned , in downtown Harare , Zimbabwe Tuesday , Nov. 21 , 2017 .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( AP ) — Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe , who once vowed to rule for life , resigned on Tuesday , succumbing to a week of overwhelming pressure from the military that put him under house arrest , lawmakers from the ruling party and opposition who started impeachment proceedings and a population that surged into the streets to say 37 years in power was enough .
The capital , Harare , erupted in jubilation after news spread that the 93-year-old leader 's resignation letter had been read out by the speaker of parliament , whose members had gathered to impeach Mugabe after he ignored escalating calls to quit since a military takeover . Well into the night , cars honked and people danced and sang in a spectacle of free expression that would have been impossible during his years in power , whose early promise after the end of white minority rule in 1980 was overtaken by economic collapse , government dysfunction and human rights violations .
“ Welcome to the new Zimbabwe ! ” people chanted outside the conference center where the lawmakers had met . “ This is the best day of my life , ” one man declared as euphoric citizens celebrated on top of cars , clustered around a tank and shook hands with soldiers who were hailed as saviors for their role in dislodging Mugabe , a once-formidable politician who crushed dissent or sidelined opponents but , in the end , was a lonely figure abandoned by virtually all his allies .
“ Change was overdue . ... Maybe this change will bring jobs , ” said 23-year-old Thomas Manase , an unemployed university graduate .
It was a call echoed by many , and which pointed to the challenges ahead for Zimbabwe , which used to be a regional breadbasket but has since suffered hyperinflation , cash shortages , chronic mismanagement and massive joblessness . And , while Zimbabweans seemed almost universally united in their wish to see an end to the Mugabe era , the hard work of building institutions and preparing for what they hope are free and fair elections scheduled for next year has yet to begin .
Mugabe , who was the world 's oldest head of state , said in his resignation letter that legal procedures should be followed to install a new president “ no later than tomorrow . ”
“ My decision to resign is voluntary on my part and arises from my concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe and my desire for a smooth , non-violent transfer of power , ” Mugabe said in the message read out by parliamentary speaker Jacob Mudenda .
Recently ousted Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa was to take over as the country 's leader within 48 hours so that he can move “ with speed to work for the country , ” said a ruling party official , Lovemore Matuke . Mnangagwa , who fled the country after his Nov. 6 firing , “ is not far from here , ” Matuke added .
Mugabe 's resignation ended impeachment proceedings brought by the ruling ZANU-PF party after its Central Committee voted to oust him as party leader and replace him with Mnangagwa , a former justice and defense minister who served for decades as Mugabe 's enforcer , a role that earned him the moniker , “ Crocodile. ” Many opposition supporters detest Mnangagwa and believe he was instrumental in the army killings of thousands of people when Mugabe moved against a political rival in the 1980s .
So far , Mnangagwa has used inclusive language , saying in a statement before Mugabe 's resignation that all Zimbabweans should work together to advance their nation .
“ Never should the nation be held at ransom by one person ever again , whose desire is to die in office at whatever cost to the nation , ” Mnangagwa said .
Zimbabwe 's military commander , Gen. Constantino Chiwenga , warned people not to target old adversaries following Mugabe 's resignation . “ Acts of vengeful retribution or trying to settle scores will be dealt with severely , ” he said .
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Zimbabweans to maintain calm . The U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe said Mugabe 's resignation “ marks an historic moment ” and that “ the path forward ” should lead to free and fair elections . British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Mugabe was “ a despot who impoverished his country ” and his exit is a “ moment of joy ” for Zimbabwe .
The end for Mugabe came when his wife , Grace Mugabe , positioned herself to succeed her husband , leading a party faction that engineered Mnangagwa 's ouster . The prospect of a dynastic succession alarmed the military , which confined Mugabe to his home last week and targeted what it called “ criminals ” around him who allegedly were looting state resources — a reference to associates of the first lady .
In his early days as leader , after a long war between black guerrillas and the white rulers of Rhodesia , as Zimbabwe was known before independence , Mugabe stressed education and built new schools . Tourism and mining flourished . But in 2000 , violent seizures of thousands of white-owned farms began , causing agricultural production to plunge . A land reform program was supposed to take much of the country 's most fertile land and redistribute it to poor blacks , but Mugabe instead gave prime farms to ZANU-PF leaders and loyalists , relatives and cronies .
As the years went by , Mugabe was widely accused of hanging onto power through violence and vote fraud , notably in a 2008 election that led to a troubled coalition government after regional mediators intervened . Still , he cast himself as a voice of pride and defiance in modern Africa , a message that resonated in many countries that had experienced Western colonialism or intervention .
Mugabe once said he wanted to rule for life , expressing a desire to live until he is 100 years old . He also said he was ready to retire if asked to do so by his supporters .
A year ago , he said : “ If I am to retire , let me retire properly . ”

Working as a foreigner in a Japanese company can be a daunting experience . Understanding these three simple words will help you build the trust you need to thrive in a Japanese office .
By Michael Gakuran Mar 27 , 2014 5 min read
Being a foreigner in a Japanese company can be a daunting experience . Differing work ethics and cultural gaps pose many challenges to employees who hail from overseas , even after mastering the Japanese language to a high level .
Office expectations are not always communicated clearly and , even for new Japanese employees , it can be tricky to fit into the company without the background knowledge of business etiquette . Although there 's no single list of points that can address this issue , there are some key concepts that go a long way towards bettering the situation .
One exceptionally useful management concept that helps foster better communication between employees is the notion of ‘ Hou-Ren-Sou ‘ . It 's a play on words – a homophone for the Japanese word for spinach – and is comprised of three characters , each an abbreviation of a separate word that together result in stronger collaboration and better information flow within the company .
The three pillars to this concept are as follows :
報告 ( ほうこく ) – Reporting
連絡 ( れんらく ) – Informing
相談 ( そうだん ) – Consulting
Together they produce 報・連・相 ( ほう・れん・そう ) .
When being entrusted with an assignment , company employees are expected to follow this protocol . Failure to do so results in concern from management about your ability to get the job done and a missed opportunity to strengthen relationships and build trust with colleagues . Building trust within the company is one of the most incredibly important aspects of working with Japanese people ( although certainly not exclusive to Japan ) , and it greatly affects all current and future projects you may deal with . As I heard it put at one PR seminar ‘ 80 % of the work and success in public relations is building trust within the company ' .
Although hou-ren-sou is not the definitive answer to building good relationships with Japanese colleagues ( there are many other cultural and linguistic points that can be made ) , it is a good starting block .
* * * * * * * * * *
Reporting ( Houkoku )
When entrusted with a project , reporting back to your boss on the status of your work is essential . To what degree will depend on the company and the work itself , but a useful gauge is to note when your boss asks you ‘ what is the status of the project ? ' . If you 're hearing this , it means you have n't reported enough .
To really understand this point , it 's necessary to put yourself in the position of your boss and consider things from their point of view . This can be tricky if you 've never been in a managerial role yourself , as you may not be able to fully appreciate the plethora of things a manager must constantly be aware of .
However , thinking of others ( which in many cases means thinking of things from the perspective of others ) is the cornerstone of success in a Japanese company because it grants you the ability to anticipate needs before they are spoken – a trait highly valued in Japan .
Your boss likely has greater things to worry about than following your project closely , so a frequent report on what 's going on will help them to fit the pieces together with other things going on in the company and in turn enable them to trust you , which leads to greater things down the line .
Informing ( Renraku )
Informing sounds very similar to reporting , but the key thing to note about this pillar of the trio is that the informing is done to the stakeholders – usually colleagues and those involved or affected by your project . This is linked to the Japanese concept of nemawashi – ‘ digging around the roots ' referring to preparing a tree for transplant . Again , this is all ‘ common sense ' if you 're good at putting yourself in the position of others .
If you do n't let your colleagues know about a project in advance , they will be very surprised to learn about it when it is formally announced , usually at a company meeting . This in turn will lead to them feeling ignored and they will likely become an obstacle to the project 's moving forward .
Discussing the details in advance and gauging their opinion and thoughts will safely lay the groundwork for moving a project along smoothly , and as a bonus you 'll likely also pickup ideas and advice you had n't thought of in the process .
Consulting ( Soudan )
Finally , we arrive at consulting . If you 've been given a project to handle , chances are you have somebody senior to you . Even if not , there 's always somebody who is better than you . Asking for advice , confirmation or feedback on parts of the project is crucial to seeing it through successfully . This could mean many different things , from having a senior point out a serious flaw you had missed , to needing your boss 's approval to use a chunk of the company budget or simply receiving wisdom from those more learned than yourself .
This also links in with ‘ informing ' and ‘ reporting ' because it allows other people to be a part of the project , fostering stronger team spirit and good relations with colleagues . The project then becomes a group effort and responsibility shared ( although you remain ultimately responsible for the work ) . This teamwork culture is another big part of life at a Japanese company .
* * * * * * * * * *
As you can see , just delving into this single business concept has uprooted and touched upon many different norms found within Japanese business culture . While certainly not the only way of doing things and perhaps not the best , it is an inescapable part of communication that goes beyond mere language learning . Success in Japan and dealing with Japanese businesses hinges on one 's understanding and skilful application of this sort of knowledge . It may not come naturally at first , but keep trying !
Have you experienced difficulty getting your ideas recognised at a Japanese company or suffered with poor relations with colleagues ? Let me know in the comments !

NASHUA , New Hampshire – Bill Clinton hit the campaign trail by himself for the first time in 2016 here Monday with two stops supporting Hillary Clinton 's presidential bid . But while he 's an enormous asset to his wife as one of the most popular politicians in the country – and especially at this critical moment with just over a month to go before New Hampshire 's first-in-the-nation primary – the debut outing could be overshadowed by Donald Trump 's aggressive attempts to damage both Clintons by reviving the husband 's sexual dalliances .
Clinton made no mention of Trump by name during his first stop here Monday morning , and dodged questions on the GOP front-runner from reporters on the rope-line . But he spoke personally about this relationship with his wife , recalling when they first met over 40 years ago at Yale Law School . ” We fell in love , ” he said , ” Everything she touched , she made better . ”
“ I thought she was the most amazing person , ” he continued , recounting her career from his law school onwards as he saw it .
Much of his speech was low-key . He closed with a meditation of what it takes to be president , saying he 's studied both successful and especially less successful presidents . “ I 've spent a lot of time thinking about this , ” Clinton said . “ I do not believe in my lifetime anybody has run for the job who is better qualified by experience , knowledge and temperament than Hillary . ”
The former president , who can inspire big crowds , command massive media attention , and rake in millions of dollars wherever he travels for his wife , will stump in again for Clinton in Exeter Monday afternoon .
But looming over his stops will be the shadow of Trump 's latest accusations .
Over the past week , Trump has used almost every public appearance he makes , along with his powerful Twitter feed of more than 5 million followers , to accuse Bill Clinton of being “ one of the great women abusers of all time , ” as he said on CNN this morning , and to allege that “ Hillary was an enabler ” who worked to cover up her husband 's dalliances .
RELATED : Feud intensifies between Trump , Clintons
The Republican front-runner has made no hint of giving up the crusade , and will campaign just about 20 miles away from Bill Clinton today when he headlines a rally in Lowell , Massachusetts . He will almost certainly hit the message again , while Bill Clinton is unlikely to address it earlier in the day .
The billionaire 's attacks are likely not an effective strategy for a general election audience , and some Clinton allies think they could actually backfire . “ His style of attack has always benefited Hillary Clinton in the end , ” said Bill Burton , a former Obama campaign strategist . “ She 's at her best when she 's under unfair attack . In a lot of ways , I think she would rather run against a Donald Trump than a lot of other folks . ”
But the attack carries some risk and is a distraction if nothing else . She 's to ignore questions from the press on Trump 's comments at multiple stops , and on Sunday , while campaigning in New Hampshire , Hillary Clinton was heckled by a Republican state representative about her husband 's alleged sexual impropriety .
And Trump could be trying to blunt Bill Clinton 's power in the campaign by injecting uncomfortable questions into the political conversation . At least five women have claimed to have affairs with Clinton , and three have accused him of unwanted sexual advances , none of which have been proven . It was in New Hampshire in 1992 that allegations of an affair by Gennifer Flowers nearly tanked Clinton 's first presidential bid .
The former president is at his best when he can play the role of elder statesman and “ explainer in chief , ” as he did during his well-received 2012 Democratic National Convention speech . But he also has a history of losing his composure in the face of attacks that get under his skin , with sometimes damaging consequences . As Hillary Clinton 's 2008 campaign stumbled , for instance , the Obama campaign intentionally needled her husband , provoking him to make angrily respond in a series of comments that led to allegations of racial insensitivity and more .
It 's possible Trump is trying to do the same now by striking a nerve . Trump 's attacks also risk reintroducing the Monica Lewinsky in the more damaging context of sexual harassment at a time when culture has become acutely attuned to feminism .
RELATED : Clinton campaign makes renewed push in NH
Trump is a terrible messenger on gender issues . This dustup started only after Trump used a vulgar Yiddish term to describe Clinton 's loss in the 2008 primary . Clinton fired back by accusing Trump of sexism , provoking his even more heated response .
But the escalation underscores the danger of any candidate picking a fight with Trump in the 2016 election .
“ It was her doing that started this . Why , because she was the one that opened up on Trump , ” said Hank Sheinkopf , a New York-based Democratic strategist . “ By Hillary attacking him , it makes him no longer a fringe candidate but a serious player in the election . If the frontrunner attacks you , you 're suddenly important . ”
“ The best thing would have been to let Donald Trump stay in the playpen of the Republican primary , instead they let him out , ” Sheinkopf added .
But none of this may matter to the hundreds expected to turn out to see Bill Clinton speak Monday . And her Democratic primary rival seems to have no interest in joining Trump 's crusade . ” We have got more important things to worry about in this country than Bill Clinton 's sex life , ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday on CNN .
Supporters who turned out at Clinton 's first stop here said Trump 's attacks only galvanized their support for Clinton . “ I just want Trump to keep doing that , ” said Sarah Walker , who emigrated from Uganda 16 years ago , and is looking forward to casting her very first vote as a U.S. citizen for Clinton next month . “ He 's only made us love Hillary Clinton more and more . ”
Diane Chubb , who is volunteering for Clinton 's campaign , said Bill Clinton is able to discuss the former secretary of state as a mother and a wife in a way that she sometimes has trouble presenting herself . “ Trump is the last one would , should say anything about this , ” she said , pointing to his long string of controversial comments about women .
TOKYO—When Kisho Kurokawa imagined the city of the future , he saw people ever more on the move , a society changing faster than ever before . Working in Tokyo in the 1960s and 70s , the architect designed an apartment building that would keep up with that future .
Say you wanted to move across town . Instead of searching for a new apartment that was right for you , you 'd just detach your apartment from its current building , truck it across town , and attach it to a new building . If you got tired of your digs , you could take your apartment down , update it or expand it , and put it back .
Kurokawa 's utopian vision was only realized once , in his Nakagin Capsule Tower , an apartment building made up of 140 tiny concrete `` capsules , '' each 300 square feet .
When the building was completed in 1972 , it made a huge splash in the architectural world . “ It stunned every major architectural journal of the year , ” said Zhongjie Lin , a University of North Carolina architecture professor who 's written a book about Kurokawa 's `` Metabolist '' movement .

The tower is still one of a kind . But today , it 's in a state of disrepair , with pretty severe water damage and crumbling concrete . Many residents want to tear the whole thing down and start over . Meanwhile , in the past year or two , several owners have put their capsules up on Airbnb , which has given architecture buffs—like me—the chance to see inside this fascinating building .
The tower was intended to serve a new , urban business class , giving salarymen who lived in Tokyo 's far-flung suburbs a crashpad if their work went later than the last train .

It was also an early pioneer of prefabricated architecture . The capsules were manufactured at a factory about 250 miles away from Tokyo and then moved to the site and attached to two central concrete and steel towers . The entire building was completed in just a couple months .
The units , which cost about the same as a car when the building was first constructed , are dominated by a circular window , like a huge porthole on an urban cruise ship . There 's an attached bathroom , which is barely bigger than what you 'd find on an airplane . One wall is outfitted with the highest-end appliances from 1972 , including a stove , a TV , a mini-fridge , and a tape deck .
The capsules were intended to be updated with the latest technology and replaced every 25 years , making it adaptable to the future . But the cost was prohibitive , and that never happened . `` It turned out that replacing the capsules would cost more money than tearing the building down and building a new one , '' Lin said .

When I stayed in the tower last month , the building was in a sorry state . Many capsule doors have plastic bags taped over them to catch dripping water . The dim hallways have a musty smell . Residents have been without hot water for the past four years due to aging pipes .
A couple years ago , a window fell out and crashed to the ground . No one was hurt , but now the outside of the building is covered in ugly protective netting .
Advertisement
Facing problems like these , the owners voted to demolish the building in 2007 , hoping to replace it with a newer , more typical apartment complex . Preservationists and architects were outraged ; Kurokawa , who died later that year , strenuously objected . Residents were thinking more of economics than historic preservation , however : The tower is situated on a prime piece of real estate in Ginza , one of Tokyo 's highest-end neighborhoods , so the property value of a modern building could be huge .
But before they could actually move forward , the global financial crisis hit , and the demolition plans ground to a halt .
Advertisement
Now , residents say , about half of the 140 capsules are in such bad condition that they go unused . A fourth of the capsules have people living there permanently , while the last fourth are used as offices or guest rooms .
Noritaka Minami , a Chicago photographer , has been visiting the tower twice a year since 2010 , taking photos of the capsules for a new art book . He 's fascinated with how the residents have transformed their standardized capsules into unique little homes over time . “ With any space , modification is inevitable , ” Minami said . “ In this building , each space is a container of all the history since ‘ 72 . ”
In some capsules , people have preserved the original design ; others have revamped their capsule to be as modern as possible . The capsule I stayed in was decorated with dark wood and flower patterns , trying to replicate a traditional Japanese sitting room .

Tatsuyuki Maeda , 48 , is one of the owners who remain . He bought his capsule five years ago . “ Every day , I would walk on this road to get to my office , ” he said . Every day , he 'd look up and admire the building . So after the financial crisis , when the prices were low , he bought one capsule that was in bad condition and renovated it .
Now , sitting crosslegged on the hardwood floors he laid himself , Maeda says he hopes to keep the capsule for the rest of his life . He lives a train ride away from downtown , but uses it to have guests over and entertain friends . An architecture buff , Maeda recently finished a crowdfunding campaign to publish a book about the tower , with profits going to renovation efforts .

“ I want to renovate not just one capsule , but a lot of the capsules that are not in good shape , ” he said .
For some owners who feel too cramped living here , the answer is Airbnb . At least five different capsules were listed on the site earlier this year , although searches now turn up only two listings . They go for $ 60 to $ 80 a night .

Most of the Airbnb listings in Tokyo tend to be either sleek modern apartments , nondescript one-rooms , or traditional old Japanese homes . The Nakagin is something else entirely . `` If you are looking for the amenities of a contenporary hotel , this is not a plce to stay , '' cautions one poster .
And while some guests complained about the tiny space or lack of amenities , for the most part , it 's the peculiar design that is attracting tourists . `` Getting to experience the project is a bit like a dream come true , '' wrote a guest from Toronto . From reviews like these , you get the sense that Airbnb could be an answer for preservation questions : letting architecture enthusiasts ( and tourists predisposed to quirky digs ) stay in the building might help fund some kind of renovation .
Like other buildings and cities , however , Airbnb has proved controversial here . The building 's management has frowned on allowing tourists to parade through the halls , and has reprimanded owners who listed their capsules . The owner of the capsule where I stayed told me in an email : `` Please do n't ask anything at reception . And please do n't stay at lobby . Also please be quiet in the room and building . And please do n't walk around in the building . '' ( Sorry ! )

It 's conflicts like these that perhaps get at the heart of why it 's so hard to preserve buildings like the Nakagin tower , an architectural icon that is at the same time an apartment building with residents who see it as just a place to live . “ It 's not a museum and it 's not an arts center , ” Minami said . “ It 's a private property with a hundred different owners . ”
In some ways , Kurokawa 's vision of the future has come true . People living in cities in Japan and around the world are more mobile than ever before . Young people especially are attracted to smaller and smaller apartments . But no other capsule towers were ever built , and we continue to suffer through packing , trucks , and cardboard boxes every time we move .

The Nakagin has proven influential in some ways , at least . Prefabricated buildings are now the norm . Eighty to ninety percent of buildings constructed in Japan have at least some prefabricated elements , Lin said .
Still , the building 's own future remains uncertain . There has n't been any vote on demolition since 2007 . And while some owners like Maeda have lovingly restored their own capsules , without a full-scale renovation effort , there 's little doubt that the Nakagin tower will fall deeper into disrepair .
“ The tower was based on this idea of mass reproducibility—the idea that the capsules can be mass produced in a factory , ” Minami said . “ And yet today , it 's one of a kind . If the building disappears , it 's the last one . ”

Casey Tolan is a National News Reporter for Fusion based in New York City .
Former Kansas State Trooper Greg Evensen reports that there are plans for road-blocks to force vaccines with military personnel putting bracelets on people . Those who refuse to take the steel band with a microchip will be put on a prison bus and taken to a quarantine camp .
Evensen also says he believes that many law enforcement officers will reject using this “ Gestapo ” approach on their fellow citizens , and will question the legitimacy of the orders of what looks like a bunch of criminals in federal government who appear to be seeking to retain their grip on power by setting up an apparatus of state terror , all too reminiscent of that if Nazi Germany where the inmates of concentration camp like Buchenwald were killed by injections in the heart .
Law enforcement officers anxious to restore law and order and arrest really dangerous criminals should look no further than at the people sitting in the top echelons of government , he hints .
“ Have you been made aware of the massive roadblock plans to stop all travelers for a vaccine bracelet ( stainless steel band with a micro-chip on board ) that will force you to take the shot ? Refuse it ? You will be placed on a prison bus and taken to a quarantine camp . What will you do when your children are NOT allowed into school without the shot ? What will you do when you are not allowed into the workplace without the vaccine paperwork ? Buy groceries ? Go to the bank ? Shop anywhere ? ? Get on a plane , bus or train ? Use the toilet in the mall ? Nope . Police officers will become loathed , feared , despised and remembered for their “ official ” duties , ” writes Evensen .
http : //www.newswithviews.com/Evensen/greg142.htm
“ Note : There are significant numbers of officers at all levels that simply detest the forced training at FEMA centers , the requirements to stop Patriots and others simply because they “ look ” dangerous , and are exercising free speech statements on their vehicles . By whose ultimate authority does this take place ? By whose ultimate judgment is it that it is necessary to harass INNOCENT drivers and families ? The public sees this Gestapo mentality as far more of a danger than any stickers they put on their vehicles ? Where are all these “ faithful ” enforcers of the law when it comes to confronting the unlawful , unconstitutional , unjustifiable , and unmerciful rotten bunch of usurpers , communists , atheists , deviated , immoral scungebuckets that are walking the halls of Congress , the White House , and the Federal Courts ? How is it that the “ get ‘ em at any cost ” morons at Homeland Security have created an environment in amerika that is an unwarranted intrusion of power in 186 other nations ?
So , once again , I implore those officers of the law who are in grave doubt about the legitimate authenticity of their superiors in any agency , to simply read the constitution , re-read their oath of office , seek out retired officers for guidance , and remember this very carefully—to brutalize citizens in the pursuit of order , is a guaranteed recipe for resistance . PLEASE do not pit yourselves ( all 650,000 officers at all levels in the US ) against a seething and angry populace who outnumber you 5000 to 1 . Believe me ; you want all of us working with you , not against you . ”

Traffic can be a real grind . For those travelling between work and home by car every day , the seemingly endless cycle of gas-brake-repeat at a snail 's pace can wear thin .
But commuters of the very-near future may be granted some respite by taking to the skies in a flying car .
The US company behind the concept vehicle TF-X is hoping a prototype will be ready to fly in just two years - and it will go on general sale within eight .
Scroll down for video
According to Massachusetts-based Terrafugia , a full-size unmanned prototype of its TF-X ( illustrated ) is expected to be ready by 2018 before it goes on general sale in 2024
According to Massachusetts-based Terrafugia , a full-size unmanned prototype is expected to be ready by 2018 .
The firm 's concept car has fold-out wings with twin electric motors attached to each end .
TF-X : KEY SPECIFICATIONS The vehicle will have a cruising speed of 200 mph ( 322 km/h ) , along with a 500-mile ( 805 km ) flight range . TF-X will have fold-out wings with twin electric motors attached to each end . These motors allow the TF-X to move from a vertical to a horizontal position , and will be powered by a 300 hp engine . The planned four-person TF-X will be semi-autonmous and use computer-controlled so that passengers can simply type in a destination before taking off . TF-X vehicles will be capable of automatically avoiding other air traffic , bad weather , and restricted and tower-controlled airspace . The vehicle will be able to recharge its batteries either from its engine or by plugging in to electric car charging stations .
These motors allow the TF-X to move from a vertical to a horizontal position , and will be powered by a 300 horsepower engine .
Thrust will be provided by a ducted fan , and the vehicle will have a cruising speed of 200 mph ( 322 km/h ) , along with a 500-mile ( 805 km ) flight range .
Terrafugia said its aim is to provide 'true door-to-door transportation , ' with the vehicle capable of being parked in a home garage like an ordinary car .
The planned four-person TF-X will be semi-autonmous and use computer-controls so that passengers can simply type in a destination before taking off .
'The TF-X operator will have final say over whether an approved landing zone is actually a safe place in which to land , and they may abort the landing attempt at any time , ' the company says .
The latest model was unveiled at the Experimental Aircraft Association 's annual fly-in in Oshkosh , Wisconsin .
Terrafugia has already provided an animation showing how the vehicle would work .

This shows the vehicle taking off by tilting its electric-powered propellers by 90 degrees .
As the vehicle moves to forward flight , the propellers spin around until they are parallel with the vehicle 's body .
When the ducted fan activates , the propellers stop rotating and fold back along the nacelles .
A one-tenth scale model is being tested at the Wright Brothers wind tunnel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) .
The trials will test everything from the drag , lift and thrust forces of the model .

However , Massachusetts-based firm Terrafugia said the TF-X will still be another eight to twelve years in development .
Last year , the same company unveiled a flying car known as the Transition , which has space for two passengers ,
It is expected to cost around £183,000 ( $ 261,000 ) when it goes on sale .
Owners will need a pilot and a driver 's licence to operate the road-legal airplane , in addition to 20 hours of flying time under their belt .
But fulfill those requirements , and you 'll be able to head down a motorway to an airport , and then take off on a conventional runway .
TF-X vehicles will be capable of automatically avoiding other air traffic , bad weather , and restricted and tower-controlled airspace . It can also be parked outside a home like an ordinary car
Terrafugia also provided an animation showing how the T-FX would operate . To take-off , the video shows how electric-powered propellers tilt 90 degrees
The founding team behind the creation are Carl Dietrich , Samuel Schweighart , Anna Mracek Dietrich , Alex Min - friends from University , and they call the Transition 'our vision for the future of personal transportation . '
They said : 'We have been dreaming about flying cars since the turn of the 20th century . The Transition street-legal airplane is the first step on the road to the practical flying car .
'We 're starting with proven technology and our product road map is designed to make personal aviation progressively safer and more accessible to a broader segment of the population . '
Earlier prototypes for the concept car had folding wings which spread out , ready for take off
Donald Trump came to Eugene on Wednesday � but he seemed a little flat .
Trump supporters from California conducted a survey Wednesday afternoon with a life-size poster of their presidential candidate in tow .
Chris Harris , a publicist from Los Angeles , said he is part of �a consortium of Hollywood actors , agents , producers and writers� who are traveling across the country to determine Trump�s popularity among voters .
�He seems dedicated to what America wants , � Harris said . �I know he�s said things that people don�t like , but he cares about the country.�
Harris said he feels Trump will �make America great again� and is not running for president for �political gain.�
Trump �is certainly not in it to make contacts and money , � Harris said . �He has more than he really needs.�
Harris was joined by Cory Skyler Drouillard , an actor and former national inline speed skating champion , and talent agent Leah Marsh . The trio arrived in Eugene from Portland , and said they were on their way to Sacramento .
Harris initially brought poster boy Trump to the Fifth Street Public Market , where he encountered Peggy Bosley and Jeffrey Biben , a Claremont , Calif. , couple living in Eugene for the summer . The couple stopped to answered Harris� questions , but disagreed with Harris� views on Trump .
�The Republicans are reaping 30 years of hateful discourse in politics and now they�ve got the exact candidate who they say they don�t want , but is what they�ve been building toward , � Bosley declared .
But Bosley jokingly added that she secretly hopes the Republicans nominate Trump as their candidate . �It�ll be a cakewalk for the Democrats , � she said .
Biben said he�s enjoyed watching Trump �for the entertainment factor , and I think it�s refreshing because what he says isn�t scripted . But do I want him to get anywhere near the presidential position ? I think not.�
Biben said he is voting for Democratic Party progressive Bernie Sanders .
�He�s been in the system a long time , he�s speaking to middle-class issues , � Biben said . �I think Bernie has stuck to his guns and he�s speaking to real issues.�
Before Harris could engage many other residents , he was asked by a market representative to leave the premises . So he headed to downtown�s Kesey Square to ask other passers-by their views on Trump . Once again , most of the responses he received were unfavorable .
One pedestrian , Wael Alzubieri , simply responded , �He�s a clown.�
Eugene resident Donny Littleton said he�ll be voting for Hillary Clinton . �I want to see a woman president , � he said .
Littleton added that he does not think Trump has enough experience in world affairs to become president . Trump �should stay in entertainment because that�s what he�s good at , � he said .
But not everyone was entirely opposed to the current Republican front-runner .
�I wouldn�t vote for him , but I�m glad he�s running , � said Jim Grubb , a Texas resident who lives in Eugene three months of the year .
Overall , Trump believer Harris said he was surprised by the negative responses .
�I was expecting to hear that we finally have someone who was willing to take a chance , � he said .

Given enough time , all simple , previously solved problems of the web eventually rear their ugly heads again .
Remember when limited bandwidth was a huge problem ? Then bandwidth was infinite . Now it 's a problem again . And that means serving up images is once again a complex problem with no elegant solution . Its seems simple—Websites should serve the right image to the right screen , high-resolution images to high-resolution devices and low res to the rest . But of course it 's not that simple . Factors like bandwidth as well as screen size and orientation complicate the matter considerably .
Arguably the best solution right now is to send low-res images to every device . Sure , your images might look terrible on high-res screens , but at least you are n't wasting people 's time or worse , costing them money .
While that 's the safest solution for now , the web does n't get better if no one takes any risks . Fortunately , until some standard or best practice emerges , we 'll likely continue to see developers pushing the boundaries and discovering new ways to handle the seemingly simple task of serving the appropriate image to the appropriate device .
The latest image cleverness we 've seen is Adam Bradley 's Foresight.js . Foresight.js is designed to make it easy to serve up high-resolution images to devices like the new iPad , but what sets foresight.js apart from half a dozen other solutions that do the same thing is that it not only checks for a hi-res screen , but also checks to see if the device currently has a fast enough network connection for larger images . If , and only if , your visitor has both a device capable of displaying high-res images and a network connection fast enough to handle the larger file size , are larger images served .
Part of what makes Foresight.js appealing is its use of the proposed CSS image-set ( ) function , one possible solution to the problem of serving up the right image at the right time . The image-set ( ) function , which works in WebKit nightly builds and is under consideration by the W3C , looks like this :
myselector { background : image-set ( url ( foo-lowres.png ) 1x , url ( foo-highres.png ) 2x ) center ; }
Foresight.js takes the image-set ( ) proposal and uses an ingenious hack to make it work in other browsers : the font-family property . Yes , it sounds crazy . But it works and remains technically valid CSS because font-family allows for arbitrary strings ( to handle font names ) . That means browsers have no problem with a rule like this :
myselector { font-family : ' image-set ( url ( /images/foo.png ) , url ( /images/foo_2x.png ) 2x high-bandwidth ) ' ; }
It 's a hack to be sure , but it 's our favorite kind of hack : clever and functional . Because browsers successfully parse the font-family rule ( even if they ca n't apply it ) the value is added to the DOM and JavaScript has no problem accessing it , which is exactly what foresight.js does .
For more on foresight.js , head over to the GitHub page which has links to plenty of example uses and copious documentation on the script 's many tricks . Also be sure to read through Bradley 's Challenges for High Resolution Images , which offers some background on foresight.js and the design decisions he made .
Over 1,000 people from various agencies are involved in the clean-up operation .
As several government agencies are engaged in cleaning up the shoreline following the oil spill after two ships collided near the Kamarajar Port recently , the Coast Guard today said nearly 40 tonnes of oil sludge and 27 tonnes of oil mixed with water were collected so far . As many as 1,025 personnel from various departments were involved in the clean-up of the shoreline , Coast Guard said in a release . `` As on date , approximately 40 tonnes of oil sludge and 27 tonnes of oil and water mixture were collected and was being dispatched to Kamaraj Port Trust , '' the release said.Meanwhile , Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar and senior government officials inspected the area after reports emerged that people feared to buy seafood as several fish were dead due to the incident.Responding to a query , Mr Jayakumar said , `` It is not true . People need not fear to consume fish . `` It is our duty to allay such fears . Therefore , we took some samples of the dead fish taken from Ennore , Marina , Thiruvanmiyur areas . There were reports of oil slick . The results from laboratory have clarified that it is safe to consume , '' he told reporters.Coast Guard helicopters which were carrying out regular sorties for continuous monitoring of the oil slick identified `` stagnated thick oil slick about 100 metres wide near Ennore and 500 x 500 metres near Kasimedu harbour '' .Coast Guard ship Varada along with a helicopter integrated with pollution control equipment has sailed to clear the oil slick.Coast Guard and various personnel from Fire and Rescue department , Chennai Port Trust , Kamaraj Port Trust , Chennai Corporation , Highways , Chennai Metro Water were involved in cleaning up operation.Volunteers from various engineering colleges , fishermen communities have also joined the cleaning operations . The incident took place on January 28 when 'M T BW Maple ' , with a flag of 'Isle of Man ' , was leaving after emptying Liquefied Petroleum Gas and M T Dawn , Kanchipuram , loaded with petroleum oil lubricant , was on its way to berth at the Ennore port .

The American Center for Law and Justice ( ACLJ ) has just filed its fifth lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State ( DOS ) , this time over the bureaucracy 's failure to turn over records of Senior Obama Official Samantha Power 's unprecedented unmasking of Americans .
As we informed you last month , we issued Freedom of Information Act Request to lawfully demand that the deep State Department produce records so the American people can be informed about the hundreds of “ unmasking ” requests that were made by former U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations , Samantha Power , including those for names and/or any other personal identifying information of President Trump during his candidacy for President , as well as his family members , staff , transition team members and his family . The DOS—yet again—failed to respond to our lawful request , and , yet again , we are taking the DOS bureaucracy to federal court .
We 've repeatedly reported that officials within the Obama Administration were engaged in the unscrupulous practice of “ unmasking ” the names of American citizens incidentally caught up in surveillance . That information was then leaked in violation of federal law . As we have asserted before , this was an unprecedented abuse of power that threatens our constitutional republic .
We already knew from earlier reports that Susan Rice , former National Security Adviser under then-President Barack Obama , requested the unmasking of the names of Trump transition officials incidentally caught up in surveillance .
Since then we 've learned that Susan Rice was n't the only one making unmasking requests . According to a congressional report , “ one official , whose position had no apparent intelligence-related function , made hundreds of unmasking requests during the final year of the Obama Administration. ” According to numerous reports , “ [ f ] ormer United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power is believed to have made ‘ hundreds ' of unmasking requests to identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team . ”
Think about that : Hundreds of unmasking requests by Obama 's U.N. Representative . And “ [ o ] f those [ hundreds of ] requests , only one offered a justification that was not boilerplate . ”
Now new reports have revealed the unprecedented number of unmasking requests made by former Ambassador Power :
Samantha Power , the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , was “ unmasking ” at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016 – and even sought information in the days leading up to President Trump 's inauguration . . . .
Fox News further reported that “ the requests to identify Americans whose names surfaced in foreign intelligence reporting , known as unmasking , exceeded 260 last year . One source indicated this occurred in the final days of the Obama White House . ”
Such abuse of the United States ' intelligence-gathering apparatus is unacceptable . It contravenes the privacy protections enshrined in the Constitution and usurps the proper role of the intelligence gathering services . The rampant unmasking of American citizens for partisan political purposes must be immediately halted and those responsible must be held accountable .
To that end , we at the ACLJ have taken significant legal action to expose the actions taken by then-Ambassador Power at the State Department that resulted in the unmasking of an unprecedented number of American citizens . Our Government Accountability Project prepared a series of Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests designed to expose the disturbing policies and practices of the deep state , Obama holdover bureaucracy that allowed these unmasking requests from a U.N Representative to be granted .
Our FOIA Request seeks :
records pertaining to any and all requests former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power made to National Security Agency ( “ NSA ” ) officials or personnel regarding the “ unmasking ” of the names and/or any other personal identifying information of then candidate and/or President-elect Donald J. Trump , his family , staff , transition team members , and/or advisors who were incidentally caught up in U.S. electronic surveillance .
The State Department bureaucracy , as has become its pattern and practice , acknowledged receipt of our request but failed to provide any documents or comply with the federal FOIA requirements .
Yesterday we filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the State Department bureaucracy for its continued violation of FOIA and failure to produce records responsive to our FOIA request . This lawsuit will force DOS to answer to a federal judge for its continued and blatant disregard for the law . Our complaint , among other things , asks the Court to “ [ o ] rder that [ DOS ] shall conduct a diligent search for any and all records responsive to [ our ] FOIA request and demonstrate that it employed reasonable search methods most technologically likely to lead to the discovery of records responsive to [ our ] FOIA request , selected from among those methods available to [ DOS ] . ”
Our federal government bureaucracy is not immune from the law—in fact taking the DOS to Federal Court helps ensure that no one is above the law and even deep state officials are held accountable for wrongful actions .
As we take on the deep state in federal court , we need your voice . Sign our petition today .
Night One : Lazer Walls and Waterfalls
For Pretty Lights , the New Year 's Eve celebration was the culmination of many aspects of both the music and the live show . Hosted at the Mardi Gras Ballroom in New Orleans by Derek Vincent Smith , it oddly felt like a homecoming show for the relocated Colorado native . Expectations were raised not only by the fact that the PL team tends to go overboard for NYE shows , but also because the fan base was thrilled to explore the dilapidated industrial backdrop that has become the staple of Pretty Light 's visual and cinematic projects , as well as the live music appreciation Nola has always been famous for .
Smith was joined on stage by New Orleans natives and newest additions to the live band Alvin Ford Jr on the drums and Brandon Butler on the organ and keys , as well as long-time collaborators Borahm Lee on additional keys and synths , and turntablist world champion Chris Karns . This rendition of the band , commonly known as Pretty Lights Live , has been on tour together for most of the fall , including the five flagship shows that became known as the Episodic Tour . Unofficially , we knew NOLA NYE was about to be the sixth encore episode we had all been craving since the fall tour ended .
For an act such as Pretty Lights that is known in the industry for their marvelous and stunning production , one ca n't talk about the band without mentioning the sixth member and visual mastermind that is Greg Ellis , otherwise and more commonly known as Lazershark . Even for his own standards , Ellis completely changed the game those two nights . He incorporated elements from all previous stage designs , such as a minimalistic version of the LED towers scattered around the stage , a cinematic screen behind the band displaying organically analog filtered footage , the laser cage that has become a staple of the shows , as well as the legion of lasers under his command that used the white backdrop to paint designs on the walls as much as they illuminated over the crowd .
And almost as if that myriad of photons was n't already enough , Pretty Lights and Lazershark decided to take the show to a whole other level with the addition of an indoor waterfall that engulfed the stage .
The layer of the waterfall created a blank slate in which Greg could project images and shapes with lasers and lights . It was almost as if a screen the height of the building and as wide as the stage magically appeared out of nowhere to display super dope visuals .
This is where things got crazy . At one point there was even a laser projecting onto the waterfall that was synced to Smith 's analog synthesizers , displaying the real life wavelengths of the music in a three-dimensional visual form . Finally , as if just to put the cherry on top , even the Shark Tank ( Ellis ' work station ) had baby towers around it , because I guess once you get locked into a serious light collection , the tendency is to push it as far as you can . Thompson would have definitely been proud .
The show itself started with a bang opening with a new unreleased track currently only known as Prelude 01 , which was more than proper seeing how the video preview Smith published of this track earlier in the year was filmed in and heavily featured the abandoned Market St. Power Plant , just down the street from the venue . The setlist continued with 2010 classics like “ Out of Time ” and “ Easy Way Out ” , and a few improvisational Psychedelic Hip Hop jams like the one that heavily used a throwback sample from Three 6 Mafia 's “ Stay Fly ” , much to the crowd 's content .
The show picked up more steam with a fan favorite mashup of “ Hot Like A Million Tomorrows ” that completely took advantage of the multitude of lighting rigs that Ellis used to show off what we were really in for during these shows . A beautiful rendition of “ Drift Away ” followed and evolved into a very heartfelt Freestyle Jam from Derek in which he rhymed about the feeling of love , unity , and heartbreak that inspires him to make the music that he does .
After that open display of emotion from Derek that fully engulfed the venue and washed over the crowd , Pretty Lights proceeded to play one of the rarest and coveted gems in his arsenal of over a hundred songs .
He had teased it at Telluride , but when asked about it the next day Derek joked around and said I had to wait a little longer for the perfect moment . Well , it just does n't get better than a New Year 's Eve show , four years to the day from the first time he ever played “ Make You Feel ” by request from a fan back in NYC NYE . This was one of the most ethereally surreal moments at a Pretty light show ever , one that every single person in there knew was a special and in which Derek portrayed through his music why he did what he does ; to make you feel .
The show switched gears soon after with another new track called “ There Is A Light ” that has been on heavy rotation this past tour . It was followed by a deconstructed and reworked live jam of one of the most iconic PL songs ever ; “ More Important Than Michael Jordan ” . The crowd had been anxiously waiting for this moment , as it seems every time the band played it this tour it just kept getting more and more mind-blowingly dope , and this was no exception . It 's crazy to think that this PL classic , which was produced by a 24-year-old Smith , in his bedroom studio and in his spare time as a hobby , is still rocking people 's worlds almost a decade later .
In his usual fashion , Derek went over curfew just to play one more song . Much to the crowd 's joy , they finally dropped “ Only Yesterday ” , a deeply sincere musical journey that was inspired by the Telluride shows as much as the Pretty Lights Family 's participation in it . There was no better way to close out night one and get everybody stoked and anxious for what the second night was holding .
Night Two : Derek Rings in 2017 with Love
Night two started with Derek taking the stage by himself and opening with Odesza 's remix of his “ One Day They 'll Know ” , followed by another rare fan favorite “ Country Roads Remix ” that sent the place into a frenzy . The band finally joined him for another unreleased track currently known as Prelude 03 that rocked the crowd with a much awaited unheard track . They also played “ Hot Like Sauce ” and “ I Can See It In Your Face ” , two tracks that put Pretty Lights on the map , right before it was time for the New Year 's countdown .
As champagne bottles popped and balloons flooded the venue , the whole band hugged and celebrated and shared their drinks with front row fans to the tune of “ Father Stretch My Hands Pt 1 ” .
After the quick breather , they got back to their respective workstations and mentally got in the zone for yet another new track , Prelude 04 . There was honestly not a better way to start a new year than with this track , which used a Shira Small Eternal Life sample resonating over and over with the most befitting mantra to start off a new year with , “ We can see and finally I know , THAT WE LIVE FOREVER. ” It was almost as if Derek himself was reminding us why we all do this music thing so passionately , as a celebration of life , love and the pursuit of happiness .
Up next were smooth versions of more tracks usually saved for special shows such as Solar Sailor and I Got Five On It . There was also an almost fifteen minute After Midnight Jam that had the entire place singing along almost to the point of overpowering the band . It seemed as if every single soul in the venue had teary eyes and the widest grin on their faces as they grooved along to this amazing rendition of an American classic .
It was easy to figure out what was really on Derek 's mind for this new year , as he started dropping tracks from his closest friends and label mates .
It all started with Michal Menert 's Low Orbit , for which he was amusingly jumping up and down moving his hands to the bass synth and getting down as much as the crowd was . It was followed by Break Science 's Wisdom of Antiquity , Paul Basic 's remix of Color of My Soul and eventually Supervision 's Hip Hop Hurray Remix . Who knows , but perhaps 2017 will be the year that new life will be brought back to the PLM label .
There was a good segment of about an hour filled with more Psychedelic Hip Hop jams , sprinkled with known tracks such as “ King of Rock ” , “ Looking For Love ( But Not So Sure ) ” , “ Prophet ” , as well as long reworked jams of two other rarities , “ Maybe Tomorrow ” and “ Solamente ” . The latter being hailed as the underground anthem of Derek 's heavily influenced hip hop roots , coupled with Lazershark 's beautiful horde of lights , lasers , and screens provided one of the most intimate moments of the show .
There was a quick set break that had fans anxiously waiting only to be rewarded with PL 's undisputed anthem “ Finally Moving ” . This moment tends to be the climax of the show as every single person blares the lyrics back as they hold up lighters and phone lights while the music fades away to give room to the crowd . Appropriately , “ I Know The Truth ” came right after to rattle the concrete ground and vibrate every wall in the venue .
If there was another track that pushed the limits this tour besides MITMJ , it would without a doubt be the Radiohead x Nirvana x NIN remix , and once again , it did not disappoint with how surreal , gritty and weird it got . At one point towards the climax of the song Derek himself came down from his station and started getting down right in the middle of the Laser Cage . With his arms flowing through the lasers , it looked almost as if it was a portal to another dimension and he was toying with the idea of crossing over into the unknown . Needless to say , this was one of the most memorable moments of the night .
Another rare gem had to be dropped , so he opted for a throwback to his early solo days with his CREAM x New York State Of Mind remix that once again rattled the crowd . But preferring to close out his shows with a mellow downtempo song , the last song of the two-night run became “ Yellow Bird ” , one of his most favorite tracks he 's ever put out .
Derek walked off stage to hug his family and friends before looking back one last time and bidding farewell with a simple smile that spoke volumes .
The monsoon outside the show was all that was left to fill the void in sound , and while Greg Ellis called it a night too , lighting from the storm kept flashing the venue sporadically . The crowd excited the building to the elements , most decompressing and waiting for a ride or the rain to stop . But almost as if we were all still in the same mindset , it seemed like everyone was just taking a second to admire the beautiful backdrop of the city skyline as we reflected on what we had just experienced those two nights .
New Orleans , you did us alright .

The Seattle Seahawks should be Super Bowl contenders again in 2016 , or at least that 's what the folks at BetOnline think , four months away from the start of the regular season .
Following a turbulent offseason that featured the losses of several longtime contributors before adding a reinvigorating draft class , the Seahawks remain among the NFL 's elite teams , according to oddsmakers .
And why should n't they be ? Over the past four seasons , Seattle has 46 regular-season wins , ranking behind only the New England Patriots ( 48 ) and Denver Broncos ( 50 ) during that span . Unsurprisingly , the Patriots and Broncos rank highly on the projected 2016 totals -- as does an NFC West rival of the Seahawks .
You can check out BetOnline 's projected win totals in the gallery above .

WOW ! CNN Mocks Hillary For FINALLY Visiting Michigan and Wisconsin For Book Tour “ Really ? ! ” ( VIDEO )
Hillary Clinton has been busy promoting her new book What Happened which of course is her version of her crushing election loss ( lies ) . She shamelessly promoted it during Hurricane Harvey while barely mentioning the poor people affected by the storm .
Hillary also announced that she would FINALLY be visiting Wisconsin and Michigan , two states she ignored during the Presidential election and ultimately lost to Donald Trump-JUST to promote her new book . Hillary has no shame . She 'll travel to places to collect money and peddle her book , but did n't care enough to talk to the American people face to face during the election .
She is also charging Toronto residents $ 2400 each to meet her on her book tour .
You know it 's bad when CNN is mocking Hillary . CNN carried the water for her during the 2016 presidential election so to see them laughing at her is a big blow to the failed presidential hopeful .
“ On her book tour she 's going to Michigan and Wisconsin . Really ? ! Really ? ! ” CNN 's John King said as the panel laughed .
“ If she had been to Michigan and Wisconsin during the campaign… ” John King continued as the panel snickered .
But Russia , right ? She lost because of Russia .

Members of the sect deny abusing their children An appeal court has ruled that US officials had no right to seize 463 children from a polygamist sect in western Texas last month . The court said that the reasons given for the children 's removal were `` legally and factually insufficient '' . But it did not immediately order the return of the children to the ranch . In April , officials raided a compound of the sect , saying young girls were being forced into marriage and sex . The children were placed into foster care . But the Texas Third Court of Appeals ruled that officials failed to demonstrate the children were in any immediate danger , which is the only legally allowable reason for taking children from their homes without court proceedings . Confusion The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has denied abuse and says it is being persecuted . Please turn on JavaScript . Media requires JavaScript to play . Correspondents say the case , which began with a raid on 3 April , has been marked by confusion . So far , 168 mothers and 69 fathers of the children have been identified - reflecting the polygamist practices of the sect - the Associated Press news agency reports . More than 100 children have still not been matched with mothers . Some of the parents say they do not know where their children have been placed , while others have complained that their sons and daughters are living at different locations , forcing them to criss-cross Texas to see them . Officials have said that several of the sect members they had listed as minors are in fact adults . They said the situation was complicated because some women and children had given different names and lied about ages . Initially , officials said more than half of the underage girls were either mothers or were pregnant . The children were taken from the sect 's Yearning For Zion ranch The legal age of sexual consent in Texas is 17 and polygamy is illegal in the US . The children were removed from the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado after someone called a domestic abuse hotline claiming to be a pregnant 16-year-old abused by a much older husband . The girl has never been found and authorities are investigating whether the calls were a hoax . Earlier this month , investigators said they had found signs of physical injuries among the children , but added it was unclear whether these were due to abuse . Members live in large extended families , making it hard to determine exact parenthood , and the state is using DNA tests in its investigation . The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) is an offshoot of the Mormon Church . It broke away from the mainstream Mormons more than a century ago . FLDS members are taught that a man must marry at least three wives in order to ascend to heaven . The church denies forcing young girls into polygamy .

DAYTON , Ohio — A solar-powered airplane has touched down in the Ohio hometown of two of America 's most well-known aviation pioneers on the latest leg of its around-the-world journey .
The Swiss-made Solar Impulse 2 landed late Saturday in Dayton , Ohio , where inventors Wilbur and Orville Wright grew up . The plane took off from Tulsa International Airport before 5 a.m. Saturday . The flight to Dayton International Airport took 17 hours .
The plane will be in Dayton until early next week , the Dayton Daily News reported . A spokeswoman for the plane 's crew said an exact take-off time would n't be known until 24 hours in advance .
The globe-circling voyage began in March 2015 from Abu Dhabi , the capital of the United Arab Emirates , and made stops in Oman , Myanmar , China and Japan .
The plane is expected to make at least one more stop in the United States , in New York , before crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Europe or northern Africa , according to the website documenting the journey .
Niklaus Gerber , an air traffic control expert who 's helping to plan the plane 's routes , said during an interview live-streamed on the Solar Impulse 2 website , that the New York trip will be challenging . He said the plane will encounter air traffic from three busy airports — John F. Kennedy , La Guardia and Newark International .
During its most recent trips , the aircraft took off from Phoenix Goodyear Airport in Arizona at about 3 a.m. on May 13 and landed in Tulsa about 20 hours later .
It departed from northern California in the early hours of May 2 and landed at the airport southwest of Phoenix 16 hours later . Last month , it flew from Hawaii to California .

The Solar Impulse 2 's wings , which stretch wider than those of a Boeing 747 , are equipped with 17,000 solar cells that power propellers and charge batteries . The plane runs on stored energy at night .
Ideal flight speed is about 28 mph , although that can double during the day when the sun 's rays are strongest .
The plane had a five-day trip from Japan to Hawaii and three-day trip from Hawaii to California 's Silicon Valley .
The crew was forced to stay in Oahu , Hawaii , for nine months after the plane 's battery system sustained heat damage on its trip from Japan .
Project officials say the layovers give the two Swiss pilots — Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg — a chance to swap places and engage with local communities along the way so they can explain the project , which is estimated to cost more than $ 100 million .
The solar project began in 2002 to highlight the importance of renewable energy and the spirit of innovation .
A :
Dear the whaaaaaaaaaaaale ,
I can most definitely answer this question seriously . As we all know , Nemo and Marlin and all their fishy friends lived in the Great Barrier Reef , which is off the northeast coast of Australia . The Great Barrier Reef is over 1,600 miles ( or 2,600 kilometers ) long , so already we have a problem because we do not know where exactly along the reef they lived . All we know is that they lived along the edge , because ( 1 ) Nemo swam out into the ocean against his father 's will , and ( 2 ) scuba divers probably keep their boats along the edges .
So , we know they started somewhere along the Great Barrier Reef ; for the sake of accuracy , I 'll give you three estimates , one where the journey starts at the most southern point of the reef , in the middle , and one at the most northern point . Their swim then went through the East Australian Current , and ultimately they were dropped off , quite conveniently , in Sydney . ( Did you know that every year tropical fish are actually taken from the Great Barrier Reef to Sydney , and further south , via the East Australian Current ? True fact ! ) Here is a visual of what we know , assuming they started their trip in the middle of the reef :
As you can see , if during their travels Marlin and Dory hugged the coast very tightly the trip would have been 1,568 miles ( or 2,524 kilometers ) . That is quite a way for a little fish . If they started at the northern-most tip of the reef ( not shown on the map above ) then the trip would have been 2,630 miles ( or 4,233 kilometers ) . If their trip began at the southern-most tip of the reef the trip would have been 1,014 miles ( or 1,633 kilometers ) .
Whew ! Clearly , Marlin cared a great deal about his son . Awww . While he did n't travel an ocean , he did travel the length of a continent , most of the Coral Sea , etc. , through many perils . Hey , I 'm impressed !
-Mico , who would probably be Nigel the brown pelican ( even though brown pelicans do n't even live in Australia ! )
Ben Garland has been where Alejandro Villanueva is now . He knows the odds are against Villanueva making the Philadelphia Eagles ' roster after serving four years in the U.S. Army .
While the degree of difficulty is high , transitioning from active duty in the armed forces to play in the NFL can be done . Garland is proof . His journey from serving in the Air Force to earn a spot on the Denver Broncos ' practice squad the past two seasons provides the road map for Villanueva . All Villanueva , who signed with the Eagles as a free agent before last month 's draft , needs is time and opportunity .
The Broncos have given the 26-year-old Garland that over the last couple of years . Denver coach John Fox is the son of a former Navy SEAL . He has the utmost respect for the men and women who serve and protect our country .

But Fox has n't viewed Garland as a charity case . He appreciates Garland 's work ethic . He values Garland 's presence in the locker room . He knows that no matter what goes wrong or what adversity the team faces , Garland wo n't quit . Garland will keep pushing , and that resilience is infectious .
`` Ben 's the kind of guy you root for , '' Broncos offensive line coach Dave Magazu said . `` He 's one of the good guys you 're hoping like heck catches a break and makes the football team and makes your team better , because he 's such a great guy . ... He 's a machine . ''
A Colorado native , Garland was a defensive lineman for four years at Air Force Academy from 2006-09 . In April 2010 , the Broncos signed Garland as an undrafted rookie free agent knowing that he would have to serve at least two years in the Air Force .
Garland used leave time to attend the Broncos training camp that summer and then , after the Broncos put him on the reserve/military list , spent two years in active duty . He was an instructor at the Air Force Academy for nine months and then was a public affairs officer for the 375th Air Mobility Wing at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois .
Every day during his active duty , Garland would train for upward of five hours . He set up cones in a field , ran what he called `` mock football drills '' and practically lived in the gym .
`` Everyone thought I was crazy , '' Garland said . `` I 'd never go out . I was constantly working and training and working for my dream . ''
In 2012 , the Air Force and U.S. Department of Defense worked with Garland as part of the Palace Chase program , which allows those like Garland to transition into the Air Force Reserve work a civilian job after two years of active duty .
Garland was indefatigable at practice , but he was not in football shape .
`` You ca n't really replicate that live speed with 11 people , '' he said . But he was fit . His teammates often joked that he put something in his water to keep him from getting tired .
`` It 's one of those things ; you learn mental toughness and you learn , ' I 'm kind of exhausted and tired , ' but be dedicated to the task at hand , ' '' Garland said . `` The NFL and the military have so many similarities . You 're on an elite team trying to be the best in the world at that specific task . You have to have discipline and work together as a team . You have to be a leader . ''
Garland was that simply by example .
`` He does n't wear down , which is really incredible , '' Magazu said . `` Even some of the other guys will ask , 'Are n't you even tired . ' Yeah , but you do n't ever see it . He has that mental toughness and that physical toughness he can push through it . It does n't look like there 's a dent in his armor . ''
Editor 's Picks Fox : Villanueva 's path from war to NFL Army veteran Alejandro Villanueva is pursuing his NFL dream with the Philadelphia Eagles after three tours in Afghanistan , Ashley Fox writes .
Garland spent the 2012 season as a defensive lineman on the Broncos ' practice squad . He was part of the scout team and also stood in as an offensive lineman . Before the 2013 season , the Broncos moved Garland , who is 6-foot-5 and is listed as 308 pounds , to offensive guard . He spent last season again on the practice squad .
The Broncos have needs along the offensive line this season after guard Zane Beadles left for Jacksonville in free agency . Garland has been working during organized team activities with the second-string offensive line . While he is eligible for one more season on the Denver practice squad , the hope is he can land a spot on the 53-man roster .
`` I guess you say we 're trying to find a place for Ben , '' Magazu said . `` Where are we going to be able to take advantage of all the intangibles he has and all the things he has to offer ? ''
That is how Garland hopes Villanueva , who played multiple positions at the United States Military Academy , is handled in Philadelphia . The Eagles are trying Villanueva at defensive end in their 3-4 base defense .
Like Garland was in Denver two years ago , Villanueva is a long shot to make the Eagles ' roster . But like Garland , he has a relentless work ethic and is playing for a coach in Chip Kelly who values players in peak physical condition .
`` He 'll be perfectly fine in the workouts , '' Garland said of Villanueva . `` He just needs to get used to playing football . He just needs to play and hopefully gets the opportunity long enough that they think they need you on the team . ''
That 's what Garland did , and he continues to take advantage of the opportunity .

Strange art is the thing you need and it 's in this article . If normal art somehow bores you and you want the next best thing or just something a bit peculiar you 've ended up in the right place .
I 've wanted to write this article with weird art for some time and have gathered a lot of interesting pictures that I want you to see .
It 's very interesting how much the imagination and creativity of some people evolve to create beautiful new art forms , some of them maybe a little strange , but you got ta appreciate what they 've achieved .
Strange art examples worth seeing Feather art
Kate McGwire modeled pigeons ' feathers with a lot of patience to create impressive artworks that not only look good but I think they are also given a pretty good feeling at touch . Strange art , indeed .
Fine art paper
I do n't know who did this but I 'd love to see more examples of this brilliant , yet strange art idea to create complicated cut out figures of paper . It surely is an interesting art example .
Viruses made of glass
Luke Jerram is a man who works with viruses and no , he 's not a virologist . He likes to show the people the beauty of viruses and yes , there is one , portrayed in these figurines made of glass that represent a strange art example .

Human flowers
Cecelia Webber thought it would be interesting to create flowers out of people that stand in different positions . It 's absolutely fascinating that she thought of such a thing and more important it 's incredible what she actually achieved . An interesting and strange art example worth seeing .
Art from matches
I remember that when I was playing with matches it was a little bit different ( of course , just slightly ) than what Pei-San Ng is doing with them . I have to admit he 's doing a better job .
Faceless art
Faceless art has been defined by Sabi van Hemert , a dutch artist which creates fusions out of children and animals . Scary idea but it 's not at all as scary as it sounds : “ I create images that evoke associations with people and animals . I imagine the balance between the many conflicting feelings and thoughts that a man can have . Balance between opposites as attractive / repulsive , happy / sad or fear / security . My pictures have something in them that causes you to think what to see and feel that it gives you , and then confirm again denied . ”
Tin foil art
This interesting idea was created by Dominic Wilcox and not how you would probably imagine . He did n't just put the tin foil on his face because it would have been a little bit tricky to make it stay still ; he placed the tin foil on an old plaster mold of his face . Is this an example of unusual art ? It surely is , but it 's beautiful .
Colored pencil sculptures
Jennifer Maestre had an idea which was a little bit dangerous at first , of creating objects with nails . The problem with that idea was n't that the nails where pointy and dangerous , she just could n't get a lot of form variations and the shapes she could do were limited . That 's how she ended up using crayons , colored ones actually to get the most out of her ideas and she has done that very well .
Xray art
Green sculptures
This interesting artwork is massive and is very popular in Asia where people respect the human 's communion with the nature but it 's starting to become pretty popular in Europe too .
It implies a lot of discipline and patience to cut the bush in such a way and no , they 're not plastic leaves .
Hands art
Guido Daniele is not new anymore to the scene . He 's doing this thing for a long time and most of us have seen its works in advertisements . He is also known for his full body paintings , not just hand painting . You should check out his site , he has an impressive amount of beautiful and strange paintings .
If you liked this article with strange art , you should also check the following ones :
Ted Gup is an author and journalism professor at Emerson College .
Hearing President Trump threaten North Korea with “ fire and fury ” took me back some 23 years to an August morning at the Funairi Mutsumi Nursing Home in Hiroshima . There I sat across from 85-year-old Shima Sonoda , a frail woman whose words were carefully measured and whose emotions had long been contained . She was one of that ever-shrinking number of hibakusha — survivors of the A-bomb .
On that morning she told me of another August morning — that of Aug. 6 , 1945 — when the bomb detonated overhead , and her city , her home and nearly everyone she knew were incinerated . Somehow she survived , though buried under rubble .
In the moments after the blast she pawed through the debris that had been her home , searching for her 4-year-old daughter , Akiko Osato . There was nothing to be found of her , she told me — not then , not ever . Minutes before , her daughter had been in her arms asking for a can of tangerines that had been set aside as an emergency ration . But Sonoda had denied her daughter the tangerines , lest conditions — already dire — should worsen .
It was a day that she had almost never spoken of , though it was a constant part of her , as were the shards of glass she said were still embedded in her head . Each morning , even decades later , she would begin her day beside her small Buddhist altar and consecrate a can of tangerines to the memory of her daughter . As she spoke , she gently dabbed a tissue to catch the tears .
She is the first one I thought of upon hearing the president speak of “ fire and fury , ” like some cartoon god of war . Other memories too then came to mind — the island orphanage where children who lost both parents were taken in the days and weeks after the blast , where they had grown up , spent their entire adulthoods within its narrow confines and died , their bomb-induced keloids plainly visible , their deeper scars hidden away . I thought of the massive silver vats — cooled by , what was it , liquid nitrogen ? — that held the DNA of numerous survivors , retained for future scientists whose more advanced techniques might decipher the long-term effects of radiation exposure denied to researchers of the present .
All this came to mind hearing the president 's threat to unleash the unspeakable terror of nuclear weapons . He said it from the clubhouse of a Bedminster , N.J. , golf course , a universe away from Hiroshima 's skeletal dome , a testament to the unthinkable .
The president spoke of “ fire and fury like the world has never seen. ” But the world has seen it . Sonoda saw it . So , too , did a couple hundred thousand other souls , nearly all civilians , whose everything was obliterated in an instant . And standing at the humble stone monument marking the exact spot 1,900 feet above which the sun itself seemed to detonate , the temperature rising to 5,000 degrees , unleashing cyclonic winds , I also felt the shiver that never leaves that place .
( The Washington Post )
It is a pity that Sonoda is no longer with us , that she can not speak to the president and share with him her memories , tell him that there is no recovering from such devastation , that some things are not to be used for rhetorical ends , that they must , in the name of humanity , be placed beyond the gamesmanship of bullies .
Between Kim Jong-un 's hermit kingdom , now bristling with missiles , and the U.S. coastline lies Japan , where Trump 's words landed with singular impact and where Kim 's missiles would find a likely target .
There was someone else who came to mind hearing the president 's threats . His name is Lt. Col. Bernard T. Gallagher . He literally wrote the book on nuclear weapons for the Air Force , flew for the Strategic Air Command and later ran the mountain redoubt in Virginia — Mount Weather it is called — where generations of presidents , justices of the Supreme Court , Cabinet secretaries and an entire shadow government were to take shelter for months , if need be — and still may — should Washington be erased by The Bomb .
In his final days in 2000 , Bud , as he was known to his friends — and I would like to think I was among them — shared with me his thoughts of such weapons . Like Sonoda , he knew whereof he spoke . As a pilot and “ cloud sampler , ” he had flown through a dozen mushroom clouds . He had swallowed a radiation-sensitive plate , suspended by a string that hung from his mouth and that measured his exposure . He had witnessed the “ fire and fury ” close enough to feel the force of its winds , to see entire atolls overwhelmed and to know that this was something that must never , ever be used in war again .
I was with him within days of his final breath , and even then , at 78 , he quoted the Bhagavad-Gita and the lines that came to him each time he saw the “ fire and fury ” of The Bomb , and forever after : “ Now I have become death , the destroyer of worlds. ” I hear those words and the profanity of the president 's words , spoken at a golf course , their resounding ignorance of history sending shock waves out across the thinking world .

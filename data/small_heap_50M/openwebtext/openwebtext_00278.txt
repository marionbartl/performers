Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( R-N.J. ) , a top House Republican , said Friday morning that he would vote against the GOP 's bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act .
Frelinghuysen 's opposition is significant not only because Republican leadership can only afford to lose 21 or 22 votes , but also because he is the chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee . Committee chairs typically vote in line with the House leadership ― and indeed set the party line and help pull recalcitrant members on board .
“ Seven years after enactment of Obamacare , I wanted to support legislation that made positive changes to rescue healthcare in America , ” Frelinghuysen said in a statement .
“ Unfortunately , the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey , ” he continued . “ In addition to the loss of Medicaid coverage for so many people in my Medicaid-dependent state , the denial of essential health benefits in the individual market raise serious coverage and cost issues . ”
Hours later , moderate Rep. Barbara Comstock ( R-Va. ) , who 'd remained mum until the final moment , said she too will oppose the bill . Hillary Clinton won Comstock 's district by 10 points , something that potentially played a role in her decision .
Even after the bill cleared a key procedural hurdle , several Republican lawmakers doubted there were enough votes to pass it . Ignoring the telltale signs , White House spokesman Sean Spicer insisted the vote was still on for Friday afternoon . As Spicer told reporters that there were no plans to cancel the vote , House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) briefed President Donald Trump on the vote count , warning that they did n't appear to have enough support to pass it .
Pressed on how the White House and GOP leadership handled the process , Spicer said they did everything they could have done to get it through the House .
Conservative Rep. Walter Jones ( R-N.C. ) bemoaned the way leadership rolled out the bill , saying they tried to jam it through the chamber .
“ The people I know that are noes , they 're pretty strong in their feelings , ” Jones told reporters Friday , just hours before the vote . “ I think there 's a good chance it could go down . If death is a finality , I 'm a solid no . ”

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart ( R-Fla. ) , who supports the bill despite having reservations about it , said it 's a “ big hit ” if the bill goes down .
“ If it does n't pass , this issue is dead , ” Diaz-Balart said Friday . “ This is the one shot ― good , bad , or indifferent ― this is the one shot to deal with health care . ”
Trump promised over and over on the campaign trail that he would repeal and replace Obamacare , repeatedly denigrating the health care law with false attacks while failing to put forward his own plan . He promised that whatever it was , Trumpcare would be cheaper , better and would cover everyone . The Congressional Budget Office found that the Republican plan would cause 24 million Americans to lose insurance by cutting tax credits that make insurance less expensive .
As the president and Ryan pushed their widely unpopular bill forward , however , it became clear that many members of the conservative Freedom Caucus would not vote for the measure .
To try to entice Freedom Caucus members , the president negotiated directly with them to cut out requirements that insurance plans cover essential benefits ― care for things like maternity , mental illness , hospitalization and prescription drugs .
Trump administration officials signaled Thursday night that they were through negotiating and that a vote would take place on Friday , regardless of whether Ryan had the votes to pass the bill .
Republicans may not have had the votes to pass the bill before they negotiated with the Freedom Caucus , but those negotiations almost certainly hurt them with another set of members : House moderates . The moderate concerns are the exact opposite of their more conservative colleagues ― that the bill goes too far in undoing Obamacare by cutting patient protections , causing millions of people to lose coverage and making it more expensive for those who can still afford it .
That dynamic , which The Huffington Post reported earlier this week , creates what seems to be an unworkable seesaw for the House leadership ― the more Freedom Caucus members they get on board by making the bill more conservative , the more moderate Republicans they lose .

Unknowable Degrees of Bubble Insanity
Back in February , we brought you an update on the truly insane real estate bubble in Australia ( see : “ Australia 's Housing Bubble – In the Grip of Insanity ” for details ) in the wake of Jonathan Tepper of Variant Perception reporting on an eye-opening fact-finding tour in Sydney .
This rotting shack in Sydney and its tiny plot of land sold for nearly $ 1 million in May of 2014 – more than two years ago . Since then , house prices in Australia have increased even further . Yes , it is an insane bubble , no doubt about it .
As every seasoned market observer knows though , the fact that a bubble has obviously attained crazy proportions does not mean it can not become even crazier . We only need to think back to the Nikkei index in the late 1980s , the Nasdaq in the late 1990s , or the grand-daddy of modern-day bubble insanity , the Souk Al-Manakh bubble in Kuwait in the early 1980s .
The latter example is generally less well known than the others , but it is unsurpassed in terms of sheer mass dementia . What made this bubble so special – at its peak Kuwait 's stock market had a total capitalization of more than $ 100 billion , which made it the third-largest equity market in the world behind the US and Japan at the time , a fact that should have told market participants they were skating on very thin ice – was the use of post-dated checks to pay for stock purchases .
The bubble needed a trigger to pop , and that trigger was delivered when one day , a single one of these post-dated checks actually bounced . One of the biggest market crashes in history ensued – a truly dramatic wipe-out , that in the end destroyed the country 's entire OTC stock market .
As we have pointed out previously , while residential real estate is actually a consumer good , analytically it should be treated as akin to a capital good maintained over several consecutive stages of production , as it renders its services over a very long period of time ( the same principle holds for other durable goods – see J.H . de Soto , Money , Bank Credit and Economic Cycles ) .
One implication of this is that interest rates are very important to the valuation of real estate . At present , the administered central bank interest rate in Australia is at a new low , and since it remains actually high compared to similar rates in other developed countries , it may well decline even further .
Australia 's administered central bank interest rate – click to enlarge .
Gross market rates all over the world have so far continued to follow the downtrend in central bank rates , so the market has yet to reassert itself ( we plan to post an in-depth discussion of the current trend in gross market rates soon ) . As long as rates remain low , real estate bubbles tend to remain well supported .
Let us not forget , the bursting of a number of housing bubbles in 2006-2009 ( in the US , Spain and several other countries ) was preceded by a slow but steady increase in interest rates and a sharp slowdown in money supply growth in the major currency areas . Neither one nor the other are in evidence in Australia at present – at least not yet .
Australia 's narrow money supply M1 has grown sharply in recent years ( the pace of the advance is comparable to the pre-2008 era ) – click to enlarge .
An Important New Development
One of the reasons why interest rates are so important in keeping residential real estate bubbles from imploding is that they make otherwise unaffordable properties seemingly affordable .
Most home buyers use mortgages to finance house purchases , and the size of the monthly payment is therefore a main criterion in terms of affordability . Given that these are usually very long term loans with terms ranging from 15 to 30 years , the level of interest rates makes an enormous difference .
Below is a slightly dated chart via Variant Perception ( ending in Q2 2015 ) that compares Australian home prices , household incomes , rents and construction costs . It should be obvious how irrational house prices have become in light of the huge gap that has opened up between these time series .
The chart also demonstrates that low interest rates are indeed of overwhelming importance in sustaining these sky-high prices . There is certainly little else that will .
Australia : house prices vs. household income , rents and construction costs .
Keep in mind though what we have mentioned in the annotation to the chart of Australia 's money supply above . The credit expansion that has been the driving force of the bubble has largely been the work of commercial banks . While the central bank has enabled them to offer loans at lower and lower rates , it is their willingness to actually do so that is decisive .
Another chart illustrating the importance of interest rates to Australia 's housing bubble : the share of “ interest only ” mortgage loans , the principal of which is settled with a balloon payment at the end of their term . The influence of rates on the size of the monthly payment is even greater in these cases .
One of our readers has recently made us aware of a recent development that may well throw a major spanner into the works . Similar to what has happened in other desirable destinations , Chinese buyers have played an increasingly important role in Australia 's property market . They have been especially active in the market for condominiums , which has experienced an extremely pronounced boom as a result .
What we were hitherto not aware of was the extent to which these buyers have actually obtained financing from Australian banks . This source of funding is now threatening to dry up . The banks are pulling back after learning that many of the loan applications seem to be fraudulent .
This happens to coincide with a noticeable surge in supply in the market – many developments that have been started in order to cash in on the huge gap between prices and construction costs are now finished or about to be finished ( we can picture a great many “ ghost apartment blocs ” in Australia 's future ) .
As the Financial Review reports :
“ Off-the-plan buyers of Australian apartments are in crisis as tough new borrowing rules mean thousands of investors who have paid a deposit are struggling to complete their purchases , according to local and overseas mortgage brokers and financiers . Shanghai-based financiers claim their Chinese clients ' funding from Australian banks has been frozen and they face foreclosure – or usurious interest rates – from private financiers . Australian financiers claim their local clients , many of them Asian , have had their settlements deferred by three months to find alternative funding . “ All the deals have been frozen , ” said Mark Yin , an agent with Shanghai-based Home Tree Group , about his Shanghai clients ' funding with Australian banks . “ We are now looking for finance all over the world. ” Mr Yin said this represented nearly 100 per cent of his clients who were waiting for properties to be completed in Australia and that most of the apartments were in the Melbourne CBD . Melbourne-based Marshall Condon , chief executive of mortgage broker Neue Black and who also has off-shore and local Asian investors , added : “ In the next three to 12 months , many investors will be applying for funding to complete their deals , however , they will be become increasingly concerned as they discover funding is limited. ” Billions of dollars has been invested in tens-of-thousands of high-rise apartments that are reshaping the skylines of the nation 's major capitals , particularly Melbourne , Sydney and Brisbane . Most have been sold off-the-plan , which means purchasers buy off the blueprint with a deposit and complete when it is built , which requires a second valuation and financing commitment by the lender . But a huge increase in supply has slowed demand , particularly around Melbourne 's CBD , pushing down prices . Lenders , which initially fell over themselves to finance overseas ' buyers , slammed on the breaks when spot checks on the loan applications detected widespread fraud . The main problem is mainland Chinese buyers , which account for about half of the deals . That means many local lenders that agreed to provide funding when buyers made deposits , will not recommit upon completion . Nervous local lenders fear that a sharp downturn , or change of sentiment , could result in foreclosures with overseas borrowers they have little chance of locating . Mortgage brokers , who receive their commissions upon final completion , are nervous they will not be paid for negotiating deals and financing . Developers , some of whom have already canceled projects , are concerned about financing existing and future projects . It also has potentially big economic impact for local consumer sentiment , building services and government revenues . Overseas financiers , typically based in Singapore and Malaysia , are working on rescue packages for borrowers by creating private bail-out funds , or buying apartments off stressed purchases , which means they lose their deposit . They include rolling five-year terms , starting at 7.5 per cent , or one-year emergency loans at 12 per cent , according to financiers . Other packages are stepped-loans where the different amounts of the loan have different rates , invariably several times higher than Australian lenders ' standard variable or fixed rate loans . For example , Australian banks and other local lenders are offering three-year fixed rates at below 4 per cent . Home Tree Group 's Mr Yin said so far he was unable to secure funding for his clients and doubted they would be able to settle . “ I have now stopped dealing in Australian property , ” he said . Another agent in Shanghai , the chief executives of Iron Fish China Lanny Xu , said while most of his clients were not affected by the change , around 20 per cent were trying to on-sell apartments as they were unable to complete settlement . He said of some were looking to banks in Singapore for financing , as they were still happy to extend loans over Australian property . “ The cost of funding in Singapore is higher than in Australia , ” he said . Mr Xu said another option was to seek finance from newly established mortgage funds , which were looking to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of Australian banks from the market . He said such funds were charging interest rates of between 8 per cent and 12 per cent . Scott Kirchner , the manager of Bella Resident in China , said the inability of offshore buyers to access finance was “ really starting to bite ” . “ We are reluctant to take on new clients unless they have 100 per cent of the cash for a property , ” he said . “ But then there 's the issue of how do they get the money out of China . ”
( emphasis added )
In other words , a number of buyers are now faced with a sudden increase in interest rates from 4 % to between 8 % to 12 % – regardless of the administered interest rate of the RBA . It is of course possible that the effect will once again stay local ( i.e. , confined to Melbourne and condominiums ) , similar to what happened when commodity prices collapsed .
The downturn in commodities led to sharp declines in property prices in regions and towns close to mining activities . However , house prices in the big cities continued to soar – not least because the RBA cut rates in order to offset the impact of the commodities bust .
It is definitely possible though that this latest development is actually the pin that finally pricks the bubble . As noted above , in Kuwait a single bounced check reportedly triggered an avalanche . The Souk Al-Manakh bubble is certainly not directly comparable to Australia 's housing market , but when a bubble is already very stretched , something will eventually trigger its demise – at times it can even be a seemingly small event .
Condominium high-rises in Melbourne – to date the consensus was that the market “ might ” be oversupplied by 2018 – it appears as though this juncture has been brought forward .
Conclusion
It is a very good bet that many of the condominium high-rises built in anticipation of ever-growing demand and an unimpeded expansion of bank credit will turn out to have been unwise investments . As Ludwig von Mises reminds us in Human Action , these malinvestments become visible once the banks are getting cold feet and are beginning to pull back – which is precisely what seems to be happening in this case .
However conditions may be , it is certain that no manipulations of the banks can provide the economic system with capital goods . What is needed for a sound expansion of production is additional capital goods , not money or fiduciary media . The boom is built on the sands of banknotes and deposits . It must collapse . The breakdown appears as soon as the banks become frightened by the accelerated pace of the boom and begin to abstain from further expansion of credit . The boom could continue only as long as the banks were ready to grant freely all those credits which business needed for the execution of its excessive projects , utterly disagreeing with the red state of the supply of factors of production and the valuations of the consumers . These illusory plans , suggested by the falsification of business calculation as brought about by the cheap money policy , can be pushed forward only if new credits can be obtained at gross market rates which are artificially lowered below the height they would reach at an unhampered loan market . It is this margin that gives them the deceptive appearance of profitability . The change in the banks ' conduct does not create the crisis . It merely makes visible the havoc spread by the faults which business has committed in the boom period . – L.v . Mises , Human Action p. 559
( emphasis added )
It is probably still fair to say though that an outbreak of caution on the part of lenders is a trigger for the bust , in the sense that the illusory accounting profits generated during the boom period will suddenly disappear .
Of course it remains to be seen if this recent development will have wider implications for Australia 's real estate bubble or if the central bank 's loose monetary policy will continue to trump such disturbances in the farce . This is one development though which the RBA can not really influence – it is essentially a major rate hike affecting an important group of buyers , and it seems as though a lot of hitherto anticipated demand simply wo n't be there .
Bonus picture : the back of the $ 1 million shack . Just in case you thought it might look better from a different perspective…
I know this may be hard for some people to believe , but I am , at heart , a well-read , liberal , bleeding-heart , tree-hugging intellectual . If I could , I would study anything and everything forever ; I am passionate about politics , about math , about books , and above all , maybe , about law . I 've loved law forever because no matter how hard I try to become cynical about the world , no matter how much I see of the injustice of it , no matter how many times I am hurt , I remain unfailingly optimistic about the prospect of fairness and justice . Even though I know differently , through years of hands-on experience , I genuinely try to believe the best of people as a whole until they prove me wrong .
I consider this to be one of my biggest personality flaws .
I 've seen the world , and I know it 's unfair . I 've seen how women are treated on the grander scale of things , and it 's not a pretty picture . I 've personally been assaulted and harassed . The world is n't a nice place . But my world , in my gym , with my friends– this is supposed to be insular . I have earned my goddamn stripes on the mat . I 've bled on those mats ; sweat on them , cried on them . I 've proven , time and again , that my gender is an aside to who I am when I step onto the mat . I am not defined by it , any more than my teammates are defined by their masculinity when they step on the mat . BJJ is the great equalizer , right ? We 'll sweat and bleed and suffer together , gender be damned . If you ca n't keep up , male or female , get out of the way , or I 'm going to smash your face .
Last night , we had a wrestling coach come in to teach us . Without a doubt , his wrestling is stellar , and he has incredible amounts of knowledge . But he said something that has been rattling around my head all night :
And then if you really want to make him feel like a girl , you do this .
Excuse me ? “ Girl ” is n't a feeling . “ Girl ” is my goddamned gender . I do n't “ feel ” like a girl , I am one . Call me crazy , but if we were to substitute a racial term in for “ girl ” in that sentence , people would be totally up in arms about it . As it was , no one except my closest friends batted an eye . That , my friends , is disgusting .
I am not the kind of woman who likes to say , “ yeah , I 'm a girl , but I 'm not like those other girls , I do n't like drama/I do n't have female friends/I do n't get along with women/etc. ” I do n't have many female friends , but that 's because I spend all day with dudes , not because I do n't get along with women . I do n't feel the need to make myself separate from other women by calling them weak and myself strong . I am a woman , and what I do is BJJ . I like to play rough-and-tumble ; some women do n't , and that 's okay with me . I also like knitting , baking , playing rugby , dancing and playing the violin . None of these things make me less of a BJJ player or less of a woman . I do n't want to ingratiate myself to the men around me by insulting my gender . I am strong , and I am female . These are not any more mutually exclusive than being weak and male are mutually exclusive . You know what makes you ( physically ) strong ? Doing things . Physical things . And “ doing physical things ” is not a gender-specific activity ( as for what makes one mentally or emotionally strong , I 'm not sure– that 's a philosophical question best left for another time ) .
Lighten up , you might say . It was just a joke in class , a one-off line to make the guys feel at home and make them comfortable . Do n't be so sensitive ! It 's just like a woman to be so sensitive . Besides , Leaahh , I know for a fact you allow your friends to make jokes about your gender at your expense .
Well , let me ask you this : at what cost do we make jokes like this ? At what cost do we allow them ? If you want to make your gym female-friendly ( and I know my gym wants to attract more women ) , then a good way to start is to not insult their gender by saying that when something bad happens , that 's what it feels like to be a girl . If I take someone 's back , are they supposed to feel emasculated ? Is that really an environment we want to encourage at the gym ? I do n't want to train with people who view my hard-earned , hard-fought skill as a threat to their masculinity . That 's not something I need in my life .
As for the allowances I make for my friends– yes , sometimes we joke about my gender . You know what they would n't do , though ? Make me feel like less of an athlete because of my gender . They would n't make me feel marginalized to build themselves up by insulting my gender . My friends know me . I see the guys at the gym more often than I see my family . If there were no banter , it would be a sad place indeed . They make jokes to me , about me . They do n't call out my entire gender in class , essentially calling me weak and erasing all the work I do every day to play with the big dogs .
What does it say about this man as a coach ? Well , it tells me that he does n't see female athletes as worth his time or his effort . It tells me that he is all about creating a good-ol'-boy atmosphere in his classes . This should n't surprise me– I know that NCAA Division 1 sports are still like this . I 'm going to propose something ground-breaking here , so bear with me . How about instead of using gendered insults to build up the guys in your class while simultaneously tearing down the women , you find more constructive ways to build team morale and camaraderie ? It 's unfortunate , really . This man has an incredible amount of skill and technique when it comes to wrestling , but I do n't give a single shit about what he says anymore , because with one comment , he made it clear what he thinks of my gender as a whole .
It 's hard enough to walk into a gym every day and be the “ other. ” I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again : being a BJJ girl is hard . Every day , you walk a line : too emotional , too robotic . Too sensitive , too cold . Too weak , too strong . Too manly , too feminine . To many of my teammates , I exist only in the superlative ; that 's fine . I do n't need everyone to understand the complexities of what happens to me at the gym . I can handle myself and the intricacies of my personal situation . But I want to see women 's BJJ grow . I want to see more women on the mat kicking ass . This “ LOL STOP BEING SUCH A GIRL ” attitude– and your inability to see why it 's problematic– is why we ca n't have that yet , boys .
What I expect from everyone is respect . Not for me , personally ; that 's earned . But when a woman walks onto the mat , she should feel the need to prove herself , not her entire gender . When I screw up in class , I should n't be devaluing the achievements of my entire gender . That 's too much pressure to put on one person .
To all the guys out there who build relationships with men by insulting women : stop the gendered insults , your privilege is showing , and it 's really unattractive . If you ca n't substitute a racial term into a sentence without making the statement insulting , chances are you 're insulting women . Cut that crap out . The world will be a better place .
Former Delhi law minister Somnath Bharti on Wednesday broke down in front of Delhi Police officers at Dwarka Sector 23 police station . According to the police , when cops questioned him about the reason for assaulting his wife Lipika Mitra , the former minister broke down .
However , the AAP MLA still claimed that he was in Delhi since the High Court had rejected his bail plea . `` I am a lawyer and I will not disclose anything , '' he was quoted as saying .
Meanwhile , the police , in the FIR against the AAP MLA , have added Section 212 of the IPC . The section deals with providing shelter to a fugitive . Cops have so far identified five persons who allegedly sheltered Bharti .
Taking forward the interrogation , cops questioned Bharti on Tuesday evening and initially asked him about the allegations which were levelled by his wife .
However , Bharti denied all allegations and claimed that they were baseless .
`` Initially Bharti was stiff but was responding , but he broke down when he was asked specific details about how he used to assault his wife and why he did so , '' said a senior police officer .
Police have also asked Bharti to clarify the incident of allegedly unleashing his dog on his wife Lipika and pin-pointed at a particular derogatory word which , the lawmaker 's estranged wife claimed , compelled her to report her ordeal to the police . He , however , denied all allegations .
Bharti was confronted with the driver of a Faridabadbased businessman whose car he had borrowed and later fled from Delhi . `` Bharti was confronted with the driver of a Faridabad-based businessman who dropped him on Yamuna Expressway and the driver has recognised him , but the AAP leader claimed that he had never seen the driver , '' the officer added .
In the wee hours of Wednesday , cops took Bharti to the Dwarka apartment where he lived with his wife , in order to locate the exact location of the crime and reconstruct events .
His wife Lipika was present when Bharti was taken there but no conversation took place between the two during the visit , which lasted between 30 to 40 minutes , the officer said , adding that the former Delhi law minister was later taken to his office in Malviya Nagar and his mother 's residence at Vasant Kunj , where his brother Loknath Bharti also resides as Lipika had alleged that she was assaulted in that house too .
In the evening , the police took Bhati 's pet dog , Don , to a veterinary hospital in Moti Bagh where the labrador retriever is to be examined by an expert , a police officer said .
The former law minister had surrendered on Monday and was subsequently sent to police custody by a Delhi court .
All 77 of Dirk Nowitzki 's teammates since 2011 , ranked This list will show you how little Dirk has had to work with since winning his one championship .
This is my third straight year making this list . In the 2015 debut edition , we only had 53 teammates available ; in 2016 , the list had jumped to 62 . Thanks to a bevy of 10-day contracts and a high turnover offseason last summer , the number has jumped all the way to 77 .
Every year , some people read too quickly and yell at me for forgetting Josh Howard , or something equally ridiculous . Come on , fellas . Here are the basics .
Which players count towards this list ?
This list only includes players who Dirk Nowitzki has played with SINCE winning the championship in 2011 , and only considers those players for their contributions starting in the 2011-12 season and going until the 2016-17 season .
What do the numbers in parenthesis mean ?
The numbers in parenthesis are the number of games those players appeared in for the Mavericks since the 2011-12 season .
How did you rank these players ?
In past years , I took the number of games into account . This year , this is based off quality of play . Whether a player played three seasons or just one , his ranking is based off how good he was during the summation of his time here . This does n't necessarily account for injuries , either .
Did you consider putting Dennis Smith Jr. first ?
I did strongly consider that . ( No player acquired this offseason is on the list . )
What 's the point of this list ?
This is to point out how little help Dirk Nowitzki got since winning his only championship . There are many reasons for that , and those reasons have been discussed to death ( and probably will be discussed some more ) here at Mavs Moneyball , and for good reason . Whatever good intentions the Mavericks had , it ended up leaving Nowitzki very little to work with . Of course , despite all of that , he still led the team to four playoff appearances in the six seasons since the title .
The other point is just that it 's fun to rank things . Hell yeah .
All 73 of Dirk 's teammates since 2011 , ranked
1 . Harrison Barnes ( 79 )
2 . Monta Ellis ( 162 )
3 . Chandler Parsons ( 127 )
4 . Tyson Chandler ( 75 )
5 . Nerlens Noel ( 22 )
6 . Seth Curry ( 70 )
7 . Vince Carter ( 223 )
8 . Wesley Matthews ( 151 )
9 . Jason Terry ( 63 )
10 . J.J. Barea ( 186 )
We 're still looking for improvement from Barnes , but in my eyes , he was clearly the best teammate Dirk has had in the six seasons since 2011 , while just 22 games of Nerlens Noel and a season of Seth Curry was enough to sneak them both into the top six . We know all about Parsons ' injury problems , but when he played , he was one of Dirk 's best teammates . Monta had his own problems , but when he was going good , he was just sensational — at least on one end . Tyson Chandler 's one post-title reprisal was n't Defensive Player of the Year material , but he was still incredibly solid . Vince Carter is the underrated Maverick of the past decade . JET 's last season here was mostly just a bummer . And shoutout to J.J. Barea , who is still hanging around and actually played the best basketball of his career when healthy last season .
11 . Shawn Marion ( 206 )
12 . Deron Williams ( 105 )
13 . O.J . Mayo ( 82 )
14 . Devin Harris ( 245 )
15 . Brandan Wright ( 198 )
16 . Al-Farouq Aminu ( 74 )
17 . Jason Kidd ( 48 )
18 . Jose Calderon ( 81 )
19 . Darren Collison ( 81 )
20 . Raymond Felton ( 109 )
It 's truly incredible how quickly this list falls off . Marion 's three seasons were thoroughly forgettable — I honestly forget he spent three more seasons here — and Deron Williams was nothing but a league average point guard . O.J . Mayo might 've been a top-five player on this list if his early season hot streak had kept up , but he fell off hard after Dirk returned that season — the one where they grew the big ass beards . Then there are a bunch of solid bench players on this list ... except Kidd , Calderon , Collison , and Felton all started a bunch of games in their respective times here , which is exactly my point about how Dirk has n't got a lot of help since 2011 .
21 . Zaza Pachulia ( 76 )
22 . Delonte West ( 44 )
23 . Jae Crowder ( 181 )
24 . Richard Jefferson ( 74 )
25 . Samuel Dalembert ( 80 )
26 . Elton Brand ( 72 )
27 . Yogi Ferrell ( 36 )
28 . Dorian Finney-Smith ( 81 )
29 . DeJuan Blair ( 78 )
30 . Salah Mejri ( 107 )
I still love Zaza , even if he was a below average starter during his time here . I also still love Delonte West , who played his damn heart out in his time here . Yogi Ferrell might even be a little low , but I tempered his performance with realistic expectations about his future . ( He 's a new age J.J. Barea and that should lead him to having a fine career . ) DeJuan Blair ? Salah Mejri ? Both in the top 30 ? I forget how upsetting this project is .
31 . Dwight Powell ( 170 )
32 . Ian Mahinmi ( 61 )
33 . Amar ' e Stoudemire ( 23 )
34 . Justin Anderson ( 106 )
35 . David Lee ( 25 )
36 . Chris Kaman ( 66 )
37 . Brendan Haywood ( 54 )
38 . Bernard James ( 92 )
39 . Brian Cardinal ( 44 )
40 . Andrew Bogut ( 26 )
We 're quickly running out of rotation players . Powell could be higher , and at times he has been much better , but we also have to consider an entire season where he just was n't that effective . That 's the sum of his performance here . I like him as a backup big this season ! Justin Anderson 's in a similar boat : was very good for stretches but overall below average . Bogut , Haywood , and Bernard James ? Goodness .
41 . Rodrigue Beaubois ( 98 )
42 . Charlie Villanueva ( 126 )
43 . Nicolas Brussino ( 54 )
44 . Dahntay Jones ( 50 )
45 . Wayne Ellington ( 45 )
46 . Jameer Nelson ( 23 )
47 . JaVale McGee ( 34 )
48 . Jeremy Evans ( 30 )
49 . A.J . Hammons ( 22 )
50 . Shane Larkin ( 48 )
How the hell are there still 27 players left .
Shoutout to JaVale for finding the only team that maximized his strengths enough to hide his weaknesses in Golden State . ( I think he also has matured a few ticks more than his time in Dallas , which has helped . ) I ca n't believe Anthony Morrow was ever on this team . Shoutout to Nicolas Brussino , who was objectively better than 34 people who suited up for the Mavericks at various points . He won them a game ! Who else on this list can boast about that ?
51 . Dominique Jones ( 62 )
52 . Ricky Ledo ( 16 )
53 . Gal Mekel ( 31 )
54 . Yi Jianlian ( 30 )
55 . Quincy Acy ( 6 )
56 . Eddy Curry ( 2 )
57 . John Jenkins ( 21 )
58 . Chris Douglas-Roberts ( 6 )
59 . Mike James ( 45 )
60 . Troy Murphy ( 14 )
The Mavericks have to pay Gal Mekel $ 315,758 this season before he finally comes off their books . I wish I were kidding . The rest of these names seem like weird fever dreams . Was preseason MVP John Jenkins really a thing ? Did Yi Jianlian actually play for this team ? Mike James ! ? Troy Murphy ! ! ? ! ! ? ! !
Shoutout Ricky Ledo , the real MVP in my heart .
61 . Jared Cunningham ( 8 )
62 . Sean Williams ( 8 )
63 . Greg Smith ( 42 )
64 . Jarrod Uthoff ( 9 )
65 . DeAndre Liggins ( 1 )
66 . Kelenna Azubuike ( 3 )
67 . Quinn Cook ( 5 )
68 . Manny Harris ( 4 )
Nice . Josh Akognon ( 3 )
70 . Justin Dentmon ( 2 )
71 . Chris Wright ( 3 )
72 . Pierre Jackson ( 8 )
73 . Jonathan Gibson ( 17 )
74 . Ben Bentil ( 3 )
What a bizarre collection of 10-day contracts , end-of-the-bench fliers , and .... a first round draft pick ? Looking at you , Jared Cunningham .
75 . Lamar Odom ( 50 )
76 . Derek Fisher ( 9 )
77 . Rajon Rondo ( 46 )
We know all about Odom 's problems now , ones that got much worse in Dallas . I hope he 's doing alright . His time on the court with the Mavericks was an unmitigated disaster , of course .
Fisher used his kids to get out of a contract with the Mavericks once he realized they were bad , and then he signed with a playoff contender a few months later . Whatever , man .
And then there 's Rondo , whose mini-renaissance in the past few seasons — it still blows my mind that he led the league in assists in Sacramento — has made his Dallas blowup look even worse . It 's one thing to just not be an NBA player , and arguably , Rondo is a borderline case at this point . But he did n't try with the Mavericks , except for the occasional games where he felt like it , and that 's an unforgivable sin .
`` Welcome to America 's hottest talk line ! Ladies , to talk to interesting and exciting guys free , press one now . Guys , hot ladies are waiting to talk to you . Press two to connect free now . ''
That was what some callers to California 's Affordable Care Act Health Exchange website heard when they called to try and sign up for health insurance .
Apparently , the number that was posted on the website had one digit wrong . As a result , customers who were rushing to sign up for Obamacare on the last day of open enrollment , ended up being offered a chance to talk dirty to some sexy singles .
While this may appear to be just one more ridiculous example of utter incompetence , brought to you by the people who are now in charge of the nation 's health care system , this is n't the first time that a government phone number intended to help citizens has resulted in callers being offered some steamy conversation .
In fact , it happens surprisingly often .
Here are some of the most recent examples of this bizarre phenomenon .
1 . In 2008 a phone line was set up by U.S. Department of Fish & Wildlife , in order for Americans to purchase a stamp that would allow them to hunt ducks during the upcoming season . A card provided listed two numbers where the stamps could be purchased . The first number listed was 1-800-STAMP24 . But , due to a printing error , the alternative number to call if that number was busy was listed as 1-800-TRAMP24 .
While the duck stamps cost $ 15 a piece , when duck hunters called the number listed they were offered a far better deal . For only $ 1.99 a minute a recorded message offered callers the opportunity to `` .. talk to the girls that turn you on . '' WHAT A DEAL ! !
Interestingly enough , in a rare display of federal government frugality , the fish and wildlife people decided that it would be too expensive to reprint the cards with the correct number - and let duck hunting enthusiasts figure it out for themselves for the remainder of the season .
2 . In 2012 , Florida Governor Rick Scott directed Floridians to call the state 's Department of Health if the wanted information about a fungal meningitis outbreak .
During his announcement , Scott inadvertently gave out the wrong number which led callers to an automated message featuring a sultry young female who said `` Hello boys ; thank you for calling me on my anniversary , '' and then directed the concerned citizens to a menu featuring a host of `` naughty options . ''
It is unclear whether the young girl featured in the recording had fungal meningitis . But , it 's pretty likely .
3 . In Florida , a year later , deputies in Lake County printed up a brochure that listed the rights of victims of sexual assault and domestic violence . It also provided an emergency hotline number , which directed people to a sex line instead . When dialed , a recorded message said , `` Welcome to America 's hottest talk line . Ladies , to talk to interesting and exciting guys free , press one now . Guys , hot ladies are waiting to talk to you . ''
4 . Last February , a Georgia woman inquiring about her child-care services was directed to a sex hotline , despite dialing a government-issued phone number . The woman , thinking this was an error , dialed the number at least four more times , but still got directed to the adult phone service .
5 . In October of 2013 , San Francisco residents , fed up with the noise from the Nike Women 's Marathon , were directed by the city to call 1-800-RUN-NIKE to voice their complaints . When dialed , a woman told the callers to `` unzip that fly , baby . ''
6 . In Santa Fe County , New Mexico , the local government site listed two phone numbers on its contact page . Do I really have to say where those two numbers led constituents to ? The sex hotline numbers were subsequently taken down .
7 . Last January , it was discovered that a former child seat information line operated by the Colorado State Patrol had turned into a phone sex line . According to KDVR-TV , Denver , the Colorado Children 's Hospital and the Colorado Department of Transportation listed the state patrol 's child seat safety hotline as 1-877-LUV-TOTS .
Needless to say , that hotline number put the state patrol on the hot seat after parents called looking for information on child seats for cars .

The Westboro Baptist Church intends to protest Muhammad Ali 's memorial service on Friday , officials announced on their website and social media .
From 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. , the radical Baptist church plans to picket outside the KFC Yum ! Center where a funeral service is scheduled for Ali , according to their picket schedule . They also threatened on Twitter to burn a copy of the Quran , the Muslim holy book .
The group said they 're protesting because Ali was a `` Christ-rejecting Muslim '' and `` followed after the false prophet ... Muhammad . ''
Protesting funerals is nothing new for the Topeka , Kansas-based church . They originally gained notoriety for protesting the funeral of a Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in 1998 , after it was determined he was beaten to death because of his homosexuality .
They have also protested the funerals of military service members , Steve Jobs , Michael Jackson and the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut . They are particularly outspoken with their anti-LGBT and anti-Semitic views .
Friday 's memorial service at the KFC Yum ! Center begins at 2 p.m. Eulogists include Lonnie Ali , former President Bill Clinton , actor Billy Crystal and journalist Bryant Gumbel . All available tickets were given out in less than an hour Wednesday , as hundreds lined up outside the arena 's box office .
The city announced Wednesday night that it will erect large screens near the Kentucky Center for the Performing Centers at the Belvedere , a downtown park setting a few blocks away , that can accommodate more than 10,000 people . Water and restrooms will be available .
Officials warned visitors to expect heavy traffic and limited parking in the area . They are offering off-site parking with shuttles into the area .

If I were to tell you Orange County 's most talked-about beer is n't an IPA , you 'd probably say , “ It 's a Double IPA , right ? ” Nope . “ Bourbon Barrel Aged Russian Imperial Stout ? ” Closer ! Here are a few clues :
It 's a coffee milk stout .
It 's blonde .
It 's only served on nitro .
Although a blonde milk stout served on nitro is intriguing on its own , Anaheim 's Noble Ale Works cooked up all the talk this year by adding a fun name : Naughty Sauce . My initial reaction was “ gimmick beer ” ; however , knowing what Evan Price has done since taking over as head brewer at Noble mid-2012 , I could n't deny the sauce .
Visually , Naughty Sauce looks similar to a freshly baked vanilla cupcake . Its fluffy golden yellow body is topped with a dollop of creamy white cascading head . Blindfolded , the beer smells and drinks like a frothed beer-latte . It 's hard to not look like a “ Got Milk ” ad after the first sip . “ Got Milk Stout ? ” Indeed . A pint goes down with minimal effort thanks to its velvety spumescent body .
Noble enlisted Portola Coffee Labs in Costa Mesa with its custom El Salvador coffee blend . Beans are hand-selected and roasted specifically for Naughty Sauce . “ We let Portola geek out with the blend . We know beer , they know coffee , ” says Price with his boyish good looks . He claims that fresh coffee beans “ have a fruity quality going in the tank , but impart a bright-roasty character when complete. ” Although three pounds of coffee per barrel are used , Portola 's owner and master roaster Jeff Duggan confirms a small amount caffeine is infused in the beer , estimating around 20 % of the caffeine in a standard 12 oz cup of coffee per pint .
Naughty Sauce is brewed and released quarterly — this latest batch yielded 45 BBL — to maintain freshness and quality . As the beer is nitro-only , Noble likes to spread the sauce around Orange County 's best craft beer bars . Initially a one-off batch , Don 's Naughty Sauce was brewed in collaboration with the all-craft beer restaurant The Playground in downtown Santa Ana . Using superstar coffee Don Pachi , the release let people taste the expensive $ 100/lb Panama beans in a unique beer .
Jarred Dooley , Director of Libations at The Playground , put it well :
“ There 's nothing quite like the face a person makes the first time they try Noble 's Naughty Sauce . People ca n't equate the color of the beer with its flavor . I think that , hopefully , people will start to realize that the plethora of amazing beers being churned out means they do n't have to go on an endless search for a ‘ whale ' of a beer . I think that Naughty Sauce deserves the cult following that Pliny the Younger gets ! ”
Special firkin releases are also a regular occurrence . The small environment of a cask gives Noble the freedom to infuse base beers with high quality specialty ingredients . Casks like Naughty Nuts – Naughty Sauce infused with hand-shaved , roasted coconut – are usually drained in one long continuous pour . Popular batches may pave the way for larger brews .
The name Naughty Sauce came from assistant brewer Brad Kominek who thought the name matched the “ sexiness ” of the beer . Noble owner Jerry Kolbly was n't a fan , but gave it the green light after a pint . Noble Ale Works has fun with most of their beer names , such as a porter named Jonathan ( named after the freshly-opened Smog City Brewing 's Jonathan Porter ) and Gosebusters , which is their take on a Leipziger Gose . Although Noble 's IPA still outsells the Sauce , all the attention has been nice money shot for the brewery .
Noble Ale Works is located walking distance from Honda Center and Angel 's Stadium in Anaheim . Head Brewer Evan Price previously brewed at TAPS Fishhouse & Brewery , Hangar 24 and BJ 's .

A skeleton found beneath a Leicester car park has been confirmed as that of English king Richard III .
Experts from the University of Leicester said DNA from the bones matched that of descendants of the monarch 's family .
Lead archaeologist Richard Buckley , from the University of Leicester , told a press conference to applause : `` Beyond reasonable doubt it 's Richard . ''
Richard , killed in battle in 1485 , will be reinterred in Leicester Cathedral .
Mr Buckley said the bones had been subjected to `` rigorous academic study '' and had been carbon dated to a period from 1455-1540 .
Dr Jo Appleby , an osteo-archaeologist from the university 's School of Archaeology and Ancient History , revealed the bones were of a man in his late 20s or early 30s . Richard was 32 when he died .
His skeleton had suffered 10 injuries , including eight to the skull , at around the time of death . Two of the skull wounds were potentially fatal .
One was a `` slice '' removing a flap of bone , the other was caused by bladed weapon which went through and hit the opposite side of the skull - a depth of more than 10cm ( 4ins ) .
'Humiliation injuries '
Dr Appleby said : `` Both of these injuries would have caused an almost instant loss of consciousness and death would have followed quickly afterwards .

`` In the case of the larger wound , if the blade had penetrated 7cm into the brain , which we can not determine from the bones , death would have been instantaneous . ''
Other wounds included slashes or stabs to the face and the side of the head . There was also evidence of `` humiliation '' injuries , including a pelvic wound likely to have been caused by an upward thrust of a weapon , through the buttock .
Richard III was portrayed as deformed by some Tudor historians and indeed the skeleton 's spine is badly curved , a condition known as scoliosis .
However , there was no trace of a withered arm or other abnormalities described in the more extreme characterisations of the king .
Missing princes
Without the scoliosis , which experts believe developed during teenage years , he would have been about 5ft 8ins ( 1.7m ) tall , but the curvature would have made him appear `` considerably '' shorter .
Dr Appleby said : `` The analysis of the skeleton proved that it was an adult male but was an unusually slender , almost feminine , build for a man .
`` Taken as a whole , the skeletal evidence provides a highly convincing case for identification as Richard III . ''
Richard was a royal prince until the death of his brother Edward IV in 1483 . Appointed as protector of his nephew , Edward V , Richard instead assumed the reins of power .
Edward and his brother Richard , known as the Princes in the Tower , disappeared soon after . Rumours circulated they had been murdered on the orders of their uncle .
Challenged by Henry Tudor , Richard was killed at Bosworth in 1485 after only two years on the throne .
DNA trail
He was given a hurried burial beneath the church of Greyfriars in the centre of Leicester .
Mr Buckley said the grave was clumsily cut , with sloping sides and too short for the body , forcing the head forward .
University of Leicester findings Image copyright AFP • Wealth of evidence , including radiocarbon dating , radiological evidence , DNA and bone analysis and archaeological results , confirms identity of last Plantagenet king who died over 500 years ago • DNA from skeleton matches two of Richard III 's maternal line relatives . Leicester genealogist verifies living relatives of Richard III 's family • Individual likely to have been killed by one of two fatal injuries to the skull - one possibly from a sword and one possibly from a halberd • Ten wounds discovered on skeleton - Richard III killed by trauma to the back of the head . Part of the skull sliced off • Radiocarbon dating reveals individual had a high protein diet - including significant amounts of seafood - meaning he was likely to be of high status • Radiocarbon dating reveals individual died in the second half of the 15th or in the early 16th Century - consistent with Richard 's death in 1485 • Skeleton reveals severe scoliosis - onset believed to have occurred at the time of puberty • Although about 5ft 8in tall ( 1.7m ) , the condition meant King Richard III would have stood significantly shorter and his right shoulder may have been higher than the left • Feet were truncated at an unknown point in the past , but a significant time after the burial
`` There was no evidence of a coffin or shroud which would have left the bones in a more compact position .
`` Unusually , the arms are crossed and this could be an indication the body was buried with the wrists still tied , '' he added .
Greyfriars church was demolished during the Reformation in the 16th Century and over the following centuries its exact location was forgotten .
However , a team of enthusiasts and historians managed to trace the likely area - and , crucially , after painstaking genealogical research , they found a 17th-generation descendant of Richard 's sister with whose DNA they could compare any remains .
Joy Ibsen , from Canada , died several years ago but her son , Michael , who now works in London , provided a sample .
The researchers were fortunate as , while the DNA they were looking for was in all Joy Ibsen 's offspring , it is only handed down through the female line and her only daughter has no children . The line was about to stop .
Tomb plans
But the University of Leicester 's experts had other problems .
Dr Turi King , project geneticist , said there had been concern DNA in the bones would be too degraded : `` The question was could we get a sample of DNA to work with , and I am extremely pleased to tell you that we could . ''
She added : `` There is a DNA match between the maternal DNA of the descendants of the family of Richard III and the skeletal remains we found at the Greyfriars dig .
`` In short , the DNA evidence points to these being the remains of Richard III . ''
In August 2012 , an excavation began in a city council car park - the only open space remaining in the likely area - which quickly identified buildings connected to the church .

The bones were found in the first days of the dig and were eventually excavated under forensic conditions .
Details of the reburial ceremony have yet to be released , but Philippa Langley from the Richard III Society said plans for a tomb were well advanced .
She said of the discovery of Richard 's skeleton : `` I 'm totally thrilled , I 'm overwhelmed to be honest , it 's been a long hard journey . I mean today as we stand it 's been nearly four years .
`` It 's the culmination of a lot of hard work . I think , as someone said to me earlier , it 's just the end of the beginning .

It 's just simple ( fill in the blank ) . I hear that phrase every time someone ca n't support their uneducated opinions . People seem to think many of the problems mankind face are simple and without variables . In my article here , I was debunking pit bull aggression myths and a commenter tried to tie it to simple biology . He gave a fallacious comparison to how human males are more violent and aggressive than females . When asking for citations , I got a meaningless rant instead . People do n't seem to realize that their opinion is n=1 . A logical opinion consists of weighing the evidence we have with the actions and stance that you take .
Below , I listed the actual conclusions from the studies rather than dressing them up and cherry picking lines to make the data seem much more significant than it really is . Citation 1 and 4 are great Metadata reads that have over 50 citations each to further strengthen their argument .
Conclusion 1 :
“ When physical aggression is the subject of inquiry , studies consistently find that as many women self-report perpetrating this behavior as do men ; some studies find a higher prevalence of physical aggression committed by women ” ( 1 ) .
Conclusion 2 :
A Harvard study : Results . Almost 24 % of all relationships had some violence , and half ( 49.7 % ) of those were reciprocally violent . In nonreciprocally violent relationships , women were the perpetrators in more than 70 % of the cases . Reciprocity was associated with more frequent violence among women ( 2 ) .
Conclusion 3 :
“ The empirical data on these issues were provided by 13,601 university students who participated in the International Dating Violence Study in 32 nations . The results in the first part of this paper show that almost a third of the female as well as male students physically assaulted a dating partner in the 12 month study period , and that the most frequent pattern was mutuality in violence , i.e . both were violent , followed by “ female-only ” violence ” ( 3 ) .
Conclusion 4 :
A review of studies for teen dating violence by Laura J. Hickman ET . Al showed “ more boys have reported perpetrating sexual abuse than have girls ( 37 percent and 24 percent , respectively ) , but more girls reported perpetrating physical abuse of their partners than did boys ( 28 percent and 11 percent , respectively ) ( 4 ) .
Conclusion 5 :
This study done with college samples also find that men and women commit similar rates of physical aggression ( 5 ) .
So as you can see when all the smoke clears , there is no such thing as simple biology when dealing with behavior . There are so many variables that affect our decisions that it is ignorant to claim it is simple . Daphna Joel , a behavioral neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel says it best “ There is no one type of male brain or female brain ” “ There is no sense in talking about male nature and female nature , ” “ Very few of the brains—between 0 % and 8 % —contained all male or all female structures ” ( 6 ) . This confirms what Jeffrey Satinover , MD , Psychiatrist with degrees from MIT , Harvard , the University of Texas and Yale who states that “ there is essentially no dimension of behavior which is not both environmentally and genetically influenced . Heritability of ( or genetic influence on ) a trait does not mean that the trait itself is genetically determined . This elementary fact of behavioral genetics is rarely explained and it seems counterintuitive to most people ” ( 7 ) .
So here you have it , folks . We are all responsible for our own actions . Although we might not all have the same struggles , we all have obstacles to overcome . What really defines a person is how they deal and overcome them . Girls and boys blame , men and women address and solve . Another stereotype debunked ! ! ! !

Gaming Did Not Lead to a Child 's Death
Last week , a man was arrested for the murder of a 2 year old girl in Watauga , Texas . Ordinarily , reporting on a murder would be enough , but the “ Crime Blog ” of the Dallas Morning News decided to take it one step further : “ ‘ Fit of rage ' while gaming may have led Watauga dad to suffocate toddler , police say . ”
The reporter is not fully to blame , as Sgt . Jason Babcock made the suspicion clear : “ He 's very involved in computer gaming . … That 's something he did constantly… She may have interrupted him somehow . ”
This is obviously a salacious story : angry gamer kills child because of violent video games . We 've heard it before , yet there has never been actual proof .
A closer look at the article reveals some interesting details : “ Severe bruising on Ellie 's face , head and body led police to suspect foul play , and doctors found a pair of bite marks on her back , the affidavit says . ”
Yet Sgt . Babcock told the reporter that it had to be a case of video game related violence : “ police believe Sanders may have gotten mad at Ellie for interrupting him while he played computer games and put his hand over her mouth ” .
Covering a mouth does not cause “ severe bruising ” on a body let alone “ a par of bite marks. ” This was not something someone could do while playing a video game . This is not something someone could just randomly do after putting down a controller no matter how angry they were . It would require a lot of activity , especially for the repeated biting , and it is unlikely to be spur-of-the-moment .
Also present at the home was a five year old child , and there is no mention of anything regarding the child noticing the severe violence taking place . To the contrary , “ A short time after the mother came home , the 5-year-old attempted to rouse his sister , who was in her parents ' bedroom . ”
If this was a fit of rage while playing a video game , then the bruising would be very different and the other child most likely would have noticed something happening .
So why do the police insist that it must be a video game related case and why did n't the reporters challenge them on these details not adding up ? Because gamers are an easy demographic to blame , and the salaciousness of gamer rage leading to a child 's death brings attention to a case .
A child 's death is horrible enough . You do not need to make up a story about video game violence . There is far more to the story , and it is n't video game related .

Alors que la presse italienne l ' a placé dans plusieurs rumeurs cette semaine , le capitaine du PSG Thiago Silva a confié son envie de prolonger au PSG après le match face à l'OM .
La semaine avant PSG/OM avait été marquée par de nombreuses rumeurs autour de Thiago Silva , le directeur général de la Juventus allant même jusqu ' à l'évoquer comme une possible bon coup du prochain mercato estival . En effet , le capitaine du PSG est sous contrat jusqu'en juin 2017 ( plus une année en option liée à la Ligue des Champions ) et sa prolongation de contrat tarde à se décider , notamment parce que le club parisien ne semble pas très pressé .
Après son excellent match face à l'OM , le défenseu central brésilien de 32 ans a été interrogé sur son futur et il a expliqué sa situation actuelle : « Ce n'est pas à moi de décider , on doit parler . On a commencé à parler l'année dernière , à la fin de la saison , et après ça s'est arrêté , je ne sais pas pourquoi . Mais je suis content ici , je veux rester , prolonger mon contrat . On doit parler avec le président pour savoir ce qu'on va faire pour le futur. » Relancé par un journaliste qui lui demande s'il veut rester , Silva ajoute dans un sourire : « Oui , toujours . »
Ces derniers jours , ce sont ses partenaires qui avaient manifesté leur envie de le voir rester , notamment son partenaire dans l'axe Marquinhos . Reste désormais au PSG à agir .
While Perry has been touting the great medical care available in Texas ( and there are some excellent medical centers ) the percentage of people in Texas without adequate access to almost any medical care is very high . 30 % of adults between 19 and 64 years do not have health insurance nor do 22 % of children from new born to 18 y.o . For employed Texans only 47 % get health coverage through their job making Texas the 50th lowest state in that group . Probably related to the fact that most of the new jobs created during the `` recovery '' being low , usually minimum wage . Before Bush and Perry , Texans used to joke that on most lists of the worst states in health and education , etc . they were only # 49 because Thank God for Mississippi . Well no more .
Concentrations of poverty and associated disease in the US can be grouped into about 7 classes . Appalachia , Mississippi Delta , the Cotton Belt , Tribal Lands , the Rural Poor , Disadvantaged Urban Groups , and the Southwestern Border Lands . These Border lands extend from South East Arizona through Southern New Mexico and along the entire Texas-Mexico border . In a 2008 paper Hotez lists the neglected diseases of poverty for each region and for the Border region the list contains 6 diseases you would expect to find in poor tropical areas of Africa , Asia , and South America . : Brucellosis , Cysticercosis , Chagas Disease , Dengue , Leishmaniasis , and Leprosy . Three of the six are insect spread are are associated with inadequate housing conditions .
According to the Texas Medical Association
The uninsured are up to four times less likely to have a regular source of health care and are more likely to die from health-related problems . They are much less likely to receive needed medical care , even for symptoms that can have serious health consequences if not treated . About one in five Texans lives at or below the poverty level ; for children , it 's nearly one in three .
Do n't get sick . If you do get sick hurry up and die .
And Perry wants to opt out of `` Obamacare '' and drop Medicaid leaving nothing for the uninsured except the emergency room which is at least 4 times as expensive.All considered Perry has a health care problem with all voters except for those that took Alan Greyson 's Republican Health mantra to heart .
The Fulmer Cup Standings
Welcome to the Standings for the World 's Most Prestigious College Football Award Based on Criminal Record , run by /r/CFB and based out of /r/TheFulmerCup .
There are over 20,000 Division 1 college football players . As a whole , they have crime rates much lower than the general population . However , when they do get in trouble , they get a lot of attention . For that reason , we have The Fulmer Cup .
The Fulmer Cup is a parody award that tracks the criminal achievements of various college football programs during the offseason and declares a “ winner ” . It is open to all Division 1 football programs ( FBS & FCS ) , and points are awarded based on the level of crime ( more details below ) . The Fulmer Cup season starts the minute the national title game is finished and ends the minute of the FBS kickoff , this year on August 26 .

During the January 18 edition of MSNBC 's Morning Joe , host Joe Scarborough asserted that it was `` outrageous that Chris Matthews has to apologize '' for his January 9 comment , highlighted by Media Matters for America , in which Matthews said that `` the reason '' Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D-NY ) is `` a U.S. senator , the reason she 's a candidate for president , the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around . That 's how she got to be senator from New York . We keep forgetting it . She did n't win there on her merit . '' Scarborough , in a discussion with co-host Mika Brzezinski , MSNBC correspondent David Shuster , and MSNBC political analyst Pat Buchanan , was referring to Chris Matthews ' statement on the January 17 edition of MSNBC 's Hardball responding to the firestorm sparked by his January 9 comment .
Matthews ' original comment about Clinton was not aired during the discussion .
During the discussion , Brzezinski asserted :
BRZEZINSKI : -- that led to her success , and there was nothing wrong with pointing that out . There was nothing wrong with it .
BRZEZINSKI : He agreed with me , and that was the conversation . But what he was saying , like in New Hampshire , there was a confluence of events including sympathy --
BRZEZINSKI : I 'm probably going to say something that 's wildly unpopular with women , but what bothers me about this is that the websites isolated one portion of what he said and that was a conversation , and I was a part of that conversation , and I actually remember saying to him that of course if Laura Bush or if someone else was humiliated by their husband , they would n't win for Senate because they did n't have the qualifications , and Hillary Clinton had worked all of her life getting experience . But what Chris was saying --
Brzezinski was apparently referring to her statement that `` if Laura Bush was humiliated by her husband and then ran for Senate two years later , she would not win . Hillary Clinton laid the groundwork before she was victimized , before she was humiliated . '' However , she did not make that statement during the conversation in which Matthews first made his remarks on January 9 , but rather two days later , on the January 11 edition of Morning Joe , during a telephone interview in which Matthews expanded on his original comment . While Matthews acknowledged on the January 11 Morning Joe that `` [ y ] ou can argue a lot of factors '' might have led to Clinton 's election to the Senate , on January 9 , Matthews said :
She did n't win there on her merit . She won because everybody felt , `` My God , this woman stood up under humiliation , '' right ? That 's what happened . That 's how it happened . In 1998 she went to New York and campaigned for Chuck Schumer as almost as the grieving widow of absurdity , and she did it so well and courageously , but it was about the humiliation of Bill Clinton .
MATTHEWS : Look , I think that may be true . I think the Hillary appeal has always been somewhat about her mix of toughness and sympathy for her . Let 's not forget -- and I 'll be brutal -- the reason she 's a U.S. senator , the reason she 's a candidate for president , the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around . That 's how she got to be senator from New York . We keep forgetting it .
In response to Brzezinski 's January 9 statement that Clinton `` does have more than being a victim , '' Matthews did say `` I agree , '' as Media Matters documented in the transcript of the original item .
Also on the January 18 edition of Morning Joe , Scarborough asserted that it was `` outrageous '' that `` Chris Matthews has to apologize for saying something , inartfully perhaps , so many years later that op-ed writers were talking about in '99 and 2000 because Gloria Steinem , who wrote an op-ed supporting Hillary Clinton before New Hampshire , Media Matters , who many people have called a front group for Hillary Clinton , just because they 're attacking Chris Matthews , who has obviously been critical of Hillary Clinton . '' In fact , while conservative commentators have asserted that Media Matters is a `` front group for Hillary Clinton , '' Media Matters has repeatedly noted that it is an independent , nonprofit , progressive organization unaffiliated with any candidate or political party .
From the January 18 edition of MSNBC 's Morning Joe :
SCARBOROUGH : Hey Pat , I want to play you a clip of Chris Matthews last night . He talked at the top of Hardball . He 's had NOW , Gloria Steinem , Media Matters , a lot of groups going after him , picketing him because of something he said on our show . I want to play you a quick clip of Chris from last night .
[ begin video clip ]
MATTHEWS : Was it fair to say that Hillary Clinton , like any great politician , took advantage of a crisis to prove herself ? Was her conduct in 1998 a key to starting her independent electoral career the following year ? Yes . Was it fair to imply that Hillary 's whole career depended on being a victim of an unfaithful husband ? No . And that 's what it sounded like I was saying and it hurt people I 'd like to think normally like what I say , in fact , normally like me . As I said , I rely on my heart to guide me in the heated , fast-paced talk we have here on Hardball -- a heart that bears only goodwill toward people trying to make it out there , especially those who have n't before . If my heart has not always controlled my words , on those occasions when I have not taken the time to say things right , or have simply said the inappropriate thing , I 'll try to be clearer , smarter , more obviously in support of the right of women -- of all people -- the full equality and respect for their ambitions . So , I get it .
[ end video clip ]
SCARBOROUGH : Pat , I suppose I should guard my words here . I am not going to do it . This is offensive to me , that Chris Matthews said something that op-ed writers wrote about in '98 , in '99 , in 2000 . That Bill Clinton scandal with Monica Lewinsky clearly helped Hillary Clinton politically because she showed enormous grace under fire , she showed just how strong she was , she continued doing her job . It was a very good moment for her . It was a bit like -- let 's just say New Hampshire was a microcosm of that time , when she was getting abused last week . And we saw her the night before , when she thought she was going to lose by 15 points , she still showed an enormous strength -- and I 've said this on the air before -- an enormous strength that I hope may be an example to my daughter , who -- or any woman who goes through so much -- so many problems but stays that strong .
Now , I 've said all of that just to say , I think it 's outrageous that Chris Matthews has to apologize for saying something , inartfully perhaps , so many years later that op-ed writers were talking about in '99 and 2000 because Gloria Steinem , who wrote an op-ed supporting Hillary Clinton before New Hampshire , Media Matters , who many people have called a front group for Hillary Clinton , just because they 're attacking Chris Matthews , who has obviously been critical of Hillary Clinton . What 's your take ?
BUCHANAN : Well , let me say , look , I think you 're exactly right . Hillary Rodham Clinton became for the American people for the first time a deeply sympathetic figure , not the sort of radical liberal she was perceived as being , when she stood up with grace under pressure under all that humiliation and frankly all that disgrace that was visited upon the presidency and upon her husband , and she handled herself exceedingly well , and that made her a sympathetic figure and was clearly an enormous boost to her when she decided to run for the Senate .
And frankly , I hope Chris was not forced to make any kind of statement like that or coerced . I do think what Chris said was very gracious in this sense : He seemed to say the only reason that she did well was because her husband was messing around . And I think Hillary Clinton -- frankly , I was astounded at how well she did running for the Senate , and she did go up to northern New York , that listening tour and talking to those people and taking the beating , and she did run a fine campaign , and she 's been a fine United States senator from her standpoint , and those things have made her a prospective presidential candidate as well .
So what Chris said last night , I think was accurate . There were both things , were factors . But I do hope -- and I do agree with you . I hope nobody forced him to do that . And simply because Gloria Steinem or Media Matters or somebody else like that comes after you is no reason for anybody to apologize . It could be a badge of honor .
BRZEZINSKI . Yeah .
SCARBOROUGH : Well , it certainly has a chilling effect on what we do .
BRZEZINSKI : I 'm probably going to say something that 's wildly unpopular with women , but what bothers me about this is that the websites isolated one portion of what he said and that was a conversation , and I was a part of that conversation , and I actually remember saying to him that of course if Laura Bush or if someone else was humiliated by their husband , they would n't win for Senate because they did n't have the qualifications , and Hillary Clinton had worked all of her life getting experience . But what Chris was saying --
SCARBOROUGH : And Chris agreed with you .
BRZEZINSKI : He agreed with me , and that was the conversation . But what he was saying , like in New Hampshire , there was a confluence of events including sympathy --
BUCHANAN : Right .
BRZEZINSKI : -- that led to her success , and there was nothing wrong with pointing that out . There was nothing wrong with it .
SCARBOROUGH : And let me say , Pat , the reason I felt sorry for her personally -- personally , not as a reporter , but personally -- was because of some of the horrible things I thought her husband was saying about her on the campaign trail , and I 've talked to a lot of men and a lot of women that felt the same way .
BRZEZINSKI : And she does n't --
SCARBOROUGH : And we were like -- and we all said , `` She deserves so much better than this . ''
BRZEZINSKI : She does n't play the victim , but she happens to in some cases in time to have been one . It does n't take away from her other qualities and her intellectual experience .
SCARBOROUGH : Pat ?
BUCHANAN : You know , Joe , on the morning of New Hampshire , I came on before John Edwards came on your show , and you played that clip of Edwards saying , `` You 've got to be tough to be president , '' you know , about her sort of emotional moment , and I said it was graceless . And behind that was the sentiment that she had been beaten up in the debate , and she had gotten emotional at the end of a campaign . It looked like everything was slipping away .
And I think , just like I did and others did who are not Clintonites , felt a sympathy for her . The women of New Hampshire came to her rescue there . And there 's no doubt about it : It was again a deeply sympathetic moment for her . And just as the 1988 -- I mean , '98-'99 , so in those 48 hours before New Hampshire , I think that emotion came to her , and I think it was the winning factor . And to the degree that Chris reflected on that , I think he was accurate .
BRZEZINSKI : Mm-hmm .
SHUSTER : Just one comment about Chris Matthews . I 've worked with him for five and a half years . I 've been alongside him , on camera , off , good times and bad . Nobody is more gracious and has a bigger heart , and has contributed more in a positive way to our political discourse than Chris Matthews .
SCARBOROUGH : Now , let me say , let me say --
SHUSTER : And to see him have to go through this is absolutely infuriating , to see the way these groups used him for pure political gain is absolutely infuriating .
SCARBOROUGH : And let me say this also about Chris : He says things that drive me crazy . Some of the things he said on the war , on the president , on the vice president has made my face turn beet red , but you know what ? I remembered what he said about the Democratic president 10 years earlier .
And again , it is so frightening . And I 'll tell you what , Chris is hosting this show on Tuesday , and we 're damn proud that he 's doing that . The thing is , Pat , it seems that we live now in this media age , in this campaign where you 've got groups like NOW , Gloria Steinem , Media Matters . They can take one clip out of a three-hour show and start putting pressure on journalistic operations , and this is what happens . It 's terrible , is n't it ?
BUCHANAN : The real danger , Joe , is not Chris Matthews , it is censorship .
BRZEZINSKI : Yeah , that 's the bottom line .
SCARBOROUGH : It is censorship , and it 's frightening .
BRZEZINSKI : And then at some point during the show , we do have to talk about Hillary on Tyra . I 'm just saying . I 'm just saying .
SCARBOROUGH : All right . Very good . And I know Pat will agree with me , there is nothing wrong with a political campaign using third parties to try to beat up , to try to push back reporters that are tough on them . I -- Buchanan and I , we tried to do the same thing before . That 's fine . That 's what they do . It is up to the news agencies to show backbone . Right , Chris -- right , Pat ?
BUCHANAN : I agree 100 percent , Joe .
SCARBOROUGH : All right . This ai n't about Hillary Clinton 's campaign .
BRZEZINSKI : No , it 's not .
SCARBOROUGH : This is about censorship . We 'll be right back . Thank you , Pat . We 'll be right back with Willie Geist and some news that you just ca n't use .
You have to appreciate Microsoft 's tenacity . After launching the original Surface Pro tablet to mixed reviews , the company opted not to rebuild from scratch but to refine its vision for a thick and heavy , but powerful , tablet . The result is Surface Pro 2 .
Much like Windows 8.1 , Surface Pro 2 is less conflicted on both the laptop and tablet sides of the hybrid equation , arriving with a more flexible kickstand , improved Touch and Type Covers , longer battery life , and better thermal design . It 's still less than the best of both worlds , but the balance between them no longer feels so uneasy .
The Surface Pro 2 is also a better lesson in compromise than the just-released Surface 2 . Both hybrid devices sport incremental rather than revolutionary upgrades , but the Pro version is simply more useful when you 're working with your hardware in the field .
Image : Michael Homnick The Surface Pro 2 is a tablet that leans toward a laptop , and does a better job of it than most hybrids currently available .
As with the original Pro hybrid , the Surface Pro 2 resembles a plain old tablet until you unfurl the integrated kickstand and attach a keyboard cover to the base , transforming the device into a small , funky-looking laptop . It retains the satisfying clicking sounds as you close the kickstand or snap in a keyboard cover , and the trapezoidal design still looks vaguely like a piece of Imperial architecture straight out of Star Wars .
Many other details are unchanged . The tablet alone weighs 2 pounds and measures 0.53 inch thick , and boasts a 10.6-inch , 1920-by-1080 display . You 'll find a full-size USB port and a headphone jack on one side , and a MicroSD card slot and a Mini DisplayPort output on the other .
The included active digitizer stylus has the same mechanical-pencil vibe as the original , and allows for pressure-sensitive drawing while resting your hand on the screen . Pricing is similar to that of the original , too , at $ 900 with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM , and $ 1000 for 128GB of storage . Now , however , you can bump up to 256GB for $ 1300 or 512GB for $ 1800 , both versions with 8GB of RAM .
Image : Michael Homnick The angled , trapezoidal profile of the Surface Pro 2 helps it stand out among tablet competitors .
Why so bulky and pricey ? Because Microsoft wanted to make a tablet that handles robust productivity tasks , such as video editing and image processing . The Surface Pro 2 's Intel Core i5-4200U processor is what you 'd typically find in an Ultrabook , and it does n't flinch under heavy loads . As a side benefit—or perhaps a main draw—the integrated graphics on the 256GB , 8GB RAM model do an admirable job on fairly recent PC games , at least at 720p resolution . Where 's the Surface-ready Bluetooth Xbox controller , Microsoft ?
PCWorld benchmarked a 64GB version of the Surface Pro 2 with 4GB of RAM . Compared with the original Surface Pro ( 128GB ) , the Surface Pro 2 ( 64GB ) was about 9 percent faster in WorldBench 8.1 . The Surface Pro 2 was also about 16 percent faster than the new Sony Tap 11 , which carries a slower Haswell-class processor . The Asus Transformer Book T100T , which uses an Atom processor , was barely half as fast as the Surface Pro 2 .
The Surface Pro 2 outpaces the original Surface Pro , as well as other recent Windows tablets .
Microsoft would prefer that you think of the Surface Pro 2 as a laptop first , and that you not compare the product directly to Apple 's much thinner and lighter iPad . But it 's hard to ignore the iPad given the Surface Pro 2 's ability to act as a tablet .
Let 's state the obvious : The Pro 2 can be tiresome to hold , its selection of touch-optimized apps is inferior to that of the iPad , and its battery does n't last nearly as long . But those drawbacks are n't as pronounced as they were when the original Surface Pro launched in February .
Since that launch , Microsoft has also secured some key apps for its tablet-friendly modern interface , including Facebook and Twitter , with Flipboard on the way . Microsoft has also made improvements to its own built-in apps in Windows 8.1 , and the modern version of Internet Explorer 11 has helpful new features , such as the ability to open unlimited tabs across multiple windows . ( Check out our review of Windows 8.1 for more details on what 's new . )
As for the hardware , the Surface Pro 2 benefits in the battery department from Intel 's fourth-generation “ Haswell ” processor , though not quite as much as we 'd hoped . We 're still doing formal testing , but my experiences juggling lots of browser tabs and a few modern apps on the Surface Pro 2 yielded about 6 hours of battery life—basically the same as PCWorld Labs ' benchmarked result of six hours and nine minutes . That 's an hour or two better than the original Surface Pro , and more than adequate for an afternoon working at Starbucks or an evening on the couch . But an entire day of use would require a top-up in the middle .
Update 11-4-13 : Microsoft issued a firmware update after the Surface Pro 2 's launch that significantly increased the tablet 's battery life .
Improvements to the Surface Pro 2 's thermal design are more substantial . The tablet runs cool and quiet during lighter use , and it does n't spin up its internal fans as often as the original did . Unless you 're putting a heavy load on the Surface Pro 2 , it wo n't get uncomfortably warm or noisy .
Image : Michael Homnick Thanks to a new 40-degree incline , the Surface sits more easily on a table or on your lap .
The other big change is in the Surface Pro 2 kickstand , which can position the machine at a 40-degree angle in addition to the original 22-degree angle . That does n't sound like much , but the flatter viewing angle feels more natural when the tablet is resting in your lap , or next to you on a couch . Just having the kickstand helps mitigate the tablet 's bulkiness , because you do n't have to hold up the tablet with your hands .
Many of the tablet-enhancing improvements in the Surface Pro 2 carry over to laptop mode . The added kickstand angle makes the Surface Pro 2 less prone to toppling , even when you have it balanced on one leg with the keyboard attached , and the screen never feels as if it 's aimed in an awkward direction . Battery life is now comparable to that of many other small Windows laptops ( but frustratingly it 's still nowhere close to Apple 's MacBook Air ) .
Windows 8.1 also brings several improvements for desktop users , including better scaling , so things do n't look so teeny on the Surface 's 10.6-inch display . The small screen feels like less of a constraint than before , though text still becomes tough to read if you 're running two websites side by side . You may also find that a lot of desktop software is n't optimized for the Surface 's higher pixel density , making things look fuzzy . Here 's hoping that software makers will catch up as more high-DPI laptops come to market .
Image : Michael Homnick The new Type Cover is backlit , but the touchpad is trickier to use than it should be .
Even after all those improvements , the Surface Pro 2 struggles to provide the same experience as a full-blown laptop , in large part because of the optional Touch Cover and Type Cover accessories .
The physical footprint of the Surface Pro 2 limits how large these covers can be . Although the keyboards do n't feel cramped , the small touchpad is tricky to master . Moving the pointer from one corner of the screen to the other usually takes more than one swipe unless you crank up the mouse sensitivity , thereby sacrificing accuracy . ( You handle touchpad sensitivity through the Mouse section of Control Panel , separate from the Mouse and Trackpad Settings in the modern interface . )
The touchpad would be more useful if not for some baffling decisions on Microsoft 's part . When you drag down from the top of the pad , for instance , two-finger scrolling does n't register right away , so you get a dead zone that occupies roughly the top fifth of the pad . Clicking and dragging is even more of a nightmare : To begin a selection , you ca n't just double-tap anywhere on the touchpad . Instead , you must hold one finger down on the tiny sliver that represents the left mouse button , a process that often takes two or three tries to get right , and more frequently messes up midselection . Expecting users to attach a mouse for reliable text selection is unacceptable , and a software fix needs to be high on Microsoft 's priority list .
Image : Michael Homnick Good news for assertive typers : The new Type Cover 's keys are firmer and less springy , though the travel is also shorter .
Thanks to firmer , less springy keys , typing on the Type Cover 2 feels solid , and the keyboard seems sturdier than its predecessor for in-lap use . Typing still takes getting used to , as the keys do n't travel as much and they have no space in between them , but the touchpad is the bigger hindrance .
A few other nitpicks come to mind : First , when you 're using the Type Cover with scrolling inverted , on occasion the Surface can scroll in the wrong direction , forcing you to detach and reattach the cover . Second , the built-in stylus still connects magnetically to the same slot as the charger , so you ca n't attach both at the same time . And finally , Microsoft exacerbates the Surface Pro 2 's battery woes by forcing hibernation when your machine has only a little life ( 8 percent ) left in the tank . You can dig into the Windows settings to give yourself more time , but Microsoft should n't be leaving a half hour of battery life on the table by default .
Bottom line
Clearly , Microsoft has lots of refinement left to do . But despite all the Surface Pro 2 's flaws , there 's something alluring about it . No other touchscreen laptop or convertible device plays the hybrid game as well as the Surface Pro 2 does . The kickstand is a brilliant flourish that compensates for the tablet 's weight while solving for the top-heaviness you find in other detachable hybrids . The Touch and Type Covers are so thin and light that you can keep them attached , and the total package still feels light enough to rival the slickest laptops .
Image : Michael Homnick The second-generation Surface Pro is a refinement rather than a total rebuild .
The Surface Pro 2 is a different kind of device , aimed at people who need to edit videos , create digital art , run a dozen applications at once , or kick back with some full-blown PC games . The fact that you can do those things on a tablet that still feels comfortable for Facebook , Netflix , or solitaire is no small achievement , and a sign that the best of both worlds might be attainable if Microsoft keeps chipping away .
Lululemon , with its curvy logo that frankly resembles a uterus , has long dominated expensive yoga classes , costly spinning workouts , treadmills in $ 200-a-month gyms , and the brightly lit streets of upscale neighborhoods . For many well-to-do women , a pair of Lululemon yoga pants is as good as a tribal tattoo .
And , like any tribe , Lululemon defines itself by exclusion : thin women , whose thighs do n't rub , are allowed inside the tent . All others can stay out . The company 's chairman suggested that women whose thighs rubbed together `` do n't actually work '' and that larger sizes would require more fabric , which made them unattractively expensive for the company .
Was Lululemon boycotted by a furious populace of offended women for bodyshaming them ? Not even close . On Thursday , Lululemon revealed that profits jumped 15 % and sales rocketed up 20 % in just the past three months . In fact , if Lululemon 's sales start falling , it wo n't be because – as the company wants you to believe – it 's because of `` PR issues '' , as it delicately calls its founders ' sizeism ; it 's more likely because of more aggressive competition from rivals rather than alienated customers .
The truth is , Lululemon has chanced on one of the enduring principles of retail : there 's probably no better way for some brands to keep women as customers than to shame them . Insecurity is a big money-maker . Happy people do n't buy things . Unhappy people engage in `` retail therapy '' , and buy clothes , jewelry , electronics or even food that makes them feel as if they have higher status . People supersize their food to feel as if they have higher status ; they do the same with their clothes , spending more and buying more garments to feel better .
The conclusion of this is obvious . It does n't take a genius of a retailer to figure out that the more insecure they can make women feel , the more they 'll send those in a tailspin looking for the approval of strangers .
Consider the impressively crass public speaking of Lululemon founder Chip Wilson , who explained that the company 's cheaply constructed yoga pants chafed and pilled because `` some women 's bodies just do n't actually work . It 's about the rubbing of the thighs . '' Previously , Wilson had said that larger sizes cost more to produce and other reports had suggested that Lululemon had hidden its larger sizes away from the sanctity of open store shelves .
Wilson had to compete for airtime with Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries , who boasts often that his frat-boy-infested superstores are `` exclusionary '' . `` We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends . A lot of people do n't belong [ in our clothes ] , and they ca n't belong , '' Jeffries said once . His target customer :
Abercrombie is only interested in people with washboard stomachs who look like they 're about to jump on a surfboard .
It 's quite a trick for an Ohio-based retailer that recently had over 1,000 stores that sell reasonably priced , interchangeably anonymous schoolyard clothes to claim that it 's exclusionary . Abercrombie , `` tucked into the empty hallways of aging malls , '' is about as exclusionary as a cheap motel , and like all retail brands it faces obsolescence when the new cool brand comes along . It 's already suffering .
Yet , Jeffries and Wilson have made millions – and has guaranteed himself millions more in coming years – by making people believe there is something wrong with them that only mass-produced clothes can fix . The unpopular , the doughy , the outsiders : they have no chance – no right – to be happy with themselves . Jeffries and CEOs like him point out their imperfections publicly and then watch their bank accounts swell as the sartorially disenfranchised file into his stores to buy rags to cover their newly shamed bodies .
It 's a simple equation : clothes confer status , and so it helps to make people feel low-status to encourage them to buy more clothes – and to pay more for those garments – all in an effort to restore their sense of themselves and their place in the social order . Self-loathing women are a godsend for lagging holiday sales . Retailers know those are the droids they 're looking for .
Overall , Lululemon 's good profits close out a bad year for curvy women . From Oprah Winfrey 's alleged rejection at an upscale boutique to Lululemon 's open shaming of its customers , women find that when they speak out about being treated badly by retailers , they open themselves up to criticism : they do n't look the right way , they 're oversensitive , or they 're not the right demographic .
This is a cynical form of brainwashing designed to boost profits , and women too often fall for it . Companies wo n't change because people start criticizing them ; they 'll only change when they think they will see their profits fall . At this rate , that could be some time .

All Aboard Florida 's Brightline passenger train service will start carrying passengers between West Palm Beach and Miami by the end of the year , offering introductory fares and `` buy-one-get-one free '' offers to entice commuters to ride .
Brightline had said the first leg of its service was expected to start service in late summer , with a grand opening ceremony expected to be held in the fall . But during a tour of the company 's sprawling MiamiCentral station on Monday , Brightline 's CEO Dave Howard said trains will begin carrying passengers later this year .
The exact schedule is expected to be released in the coming weeks , and ticket prices will be announced about 10 days before service begins , company officials said .
`` No one has done this in more than 100 years , '' Howard said of the company 's plan to return passenger train service to Henry Flagler 's historic railroad corridor . `` There really is no template . We want a safe and successful launch . ''
Howard said the company plans to offer lower-than-normal ticket prices to encourage riders to try its trains , which Brightline says offer a stress-free alternative to traveling by car .

`` Unit you try it , you do n't really have a sense of its value , '' Howard said .
Work on Brightline 's West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale stations is essentially complete , and construction on the station in downtown Miami on track to be finished this fall , Howard said . The MiamiCentral station is one piece of the company 's six-block complex , that includes ground-floor retail space , an office tower and two residential apartment buildings .

Much of the structural work at the Miami station is complete , however crews are still installing other finishings including tracks that the trains will run on and the escalators that will eventually carry passengers to the elevated rail platform .
The Miami station is expected to become a transportation hub and shopping and entertainment destination for both tourists and locals . The site is within walking distance of the AmericanAirlines Arena and a short shuttle ride from PortMiami , which processed more multi-day cruise passengers than any other port in the world in 2014 .

This past year , the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority approved a plan that will eventually allow Tri-Rail trains to carry passengers to Brightline 's station in downtown Miami .
Tri-Rail now runs between Palm Beach County and Miami International Airport . The downtown Miami Tri-Rail stop would give Palm Beach County residents easier access to the AmericanAirlines Arena , Port Miami and other businesses and shopping districts .
Of the roughly 50 daily Tri-Rail trains , about half are expected to travel to Brightline 's Miami station , officials have said .
Eventually , Brightline plans to extend its service north to the Orlando International Airport , where the $ 221 million transportation hub that houses the company 's northernmost station is set to open this fall .
Phillip Brown , executive director of the Orlando airport said this past month Brightline 's trains wo n't start carrying passengers to Orlando until `` late summer or fall '' of 2020 .
Quiet zones that will eventually silence train horns along the Florida East Coast Railway tracks through Palm Beach County are still set to be implemented when Brightline launches its service , company officials said Monday .
Quiet zones require a higher level of safety , because trains do n't blow their horns at rail crossings .
As a result , Brightline has launched a safety campaign to keep people off the tracks .
In April , the company teamed up with the Palm Beach County School District to warn students and those living near the Florida East Coast Railway corridor about the dangers of walking along train tracks .
Brightline has asked cities along the route to help promote the campaign , part of a national program called Operation Lifesaver , which is designed to reduce collisions , fatalities and injuries at highway-rail crossings and prevent trespassing on or near railroad tracks .
`` We still have to educate the community , '' Howard said Monday . `` These communities have been very used to the freight trains , which come through slower and have much longer crossings . The crossings time for our trains will be less than waiting for a stop light….People have to be very cautious and understand that it is going to be a different level of activity . ''
Four of Brightline 's five trains are housed in West Palm Beach . The 5th train , which is under construction at Siemens ' manufacturing hub in Sacramento , Calif. , is expected to arrive in Palm Beach County later this month .
Updated at 11:10 a.m. Eastern with details from post-launch briefing .
WALLOPS ISLAND , Va. — An Orbital ATK Antares rocket successfully launched a Cygnus cargo spacecraft packed with supplies and equipment for the International Space Station Nov. 12 .
The Antares lifted off from Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport here at 7:19 a.m. Eastern , at the end of a five-minute window . At a post-launch press conference , Kurt Eberly , deputy program manager for Antares at Orbital ATK , said that was because of an issue with the process of chilling one of the RD-181 main engines during pre-launch preparations .
The five-minute slip had another benefit as well . “ It gave the range some more time to clear out some boats that were trending towards the hazard area , ” he said . Controllers scrubbed a previous launch attempt Nov. 11 when an aircraft entered the range .
The Antares had an “ over-performance ” on this launch , placing Cygnus into a slightly higher orbit than planned , but one that does n't affect plans for the Cygnus to arrive at the ISS early Nov 14 .
Eberly said this additional performance , which also was noted on the rocket 's previous flight in October 2016 , could allow the Antares to carry slightly heavier payloads on future missions . “ We 're going to be adjusting our models , and when we do that , we 'll be able to bank a little bit more margin , ” he said , which could be used for Cygnus based on internal discussions and those with NASA .
The Cygnus , on a mission called OA-8 , is carrying more than 3,300 kilograms of cargo , including crew supplies , station hardware and scientific investigations . “ We have Cygnus completely packed full of cargo on this mission , ” said Dan Hartman , deputy ISS program manager at NASA , said at a pre-launch briefing Nov. 10 .
The Cygnus spacecraft , named “ S . S. Gene Cernan ” after the Apollo 17 astronaut who passed away earlier this year , will remain at the station only a few weeks , with the arm unberthing the Cygnus , after filling it with cargo for disposal , on Dec. 3 .
NASA will wait to release Cygnus for a day , however , using the spacecraft for tests of a docking system for future commercial crew vehicles . “ We just want to get a little bit more characterization of our ISS GPS performance during that operation , ” Hartman said .
Cygnus will then be released by the robotic arm on Dec. 4 , the same day as SpaceX is scheduled to launch a Dragon cargo spacecraft to the ISS . Hartman said that while the station could accommodate both Cygnus and Dragon simultaneously , SpaceX 's previous analyses for its upcoming mission assumed Cygnus would not be there . “ That 's primarily what 's driving ” the early departure of Cygnus .
After leaving the station , but before its mission-ending destructive reentry , Cygnus will fly to a higher altitude and then deploy 14 cubesats mounted in dispensers on the exterior of the spacecraft 's service module . Those cubesats include eight Lemur satellites for Spire , a company that operate a constellation of ship-tracking and weather satellites , as well as technology demonstration cubesats for NASA and The Aerospace Corporation .
This mission is the fourth time that NanoRacks has flown cubesats in external dispensers on a Cygnus , said Henry Martin , mission manager at NanoRacks , at a Nov. 10 pre-launch briefing , but on previous flights were n't able to fill all the dispensers . “ It 's totally full ” on this flight , he said .
Today I 'm reviewing Notoriously Morbid 's Slay Me collection , which is based on Buffy the Vampire Slayer , which I adore . This collection was released in waves , and today I 'll do 1 and 2 . ( 3 and 4 will come later . ) The entire collection is matte , which is unusual . Sadly , two of the colors have been discontinued , but I 'm including them anyways for posterity 's sake .
Since these are mattes , I swatched them slightly differently than usual . The top/left half is over bare skin and the bottom/right half is over Urban Decay Anti-Aging Primer Potion . The top picture is in indoor natural light and the bottom one is in direct sun . The sun brings out a slight sparkle in some of the swatches , but they all looked matte on my eyes when I used them .
Wave 1 : Boca Del Infierno , Comic Relief , Teacher in Tweed , Hesitant Heroine , Quiet Storm and Gypsy Curse
Wave 2 : He 's Going Through Changes , She 's Got Gidget Hair , Dust to Dust , The Dating Slayer , She Names the Stars , Bloody Awful Poet
Boca Del Infierno : “ A rich , deep oxblood. ” This is a dark , rich burgundy blood red . It 's much darker and more opaque over primer than bare skin .
He 's Going Through Changes : “ A warm , gingery peach , as smooth as Oz 's fur. ” This is a matte pinky peach . It 's very warm . On me it 's too warm to really using as a blending or transition shade ( which I sillily keep trying to do ) , but it makes a nice lid color . It 's darker over primer , but the coverage is very even on bare skin .
Comic Relief : “ A cheerful sunny orange. ” This is a great matte orange . Sadly , it 's one of the colors that is no longer for sale . If you apply it lightly and blend it out it looks more peachy , but if you apply it with a heavier hand it 's definitely orange . It leans more red than yellow .
She 's Got Gidget Hair : “ A pale orange with a beige undertone. ” This is a peachy tan . It 's similar to He 's Going Through Changes , but more yellow and less pink . It 's definitely a warm color and applies smoothly on bare skin .
Dust to Dust : “ An icy mint green with a gray/bone undertone. ” This is a very pale green , with a whitish grey cast . Over primer it looks more grey-green and on bare skin it 's more white-green . It works surprisingly well as a highlight color for the browbone or inner corner in cool-toned looks .
The Dating Slayer : “ A bright sky blue – so Cordelia , so 90's. ” This is a matte baby blue . Over primer it becomes more sky blue . It 's a pretty dated color to my eye .
She Names the Stars : “ A cool , blue toned purple as deep as Drusilla 's evil madness. ” To me this reads as cornflower blue rather than purple , especially over primer . It 's sheer over bare skin and very slightly more purpley . It 's a really pretty color , but it 's been discontinued .
Hesitant Heroine : “ A deep sapphire blue with an indigo tone in a matte finish. ” Yet another matte blue . This one is darker and more cobalt . It 's much sheerer over bare skin than it is over primer , but I have n't had any problems blending it . The fallout really does want to stain , though , so be careful when you apply it .
Quiet Storm : “ A sweet baby pink with a gray undertone. ” This is such a pretty lavender ! It was tricky to photograph since it 's about the same level of lightness as my skin tone , just purple . Like most of the other pastels in the collection , it 's whiter over bare skin and more grey over primer . This is one of my favorite colors from the collection .
Gypsy Curse : “ A warm-toned taupe , the exact color of the shadows Angel waits in. ” This is a fantastic grey-brown color . It makes a great transition or crease shade , but it does not blend out well over primer , so using it can be a little tricky . I want to love it , cuz the color 's great , but it gets weird patches that wo n't blend out when I use it over primer , so I 'm torn . Primer does n't affect the color or saturation much , but it really does impact its blendability .
Teacher in Tweed : “ An olive brown that practically screams librarian. ” This is a slightly green tinted brown . The color is much darker over primer , and it has the same primer-induced blendability issues as Gypsy Curse .
Bloody Awful Poet : “ A cool-toned matte black , as cool as Spike 's leather trench coat. ” This is a matte black . It 's solid black over primer and sheer charcoal black on bare skin . I love using a tiny bit on a liner brush to softly line my lower lashes . I get a ton of use out of this one . Plus , I love Spike , so points for that .
Overall Thoughts : I love Buffy and the connections to the characters are great , but this collection is a bit of a mixed bag for me . There are colors I love and will get a lot of use out of ( like Bloody Awful Poet and Quiet Storm ) alongside ones I wo n't use very often ( The Dating Slayer , I 'm looking at you ) . The formula also strikes me as inconsistent . None of them were patchy , and all of them had a smooth texture . However some colors need a primer to improve their opacity and adhesion , but others blend better without one . Over time I think I 'll be able to figure it out , but it makes some pairings tricky ( like when I used Boca Del Infierno , which is better with a primer , with Gypsy Curse , which is better without ) . I considered doing a separate review for each wave , but did n't think I 'd be able to make balanced looks with just one wave at a time , since Wave 1 is heavy on the deep colors and Wave 2 is primarily pastels . That said , I was happy with the looks I wound up putting together . These colors also make fantastic liners when mixed with Superstar Serum . I imagine I 'll most use these in conjunction with other shadows , cuz I like a bit of sparkle . But mattes are useful to have as part of my collection and the Buffy connections really do make me smile .
Stay tuned for the looks tomorrow ! ( Check them out here . )
As a philosopher-turned-photographer , Bob Adelman forged a career committed to both social action and aesthetics . When he was not documenting the civil rights movement in the North , he was hanging out with — and taking pictures of — artists like Andy Warhol and Larry Rivers .
Fittingly , his documentary photography had a strong political bent , as he examined social issues like poverty in America , the antiwar movement and the civil rights struggle . He did so without concern for critical attention , especially since “ art ” photography over the last four decades has become more about the image-maker documenting himself .
“ Serious photography of social and political nature is not considered art in the same way as social and political art is quite acceptable in painting , music , or literature , ” he said .
But this week , Mr. Adelman will become , in essence , a photographer in residence at the Library of Congress , a position created to draw attention to the importance of the medium in American life . He will give talks and lectures for the library , continue to photograph and pursue his book projects on the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Warhol .
Mr. Adelman was born in Brooklyn , raised in the Rockaways and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York in 1946 . Hoping to find answers to his larger questions , he studied graduate-level philosophy at Columbia University , but there were n't any “ What 's the purpose of life ” courses . Instead , he turned to aesthetics , which is the philosophy of art .
In time , he grew more interested in “ making and doing , ” which led him to learn photography — applied aesthetics , perhaps — and to join the civil rights group the Congress of Racial Equality , or CORE . Moved by the courage of young people who at great risk battled segregation through passive resistance , Mr. Adelman cast his lot with them . He was named the national photographer for CORE in 1961 .
“ For me to get involved in something , I had to see some purpose to it and it had to mean something , ” he said . “ I realized that my involvement would be very dangerous , but I had a long think with myself and decided that this was something worth risking your life for . ”
That did n't happen immediately , but the first sit-ins he photographed were in segregated restaurants along a major highway in Maryland . There was pushing and shoving , and several of his friends were arrested . His first reaction was to intervene , but he thought that maybe a photograph was more important .
Those photos were used as evidence in court cases and to help raise money for the movement . His photographs of the civil rights struggle were also published in many magazines , and eventually some were used in the congressional Kerner Commission on civil unrest in 1967 . His images , which became important historical documents , made a difference . Mr. Adelman , who often photographed Dr. King , said that the civil rights leader — Doc , as he calls him — appreciated photography and its key role in the movement 's success .
“ Garry Winogrand famously said that photographs do n't change things , ” he said . “ I think that 's a very silly thing to say because they do . ”
During the 1964 Freedom Summer , Mr. Adelman spent three days in western Louisiana , photographing and living with the Rev . Joe Carter , an African-American minister who , after four previous attempts , successfully registered to vote . Later that night , a group of Klansmen descended on his home at the end of a dirt road . Some of the reverend 's black neighbors , expecting trouble , had positioned themselves in nearby woods . Gunshots were exchanged . The Klan fled .
It was too dark to photograph , so Mr. Adelman dropped to the floor next to the minister , who was kneeling and clutching his rifle . Soon after , a portrait of Reverend Carter ( Slide 1 ) ran with a story in Ebony magazine .
To Mr. Adelson , segregation “ was an organized system of terror ” that was put in place and enforced by the Klan and community leaders .
“ We very much needed the photography to reveal this , to show people exactly what was going on as the demonstrations progressively peeled away what racism and segregation meant , ” he said .
After the Voting Rights Act was signed into law , Mr. Adelman continued his photography and his activism . He also delved into children at play , photographing and interviewing them , and helped develop a series of reading textbooks for urban elementary schoolchildren . The books , drawn from real-life situations , were meant to be a counterpoint to children 's books like the Dick and Jane series in which all the characters were white .
He continued through the 1990s , often zeroing in on social issues , photographing for Look , Life and The New York Times Magazine .
Mr. Adelman studied philosophy primarily to find his way in the world . But it was through photography that he discovered the meaning that he was searching for .
“ I realized that I wanted to get involved in the world and make a difference , ” he said .
And he has .

Defendant breached the implied contracts it made with Plaintiffs and Class Members by purposefully slowing down older iPhone models when new models come out and by failing to properly disclose that at the time of that the parties entered into an agreement .
`` Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers , which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices . Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions , have a low battery charge or as they age over time , which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components .
Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6 , iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions . We 've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2 , and plan to add support for other products in the future . ''
Apple yesterday confirmed that it has implemented power management features in older iPhones to improve performance and prevent unexpected shutdowns as the battery in the devices starts to degrade , and this admission has now led to a class action lawsuit , which was first noticed by TMZ Los Angeles residents Stefan Bogdanovich and Dakota Speas , represented by Wilshire Law Firm , this morning filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California accusing Apple of slowing down their older iPhone models when new models come out.According to the lawsuit , Bogdanovich and Speas have owned the iPhone 7 and several older iPhone models and have noticed that their `` older iPhone models slows ( sic ) down when new models come out . '' The two say they did not consent to have Apple slow down their devices , nor were they able to `` choose whether they preferred to have their iPhones slower than normal . `` They 're seeking both California and Nationwide class action certification , which would cover all persons residing in the United States who have owned iPhone models older than the iPhone 8.Apple yesterday addressed speculation that it throttles the performance of older iPhones with degraded batteries , confirming that there are power management features in place to attempt to prolong the life of the iPhone and its battery . Apple implemented these features last year in iOS 10.2.1 When an iPhone 's battery health starts to decline , the battery is not capable of supplying enough power to the iPhone in times of peak processor usage , which can lead to shutdowns , Apple says.The lawsuit seemingly misrepresents Apple 's original statement and suggests the plaintiffs and their lawyers do not understand Apple 's explanation for how iPhone power management features work and why they were implemented , given the lawsuit 's suggestion that it 's tied to the release of new devices . As explained by Apple , when certain iPhone models hit a peak of processor power , a degraded battery is sometimes unable to provide enough juice , leading to a shutdown . Apple says it `` smooths out '' these peaks by limiting the power draw from the battery or by spreading power requests over several cycles.Lithium-ion batteries degrade over time by nature , and this eventual wearing out addressed by the power management features is unrelated to the release of new iPhone models.Apple does not deny that iPhones with older batteries can sometimes see slower performance , but power management is a feature that Apple says has been implemented to improve overall performance by preventing an iPhone from shutting down completely rather than a feature that 's been implemented to force users to upgrade by deliberately slowing devices.As many people have suggested , Apple has done a poor job of explaining why it has implemented these power management features and how the state of the battery ultimately affects iPhone performance . More transparent information about battery health should be provided , and customers should be better informed when their batteries start to degrade so they can choose whether or not to pay for a replacement . Apple may also need to relax its policies on when customers can pay for a battery replacement , as currently , a battery ca n't be replaced unless in-store equipment registers it as near failing.An iPhone 's battery is designed to retain 80 percent of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles . A defective battery that does not meet those parameters can be replaced for free for customers who have AppleCare+ or who have devices still under warranty.For out of warranty customers , Apple offers a battery replacement service , which costs $ 79 plus $ 6.95 for shipping.The lawsuit is demanding the replacement of the old iPhone and compensation for loss of use , loss of value , the purchase of new batteries , ascertainable losses in the form of the deprivation of the value of the iPhone , and overpayments because Plaintiffs and Class Members `` did not receive what they paid for '' when Apple interfered with the usage of their iPhones.Additional class action lawsuits have been filed against Apple in Chicago , New York , and Northern California . All three lawsuits allege that Apple slowed down iPhones in an effort to get customers to upgrade to new devices .

Ever since Edward Snowden handed thousands of National Security Agency documents over to filmmaker Laura Poitras and writer Glenn Greenwald in a Hong Kong hotel room , the NSA 's mass surveillance of domestic phone calls and Internet traffic has been widely compared to the abuses of East Germany 's secret police , the Stasi .
The communist republic may have imploded in 1989 , but it has nonetheless become synonymous with a smothering , all-knowing spy apparatus .
A year ago , President Obama himself cited East Germany as a “ cautionary tale of what could happen when vast , unchecked surveillance turned citizens into informers and persecuted people for what they said in the privacy of their own homes. ” He was responding to accusations that just such a vast , unchecked effort to collect data has metastasized on his watch .
It was no coincidence that Poitras chose Leipzig , a city in the heart of the former East Germany , for the recent German debut of her documentary Citizenfour , about Snowden and the NSA . “ If the government is doing that kind of surveillance , it has a corrosive effect on democracy and society , ” Poitras said after the premiere . “ People who lived through it can tell you what it was like . ”
Indeed . When it was revealed that the NSA had been listening to her cell phone calls , German chancellor Angela Merkel—who came of age in communist East Germany , under the Stasi 's watchful eye—told President Obama , “ This is just like the Stasi. ” In an interview last year , NSA whistle-blower and Poitras source William Binney likened the agency to “ the Stasi on supersteroids . ”
They 're wrong . In crucial ways , the two agencies are very different . In its effort to control East Germany , the Stasi made its presence felt in every sphere of life . Its power rested not only in the information its surveillance yielded but in the fear and distrust that collection instilled . The NSA , on the other hand , operates best in the dark , its targets unaware of its existence , let alone its dragnet data-gathering . Even Poitras , when asked , acknowledged a line between the two . “ The NSA 's broad , mass collection is fundamentally different than what the Stasi did , ” she said in Leipzig .
Calling the Stasi “ secret police ” is misleading . The name is an abbreviation of STAatsSIcherheit , or State Security . Founded in 1950 as the East German Communist Party 's “ sword and shield , ” it never hid the fact that it was spying . By the late 1980s , more than 260,000 East Germans—1.6 percent of all adults in the country—worked for the organization , either as agents or as informants . ( If the NSA employed as many analysts to spy on 320 million Americans , it would have 5 million people on the payroll . ) It wanted you to constantly wonder which of your friends was an informant and , ideally , tempt or pressure you into the role of snitch too .
At times , the scrutiny reached absurd proportions . Every apartment building and workplace had a designated informer . Spies used specially built equipment to steam open mail ; a Division of Garbage Analysis was on the lookout for suspect trash . Stasi agents let the air out of targets ' bicycle tires and rearranged the pictures in their apartments in an effort to drive “ class enemies ” crazy .
Cooperation was often a prerequisite for career advancement , academic success , even a new apartment . The Stasi had the power to take your children away or keep you from getting into a university . Its visibility and ubiquity forced East Germans to make moral choices every day : Collaborate with an unjust , undemocratic system or suffer the consequences .
The NSA is a different beast . Until Snowden 's revelations , it was one of the best-funded , most powerful agencies that most Americans had never heard of . In contrast to the sexier CIA , the NSA—founded in 1952 in part to break foreign codes—preferred invisibility .
After the attacks of 9/11 , a national security apparatus hungry for information and a Congress reluctant to push for oversight allowed the agency to metastasize into a monster , fed by more than $ 10 billion annually , largely out of the public eye . Few people felt or suspected its presence : Two years ago , an American complaining about NSA surveillance would have been dismissed as paranoid .
Yet even after Snowden revealed how the NSA had penetrated American phone and electronic communications , the public reaction was more bored yawn than outraged howl . Because the agency operates so deep in the shadows , the average citizen can claim ignorance of—and feel no responsibility for—the NSA 's activities . As Paul R. La Monica put it in a CNN Money column , “ I have nothing to hide . I 'm not a terrorist . ”
The agencies ' technological capabilities differed too . The Stasi 's files—sometimes running to tens of thousands of pages on longtime dissidents—occupied 69 miles of physical shelf space . Despite the huge outlay of resources and energy , today much of the information gleaned from its giant network seems trivial : political leanings , sexual preferences , religious convictions , music tastes . Most people post as much on their Facebook page nowadays .
To sort and track everything , East Germany 's superspies relied on 40 million file cards and computer databases . Searches were made by hand , or with locally sourced Robotron computers the size of desks and years behind their Western equivalents . By the late '80s , the collapsing East German economy forced the agency to recycle confiscated rock music cassette tapes to record tapped phone calls .
On the other hand , what we 've learned about the NSA 's technological prowess boggles the mind . It has taken the agency just a decade to collect an estimated billion times as much data as the Stasi amassed in nearly half a century—potentially 5 zettabytes , or 5 billion terabytes . According to one leaked document , by 2006 the NSA was sucking up “ one Library of Congress every 14.4 seconds. ” Trillions of domestic call logs , hundreds of billions of cell phone location records , and untold billions of pages of web data give it access to even the most out-of-the-way corners of our increasingly digital lives .
To make sense of it all , the NSA reportedly has the 21st century 's fastest computers at its disposal . Snowden 's leaks show it 's able to sift through billions of data points and link scraps of seemingly trivial information to establish patterns of behavior and association . Its algorithms and extensive databases make the NSA far more effective than the Stasi ever dreamed of being .
That 's why the comparison is so treacherous . It diminishes the horror of the Stasi 's targeted oppression while downplaying the threat posed to our democracy by the NSA 's secretive surveillance . The NSA 's tactics and techniques may not be anything like the Stasi's—yet . But It 's invisibility , technological expertise , and lack of oversight make it dangerous in a different way .
Right now the NSA 's domestic surveillance is indiscriminate and , we 're told , aimed solely at preventing another 9/11 . But how do we know ? And what guarantees that it will stay that way ? To what end is all this data being collected , and how might it be used against us in the future ? It 's clear that not even Congress knows the answers—and that 's scary .
With that much information at hand , the potential for abuse increases . If someone in power wanted to target and pressure Americans it saw as political enemies , the NSA 's digital storehouses of personal information would be a terrifyingly effective tool . Anyone who argues that only criminals have to fear the police and only terrorists have cause to encrypt their emails would do well to look back to Richard Nixon 's Enemies List or J. Edgar Hoover 's FBI , which used data on the sex lives of American politicians and civil rights activists to twist arms and end careers .
Omnipresent , if not omniscient , the Stasi was one of the most hated institutions in East Germany . In the end it was also one of the first to be swept away when the revolution came . Just days after the Berlin Wall fell , protesters peacefully occupied Stasi offices across the country , often catching agents in the midst of shredding and burning mountains of incriminating paper .
Twenty-five years later , Germany is one of the most privacy-obsessed countries on earth , thanks in no small part to the memory of the Stasi 's abuses . There was no role for Stasi tactics in the reunited German democracy . It 's up to us to make sure the NSA can never threaten ours .
On Twitter Tuesday evening , U.S. president Donald Trump denounced as “ fake news ” reports that White House chief of staff John Kelly would soon be fired .
“ This story is totally made up by the dishonest media , ” he tweeted .
The Fake News is at it again , this time trying to hurt one of the finest people I know , General John Kelly , by saying he will soon be… .. — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 11 , 2017
…fired . This story is totally made up by the dishonest media.The Chief is doing a FANTASTIC job for me and , more importantly , for the USA ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 11 , 2017
As far as can be discovered , however , no media outlet had actually reported this , or anything reasonably close to it . Trump might possibly have been reacting to a short piece in Vanity Fair that talked about Kelly 's unhappiness in the job , but a reader of that story would take the idea of Kelly quitting as being at least as likely as his resigning . On Monday , the Washington Post speculated about a possible replacement for Kelly “ should tensions between the president and his top aide become unsustainable . ”
In early August , a CNBC commentator predicted Kelly 's outster if he was given public credit for righting a wayward administration : “ He will be pushed out because Trump … can not tolerate anyone else getting the credit. ” But that was more than two months ago .
WATCH : The open feud between U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson intensifies , with Trump challenging Tillerson to an IQ test . As Jackson Proskow reports , it 's just another example of how tense the pair 's relationship is .
Trump then followed it up Wednesday with tweets questioning the broadcast licences of networks which ran stories that displeased him :
Fake @ NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a `` tenfold '' increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal . Pure fiction , made up to demean . NBC = CNN ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 11 , 2017
With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks , at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License ? Bad for country ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 11 , 2017
Broadcast licences have been used as a tool of censorship in several countries , such as Russia , Venezuela and Indonesia . In Uganda , for example , officials have pulled the broadcast licences of radio and TV stations whose reporting the government disliked .
Trump 's relationship with his inner circle , and senior Republicans in Congress , has frayed in public in a way that would be unthinkable in any other administration in the recent past .
Tillerson , Mattis and Kelly are serious people : Tillerson used to run ExxonMobil , and Mattis and Kelly were both full generals in the U.S. Marine Corps . Why do they endure life in Trump 's White House ? Corker 's comment offers one hint , as does a report that Kelly “ does n't love this job . He 's doing it as a duty for the country . ”
WATCH : The White House said Tuesday U.S. President Donald Trump was “ making a joke ” when he challenged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to an IQ test and said he has “ 100 per cent ” confidence in Tillerson .
The U.S. Constitution offers another , not incompatible possibility — the vice-president , and a majority of the U.S. federal cabinet , can start the process of removing a president if they deem him “ unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. ” If Mattis and Tillerson are goaded into resigning , they do n't get a vote when or if the time comes .

Guy Martin 's Spitfire Reading time : about 1 minute . British
Films

Planes
Guy Martin 's Spitfire is a British documentary about the recovery and rebuild of a rare MK1 Spitfire from the French beach where it was crash landed in 1940 by RAF pilot Squadron Leader Geoffrey Stephenson . The Spitfire had slowly been buried under generations of beach sand so the recovery operation took weeks of digging and months of painstakingly cataloging the parts .
This is the story of its revival presented by well-known British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – who also rolls up his sleeves and assists with the restoration . Almost all of the original parts were beyond saving due to their decades in the salty sand , so the engineers used them as a blueprint to ensure the plane is indistinguishable from the one flown by Stephenson in the early days of the Second World War .

I used to be a fan of David Boies back when he was defending Napster , and I recall liking the guest lecture he gave at Temple Law , though I do n't remember what it was about . These days , though , like an unnecessary movie sequel , it seems he 's given up his integrity for a paycheck .
As part of the Sony hack , a huge slew of potentially embarrassing information has come to light , including a whole bunch of internal emails about , for example , why David Fincher had to direct the Steve Jobs biopic , and how casting African-Americans is inconsistent with Sony 's “ fiduciary obligations to their shareholders . ”
This is n't just gossip . These are matters of public interest . See , e.g. , Synder v. Phelps ( 2011 ) ( “ Speech deals with matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political , social , or other concern to the community , or when it is a subject of legitimate news interest ; that is , a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public. ” Citations and quotations omitted . )
Sony is a major corporate conglomerate that spends millions every year lobbying Congress . ( Here , for example , is just one disclosure from earlier this year in which Sony Pictures Entertainment is lobbying for preferential tax treatment and for “ support of strong IP chapter in trade pacts. ” ) Moreover , though the term “ entertainment ” is thrown around as if movies were just any other business , the truth is that movies — like all forms of art — are a key part of our culture . ( Yes , at that link is a picture of Lawrence Lessig standing with a very young Aaron Swartz . ) At the very core of human culture is the act of storytelling ; a free society has the right to discuss how its stories are told and who tells them .
Val Broeksmit is a musician who tweets at @ bikinirobotarmy , and he 's been combing through the hacked Sony emails — which are now out in the public for anyone to see — and posting some of what he finds , like the above two examples .
He has the right to do that . We have a right to see those emails . They 're “ confidential , ” I suppose , in the sense that Sony would rather we not see them , but so what ? American law really does n't care about damage to a corporation 's reputation , not enough to chill free speech rights . See , e.g. , Doe v. Public Citizen ( 4th Cir. , April 16 , 2014 ) ; Procter & Gamble Co. v. Bankers Trust Co. , 78 F.3d 219 , 225 ( 6th Cir . 1996 ) ( “ commercial self interest ” does not to qualify as a legitimate ground for keeping documents under seal ) . The public does n't have the right to hack into Sony 's emails , but , once they 're out there , they 're out there . This is part of living in a democratic society .
That 's where David Boies comes in . Sony has hired him to , well , I do n't know what . Put on a show ? It seems all he 's been doing so far is sending silly letters to newspapers vaguely demanding that they not reference the Sony emails , letters which they have rightly ignored . Yesterday , he sent one of those silly letters to Twitter , asking them to remove the emails posted by Broeksmit .
It 's mostly a bunch of blather with a mere paragraph devoted to the discussion of actual laws :
The possession , use , and publishing of the Stolen Information implicates numerous federal and California state laws , including , but not limited to , the Computer Fraud & Abuse Act ( 18 U.S.C . § 1030 ) , the Copyright Act ( 17 U.S.C . § 501 , et seq . ) , the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access & Fraud Act ( Cal . Penal Code § 502 ) , California 's Stolen Property Law ( Cal . Penal Code § 496 ) , the Uniform Trade Secrets Act ( Cal . Civ . Code § 3426 , et seq . ) , and the California Unfair Competition Law ( Cal . Bus . & Prof. Code § 17200 , et seq . ) , among others , especially when such actions are taken knowingly in furtherance of federal and state crimes committed by the perpetrators , including extortion .
You know a lawyer is talking rubbish when in a single sentence they reference six different acts prefaced by “ including , but not limited to ” and followed by “ among others , ” to make sure you know they 're still working hard to find other statutes to vaguely reference . California has a law that says frogs used in frog-jumping contests ca n't be eaten , why not reference it , too ? After all , it 's not like you need to explain why it applies — just cite it and move on to the rest of the threat .
It 's embarrassing : they have 240 lawyers over at Boies , Schiller & Flexner , and the whole lot of them could n't come up with a cogent sentence explaining why any of those laws would apply to Twitter or Broeksmit . Sitting here , I ca n't see it — for example , the first law he cites , the CFAA , applies to unlawfully accessing computers , which Broeksmit plainly did n't do , unless he actually hacked Sony himself — and I 'm not going to do Mr. Boies job for him . Frankly , I 'm wondering if he did n't veer a bit close to extortion by throwing around the potential for criminal liability . As PopeHat notes , that 's unethical under the California Rules of Professional Conduct .
Like Broeksmit told the Wall Street Journal , “ If this can happen to me , it can happen to anybody. ” Indeed , and that 's why Sony needs to immediately apologize to him and to the Internet as a whole or explain why it thinks Broeksmit has broken the law . If Sony and Boies really think they can sue everyone who ever talks about Sony 's emails , we have a right to know that , too .
Update , January 2 , 2015 : Via @ jaredmauch , I see Twitter removed just two tweets as a result of the threat , both of which included portions of the script to the next Bond movie . That is understandable : those scripts are copyrighted and registered , and thus subject to a DMCA Takedown Notice . The rest of the materials have not been registered with the copyright office , and thus Sony can not file a copyright infringement claim over them . See Reed Elsevier , Inc. v. Muchnick , 130 S.Ct . 1237 ( 2010 ) ( copyright registration requirement of 17 U.S.C . § 411 ( a ) “ is a precondition to filing a claim that does not restrict a federal court 's subject-matter jurisdiction. ” ) If Sony wants to file a copyright infringement claim over those emails , it needs to first register them with the Copyright Office — which will further weaken any putative claims they have to “ trade secrets , ” and which will also strengthen Broeksmit 's First Amendment defenses .
Thus , we 're all still waiting for Sony and Boies to come up with a viable legal theory against Broeksmit . I 'd prefer they come to their senses and apologize .
Citizens ' complaints against police dropped by 93 percent when officers were equipped with body cameras , according to a recent study .
Cambridge University tracked 2,000 police officers employed in four UK law enforcement agencies and two US police departments .
In the United Kingdom , police agencies in Cambridgeshire Constabulary , Northern Ireland , the West Midlands , and West Yorkshire were monitored . In the United States , the Rialto and Ventura police departments were studied . The study covered 4,000 police shifts totaling 1.5 million officer work hours .
Jerry Lee Fellow in Experimental Criminology and Lecturer in Experimental Criminology , Dr Barak Ariel lead the study . Dr. Ariel has partnered with several police forces in the UK and other countries to research the efficiency of tactical strategy encompassing informal crime control , hotspot policing , restorative justice , and use of cameras in police operations .
Dr. Ariel stressed how body cameras encourage both officers and civilians to treat each other reasonably .
“ I can not think of any [ other ] single intervention in the history of policing that dramatically changed the way that officers behave , the way that suspects behave , and the way they interact with each other , ” Dr. Ariel told BBC .
Dr. Ariel attributed this improved propriety to mutual knowledge that every action is recorded and potentially reviewed .
“ Individual officers become more accountable , and modify their behaviour accordingly , while the more disingenuous complaints from the public fall by the wayside once footage is likely to reveal them as frivolous , ” Dr. Ariel told BBC .
Further , Dr. Ariel argues that camera footage would alleviate the common fear many people share of police due to a rise of police abuse and misconduct .
“ Everyone is recording the police except themselves , ” Dr. Ariel told CBS News . “ Now we have something from the officer 's point of view from the very beginning of the interaction . ”
Only 45 police forces have equipped its officers with body cameras in the UK , according a to a Press Association survey . Several large U.S. police departments have their officers use body cameras , but there are still thousands of smaller departments that do not .
In the year before the study was conducted , citizens filed 1,539 complaints against police officers in the select law enforcement agencies . During the 12 months that the study was administered , citizens filed a relatively meager 113 complaints against police officers – a whopping 93 percent drop .
On one site involved in the study , complaints essentially vanished . During the trial period zero complaints against officers were filed with Site A in all the groups tested .
In addition , the findings , published in the journal Criminal Justice Behaviour , showed how even among officers working in the same agencies who were not equipped with body cameras complaints dropped .
Dr. Ariel states that improved body-camera equipped police interaction with the public was adopted even among officers without the devices attached to their uniforms . He called the advancement of this culture “ contagious accountability . ”
Body camera usage has also helped law enforcement agencies obtain convictions with video footage of police encounters substantiating charges . Such irrefutable evidence is key in trying some cases , like when domestic violence victims do not want to collaborate with authorities .
Conversely , assaults against officers rose by 15 percent when using body cameras , according to a Cambridge University report released last May .
Video footage recorded by a police body camera was used to clear officers of shooting a mentally ill man in the London Borough of Enfield . Jurors , who justified the officers use of deadly force , were presented with body camera footage showing the moment when the mentally ill man pointed an air pistol at the officers .
I was enchanted by Twitter on the opening day of Brainstorm Green . By creating what 's called a hashtag for the event – in this case , # FortuneGreen – those of us who organized the Fortune conference about business and the environment encouraged people at the event to tweet about it . And we made it easy for anyone to follow or search for a stream of tweets from the event .
digg_url = ‘ http : //www.greenbiz.com/blog/2009/04/23/why-twitter-can-be-bad-journalism ' ;
So I opened my laptop and , in real time , read dispatches from the event : What was being said , what others thought about about what was being said , big ideas , trivial observations , critiques of our speaker , links to photos from the scene–all in 140 characters or fewer , the limit on the size of messages that can flow through Twitter . ( For an explanation of Twitter , see this . ) While the size of each message is limited , there 's no limit on the number of 140-character dispatches you can send . So people , including me , were sending out dozens of tweets per hour .
By searching Twitter ( at http : //search.twitter.com/ ) for Tweets containing # FortuneGreen—are you still with me here ? —anyone can see everything that was said about the event . Kind of fun . Some examples from today 's session , and I wo n't try to translate all the shorthand now :
oppgreen : http : //twitpic.com/3sv27 - Cowboy Clinton at # fortunegreen today…check out his cowboy boots…yeehaw ! patrickdo : @ mlamonica thanks for the link , great story on Bill Clinton at # fortunegreen mlamonica : Green business is key to tackling climate change , says Bill Clinton . link to full story this time http : //t.cnet.com/4g # fortunegreen DavidSwardlick : Pres . Clinton - the only morally accepable way to controll population in the world is to help get all the girls into schools # FortuneGreen Milieunet : RT @ greenwombat : Clinton : Arizona & Nevada : “ Those are two of the places it would be easiest to make energy independent. ” # FortuneGreen
You get the idea .
Anyway , I was tweeting merrily along after moderating a panel on climate change politics in Washington when I sent out the following :
MarcGunther : EDF 's Fred Krupp , NRG 's David Crane , Duke 's Jim Rogers say , give away 100 % of permits under cap and trade at first # FortuneGreen
During my panel , I had understood Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund , CEO David Crane of NRG Energy and Jim Rogers , the CEO of Duke Energy , who all belong to the U.S . Climate Action Partnership , to say that all of the allowances under a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions should initially be given away . The question of whether to give away or auction those allowances—essentially , permits to pollute—is a contentious one , for reasons not worth going into here . To my surprise , my tweet set off a bit of a storm in the world of energy and environmental bloggers , including some not at the event .
My tweet turned out to be the result of a miscommunication or misunderstanding on my part . Of course , since I was reporting live during the event , I did n't bother to check my facts . I do n't blame Twitter for that . That was my fault .
But I learned two lessons that would have been obvious had I done a little more thinking and a little less tweeting . Lesson No . 1 is this : Trying to cover an event live on Twitter—especially if you are a participant , as I was—does n't allow time to check facts or seek out an alternative point of view or think for more than a few seconds about what to say . There 's not enough time to do anything but tweet . In fact , it 's hard just to tweet and pay attention . You 're multitasking . It 's closer to court stenography or simultaneous translation than to real journalism , which requires sifting and thinking . Or at least it should .
Lesson No . 2 : There 's not much you can do when you make a mistake on Twitter , particularly if you are dealing with a complex subject . After trading emails with bloggers , NRDC and EDF , I got the following from Dave Hawkins , NRDC 's leading climate expert , who was with us at Brainstorm Green :
What USCAP recommends is that nearly all allocations go , not to emitters , but for consumer rebates/dividends , low-carbon technology , efficiency , low–income protection , adaptation , and international engagement . That includes initial allocations to local distribution companies , with a requirement that the value be passed through to customers and/or invested in efficiency… . You asked about NRDC 's position on allowance distribution . It is set forth in the attached Cap 2.0 proposal and we believe it is consistent with the USCAP Blueprint . It is on the web at http : //www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/cap2.0/files/synthesis.pdf
As you can see from figures 2 and 3 of the document , allowance value is focused on clean and advanced energy deployment , efficiency , and consumer dividends from the start and after 15 years all value would go back to consumers as dividends . Of the estimated $ 100 billion annual value at the start of the program about $ 8.9 billion is proposed for distribution to energy-intensive industry to prevent off-shoring of production and emissions from these industries . This gets phased down over the initial 15 years of the program .
In 2012 more than $ 51 billion per year would go directly for efficiency and low-carbon energy RD & D and deployment , with more of the remainder going to consumer rebates and dividends , adaptation , forestry and agriculture incentives , and international engagement .
Try saying that in 140 characters . Even if I could , it would now be impossible to reaggregate the audience that read the original mistaken tweet . All I can do now is send out a tweet about this blogpost—my best effort to correct the mistake .
The real mistake , though , is trying to cover a story in little live bursts . You ca n't concentrate , you ca n't think , you ca n't convey a complex idea , you ca n't persuade or explain . That 's why Twitter is bad for journalism–or , more specifically , it is not the right vehicle within which to do journalism .
Twitter will good for journalism in other ways . It 's an effective way to point other people to content on the web . By following others ' tweets , I 've discovered blogs or stories I would otherwise have missed . I 've quickly collected several hundred “ followers ” in just a few weeks , so I can tell about what I 'm writing or reading .
Twitter 's valuable in other ways , too . It 's a real-time window into what people are doing and thinking and talking about . It has enormous potential , already demonstrated , as an organizing tool . Anyone in the communications business probably ought to play around with Twitter and other social media like Facebook .
But I had a brief chat with Peter Darbee , the CEO of PG & E Corp. , during Brainstorm Green that has stuck in my mind longer than any tweet . He told me that he 's going to cut back on some of his day-to-day work so that he can carve out a couple of hours every day for thinking . Imagine that . Just thinking–no phone , email , meetings or , presumably , tweets . I ca n't remember the last time I spent 15 minutes thinking , unless you count time I spend running . Something 's lost because of all the attention we devote to Gmail and blogs and Facebook and Twitter . As Joni Mitchell put it , “ does n't it always seem to go that you do n't know what you got till it 's gone . ”

When Clarke Griffin ( Eliza Taylor ) was last seen on The 100 , she was leaving her people behind for parts unknown . Now , the show 's executive producer , Jason Rothenberg , has revealed the first photo of Clarke in Season 3 and she is sporting quite a new look .
Wrote Rothenberg in his tweet with the photo reveal , `` Sneak peek of Clarke in Season 3 . You guys are n't ready . 2016 is n't THAT far away . ''

It 's hard not to ponder just how Grounder-esque Clarke is looking in that photo , hmm ? We know that Grounder Commander Lexa ( Alycia Debnam-Carey ) is returning in Season 3 , and we recently spoke to Debnam-Carey about returning to the series . We 'll also be meeting plenty of new Grounders , including Black Sails ' Zach McGowan as a rogue Grounder warrior name Roan and Desperate Housewives ' Brenda Strong as Queen Nia of the Ice Nation .
The 100 : Season 2 Review
Check out our video interviews above and below with Rothenberg and The 100 cast to learn more about Season 3 .

The 100 : Season 3 will consist of 16 episodes and debut sometime early in 2016 .
LAST weekend I was having pillow talk with Scarlett * ( 25 ) . We had been on a date the night before . It was only our third or fourth . We had gone to the theatre , followed by a bar , then eventually back to my apartment for sex . We woke with hazy headaches , bruised bodies and whimsical conversation .
“ What 's on for the rest of your weekend ? ” I quizzed in a hungover drawl . “ Oh , I 'm just planning to spend some time with my boyfriend Chad * ( 29 ) . ”
While this dialogue may sound Ashley Madison-esque to those who hold more traditional values , that could n't be further from the truth . In the past decade society has seen a rise of couples ( especially the more youthful ) exploring polyamory and open relationships — the practice where a committed couple also separately and openly engage in dating and sexual relationships with others , sometimes casual and sometimes more serious .
“ Poly to me is dating or otherwise being in a relationship ( sexual or romantic or both ) with more than one person , or being open to that , ” notes Scarlett , who has dated Chad for three years . “ I was still poly when I was only dating one person , the same as how dating a man does n't remove my queer identity . When talking about my current relationship I usually say I 'm in an open relationship , because I feel like poly sometimes implies that I 'm only interested in multiple committed relationships ( or at least that 's how I see it used ) whereas right now I 'm perfectly happy casually dating or sleeping with other people while having one live-in committed relationship with Chad . ”
Contrary to popular belief , polyamory and open relationships are n't primarily about allowing your partner a get-out-of-jail-free card to indulge in sexual exploits with other people ( a concept much closer to swinging which is generally more associated with older married couples ) . To many the act of engaging in dating is about the fundamental experience that comes from the exploration of the human condition . Meeting new people , learning from their worldview and expanding your perspective on the world around you .
“ I identify as a queer pansexual with an interest in various forms of fetish play , ” says Chad . “ Because of this I tend to think that in a lot of cases it is impossible for one partner in the traditional sense to fulfil all needs when it comes to the rather broad concept of intimacy . This is something I fell naturally into doing over time as I worked it out . ”
It 's an unspoken truth that while in the formative stages of any relationship you will both be dating other people , and that once entering a monogamous bond you will still have flirtatious feelings for others time-to-time . It 's difficult not to see the appeal of being able to date multiple people at once without guilt .
“ I think it 's always been something which has made sense , ” details Scarlett . “ But it 's only been the last four or five years when I 've felt able to try and have poly relationships . I like that I can provide different kinds of support to different partners/lovers and similarly get different things from them . ”
“ I like to have minimal boundaries , ” adds Chad . “ I do n't see how holding someone back from something they feel the urge to partake in as constructive behaviour ( assuming they are n't harming themselves or others ) . ”
That 's not to say that you can simply jump into the open relationship ocean without any form of an emotional lifejacket .
“ My first few attempts at open relationships did n't go so well — the first was trying to open up a relationship which had previously been monogamous , where I was more interested in it than him , ” says Scarlett .
“ The others were when I started dating people already in long term relationships and issues arose with balancing the needs and interactions between everyone involved . I learned a lot about how to conduct myself in open relationships and relationships more generally from those experiences , even though they were quite painful at the time . ”
Of course , as with any form of relationship , boundaries must be drawn and communication is imperative .
“ When I 'm interested in going on a date with a new person I make sure they know about Chad right from the start , because if someone is n't comfortable with an open relationship then they 're not the person for me . Another important thing for me is that they respect my other relationships . ”
“ I like to think communication between all parties is key , ” says Chad . “ But I also think that is true with any kind of relationship . It should n't be a challenge and if it is , perhaps it 's not for you . ”
“ Chad and I have one main rule which is to always use condoms if we 're with a partner where the sex we 're having calls for them . Aside from that we 'll usually mention if we went on a date ( we do n't have a requirement for pre-approval or anything like that ) . We also both get STI tests reasonably often , but I think that 's just something which anyone who is sexually active with more than one partner should do , whether those partners are in series or parallel . ”
Polyamory will never be for everyone , but the same can be said for monogamy . They both fall at the opposite ends of a very broad spectrum , one that many people occupy the middle-ground of for much of their lives .
The important thing for couples like Scarlett and Chad is being upfront and honest . And there 's definitely something to be said about that .

Time is running out for Caltrans in its marathon pursuit of permits needed to implode the largest underwater pier of the old eastern span of the Bay Bridge before the costs rise .
Some agencies are still considering the demolition , which if approved would take place in November at a cost of at least $ 132 million for all 22 piers . That month was chosen as the time when imploding the five-story hollow caisson would have the least effect on fish and wildlife .
The raft of agency OKs needed to include the federal , state and regional agencies concerned with wildlife and water quality .
If the blasting method falls short of full approval , the cost of removing the underwater bridge supports could grow by $ 94 million , according to an August report to the Legislature .
The key concerns have been protecting endangered fish and wildlife and also water quality .
The state Department of Fish and Wildlife and the state Water Resources Control Board have signed off on the project , as has the federal Fish and Wildlife Service , bridge spokeswoman Leah Robinson-Leach said Wednesday .
But Caltrans still needs a permit from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the regional Bay Conservation and Development Commission , she said . The bay agency has set a Sept. 17 hearing to consider the question .
The Army Corps of Engineers also has to weigh in with an update of a previous permit .
The pier , called E3 , would be a test of the implosion method for the 21 other underwater piers that range eastward to the East Bay shoreline .
Much of the obsolete bridge is slowly being deconstructed piece by piece above water , but E3 , a 268-foot-high hollow chunk of concrete set in the bay mud , could be pulverized in just six seconds .
Caltrans first planned to build cofferdams around the pier and pump out the water so that workers could gradually demolish it with jackhammers , but such work could take many months , Robinson-Leach said .
The agency determined an implosion was the most efficient , cost-effective and environmentally sound way to remove the pier . More than 600 small explosives set in the concrete and detonated simultaneously would collapse the concrete into a pile of rubble .
Finding a way to protect bay fish and wildlife was key to going with the implosion method . The agency plans to create an “ air curtain ” around the pier using pipes blowing compressed air into the water .
The curtain is expected to contain the blast energy that could injure or kill seals , sea lions and porpoises , said a marine scientist with the watchdog group Baykeeper .
In fact , the initial plan to mechanically dismantle the pier could have been worse for the wildlife as the work dragged on , said Baykeeper staff scientist Ian Wren .
But Wren said he still has “ a lot of concern about debris and dust dispersed through the water . ”
Baykeeper is working with Caltrans on easing the environmental effects . The group will monitor the implosion as Caltrans may use it to demolish smaller support piers .
“ If the impacts are significant , we would look for more permit review and advocacy for alternative dismantling , ” Wren said in a phone interview Wednesday .
Mechanical work may prove more cost-effective and safer to remove some of the piers in shallower water , Robinson-Leach said .

Colorado 's new special DEA agent in charge ( emphasis on `` special '' ) told the Denver Post late last month that medical marijuana is dangerous because it can cause water damage in houses where children live .
“ By federal law , marijuana is illegal , ” Barbra Roach told the Post . “ There is no medical proof it has any benefit . People are not taking into account what can happen to those who are growing it . There are homes with mold and water damage in the hundreds of thousands and there are children in there too . ”
The drug war truly does claim a new casualty every day .
Rep. Jared Polis ( D-Colo. ) , who Reason nominated as a possible successor to Rep. Ron Paul ( R-Texas ) , mocked Roach on Twitter and his Facebook page last week :
“ That 's just a very strange thing to say . No doubt that some idiots have flooded their basements growing marijuana . No doubt that some idiots have flooded their basements growing tomatoes . I stained my tiles in my living room last year growing narcissus . Ok . So for this we need a federal cop busting people ? ” “ The fact that an opponent of medical marijuana uses arguments like ‘ it causes water damage to homes ' shows how bankrupt that side is of facts .

If the last two games gave us any indication , its clear that at the end of close games , the Nets are comfortable running their offense through Brook Lopez .
In Wednesday night 's 93-90 win over the Detroit Pistons , it was Lopez who got the ball on the last two crucial possessions . In Lopez 's final bucket , the Nets ran a basic post up play for the center , letting him isolate against Greg Monroe . Lopez backed his way in towards the hoop and scored with relative ease .
As easy is that hoop looked , the Nets showed on the possession before that while they may want to run their offense through Brook , there are other creative ways to get him the ball aside from just straight post ups .
Let 's take a look .
As you can see in the above image , the set begins with Deron entering the ball to Joe Johnson on the wing , then Deron rubs off of a Gerald Wallace back screen to get enough space to set up shop in the right mid-post area .
On Williams ' catch , both block areas are clear for Williams to go to work in the post . This is purposeful as the play is designed to look and feel like an isolation for him . See below .
But , Deron 's post-up is merely a clever bit of misdirection ( Hat tip to Zach Lowe of Grantland for initially sniffing out this play design . Peep number eight towards the bottom ) .
Notice above , as Williams begins his dribble to back down Bynum , the Pistons are already sending help . The nearest Piston defender is Jonas Jerebko and even after one dribble he 's almost lost sight entirely of his man , Gerald Wallace . As a result , Greg Monroe , who is guarding Brook Lopez , is forced to rotate towards the paint to help cover Jerebko .
As you 'll see in the below image , the Nets use this rotation against the Pistons . As Monroe is rotating down , Gerald Wallace is beginning what is called a cut-screen ( a screen disguised as a cut ) . Wallace cuts towards the hoop , but more importantly , he cuts directly in front of the path of Lopez 's defender Monroe . Lopez 's job then is to cut directly off of Wallace 's left hip . Here 's the start of that action :
And here 's the end result , which is Lopez getting a catch moving downhill towards the rim with essentially both of the Pistons interior defenders occupied :
As you can see , running the offense through Lopez can happen in a number of different shapes and forms . This creative entry takes advantage of Lopez 's ability as a diver and his ability to finish shots on the move .

Unable to accept the results of a fair and free election , liberals have tried all kinds of crazy things to stop Donald Trump from taking office next month . They attempted a recount in several states to overturn Trump 's election , have threatened the Electoral College into changing their votes , and have floated a conspiracy theory that the Russians hacked the election , hoping for god knows what . None of that stuff has worked , so they are now trying to get Obama to declare Trump insane and have him institutionalized .
Three psychiatry professors from liberal universities have penned a letter to the current president begging him to force Trump to undergo a mental health evaluation . Well , technically they wrote this letter to The Huffington Post , but they are hopeful Obama will read it .
Dear President Obama , We are writing to express our grave concern regarding the mental stability of our President-Elect . Professional standards do not permit us to venture a diagnosis for a public figure whom we have not evaluated personally .
Interestingly enough , right after saying it would be unprofessional for these liberals to diagnose Trump without actually examining him , they go ahead and diagnose him anyway :
Nevertheless , his widely reported symptoms of mental instability — including grandiosity , impulsivity , hypersensitivity to slights or criticism , and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality — lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office .
The only way these symptoms can be considered “ widely reported ” is that lunatic liberal websites like The HuffPo have pushed this false narrative that Trump is mentally unbalanced . Looking at that list of symptoms , a good case could be made that the letter writers are actually talking about Obama . The president is an egomaniac , a pathological liar , does n't deal well with criticism , and lives in a fantasy world where his shitty presidency has been one of prosperity and progress .
And then here is what the liberal professors want Obama to do to keep Trump from assuming office :
We strongly recommend that , in preparation for assuming these responsibilities , he receives a full medical and neuropsychiatric evaluation by an impartial team of investigators .
The letter is signed by Judith Herman from Harvard Medical School , Nanette Gartrell , from the University of California , San Francisco , and Dee Mosbacher also from the University of California , San Francisco .
Let 's look at what these mental health “ experts ” are asking : they want the sitting president to force the President-elect to undergo a serious psychiatric evaluation in hopes that Trump will be declared insane and institutionalized so he ca n't become the next President of the United States . That 's the most bonkers thing liberals have come up with yet . Somebody needs a psych-eval , but it is n't Trump ; it 's these three liberals who have written this letter .
The recount effort to overthrow Trump ended with him actually picking up votes . The scheme to get Electors to cast their votes for someone other than Trump will end in failure on Monday . The Russian hacking conspiracy theory is just leftist noise and wo n't keep Trump from swearing in . Sadly , all three of those liberal plots to undo the election seem brilliant compared to the idiocy of thinking Obama can have Trump thrown in the loony bin .

Officials approved a service , coded No 24/i , to take foreigners to an immigrant hostel and by-pass a working-class neighbourhood served by the existing 24 buses after disturbances between the two groups of passengers . `` At the heart of the decision are the clashes between immigrants and residents , '' said Orazio Ciliberti , the centre-Left mayor of the agricultural town in Puglia province . He added , however , that immigrants would be free to travel on any bus they choose .
`` We are not talking about racism , but about providing a better service . ''
The news of the route , which starts on Monday , prompted comparisons with Apartheid-era South Africa and the fight against segregated buses in the southern United States during the 1950s .
`` The route for non-EU citizens in Foggia , which smacks of segregation , should be abolished as soon as possible , '' said Nichi Vendola , the regional president of Puglia .
Authorities say friction has been rising between residents of the working-class neighbourhood of Mezzanone and the roughly 800 migrants who live in the Cara centre after a series of robberies blamed on foreigners .

VANCOUVER , British Columbia – On his way to the bus Saturday night , Kevin Durant was walking through the Golden State Warriors ' locker room , past the coaches and front-office staff , past his preseason debut . He clutched a paper plate loaded with the buffet spread as his eyes caught the franchise 's architect knotting his tie .
“ Nice to see you make a shot out there , ” general manager Bob Myers deadpanned .
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Durant smiled and nodded , as though gratified to hear Myers busting his chops .
Seeing Kevin Durant in a Warriors uniform may take a moment to get used to . ( AP )
Durant had played a little nervously , a little scattered in a Warriors uniform . It is a long jaunt to June , and it began by missing seven of nine shots in 18 minutes against the Toronto Raptors .
Maybe it 'll come fast for Durant here ; maybe it 'll take some time . Nevertheless , it will come for him with these Warriors , and when it does , they 'll be a gathering of talent to behold .
Under Myers and coach Steve Kerr in Golden State , the Warriors take the job seriously – just not themselves . They 're much closer to the San Antonio Spurs model than most of that franchise 's direct descendants . Rival players can be close friends for years , but free agency is a stranger process for the decision-makers : Management and coaches meet a player for the first time on July 1 , and get his decision within days . In a lot of ways , the GM and coach come together as perfect strangers with a superstar signee .
“ I 'll tell you this : I do n't know Kevin Durant very well at all right now , ” Myers told The Vertical . “ He 's a little bit like Andre Iguodala in that way . I think it takes years to get to know players . I do n't know enough about him right now . ”
Durant scores a bucket Saturday night . ( AP )
In meeting Durant in the Hamptons in July , though , Myers knew this : Durant wanted to find joy in basketball and the Warriors had the market cornered on it .
Story continues
“ One of the pillars of Steve 's culture is joy , ” Myers told The Vertical . “ Have fun . That 's why you come to shootaround and hear the music going . It took me a while to figure that out . As someone new in the business , I thought you were supposed to have strict rules . That 's how it was done . Steve helped me realize it 's a long season and you can be successful while enjoying yourself . He 's proven that here .
“ Winning , success , they do n't have to be accompanied by rigidity . We try to let people be themselves , grow up , evolve . We make mistakes . We will make more mistakes . But our players are grown men , and they 'll do what they need to do . ”
For all the reasons that have been explored and examined about Durant 's decision to bolt Oklahoma City for Golden State in free agency – especially the scrutiny upon the Russell Westbrook-Durant dynamic – this ca n't be lost in it all : Durant 's ultimate disconnect with Oklahoma City far transcended his co-star and extended deeper into the Thunder franchise . This is no one 's fault ; teams and organizations have to be themselves , operate within what works for them , and then free agency allows players to make the choice .
In the end , Golden State 's Draymond Green would n't have been so persistent recruiting Durant throughout the past season had Durant shut down the conversations . Green would n't have texted and talked with one-sided conversations that included no responses , no reciprocation . Truth be told , something was missing for Durant in Oklahoma City , and he left because he believed it existed in Golden State . Great players need an anchor to stay , and Durant did n't have an anchor there .
“ I did think that was an advantage for us , ” Green told The Vertical .
Durant fits here . When he touched the ball on Saturday night , they booed him at the Rogers Arena . So it goes . Eventually , it 'll subside . Yes , it takes a moment to train your eyes , see Durant in that Warriors uniform and allow your mind to recalibrate its thinking .
His agents did n't make the decision , nor his family or friends . Durant did . He wanted to leave Oklahoma City . He wanted to play for the Warriors – and with the Warriors . For Durant , the choice was n't some kind of measure of his character , but simply a window into his priorities and preferences .
“ We have n't had any talks about how he fits in here , ” Green told The Vertical . “ It 's a natural . Those are the talks that got him here – how he fit . He 's definitely a person who believes relationships matter . ”
One preseason game down , and the Warriors and Durant are marching down the path now . Myers stood in a corner of the coach 's locker room , and had no interest in pretending he could speak with tremendous authority on the superstar who walked into his life on July 4 .
Myers knows this , though : “ [ Durant ] wants an environment that he enjoys going to work in every day , ” he said . “ It 's basic . Everyone wants to complicate it , but Kevin Durant loves playing basketball . That 's all he wants to do : play basketball . And enjoy himself . ”
Perhaps Kevin Durant is n't used to a front-office executive busting his chops on a bad shooting night , but the look on his face suggested he loved it . These are the Golden State Warriors , and that 's such a part of what made the sport 's biggest free agent make a leap of faith .
Welcome to Golden State , KD . Now , make a jump shot , will you ?

Queensland government study shows current funding is far less than what is needed to meet environmental targets and avoid reef being placed on Unesco watch list
Attempting to fix the water qualityfor the Great Barrier Reef will cost $ 8.2bn in the next decade but even then some of the targets will be impossible to meet , according to a landmark report commissioned by the Queensland government .
The targets are part of the federal government 's Reef 2050 Plan , the implementation of which is required by Unesco in order for the reef to avoid being included on the world heritage in danger list . Currently , state and federal governments are spending less than a tenth of what the report finds is required .
Great Barrier Reef bleaching made 175 times likelier by human-caused climate change , say scientists Read more
The conclusions are part of the government 's final Water Science Taskforce report , and associated costings study . It only addresses water quality issues and not warming , which was responsible for killing almost a quarter of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef this year . Improving water quality is expected to give the coral a better chance of recovering from bleaching .
The final costings amount to about half that of a draft version of the report leaked to the ABC , but are roughly in line with independent analysis published in a scientific journal in May .
The costing report notes that “ policy solution sets to meet the regional Reef 2050 Plan targets for the GBR requires a significant increase in investment from current levels ” .
The report notes that farms are the major source of pollution for the Great Barrier Reef , and identifies seven policy “ solution sets ” , including improving management practices for cane farmers and graziers ; remediating gullies ; completely shifting the land use for some areas ; and improving urban stormwater management .
It found that the currently available policy solutions , even with the suggested level of investment , will not be able to meet all the targets because they “ can not be applied widely enough , or they simply can not address the scale of load reductions ” . As a result , new policy actions will need to be considered , it said .
The Great Barrier Reef : a catastrophe laid bare Read more
The report notes that farms in the relevant areas employ about 35,000 people and contribute $ 3.7bn to the economy each year . Meanwhile , industries relying on the Great Barrier Reef employ twice than number of people and contribute about $ 6bn to the economy each year .
It makes 10 broad policy recommendations , all of which the Queensland government either agreed to , or agreed to “ in principle ” .
Queensland environment minister , Steven Miles , said : “ The recommendations set the stage for a bold new era of reform in water quality improvement and that is what we will deliver . ”
“ We have agreed , or agreed in principle , to also review the reef water quality targets , better communicate how everyone can improve reef water quality , use incentives to drive water quality improvements , pursue targeted regulatory approaches , develop a strategic investment plan , and simplify and strengthen governance arrangements . ”
Miles said some of the recommendations will require further consultation or collaboration with the federal government .
The report was welcomed by WWF spokesman Sean Hoobin .
“ “ We congratulate the Queensland Government for commissioning this historic report . It 's the most detailed and comprehensive assessment ever undertaken of what it will cost to save the Reef , ” Hoobin said .
“ This report confirms that the money committed so far by Australia falls far short of what 's required , ” he said .
In just two seasons receiver Odell Beckham Jr. has become a legend in New York even though he 's yet to play in a single post season game . That could very well change this season as the Mara family broke the bank with over 200 million in free agency dollars in hopes of adding the right pieces to a franchise in search of old glory .

New York Giants ( 6-10 )
SB Futures : 20-1
FORMER
The Giants offense earned mixed reviews in coordinator Ben McAdoo second season . While the offense ranked a solid eighth overall in yards it was the combination of a poor 3rd down efficiency rate which ranked 22nd in the league and an even more frustrating red zone percentage that ranked 29th which caused the Giants offense to underperform at the most opportune moments . It did n't help matters that the defense was awful ranking dead last in yards allowed at 420.3 per game and 30th in points allowed at 27.6 per game .
If it were n't for the quality of play on special teams , things could have been much worse for the Giants in '15 . But the unit was a huge boon to the team thanks to kicker Josh Brown ( 30-32 including 3-3 from 50+ ) , punter Brad Wing ( tied a franchise record with 33 punts inside the 20-yard line ) and returner Dwayne Harris ( two return TDs and a 28.7 kick return average which ranked third in the NFL ) .
CURRENT
The Tom Coughlin era ended with four straight non-playoff seasons with the last three ending in losing seasons following a second Super Bowl win in 2011 . McAdoo takes over and becomes a head coach for the first time in his 20-year coaching career .
One could argue that general manager Jerry Reese should have also seen the door and his time could be coming if the team does n't turn things around soon . Reese has only fielded five starters over the past five drafts , but he might have just saved his best class for last . It would n't surprise me to see five players from just this past draft start by the start of the 2017 season .
Reese should also get high marks for acquiring one of the top-two free agent classes in franchise history . Time will tell how this class compares to the '05 class which included QB Kerry Collins , OT Kareem McKenzie and MLB Antonio Pierce . While the Mara family can never be confused with the Steinbrenners , every decade or so they do seem to wake-up just in time to appease their loyal fan base and this is just the latest example .
With Olivier Vernon , Damon Harrison and Janoris Jenkins joining talented defenders Jason Pierre-Paul , Johnathan Hankins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie the defense appears ready for a major up rise .
CONCLUSION
If the free agents and rookies contribute as much as I believe they will the Giants have a good shot at returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2011 .
My major concern is with first-time head coach McAdoo . Getting a team from the NFC East to make the playoffs is one thing , but winning a Super Bowl is entirely something else . But if McAdoo can prove he 's the right man for the job , the talent should be there to take the Giants back to their winning ways before Eli leave the building .

Mark Zuckerberg-backed FWD.us is escalating its attacks on Donald Trump 's immigration policies as the candidate prepares to accept the Republican party 's presidential nomination in Cleveland .
The immigration reform group launched a website , Trump365 , that explores the human and economic toll of deporting an estimated 11 million people .
`` It 's a big number , '' said FWD.us president Todd Schulte . `` We want to break it down so people understand this is going to hurt each and every one of us in America , whether they 've ever met an undocumented immigrant or not . ''
FWD.us cites estimates that the cost of such a mass deportation could reach $ 735 billion to $ 935 billion over the next 20 years ( or about $ 11,442 per household ) . It argues that uprooting so many people would have disastrous consequences for the nation 's economy and cause labor shortages for specific industries , like construction .
Schulte said he hopes Trump365 will serve as a `` messaging hub , '' where supporters could find graphics to share on Twitter and Facebook , in an attempt to amplify the message .
Trump365 launched a day before FWD.us prepares Monday to release the results of a new poll of voters ' views on Trump 's immigration plan in three key presidential battleground states .
Update : FWD.us just released the results of a new bipartisan poll of 600 likely voters in Colorado , Florida and Nevada , which reveals that Trump 's immigration policies are extremely unpopular among independent voters .
Roughly two-thirds of Independents said they opposed his plans to round up and deport all immigrants living here illegally ( 67 percent ) , to revoke citizenship from U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants ( 67 percent ) , to temporarily ban foreign-born Muslims from entering the U.S. ( 67 percent ) and to build a wall across the Mexican border ( 65 percent ) .
Trump365 and the new survey are part of a campaign to counter anti-immigration rhetoric in the 2016 White House race , which included web videos that imagined the plight of people ripped out of their homes or jobs by a deportation force .
John Podesta on Clinton securing nomination and facing Trump
The call that seemingly changed everything for Meleana Shim came at 7:45 on a Friday morning .
Houston Dash managing director Brian Ching told the 22-year-old that the Dash would be selecting her in the NWSL expansion draft .
Two days before , the Portland Thorns had announced that Shim would be unprotected heading into the draft , but the early-morning call still caught the young midfielder entirely off guard .
Over the last year , Shim 's life already had undergone dramatic changes . She had gone undrafted in the 2013 NWSL college draft , made the Thorns through an open tryout , earned her way onto the field as a starter , scored five goals for Portland and won a championship in her first professional season .
Off the field , the Hawaii native had grown fond enough of the Rose City to call Portland her new home . She loved the rainy weather and relished trail runs in Forest Park . She had found a group of friends that loved yoga and art , and knew nothing of the world of professional athletics . And she had fallen in love and just signed a lease to live with a woman she had met at a Portland coffee shop .
On that early-January morning , Shim was supposed to catch a flight home to visit her family in Hawaii . Now , she hung up her cell phone and told her girlfriend , Maru Serricchio , the news .
The couple sat down on the couch at Serricchio 's studio apartment in Northwest Portland and began to cry .
“ I was in shock of the reality of her life , ” Serricchio says . “ It did n't hit me until it happened that this is normal for her career . This can happen at any time . ”
Unlike other professional athletes who make hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to compete , players in the National Women 's Soccer League play for modest salaries , driven by their love of the game and will to see a women 's professional soccer league succeed in the United States .
Since the age of 6 , Shim 's trajectory had been pointing her toward the highest levels of women 's soccer . For years , she played persistently and made enormous sacrifices for the sport . Her dedication never wavered . She could n't get enough of soccer .
But Houston 's draft call made Shim question whether she wanted to play soccer so badly that she would be willing to pack up and leave the place and the woman she loved .
“ Soccer is something I hold very close to my heart , ” Shim says . “ I was willing to sacrifice everything , including myself , for the sport . I had to take a step back and look at my life . ”

In 1997 , Jason Goodson decided to scour the island of Oahu for the best 6- , 7- and 8-year-old girls soccer players , hoping to create a competitive team that could stay together through their childhood development years .
In late summer , Goodson was heading to his car after a day of scouting when he noticed a tiny girl preparing for her game by kicking a soccer ball smoothly with her left foot against a wall . He decided to stay and watch her play .
But when the referee blew his whistle , the young girl immediately sat down in the center of field and refused to get up — the perfectionist did n't want to play a sport that she had n't mastered .
Goodson was about to leave when the girl stood up , ran over and stole the ball from her own goalkeeper and proceeded to dribble up the field around all the other players and straight into the other goal .
For the rest of the match , Meleana Shim ran circles around her opponents .
“ She just had a level of sophistication that was above and beyond anything I 'd ever seen in such a young player , ” Goodson says . “ It did n't take long to realize just how special she was . ”
At 6 , Shim was the youngest player Goodson invited to join his squad , the Ho'okalakupua Football Academy . But Shim — whom everyone by then called “ Mana , ” the Hawaiian word for life energy — quickly proved she could compete with players two years older .
And her competitive thirst was unquenchable . Though the team would practice five or six days a week , Shim was soon calling Goodson regularly to ask if he would train with her on days off .
“ From a very young age , I always put in a lot of time just working with the ball and getting a good touch , ” Shim says . “ Jason focused on technique before anything else . I really think that foundation has helped me because I 'm confident and comfortable with the ball at my feet . ”
After practice one afternoon , a 7-year-old Shim ran to her father 's car in excitement . The team had learned to juggle that day and Mana had juggled the ball 13 times — more than anybody else on the squad .
“ 13 ? ” Sri Shim joked . “ That 's not very many . I bet you ca n't get to 25 . ”
For the next three hours , Sri leaned against his parked car as a determined Mana juggled the soccer ball over and over again , trying to get 25 touches before it hit the ground .
As the sun set , Mana asked her dad to turn on the car headlights so she could meet her goal . When she finally reached 25 , she told her dad they could go home .
“ I was so stubborn , ” Mana says . “ It was so ridiculous , but that 's how I am . Once I put my mind to something , it 's happening . ”

Around the time Shim turned 13 , Goodson left Hawaii to take a job in Arizona coaching one of the top youth clubs in the nation , the Sereno Soccer Club .
Shim was devastated .
Without Goodson , Shim felt her progress stifled . She was entering high school and knew she needed to continue to up her game to earn an elusive college scholarship .
The summer before her junior year in high school , Shim was supposed to head to the mainland for a weeklong camp in Idaho with the Olympic Development Program .
She packed two suitcases . Then , the 15-year-old told her parents she would n't be coming home .
“ I told them I was going to live on the mainland and play soccer , ” Shim says . “ I wanted a good college scholarship , and to get that I needed to play games every weekend for a serious team . ”
College coaches do n't spend much time scouting in Hawaii , Shim says . She knew if she stayed on the island , she would end up at the University of Hawaii , a mediocre soccer school , but the only college her parents could afford .
“ The decision was all her own , ” Sri Shim says . “ Both her mother and I fully supported her in her soccer because she was very driven and passionate about it . ”
Shim played in San Ramon , Calif. , for three months before deciding she needed to find a more competitive team . She called Goodson , and soon after Shim was sitting at San Francisco International Airport wondering if she was crazy .
She had booked a flight to Arizona and was planning to play under Goodson for the Sereno Soccer Club and live with the family of Ellen Parker , a girl she had met briefly at camp in Idaho and who would go on to play soccer at the University of Portland .
Finally , Shim stepped onto the plane .
She would spend the next year being homeschooled and playing soccer in Arizona . But the move led to a scholarship offer to play for Santa Clara University .
“ Mana 's always had this desire and sheer determination , ” Goodson says . “ You knew she was going to play at the highest levels . ”

In January 2013 , Shim was nestled in a corner of a Starbucks in Los Gatos , Calif. , 15 minutes from the Santa Clara campus , staring at her computer screen .
She watched the final picks of the NWSL college draft go by , her hope fading with each selection . When it became clear that she was n't getting drafted , Shim shut off her phone to avoid the inevitable calls from her parents .
“ If the pro coaches had been more fully aware of Mana 's ability , she would have been drafted , ” says Santa Clara coach Jerry Smith . “ She 's one of the most skillful and tactical players I 've had a chance to work with . For me , there was n't ever any doubt she was going to play in the league . ”
The upside of not getting drafted was that Shim could choose her team as she pursued open tryouts .
She looked at the rosters of all eight NWSL squads and concluded that Portland was the strongest . So , she booked a ticket to the Northwest .
“ I like to challenge myself and I 'm OK with failure , ” Shim says . “ I made a commitment to myself that I would continue to pursue my soccer career if I could make the best team in the league . I do n't like to make the safe decisions . ”
Shim recalls the overwhelming number of players who attended tryouts in Portland . The 5-foot-4 attacker found it difficult to play alongside so many different athletes , of varying skill level , who were all competing for an elusive roster spot .
But through the melee , Thorns coach Cindy Parlow Cone saw something in the small midfielder . She called Shim the next morning to invite her to preseason . Within a week , the Thorns had signed her to a contract .
“ Once she gets on the field , ” says Lolly Shim , Mana 's mother , “ she 's so technically good that people want her there . ”
• • •
Shim 's first months as a professional athlete did n't start out as planned .
She got very sick , and for a while thought she had mononucleosis . She could n't practice or travel for the first few weeks of the season . And even when she returned to the field , she found herself competing for playing time in an already very crowded midfield .
Cone had moved Canadian national team star Christine Sinclair to the midfield , and Shim realized that there was a seemingly open spot at forward alongside U.S. national team star Alex Morgan .
Shim hardly knew Morgan , but she sent her a text anyway .
“ I said , ‘ I 'm going to try to play forward with you , ' ” Shim says . “ ‘ Can you give me any tips ? ' She wrote up this whole thing and really talked with me and was so helpful when she did n't need to be . ”
On May 4 , Shim made her first start against the Washington Spirit , playing with Morgan at forward .
Shim had moved back to midfield by July , when she scored four crucial goals in consecutive games , including the game-winner in a 2-1 victory over Boston .
A month later , she was in the starting lineup when the Thorns beat the Western New York Flash 2-0 to win the inaugural NWSL championship in front of thousands of fans in Rochester , N.Y .
By then , Shim had solidified herself as a critical starter and a fan favorite .
`` Mana 's tough , '' Thorns midfielder Allie Long says . `` She 's a fighter . ''
Shim 's success as an NWSL rookie helped earn her a call-up to the U-23 U.S. women 's national team camp in December and then a call-up to a tournament in Spain in early March .
And in Spain , Shim made an impression . She scored just before halftime to help the U.S. U-23 team beat Norway 2-1 to win the Six Nations Tournament .
“ She 's more of a cerebral player and a technical player than most of the other players we have , ” says U-23 coach Steve Swanson . “ Mana makes the players around her better . Players like her are worth their weight in gold . ”

Shim 's apartment , where she now lives with Serricchio , sits on top of a hill in Northwest Portland . On a clear day , the couple can look out from their dining room table and see Mount Hood etched in the distance .
The couple have covered the walls with Serricchio 's paintings and photos , including a black-and-white painting of Shim . Books line a wall , next to a collection of old cameras . On the table , the women display a Scrabble board that they created out of a cardboard sign .
The only hints that a pro soccer player lives in the apartment come from the neatly lined row of brightly colored sneakers and cleats that sit in a shoe rack by the door , and the Portland Thorns scarf that hangs on the coat rack .
“ To me , soccer is a part of my life , but it 's not the end all , be all , ” Shim says . “ I try to incorporate other things and have balance . ”
Shim has been practicing twice a day for the last two weeks . She sits on the couch nestled against Serricchio as she drinks tea and rests her legs .
“ Any time something comes up , a miscommunication or frustration , we 're like , ‘ at least we 're not in different states , ' ” Shim says . “ Let 's just be thankful for that . ”
In the week after Houston drafted Shim , she tried and failed three times to make the trip to Hawaii to visit her family .
On one attempt , she got as far as checking her baggage before realizing that she was n't in the right emotional state to leave Portland . Her bag flew to Hawaii alone and the airline shipped it back to her the next day .
Shim has dreams of one day competing for the U.S. women 's senior national team , and to do that , she knows she has to be willing to drop everything for the sport .
But Shim had never expected her life in Portland to be just a pit stop along the way . And when Houston called , she was n't prepared .
“ My future was being determined for me , ” Shim says . “ I was n't ready to go . ”
Luckily , Shim never had to leave .
Exactly one week after Houston drafted her , the Thorns took an unexpected timeout in the second round of the NWSL college draft . A few minutes later , Shim received a text on her phone . It was Thorns coach Paul Riley welcoming her back to Portland .
`` We did n't want to lose her in the first place , '' Riley says . `` Since Houston drafted her , our priority had been to get her back . ”

It 's late February and dozens of fans are gathered at Bazi Brasserie in Southeast Portland , talking excitedly in small groups about the Portland Thorns , when Shim walks into the dark bar with Serricchio at her side .
The bar breaks out in applause .
The fans have gathered to celebrate and reminisce about the Thorns ' NWSL title one last time before the 2014 season begins . When Shim heard about the event , she volunteered to attend .
Portland Thorns midfielder Meleana Shim poses for a photo with fans at Bazi Bierbrasserie on Saturday Feb. 22 , 2014 .
“ The reality is players come and go , ” Shim says . “ I could easily be going to Houston this year . There are a lot of players who were on the team last year that are n't on the team this year . But I think that what we could all say is that the city of Portland deserves another championship . ”
Shim makes her way through the bar , stopping to talk with each small group of supporters . She 's supposed to stay for an hour , but nearly two hours later she 's still chatting with fans .
`` Mana is probably the warmest , most bubbly and kind person you 'll ever meet , '' says Rachel Van Hollebeke , a Thorns defender and member of the U.S. women 's national team . `` She 's really easygoing and just has a love for life that 's really contagious . ''
Shim poses for a photo with Thorns fan Luke Fritz . Behind her is the 2013 NWSL championship banner , with Shim 's signature in the center .
“ It 's amazing to think about everything that 's happened this year , ” Fritz says . “ Especially for you . ”
“ It 's been crazy , ” Shim says . And then she smiles .
After Shim 's circuitous journey , she is finally where she wants to be , ready to settle down in Portland , the adopted city that she adores , and just play the sport that she loves unconditionally .

Microsoft has been working hard to beef up Windows 10 with enterprise-grade security , making sure that both consumers and businesses are protected from threats . One particular feature in Windows 10 is called Windows Hello , which allows users to seamlessly and securely log into their PCs . Windows Hello supports three types of biometric entry , which includes fingerprint recognition , iris , and facial recognition .
“ With Windows Hello , you 'll be able to just show your face , or touch your finger , to new devices running Windows 10 and be immediately recognized . And not only is Windows Hello more convenient than typing a password – it 's more secure ! Our system enables you to authenticate applications , enterprise content , and even certain online experiences without a password being stored on your device or in a network server at all , ” Microsoft explained in an official blog post back in March of this year .
Using an Intel RealSense 3D Camera , the good folks over at WinSupersite have put together a video demonstration of Windows Hello on Windows 10 . Thanks to the Windows 10 SDK build 10158 from two weeks ago , third party hardware can now use Windows Hello facial recognition . Check out the demonstration below .

The US State Department 's Country Reports on Terrorism 2016 recently shed light on how Kashmir remains the most volatile state in India explaining the presence of security forces . Jammu and Kashmir experienced a 93 per cent increase in attacks in 2016 , the report noted . Over 19 per cent of the terrorist attacks in India in 2016 took place in the state .
The CRPF has come under a spate of attacks on its convoys in the Valley in the recent past . Recently , it also considered ensuring a partial or full bullet-proof armour to its four-wheeled troop carriers .
Former Kerala DGP TP Senkumar . ( Facebook )
TP Senkumar , former Kerala police chief , is in news for making controversial statements . In an interview to Samakalika Malayalam , an online publication , on Saturday , the ex-DGP said the Muslim community should make attempts to check religious extremism from within . “ There should be attempts from within the community to check religious extremism , ” The Indian Express quoted him as saying to the Malayalam publication .
Senkumar had retired from service last month . In the interview , he also said that there is “ no sense ” talking about RSS while discussing terrorism . “ When speaking about extremism , there is no sense speaking about the RSS . One can not have a comparison between the RSS and the Islamic State , ” Senkumar said .
The retired cop further said that Muslim community should not understand Jihad the way it is being understood by them now . “ The problem comes when a Muslim is taught he should do jihad to attain heaven and that jihad is when one converts another into Islam and kills a non-Muslim . Jihad should not be understood by the Muslim community in the manner in which they are understanding it now… , ” Senkumar said .
Senkumar also alleged that “ love jihad ” is still being practised by a section of the Muslim population . “ If religious conversions happen over love , such things would have taken place in all religions . But such conversions happen only in the Muslim community , ” he said . Senkumar also talked about “ demographic change ” in Kerala and linked it to the alleged growing Muslim population in Kerala . Of every 100 births in the state , Senkumar claimed , 42 belong to the Muslims , who constitute only 27 per cent of the state population . For Hindus , who constitute 54 % population , he said the birth rate is only 42 per cent , while for the Christians , who constitute 19 per cent of state population , the birth rate is 15 per cent . “ If demography is changing in this manner , what kind of change would be taking place in Kerala in the future ? Although the Christian birth rate is coming down , their population is not falling because of the conversions they are doing , ” Senkumar said .
The ex-Cop also said he had recently watched a video clip of a Ramzan speech that found fault with the killing of men to save cows . According to The Indian Express , Senkumar said , “ Such speeches would have far-reaching consequences . Action should be taken against them . ”
Senkumar 's comments triggered protests in Kerala . General secretary of IUML , an ally of Congress , P K Kunhalikutty told IE that Senkumar should not have talked in this manner . Congress MP MI Shanavas accused Senkumar of “ speaking for the Sangh Parivar ” and he should be booked for “ attempting to create communal hatred . ”

Using health insurance claims data from more than 480,000 people in nearly 130,000 families , researchers have created a new classification of common diseases based on how often they occur among genetically-related individuals .
Researchers hope the work , published this week in Nature Genetics , will help physicians make better diagnoses and treat root causes instead of symptoms .
“ Understanding genetic similarities between diseases may mean that drugs that are effective for one disease may be effective for another one , ” says senior author Andrey Rzhetsky , professor of medicine and human genetics at the University of Chicago . “ And for those diseases with a large environmental component , that means we can perhaps prevent them by changing the environment . ”
The results of the study suggest that standard disease classifications–called nosologies–based on symptoms or anatomy may miss connections between diseases with the same underlying causes . For example , the new study showed that migraine , typically classified as a disease of the central nervous system , appeared to be most genetically similar to irritable bowel syndrome , an inflammatory disorder of the intestine .
Rzhetsky and a team of researchers analyzed records from Truven MarketScan , a database of de-identified patient data from more than 40 million families in the United States . They selected a subset of records based on how long parents and their children were covered under the same insurance plan within a time frame most likely to capture when children were living in the same home with their parents . They used this massive data set to estimate genetic and environmental correlations between diseases .
Next , using statistical methods developed to create evolutionary trees of organisms , the team created a disease classification based on two measures . One focused on shared genetic correlations of diseases , or how often diseases occurred among genetically-related individuals , such as parents and children . The other focused on the familial environment , or how often diseases occurred among those sharing a home but who had no or partially matching genetic backgrounds , such as spouses and siblings .
The results focused on 29 diseases that were well represented in both children and parents to build new classification trees . Each “ branch ” of the tree is built with pairs of diseases that are highly correlated with each other , meaning they occur frequently together , either between parents and children sharing the same genes , or family members sharing the same living environment .
“ The large number of families in this study allowed us to obtain precise estimates of genetic and environmental correlations , representing the common causes of multiple different diseases , ” says Kanix Wang , a graduate student and lead author of the study . “ Using these shared genetic and environmental causes , we created a new system to classify diseases based on their intrinsic biology . ”
Genetic similarities between diseases tended to be stronger than their corresponding environmental correlations . For the majority of neuropsychiatric diseases , such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and substance abuse , however , environmental correlations are nearly as strong as genetic ones . This suggests there are elements of the shared , family environment that could be changed to help prevent these disorders .
The researchers also compared their results to the widely used International Classification of Diseases Version 9 ( ICD-9 ) and found additional , unexpected groupings of diseases . For example , type 1 diabetes , an autoimmune endocrine disease , has a high genetic correlation with hypertension , a disease of the circulatory system . The researchers also saw high genetic correlations across common , apparently dissimilar diseases such as asthma , allergic rhinitis , osteoarthritis , and dermatitis .
The study received support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) Big Mechanism program , the National Institutes of Health , and a gift from Liz and Kent Dauten . Additional authors are from the University of Chicago , Microsoft Research , and Vanderbilt University .

A cloud company has finally figured out a way to get people to read its terms of service : Put a zombie reference in there .
“ It 's hard to imagine the kind of person who would read all the way through Amazon Web Services ' massive terms of service agreement , ” writes Jacob Brogan in Slate . “ At more than 26,000 words , the document is denser and more digressive than Tristram Shandy , a veritable post-apocalyptic wasteland of legalese that dictates how users can and can not employ products from the e-retailer 's massively profitable cloud computing division . Formidable as it is , however , someone managed to make it through . ”
So where do the zombies come in ? The service now includes a new Lumberyard gaming engine , which is free , open-source software intended to help developers write games . Normally , users are barred from integrating it “ with life-critical or safety-critical systems , ” including medical or military equipment , ” Brogan writes . “ Basically , that means you ca n't use the software to program robot doctors or control weaponized drones , ” which he says is pretty darn unlikely anyway . But just in case , all bets are off in the event of a zombie apocalypse , Amazon writes :
“ However , this restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence ( certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body ) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh , blood , brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization . ”
In the process , the zombie reference also helped promote Amazon 's new gaming engine . That 's likely to help the company 's cloud service , because the gaming engine must be hosted on either Amazon 's Web servers or the developers ' own , notes Elizabeth Weise in USA Today . In other words , no cloud service competitors , writes Chris Morris in Fortune . “ And there 's no zombie apocalypse exemption there , so if the worst does happen , and Amazon 's servers go offline too , you 'll be out of luck , ” notes Samuel Gibbs in The Guardian .
It 's not the first time that zombies have come up in the context of data protection and disaster recovery . In 2011 , the CDC issued its own emergency preparedness and response circular about zombies .
“ You may laugh now , but when it happens you 'll be happy you read this , ” the circular warned . It went on to describe the zombie threat , and what people could do to be prepared in the event of a zombie apocalypse .
No , it was n't issued on April Fool 's Day , and no , it was n't a joke . Well , sort of . Did the CDC really expect a zombie apocalypse anytime soon ? No , probably not . But it got attention , it made people laugh , and if it got people to read the circular , the information in it worked just as well protecting them against hurricanes and floods as it did against zombies .
As it turns out , the CDC may have been inspired by the Defense Department , which in 2011 released its own plan for “ Counter-Zombie Dominance. ” “ Planners … realized that training examples for plans must accommodate the political fallout that occurs if the general public mistakenly believes that a fictional training scenario is actually a real plan , ” quotes Foreign Policy in 2014 . “ Rather than risk such an outcome by teaching our augmentees using the fictional ‘ Tunisia ' or ‘ Nigeria ' scenarios used at [ Joint Combined Warfighting School ] , we elected to use a completely-impossible scenario that could never be mistaken for a real plan . ”
Cornell University also used zombies to help study the spread of disease , and in the process , figured out the safest places to be in the event of a zombie apocalypse . Similarly , last December , the British Medical Journal published a peer-reviewed study on the upcoming zombie apocalypse , to call attention to preparing for infectious diseases .
“ Using zombies in lieu of real diseases gives researchers , public health professionals , policymakers , and laypeople the ability to discuss these heavy issues without getting bogged down in one specific outbreak or pathogen , because many of the problems we 'd face during the zombie apocalypse are similar to those that come up in any serious epidemic : coordination . Funding . Communication . Training . Access to treatment or prevention , ” writes Tara Smith , the author of the paper . “ In short , it 's way more fun for the average person to shoot the shit about zombies than to have a more serious discussion about influenza , or Ebola , or whatever the infectious disease du jour may be–and maybe even learn a bit of science and policy along the way . ”
In fact , the CDC zombie circular worked so well that the agency expanded the program into a variety of other content , including a graphic novel . The Amazon reference to the CDC may have been a nod to the program .
Considering that people have actually given up their first-born children through not reading terms of service carefully , vendors ca n't be blamed for putting all sorts of weird things into them , just to get people to pay attention .
Newsweek , for example , pointed out that Tumblr 's community guidelines state : “ While you 're free to ridicule , parody , or marvel at the alien beauty of Benedict Cumberbatch , you ca n't pretend to actually be Benedict Cumberbatch. ” And Tumblr also tells children younger than 13 in its terms of service to “ ask your parents for a Playstation 4 , or try books ” instead of using Tumblr , writes David Goldman in CNN .
In that context , the amount of attention paid to the zombie reference in the Amazon terms of service worked pretty well – according to Google , it resulted in about 400 articles .
Well , 401 .
Concern over the future of the Socceroos has claimed its first victim following the departure of national teams boss John Boultbee after almost eight years in charge .
Boultbee , the administrator responsible for managing all the men and women 's national teams but primarily the Socceroos , will leave at the end of the qualifying campaign for next year 's World Cup after telling Football Federation CEO David Gallop that he plans to stand for the presidency of rowing 's international governing body , FISA .
Though that position was viewed as incompatible with his role at FFA , Boultbee has long held senior roles in rowing at both national and international level .
Gallop has shown increasing concern since his arrival in December at the management of the Socceroos and the national teams unit , and Boultbee 's departure is likely to lead to a shake-up in the way it is run .
Boultbee , who was brought in by Frank Lowy and John O'Neill in 2004 , is a member of FISA 's executive committee , on the board of Rowing Australia and a steward of the Henley Regatta .
It comes with the Socceroos locked in a desperate battle to qualify for the World Cup next year and facing three defining qualifiers next month against Japan , Jordan and Iraq .
Realistically , Australia needs to win at least their two remaining home games , against Jordan and Iraq , to avoid third place and a succession of play-offs -- or even miss out completely on a place at a third consecutive World Cup .
But there has also been deep concern right up to board level at FFA over the Socceroos ' `` brand '' .
The players themselves were shown internal research last year charting their slide in the public conscience .
Though the switch to qualifying for the World Cup through Asia has produced a far longer and more challenging pathway , crucial fixtures have failed to engage with the public and there has been a knock-on effect on ticket sales .
It 's understood Gallop met Osieck earlier this year and made it clear he wanted regular performance reports from the veteran German coach , who under previous chief executive Ben Buckley had substantially more autonomy .
`` There are lots of exciting things happening , with the Young Socceroos going to the World Cup , the Socceroos on the verge of qualifying , a new Matildas regime , FFA taking over management of the AIS program and a new version of the national curriculum imminent , '' Boultbee said yesterday .
`` So it 's a pretty good time to refresh the national teams unit . ''
In A-League news , Brisbane Roar are poised to unveil the signing of former Manchester United and Perth midfielder Liam Miller .
Miller left Glory this month after failing to agree terms on a new deal .
It 's the end of an era ; NASA announced this week that it has shut down its last mainframe computer .
The last NASA mainframe , the IBM Z9 , was powered down at Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama earlier this month , Linda Cureton , NASA 's chief information officer , wrote in a blog post .
For those more familiar with smartphones and tablets , Cureton described a mainframe as `` a big computer that is known for being reliable , highly available , secure , and powerful . They are best suited for applications that are more transaction oriented and require a lot of input/output  that is , writing or reading from data storage devices . ''
Cureton started her career at NASA as a mainframe systems programmer out of Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland `` when it was still cool . '' She worked on an IBM 360-95 , which solved complex computational problems for space flight .
`` Back then , real systems programmers did hexadecimal arithmetic  today , 'there 's an app for it ! ' '' she joked . But , Cureton acknowledged , `` all things must change . ''
`` Even though NASA has shut down its last one , there is still a requirement for mainframe capability in many other organizations , '' she wrote . `` The end-user interfaces are clunky and somewhat inflexible , but the need remains for extremely reliable , secure transaction oriented business applications . ''
Last year , NASA also said goodbye to its shuttle program . In July , the Shuttle Atlantis completed its final journey to the International Space Station , bringing NASA 's 30-year shuttle program to a close . For more , see PCMag 's look back in the slideshow below .

Greens candidate dumped over Hazelwood row
Updated
The Greens have disendorsed one of their candidates for the Upper House seat of Eastern Region , three days before the Victorian election .
Cheryl Wragg , from the Latrobe Valley , was disendorsed last night in a row with Greens MP Greg Barber , over the proposed closure of the Hazelwood Power Station .
Ms Wragg will continue to appear on the Greens list on the ballot paper but says she will be running as an Independent .
She says Mr Barber 's proposal to close down the Hazelwood Power Station in four years will not work .
`` Mr Barber 's plan proposes to replace the 1,600 megawatt base-load generation of Hazelwood with 1,200 megawatts of photovoltaics , '' she said .
`` It just wo n't work . It 's technically incompetent . Mr Barber does n't seem to understand that base-load power needs to be there 24 hours a day . ''
Mr Barber says Greens candidates need to follow their party 's policies .
He says the policy to shut down Hazelwood relies on renewable energy and on Victorians reducing their power use .
`` There 's no doubt it 's challenging but we 'll need a lot of renewables , much of which is on the drawing board , but most importantly deep cuts to energy use through an energy efficiency program across the state , '' he said .

One takeaway from Trump 's inauguration speech : gangs
by Jon Rappoport
January 21 , 2017
I could list 10 interesting things Trump said yesterday . And of course , words are n't actions . Yet . But here is one remark you 're not going to get , and never did get , from any recent president :
“ Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities…And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential . This American carnage stops right here and stops right now . ”
To which Rachel Maddow ( MSNBC ) replied :
“ It was militant and it was dark . The crime , the gangs , the drugs , this ‘ American carnage , ' disrepair , decay . You ca n't imagine the outgoing president giving a speech like that . ”
She 's right , because the outgoing president never did anything to stop the carnage . If she thinks Trump 's language was too militant , she should try talking to mothers who live in those inner cities , who are trapped and held hostage by gangs , who want a nation of laws , and ca n't find a way to live safely with their children by eating Obamas 's high-flying empty rhetoric .
Obama somehow managed to spend eight years in the White House and never mention , with any significance , GANGS . Eight years…and nothing . Yet he was The One who was going rescue America 's inner cities .
Find an inauguration speech by any recent president in which the word GANGS appears .
Is the whole point of being presidential an avoidance of stark realities ? Is that what all the Rachel Maddows want ? They 're not living in those neighborhoods . They 're not up against the gangs and the crime and drugs every day and every night .
The truth is , it 's offensive for a president not to mention these things .
Did Attorneys General Eric Holder or Loretta Lynch go after gangs ? Did they raise a finger to stop this scourge ?
Did Obama form a plan and put it into action ?
Did any federal legislator or bureaucrat raise hell because gangs are controlling large swaths of inner cities ?
Did any major news outlet pound on this story month after month ?
Guess what ? When you add up gun crimes , killings , maimings , and drug overdoses in cities across America , you come to the door of gangs . That 's a shocking revelation millions of Americans already understand , but for some reason presidents are clueless .
Yesterday , though , Trump was n't clueless .
We 'll see what he actually does and does n't do , but he knows . And he talks .
Offended liberals take umbrage at his remarks , but as usual they prolong decimation and destruction , and they take the opportunity to fly their useless banners of care and concern and opt for solutions that are n't solutions . They want to look and sound good .
After all , they wanted to elect a president who played a major role in destroying an entire country for no reason ( Libya ) , and they did n't even blink at the horror . It was n't on their radar . That 's how much they really care .
( To read about Jon 's mega-collection , Exit From The Matrix , click here . )
If tomorrow , by some miracle , all gangs in America disappeared , and the communities they ruled came back to life , liberals would find a way to be offended . They would yell and scream . Because some injustice had n't been addressed . Because some reparation had n't been made .
Because they have an interminable itch that can never be scratched out of existence .
Behind all their pronouncements , they must be able to see victims , on whose blood they feed .
When they imagine individuals held hostage coming back to freedom and strength and self-propelled power in communities , liberated from the carnage of gangs , they see silver bullets moving toward their own vampiric hearts .

When it comes to paid maternity leave , the United States is in the postpartum dark ages .
One hundred and seventy-seven nations -- including Djibouti , Haiti and Afghanistan -- have laws on the books requiring that all women , and in some cases men , receive both income and job-protected time off after the birth of a child . But here , the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 provides only unpaid leave , and most working mothers do n't get to stay home with their newborns for the 12 weeks allowed by the law . Many are n't covered by the FMLA ; others ca n't afford to take unpaid time off . Some go back to work a few weeks after giving birth , and some go back after mere days .
The century-long battle for maternity leave in America is a story of missed opportunities and historical accidents , further slowed by activists ' miscalculations and some well-funded opposition . In other words : It did n't have to be this way .
As far back as 1919 , when the Model T was switching from a crank to an electric starter , the U.S. government came close to signing on to an International Labor Organization agreement , supported by 33 countries , that said women workers should receive cash benefits in addition to job-protected leave for 12 weeks in the period surrounding childbirth . That same year , Julia Lathrop , the chief of the Labor Department 's children 's bureau , issued a report on international maternity leave policy in which she decried the United States as `` one of the few great countries which as yet have no system of State or national assistance in maternity . '' She had recently returned from Europe , where Germany and France had paid-leave laws that had been in place for decades .
But this first real drive for maternity leave fell victim to petty infighting . Though many members of a key labor group wanted to include `` maternity insurance '' in its recommendations to Congress and President Woodrow Wilson , it was omitted after an internal dispute over who would be covered . Other early proponents of maternity benefits got tripped up by whether to insist that protections and income for pregnant women be part of national health coverage ( which , sadly , they seemed to think was around the corner ) .
At other times , history has intervened . When women flooded the workforce during World War II , the Labor Department 's women 's bureau recommended that women get six weeks of prenatal leave , as well as two months following childbirth . Then , just as pressure for change was mounting , the war ended , men returned home to reclaim their jobs , and the drive fizzled .
Politics have posed an even bigger obstacle . The debate over maternity leave has long served as a proxy for tensions surrounding the presence of women in the workplace . Remember that , until 1978 , it was legal in most states to fire women for becoming pregnant ; some conservatives defended the practice as a way to encourage women to return to the home .
But even some feminists objected to giving women job-protected time off around birth , because they felt that their gains were too precarious , and their determination to ascend from the pit of sex discrimination was too great , to risk drawing further attention to maternity . In the early 1970s , some women challenged school board policies requiring pregnant teachers to take maternity leave for several months before and after birth . So it was n't entirely surprising that , when Rep. Howard Berman ( D-Calif. ) spearheaded a national proposal for leave in 1984 , it encountered the same resistance .
`` Influential feminist activists in Washington opposed maternity leave because it was n't treating women the same as men , '' says Joan Williams , director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California at Hastings . `` They said : 'No , no , no . We do n't want national maternity leave . We want to fold maternity into other medical needs . ' ``
And that is what ultimately happened . During the decade or so when advocates pushed for what would become the Family and Medical Leave Act , their working definition of what leave should include shifted . At first , it applied only to mothers , then to new parents and later to all workers who need to care for family members . This change was good in that it allowed fathers to be more involved and helped broaden political support for leave legislation -- but it came at a price : The prospect of so many would-be leave-takers made business interests more aggressive than ever in their efforts to make sure that the time off would n't be paid .
`` In Europe , it 's parental leave , '' says Steven Wisensale , a professor of public policy at the University of Connecticut and the author of `` Family Leave Policy : The Political Economy of Work and Family in America . '' `` When you get into family leave and you 're suddenly concerned about caring for elderly people , it becomes a little more nebulous . ''
And so , after years of debate , during which Sen. Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) filibustered and President George H.W . Bush twice vetoed family leave legislation , the law President Bill Clinton finally signed in 1993 was so shrunken from its original form that it was barely recognizable .
Bootstrap 4 Beta 3
Welcome to the final beta of v4 ! It 's been over two months since we shipped our second beta and we 've been busy making the last breaking changes before moving to our next stable release , v4.0.0 ! We have a few more breaking changes than we were planning , but fret not , we 've detailed them all .
Beta 3 primarily focuses around our forms , but it also includes key fixes to tables , some global styles , our documentation , and some JavaScript bugs . Following this release , we 'll address a few issues and PRs before doing a stable v4 release a week or two into the New Year .
Let 's dive into all the highlights .
Breaking changes
As mentioned in our Beta 2 release , we needed to make a few more breaking changes in Beta 3 . We 've summarized them here and in our migration docs—be sure to read them !
Rewrote native and custom check controls . Both browsers default and custom checkboxes and radios now have simpler markup after removing the < input > from the < label > . Now , all checkboxes and radios have a parent < div > and sibling < input > and < label > pair . This is essential for form validation and disabled inputs because we can use the input 's state to style the label . In addition , custom checkbox and radio elements no longer have a .custom-control-indicator . This is generated from the new .custom-control-label .
Input groups were rewritten with specific .input-group- { prepend|append } classes . The new approach allows us to support validation styles and messages within input groups , while also adding support for custom selects , custom file inputs , and multiple .form-control s .
Responsive tables are once again parent classes to avoid accessiblity issues with changing a < table > 's display .
Deleted the .col-form-legend class , consolidating it 's styles into the .col-form-label class .
Read the Migration page for further details .
More highlights
In addition to the breaking changes , we 've addressed a few more general issues that may impact your project .
Restored cursor : pointer to non-disabled links , buttons , .close , navbar toggler , and pagination links .
Added a new vertically centered modal option with .modal-dialog-centered .
Added new dropleft and dropright variants for dropdowns in # 23860 .
Our npm package no longer includes any files other than our source and dist JavaScript and CSS files . If you previously relied on our running our scripts via the node_modules folder , you 'll need to update your build tools .
Print styles have moved to bottom of the import stack to properly override styles .
For more details on this release 's changes , take a look at the Beta 3 ship list issue , as well as the Beta 3 project . Be sure to join our official Slack room ! and dive into our issue tracker with bug reports , questions , and specific feedback whenever possible .
Coming up
Stable v4.0.0 is our next release and we already have a GitHub project board to track issues and PRs . There will be no breaking changes from Beta 3 to stable , so our changelog should be short and sweet . Expect some linting , Sass variable improvements , updated docs Examples , and more build tool improvements .
With our next release , the master branch will once again become our default branch . We 'll merge v4-dev into master , meaning v3 's source code will only be in our v3-dev branch and past releases .
See you again real soon !

@ mdo & team
Soon , you could make everything in your life smartphone-app-controllable—or at least the things that have wires . A California-based inventor has taken to Kickstarter to fund the launch of the latest evolution in `` maker '' technology—an Arduino-compatible microcontroller that 's small , fast , and cheap , with built-in wireless communications . The RFduino has already exceeded its Kickstarter goal nearly 30 times over , with 10 days to go before its deadline .
Based on a Nordic Semiconductor 32-bit ARM system-on-chip that has built-in support for Bluetooth 4.0 , the RFduino runs the same code as Arduino UNO and DUE boards , and it works with any type of sensor , servo , or other device that can communicate with an Arduino microcontroller . Bluetooth 4.0 's Bluetooth Low Energy ( BLE ) feature allows the microcontroller to run on power sources as small as a button-cell battery for some applications—and the team has developed a `` shield '' for the CR2032 battery , as well as single- and dual-AAA battery configurations . It can also run off a USB power source or can be wired directly to a 3-volt DC power source .
As a result , the RFduino could be used for a whole host of devices that interact with mobile devices , including remote controls , proximity-switch devices such as alarms , and home automation applications that control LED lighting . It could also allow devices programmed with Arduino `` sketches '' to interact with each other over Bluetooth 4.0—potentially allowing for the development of swarms of smart devices that can talk both to smartphones and notebook computers and their environments .
A number of open-source iOS applications have already been developed for the iPhone to interact with the RFduino , according to Armen Kazanchian , the man behind the company RF Digital , which developed the controller and a collection of accessory electronics to support it . In an e-mail exchange with Ars , Kazanchian said that all of the development so far on the Open RF project had been done by a team of four people , with Kazanchian as the project lead . The applications developed thus far will be open-sourced , as will the hardware ( the electronics designs for the RFduino itself , and for the various electronics `` shield '' add-ons developed to support it ) . The team is currently looking for a channel to publish both through .
Kazanchian , an electrical engineer with experience in the cellular , consumer electronics , aerospace , and industrial systems industries , founded RF Digital as a wireless electronic component design firm in 1999 . He said that in addition to the Kickstarter backers who have donated money to the project and the support from the Arduino `` maker '' community , there 's already commercial interest in using the component . `` We have quite a bit of interest from OEMs with mass-production volume uses and requirements for the RFduino and derivative implementations , '' he said .

IS IT really over ? In the middle of March investors were worried that the financial system was going to hell in a handcart . Analysts competed to produce the highest possible forecast for losses from the credit crunch . Just six weeks later , everything seems a lot calmer . Stockmarkets have stabilised and corporate credit spreads ( the excess interest rates paid by risky borrowers ) have come down sharply . Gold is cheaper . Bankers talk about having put the worst behind them . This week the Bank of England 's twice-yearly Financial Stability Report was cautiously optimistic ( see article ) and America 's Federal Reserve was relaxed enough to cut the pace of its monetary easing ( see article ) . Rates may even have reached the bottom .
Optimists can point to one big relief . When the Fed helped JPMorgan Chase to rescue Bear Stearns , it sent a signal to the markets—a kind of “ No Bank Left Behind ” Act . If the Fed was willing to save an investment bank , without any retail depositors , then the system would not be brought down by a “ plumbing problem ” , such as the collapse of a counterparty in the derivatives market . The boost to confidence has helped banks to repair their balance sheets by raising large sums from both shareholders and the bond markets . Maybe financial Armageddon had been avoided .
A sea of troubles
Maybe . But the fight ahead still looks bloody . Although the system as a whole is safer , plenty of problems remain for particular banks . In the money markets , the banks are still having to pay a high margin over official rates to borrow short-term money , despite the ingenious efforts of the Bank of England , European Central Bank and America 's Fed . Investors are still worried that banks could get into trouble . There is probably more troubling news to come on write-offs ; declared losses so far are well short of the $ 945 billion that the IMF estimated were the global losses from the crisis , much of it outside the banking system .
The malaise that started the crisis—the American housing market—is still getting worse . The month-on-month decline in the Case-Shiller index of house prices in 20 large cities is accelerating ; on the latest reckoning , it was down by 12.7 % over the 12 months to February 29th . As the decline continues , more homeowners will default on their loans .
And losses are now emerging in areas other than housing . After a long period with scarcely any bond defaults by companies , there have been 21 failures this year , according to Standard & Poor 's , a rating agency ; some 122 issuers , with debt of around $ 102 billion , are deemed vulnerable to default . Ominously , corporate debt is the shaky foundation for trillions of dollars of derivative contracts .
Consumers round the world are grappling with higher food and fuel prices . British house prices are now showing annual declines . Europe 's economies seem to be deteriorating . In April the Belgian business confidence indicator , a good gauge of the continent 's conditions , suffered the biggest decline in its 28-year history . Commercial property looks vulnerable , as do some emerging markets , especially in central and eastern Europe . And things are shaky in Japan , where industrial production declined more than 3 % in the latest month .
Imagine that you had fallen asleep last July and that you had been spared the dread words “ credit crunch ” and “ Bear Stearns ” . On waking today , you would be astonished at how low American interest rates had fallen ( especially in the light of headline inflation ) . But you would still be alarmed at the state of housing markets , the prospects for consumer spending and the trend in forecasts of economic growth . You would not assume that the worst was over . Nor should investors , just because they have had to live through it all .
One of Zoo Miami 's elephants died Tuesday for reasons that remain shrouded in mystery .
Lisa was an African elephant — a species of the largest animals walking the earth , considered vulnerable to extinction , according to conservation groups .
At 44 years old , Lisa was reaching the upper average limit of an elephant 's lifespan in captivity , said Ron Magill , spokesman for Zoo Miami . Elephants are one of the few species that do better living in the wild . They average 50 to 60 years in the wild compared with 35 to 45 years old in captivity , he said .
Still , Lisa 's death came as a shock to zoo personnel , Magill said .
Lisa , who weighed about 8,400 pounds , had been under close observation since July 12 , when zookeepers found her lying on her side in the Elephant Barn and had to help her back to her feet , Magill said . Elephants normally sleep standing up , although they are known to roll in mud .
“ We could never determine what caused her to lie down then , but then she got back to normal , ” Magill said .
She was found lying on her side again Tuesday afternoon and appeared to suffer some kind of seizure , he said .
Lisa arrived at Zoo Miami last year , after living nearly 40 years at the zoo in Norfolk , Va. She had been born in the wild .
Tests to determine the cause of death have been ordered , Magill said .
“ This is especially painful to the Zoo Miami community , ” Magill said . “ There are few places in the zoo where the bond between the keepers and the animal is closer . ”

SAN ANTONIO - A car with a manual transmission proved to be too difficult for a carjacking suspect , according to San Antonio police .
They said the suspect , who stole the car at knifepoint early Friday morning , was not able to drive the car from the scene on the city 's West Side .
The car owner told police that the suspect forced him to drive him to a location in the 200 block of Mickel John Street .
The victim said he was arguing with a woman outside a gas station on Culebra Road around 1:30 a.m. when another man approached him , demanded his car at knifepoint , then apologized for the carjacking .
He said the suspect quickly realized that he could n't drive off with the vehicle , himself , because of its manual transmission . He said the suspect forced him into the car and told him to drive .
According to an officer , the victim was able to jump out of the vehicle at one point and call police . Officers went to Mickel John Street and arrested the suspect .
Police said the suspect suffered minor injuries during his arrest . They said they had to restrain him in handcuffs while he was being treated by paramedics because he would n't settle down .
He faces several charges , possibly including kidnapping .

China is in the process of developing sophisticated reconnaissance satellites that will allow it to support tactical military operations , a new analysis to be published by the Journal of Strategic Studies says .
‘ China may already be able to match the United States ' ability to image a known , stationary target and will likely surpass it in the flurry of launches planned for the next two years , ' notes Reuters , which gained an advance copy of the report .
‘ The most immediate and strategically disquieting application is a targeting and tracking capability in support of the anti-ship ballistic missile , which could hit US carrier groups…With space as the backbone , China will be able to expand the range of its ability to apply force while preserving its policy of not establishing foreign military bases . '
The timing of the report is interesting – and slightly awkward for Gen. Chen Bingde , the chief of the general staff of the People 's Liberation Army . The same day Reuters reported news of the analysis , Chen was lecturing the United States over its military spending .
During a news conference with his US counterpart , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen , Chen said : ‘ I know the United States is still recovering from the financial crisis , and still has some difficulties in its economy . …It would be a better thing if the United States did not spend so much money on the military . '
China has , of course , been boosting defence spending at double-digit pace for a decade , but Chen was quick to argue that this was only a case of China making up for underinvestment . China 's estimated military spending for this year is expected to come in at less than $ 100 billion , compared with the United States ' about $ 550 billion .
Still , Mullen expressed concern over ‘ some very specific capabilities…that are very focused on the United States ' capability . '
‘ What I have spoken with my counterpart about before and certainly seek to discuss again , ' Mullen told reporters , ‘ is a better understanding of what the strategic intent and the strategic thrust is . '
Most of Zimbabwe 's white farmers were stripped of their land in often violent evictions that started in 2000 . Now the remaining white farmers are on edge because of threats of new evictions linked to the country 's long-running political turmoil .
Mandi Chimene , a newly appointed provincial governor for Manicaland province , said at a rally this past weekend that she had evicted white farmers from 12 farms in the Headlands district alone , claiming they were being protected by the former vice president 's faction . Joice Mujuru was ousted from the ruling party congress in December after falling out of favor with the president and his wife .
Another newly appointed governor , Joe Biggie Matiza of Mashonaland East province , said he will take similar action by the end of this month .
However , human rights advocate and political analyst Gabriel Shumba said that linking the evictions to the Mujuru faction “ is just political expediency by those seeking to evict them. ” Shumba said , “ White farmers are caught up because they are in possession of an asset that is in demand . ”
{ snip }
Douglas Mombeshora , the lands minister , recently said black farmers can enter into joint venture with partners of other races . But vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa later delivered a conflicting message , warning of more evictions of white farmers . President Robert Mugabe has often spoken against joint farming partnerships between blacks and whites .
There are fewer than 300 white farmers out of the original total of 4,500 , according to the Commercial Farmers Union . { snip }

WASHINGTON — Do n't count Ron Paul out .
That 's the warning from election experts watching the race for the GOP 's nomination , who say that Paul has the money and fiercely loyal support to stage an upset at the crucial Iowa caucuses .
“ There 's a strong loyalty to him , ” Iowa pollster Ann Selzer told The Post .
“ You ca n't write him off . You have to say he 's building the kind of organization that can succeed . ”
And finishing strong in that contest could help him rake in more votes in later primaries , she said .
The Texas Republican has a strong ability to raise campaign cash , has been on the air with more than $ 1 million in TV ads in Iowa and is building a nationwide organization .
The latest Iowa State University poll has Paul at 20 percent , second only to Herman Cain .
But two other metrics show that Paul leads among voters who say their minds are made up , and is tied with ex-Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney among people who say they would definitely show up on caucus night .
Paul is also getting more attention in the debates .
In Wednesday night 's contest , Paul was at the center of many of the foreign-policy discussions and got to speak for a total of nearly 10 minutes , nearly as much time as Romney .
In an interesting article on CounterPunch , Nikolas Kozloff examines Carville 's ties to South America and his subsequent ties to the very company that ( partially ) caused the oil spill he crows about on TV . With Kozloff reporting that a job in Bolivia - also connected to BP , as I will explain in a bit - netted about $ 30,000 a month for the man , it 's not hard to imagine why he did n't have a problem with the company before this .
Somewhat strangely , after Clinton 's presidency , Carville became an international political consultant . In what could probably be described as some weird new kind of imperialism , he brought American style politics ( including reverence for a corporatist `` free market '' and militarism ) to campaigns as diverse as Tony Blair 's in the UK , Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis ' , the President of Panama 's , and now the establishment candidate 's in Colombia , among others . As it is described on the website of `` Democracy Corp , '' the consulting firm Carville is part of :
Carville also has international campaign experience , having worked as a political advisor to Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis and done political work in Central and South America .
Kozloff goes into detail about Carville 's various stints in South and Central America , talking first about his role in Panama , then Argentina , Ecuador , Bolivia , and now Colombia . Aside from the highly questionable ethics of what Carville is doing ( because of the fundamental undemocratic nature of it , among other aspects ) , his work in Colombia and Bolivia is of particular interest .
To back up a step , let 's just look at a few things Carville has said about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill ...
`` I do know , for too long , they were taking BP 's word for everything which turned out to be wrong at every junction . It 's all turned out on the wrong side ... I think the president has to address the nation . His legacy depends on what happens with the oil in the Gulf of Mexico . ''

In Bolivia , Carville helped a president who was - at least for Bolivian politics , where the strong socialist Evo Moralez is now president - very favorable to `` free markets , '' Gonzalo Sánchez de Losada . A 2004 piece in the Nation gives a brief overview of how Bolivia 's relationship with the oil industry has progressed since then , from the perspective of examining a referendum that was passed repealing the privatization laws of Carville 's candidate :
Early returns indicated an 80 percent majority in favor of repealing the existing hydrocarbons law pushed in the 1990s by the hated Sánchez de Lozada ( or `` Goni '' ) , whose political consultants were the star liberal Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg and former presidential campaign manager James Carville . The Washington-based Greenberg firm represents British Petroleum , one of the multinationals with billions invested in Bolivia . BP supported the referendum , along with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank , as did US Embassy officials , because the possible alternative -- an Indian-led revolution -- was even worse .
Now in Colombia , Carville actually helped a candidate who might be friendly to BP 's offshore drilling - because of his friendliness to , as Kozloff says , `` foreign investment '' - at the same time he has become such a presence in the US media over the oil spill in the Gulf .
To briefly summarize the Colombian election , held yesterday , from an American perspective : the militaristic and relatively capitalist candidate Juan Manuel Santos was the candidate of the establishment and the favorite of current president Uribe . But Green Party candidate Antanas Mockus , who was previously part of a line of very successful mayors of Bogotá , unexpectedly surged in the polls in the past few months , actually overtaking Santos for a while . In a field of nine candidates , yesterday Santos received about 46 % of the vote while Mockus got about 21 % , meaning that there will be a June 20 runoff . Mockus is viewed as a kind of anti-politician politician , and will be the first Green Party head of state anywhere in the world if elected .
So . Back to James Carville , who has been consulting Santos . Here , Kozloff explains it much better than I could :
All of this prior history is now being brought to bear on Colombia , where Carville in his role as political confidant once again stands to play an influential role . In Colombia , as in Bolivia , energy companies loom large . Recently , Bogotá has militarily taken on guerrilla forces and undertaken measures to make the investment climate more promising for foreign oil corporations . As a result , the country has seen rising petroleum investment , and currently BP is a key player in Colombia . A company which has already accumulated a sordid environmental and human rights track record in Colombia , BP is -- -incredibly -- - thinking about commencing exploratory drilling in offshore Colombian oil blocs . Colombia needs to give BP the boot if it wants to avert disasters like the one in the Gulf , yet it 's by no means clear that Carville 's man Santos is the one to take on the oil industry . An establishment politician who favors the military and foreign investment , Santos would seem to be an unlikely environmental champion . His opponent , Antanas Mockus , is no radical either and it 's not clear whether he would usher in an environmental revolution in Colombia . However , if Mockus was victorious he would be the first Green Party president in the world . A politician who wants to restore integrity and legality to Colombian politics , Mockus is therefore more likely to rein in Big Oil .
I am not writing this in order to defend President Obama . In fact , I agree to a certain extent with James Carville on Obama 's handling of the situation . And if Obama had been more concerned about this problem before the spill occurred , then maybe it would n't have happened . I do not blame Obama entirely , either . The message of this is not that Obama is at fault or James Carville is entirely wrong - it is that James Carville is a hypocritical political power player who really does not care about ordinary people . His hypocrisy is emblematic of many of those in power , those who put their own self-interest above the good of the people of the world . Even if Carville has genuinely started to come around since he 's been personally affected by the oil spill , then that just proves that he is selfish enough not to realize the consequences of what he was doing .
Carville 's brand of international corporate-dominated politics is exactly what allowed the BP disaster to occur . And now Carville has the cajones to not only continue practicing this work , but to do it at the same time that he is condmening the exact same company which he is , in reality , helping . As long as our politics is dominated by hypocrites like Carville , we wo n't see an end to disasters like the Deepwater Horizon spill .
TV ratings company Nielsen is to change its definition of what constitutes television viewing , according to the Hollywood Reporter . This would mean that data from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Instant Video , viewed on devices from set-top boxes to the PlayStation 3 , would be included in Nielsen 's ratings . A committee made up of representatives from TV networks and advertisers reportedly agreed to the changes at a meeting in New York on Tuesday .
Nielsen has been working on the necessary analytics technology for a while , with pilot programs studying Hulu , Netflix , and YouTube streaming , as well as with cable companies ' tablet applications . The Hollywood Reporter 's sources say that Nielsen plans to roll out new hardware and software in the 23,000 American homes it draws its data from this September .
Initially , only a limited amount of data will be taken from tablets , such as the iPad — the primary focus is said to be on set-top boxes and game consoles . Nielsen has reportedly targeted the end of this year as a goal for measuring iPad figures . The ultimate goal is `` to capture video viewing of any kind from any source . ''
Update : The Los Angeles Times has now confirmed both the new additions and the fall rollout , with CBS chief research officer David Poltrack saying `` It is imperative for us that Nielsen as soon as possible incorporate these new forms of distribution into the overall measurement system . ''
An Online Advertising Guide
Posted by Steve Spalding in Featured | View comments
If you operate a blog , have built a web app or are otherwise are trying to monetize a property on the web , advertising is one of the first paths that you might amble down . Let 's throw the baby in with the bathwater and say that ads will be your primary method of monetizing your idea . In that case you might need to be a little more sophisticated . This guide will step you through the process of finding the right advertisers for your site , and maximizing your revenue potential .
Types of revenue models from advertising
CPA
Cost Per Action ( Affiliate ) programs are sold through marketplaces like Commission Junction . These advertisements usual marked by high ( sometimes very high ) payouts , but the downside is that in order to make any money at all — users have to purchase the product or services from the advertising company through your site .
Typically , these types of ads perform best on high volume sites with services that compliment the product that the advertiser is trying to sell . If your site is about concert reviews , a Ticketmaster Affiliate program will perform a lot better than if your site was about Model Trains . If your site has no particular focus , Affiliates are going to be a hard sell .
I would suggest trying them out but realize that many , many times these will make you no money at all .
CPC
Cost Per Click advertisement is the first stop for many entrepreneurs looking for a way to monetize . Google Adsense is the most well known CPC vendor . The benefits of CPC are that these ad blocks are easy to set up , and they can potentially generate revenue even at small levels of traffic .
The downside to CPC advertising is that the revenue it generates is uneven because it strongly depends on ad placement location and niche your service operates in . Certain industries ( typically those that sell high ticket products and services ) can do really well under this model but many will find themselves with an inventory full of really low paying ads .
Typically , CPC is a good place to start until you get your feet wet ; however , unless it 's consistently successful for you it does not scale as well as other options .
CPM
Cost Per A Thousand advertising are what networks like Casale Media and Tribal Fusion deal in . You are paid per impression instead of for each click . Typically , for web services with high volume but relatively low engagement , this is a great option for monetization .
Not only do these networks often pay more than CPC advertising , but your payment is directly related to the number of pageviews that you get to your site . This makes it a lot easier to predict your advertising revenue from month to month .
The biggest drawbacks are that many of the good networks are difficult to get into , and the bad networks offer CPMs that are too low to be a viable revenue model . I suggest constantly shop around for better CPMs . As you grow and your audience becomes more engaged , you should be looking for networks that are willing to pay you more for that engagement .
Boutiques
BlogAds , Federated Media , and The Deck are three examples of boutique ad networks . Typically , these companies focus their attention on specific verticals and have extremely high standards in the sites that they let in . As a result , the CPMs that they pay are often substantially higher than similarly positioned networks .
In order to be considered for one of these networks , you will either have to have a service that is high profile , targets a very specific niche or extremely high volume . Since these are premium advertisers , they might also have stricter rules about how their ads can be displayed .
Usually , by the time you are ready to apply for a Boutique ad network your real question will be whether you want to outsource your sales or handle them yourself . If you decide that doing sales internally is not in your best interest , these networks are an excellent source of revenue .
Direct Sales
If you have the team , the time , and the patience the best way to make money off of ads is selling them yourself . Not only do you not have to pay an ad network a portion of what you make , but you also have complete control over how the ads will be presented and what type of advertisers that you choose to take on .
It sounds great but the big thing to remember is that selling advertising is not easy . Everything from identifying potential advertisers , to determining a price point that makes sense for your customers to providing them with the details of how well their ad is doing takes time . When you are a young company , that time might be better spent taking care of more pressing problems .
If you are ready to invest in an ad sales team , the biggest thing to remember is that advertisers pay premiums for strong verticals , high click through rate and exclusivity . When building your package , try to have one or more of these “ features ” as a part of it .
Understanding key terms
When shopping around for an advertising network , there are three phrases you will hear a lot . Understanding the distinction between them will save you time , effort and lost revenue .
Ad network
Examples : Adsense , Adbrite , Bidvertisers .
An ad network serves ads in a format as determined by their technology . Take a look at the three examples that I gave , you will see that each of them has a particular format of ads that they carry — whether it is Adsense 's contextual model or Adbrite 's marketplace , each network brings to the table both the technology and the creative to serve with it . Typically , ad networks have no problem filling your inventory and they pay out on a cost per click or cost per action basis .
Ad servers
Examples : Doubleclick ( DART ) , Right Media , Atlas
An ad server is a “ capsule ” that tracks and displays ads . It is neither an ad network nor is it a rep agency , it 's a piece of software . Ad servers allow you to track the number of impressions you are serving , analyze the demographic data surrounding it and control which networks and rep agencies get impressions . The better ad servers let you target your campaigns by a number of psychogaphic and demographic criteria . There are a few good free ad serving solutions available ( OpenAds for instance ) , however , if serving ads will be a serious part of your business ( and you have the minimum required pageviews ) you should look into purchasing DART or Atlus .
Rep Agency
Examples : Technorati Media , Federated Media , and Gorilla Nation
We often use the words ad network when we mean to say rep agency , there is a significant difference .
A rep agency is a company that acts as a broker between publishers and agencies . In exchange for getting deals with major brand advertisers ( Netflix , Fritos , Pepsi etc . . . ) they take a portion of the revenue ( anywhere between 30-60 % ) . Rep agencies can be extraordinarily beneficial because they have well connected sales teams who can land deals that many small companies can not . The good ones have an inside track with the major ad agencies , and they control a substantial volume of impressions — which makes it easier for them to get agencies to the table . Most large web properties , even those capable of doing direct sales will sell a portion of their inventory through rep agencies . It simplifies sales cycles and ensures that everyone “ gets an ad. ” Since every impression served from a rep agency represents a “ sale , ” these networks typically have a harder time filling inventory than ad networks .
The advertising chain
Setting up a set of campaigns for a large site means understanding the advertising chain . No one provider will be able to fill all of your available advertising inventory with the highest paying ads . How do you solve this ? You chain a bunch of different providers together . Applications like the Rubicon Project and Pubmatic exist to make this easier , but you can do it on your own with a little bit of work .
Direct sales
This represents the most expensive ads in your stable . These are ads sold by your sales team . Typically the rate in which these ads are displayed are determined by contract you have with the advertiser . In most cases these will exist near the top of your chain and will take up anywhere from 30 to 60 % of your inventory .
Rep Agency sales
Next down the line come your high quality rep agencies . The rule of thumb is to pick the one with the highest CPM and fill rate to exist at the top , and plug in other networks as passbacks . A passback is an additional provider that will be given an opportunity to serve an ad should the provider further up the chain be unable to . At this point you should have taken care of 20 or 30 % more of your inventory , enough to finish the chain using . . .
Ad Networks
If you still have unsold inventory , do n't be afraid to throw in an ad network like Adsense . Under the right conditions , these networks can generate a substantial amount of revenue and just as importantly , they rarely ever have a problem with fill . Do n't give up on trying to fill your inventory using providers further up the chain though , typically ad networks provide lower quality , more generic ads than either direct sales or rep agencies .
Here is an example of an advertising chain :
Ad server : DART
Toshiba ( Direct Sale )
Netflicks ( Direct Sale )
Technorati Media ( Rep Agency )
Tribal Fusion ( Passback )
Blue Lithium ( Passback )
Adsense ( Ad Network )
Making money from ads on the web is a balancing act . Always , you are trying to maintain the highest possible CPM while still filling out your inventory . To do this requires experimentation and a little bit of patience . Never be afraid to keep trying , the more work you are willing to put into it , the more money you are likely to get out of it .

South Africa 's Tokyo Sexwale is slogging it out to become chief of world football with five other candidates at next year 's election . While he remains an outside contender for the presidency , his manifesto talks a good game . By ANTOINETTE MULLER .
The Fifa presidential race is on . South Africa 's Tokyo Sexwale is one of five candidates who will contest next year 's elections , which will be held in February . Although many consider Sexwale one of the outsiders , his manifesto does make for interesting reading . Not that anyone cares for manifestos in the wheeling and dealing world of Fifa elections , but it does give us some idea of what the candidates are all about .
Sexwale is one of the few candidates who have published a manifesto thus far . It makes for good reading , and you can find the six key points below . However , there are some crucial issues he has not addressed . Sexwale has not , for example , said whether he would agree to have his salary disclosed or whether he would be open the idea to non-executive directors on the executive committee . He does not address anti-corruption at all , a worrying oversight considering an avalanche of corruption is exactly what led to this sordid saga in the first place . He also did not mention how he would approach conflict of interest issues . Still , if you can gloss over a few typos – the Bernabéu , the home ground of Spanish football 's Real Madrid , was written as “ Benebeau ” , for example – Sexwale has some good ideas in this document :
He 's considering advertising on national team jerseys
Some consider this a slightly controversial point , but it 's simply keeping in line with modern day sport . Currently , advertising on jerseys is only allowed at club level , and it is not for international teams . Sexwale argues that allowing advertising on jerseys will help boost the coffers of associations . He states : “ There is space there for much value worth millions of dollars which will be destined directly into FAs coffers ! ”
Yes , that is a direct quote , complete with the exclamation mark for emphasis on how exciting such a logical solution to boosting profits make him .
He vows to fight for more World Cup places for Africa
Despite having more members than any other Confederation , Africa only gets five spots at World Cups . Europe gets 13 . Sexwale succinctly says : “ After 111 years of its existence , FIFA needs to take a hard look , with sensitivity , at these imbalances – not in opposition to any grouping but in favour of football . ”
The same goes for the lopsided figures of confederations at the executive committee . This is one of the smartest moves of his election . The general feeling in the footballing world is that Europeans has run the game for long enough . It might not enough to win him the election , but it does show that he is in touch with the lack of balance in power currently plaguing Fifa .
He makes a special mention for women 's football
You can not really accuse Sexwale of paying lip service here since there are not exactly many women in powerful positions to woo . However , he does acknowledge the role women 's football play in the global scheme of things both on the field and in the boardroom , and says that he will “ labour tireless ” for the development of the women 's game . It 's quite a nice change from Dear Leader Sepp 's suggestion that “ maybe women should play in tighter clothing ” .
Vowing to continue the fight against trafficking
It is one of footballing 's issues that is not talked about nearly enough and yet , it is one of the most damning . The trafficking of young children under the pretences of turning them into “ football stars ” is a serious problem . The BBC has reported on the issue , revealing that children as young as 14 are being sent to Laos to play at unregistered academies . The clubs then aim to profit from the sale of the players when they get older , and investigators believe that this was just one of many cases . Fifa is seriously struggling to cope with the issue and has been silent on it for far too long . That Sexwale has acknowledged and highlighted it is a good thing : “ Children , football 's grassroots , are future stars of the game and should be protected . Zero tolerance , in collaboration with law enforcement agencies , shall be undertaken against the abhorrent child trafficking practises for severe criminal action against perpetrators . ”
Stamping out racism
No surprise here . Sexwale has served on Fifa 's anti-racism and anti-discrimination committees . Fifa 's approach towards racism has been underwhelming to say the least , so it 's no surprise that Sexwale is looking to ramp things up . He 's not entirely clear on the sanctions and fines he might impose on offenders , but does say what he has in mind to investigate and police matters better . Under his watch , the Anti-Racism Task Force will be elevated to a FIFA Standing Committee , chaired by one of the FIFA Vice Presidents along with himself .
Adding a personal touch
“ Every FA 's President will have direct tele-contact with myself . They need not bang the door to see their own FIFA President on very serious matters , ” Sexwale writes in his manifesto . It 's a nice touch indeed , but probably not the kind of thing that 's going to win him an election . DM

PinkNews Exclusive
The Liberal Democrat leader has called on GPs to routinely test new patients for HIV .
Sir Vince Cable says the tests should become commonplace in high prevalence areas in a bid to cut the number of people do not know their status .
The comments come after a report by Public Health England showed a one fifth fall in gay and bisexual men diagnosed with HIV during 2016 .
New figures show a 21 % fall in new HIV infections among men who have sex with men ( MSM ) and a fall of 18 % among the UK population in general .
Sir Vince Cable told PinkNews : “ Whilst it is very welcome that new HIV diagnoses are down for gay and bisexual men in London we must not be complacent in our battle against HIV or ignore the wider picture .
“ It has killed too many people and ruined too many lives .
“ There have been extraordinary strides in HIV prevention and awareness that is now seeing clear results in the gay community , but there is still more the government can do .
“ For example , routine HIV tests when you register with a GP or are admitted to hospital is still not common practice in high prevalence areas .
“ Too many people are still completely unaware that they are living with HIV and this has to change .
“ The Liberal Democrats will therefore continue to advocate for a more proactive approach to tackling HIV and continue our fight to ensure the government makes Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) for HIV prevention available on the NHS . ”
Sir Vince 's comments back guidance by the British HIV Association that people living in high-prevalence areas for HIV infections should be routinely offered an HIV test when they register with a GP or are admitted to hospital .
An investigation found 82 % of high prevalence areas were failing to offer HIV tests in accordance with the guidelines , while 70 % did not fund HIV testing at all GP surgeries .
The significant fall in new infections has been called “ the most exciting development in the UK HIV epidemic in 20 years ” by Public Health England .
EXPLAINED : What is PrEP and where can I get it ?
Their report credits access to PrEP , an HIV prevention pill , with the decline in new infections , saying there “ will be further strengthened with the implementation of the PrEP Impact Trial over the next three years . ”
An NHS England spokesperson said : “ The new figures out today show that NHS investment in HIV prevention is paying off .
“ High rates of effective treatment in people with diagnosed HIV , our Treatment as Prevention policy which ensures that people receive treatment to protect HIV negative partners and our major intervention with PrEP , which will be up and running by the end of this month , will supercharge these increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . ”
The decline in HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men is particularly focused in parts of London , where diagnoses decreased by 29 % from 1,554 in 2015 to 1,096 in 2016 .
Outside of London , the fall was 11 % among this group .
Despite the good news , the number and proportion of diagnoses made at a late stage of HIV infection remains high , particularly among heterosexual men and women .
32 % of gay and bisexual men were diagnosed at a late stage , while the number was almost double for heterosexual men at 60 % .
Late diagnosis is associated with a higher risk of short term mortality and increased risk of onward transmission , since those diagnosed late have been unaware of their HIV infection for around three to five years .
How would you like it if you have some stranger snapped your picture while you were out and about and then used that photo to find out your real name and other information about you ?
FindFace facial recognition may not be brand new , but the app boasts of a 70 % accuracy as in snap a photo of a stranger and then find out who that person is via their social media profile . For now , it works with VK , which is like a Russian version of Facebook , but it has been downloaded 500,000 times since February and has searched about three million photos .
“ With this algorithm , you can search through a billion photographs in less than a second from a normal computer , ” FindFace co-founder Alexander Kabakov told The Guardian . Talking about how the app could revolutionize dating , he added :
“ If you see someone you like , you can photograph them , find their identity , and then send them a friend request . It also looks for similar people . So you could just upload a photo of a movie star you like , or your ex , and then find 10 girls who look similar to her and send them messages . ”
If that 's not creepy enough for you , then there 's the Orwellian aspect of law enforcement and retail being the “ real money-spinner ” for the face recognition technology .
NTech Lab , which created FindFace , “ upstaged ” over 100 other facial recognition algorithms in the University of Washington 's MegaFace challenge by achieving a 73.3 % accuracy on one million faces ; it even beat Google 's “ FaceNet ” which had previously reached a 99.63 % accuracy level ( pdf ) in different testing .
After winning the competition , NTech suggested its face recognition technology could be used by law enforcement “ to search for and identify possible or wanted criminals using streaming video cameras , ” or used by customs to identify people on watchlists , or to “ verify and monitor ” fans in real-time such as at sporting or entertainment events .
Since winning MegaFace , law enforcement has shown an interest . Russian police are using the technology in a pilot program via Moscow 's video camera network to search for criminals . NTech co-founder Alexander Kabakov told The Guardian , “ It 's nuts : there were cases that had seen no movement for years , and now they are being solved . ”
Sometimes it seems like face recognition is everywhere , used for social media sites and even at Church . The NSA has intercepted “ millions ” of photos daily and fed the “ facial recognition quality images ” into its facial recognition programs . The FBI was supposed to have 52 million photos in its NGI face recognition database by 2015 and was reportedly populating the database with photos snapped in the field . Face recognition is used by other law enforcement agencies such as police in Boston and San Diego .
The thing about FindFace is that it is not only fast , but it requires less computational resources than most facial recognition solutions ; by lowering the computational costs , the Observer suggested , “ N-Tech could make it feasible for the authorities to log everyone , just in case . Like the cops already do with license plates . ”
Some people may find it really cool , but it 's already proved handy for stalking . Russian art school student Egor Tsvetkov took photos of strangers sitting across from him on the subway and then published his “ Your face is big data ” project ; acting “ like a Web stalker , ” he linked the strangers ' photos to their VK profiles . Tsvetkov said that in theory , FindFace “ could be used by a serial killer or a collector trying to hunt down a debtor . ”
Immediately afterwards , the 2chan Russian imageboard launched a campaign using FindFace and VK to deanonymize and dox porn actresses . In the wrong hands , a tool like FindFace could be a death sentence for dissidents and victims of domestic abuse .
The idea of strangers or law enforcement using a face recognition app that requires little computational power to put a name to your face for no reason other than they want to ? That should raise your privacy hackles . It may not be the only face recognition tech in the game , but it could spell an end to anonymity in public , open the door for harassment by strangers and put countless people at risk .
However , some people like Dr. Alec Couros , who have been an “ indirect victim of catfishing , ” would like for FindFace to be more widely available . He told The Observer , “ If Facebook actually publicly used the tool , well … watch their user count drop like crazy. ” Couros used FindFace to identify over 20 fake VK profiles using his pictures .
When Kasperksy Lab tested FindFace , it even identified a Kaspersky employee who does n't post any photos in any social networks ; someone had posted his picture on a different social network and another user stole it and used it as his profile picture .
Kaspersky said FindFace “ successfully found 9 of 10 test ‘ victims ' in the office. ” A positive note was that FindFace was two or three times less accurate if you take photos of strangers from a distance in the subway . If you crop and zoom , however , FindFace works again .
If a photo is taken during daylight , “ with an average smartphone , ” then it would be good enough to work for FindFace . If you do n't want to be “ detected literally by any stranger with a phone , ” then Kaspersky suggested deleting old photos from VK accounts , or trying to shield your face such as by wearing a hoodie .
From his upper-class perch , Jim Saccomano wants Broncos fans who are n't season ticket holders to know just how much pain he 's in this morning :
Hard for those who are not with team or are season tix holders who never miss a game to fully comprehend the personal sting of loss ... — Jim Saccomano ( @ broncos_sacco ) November 25 , 2013
Are you f # $ king kidding me , Sacco ?
Get a clue . This man-in-the-arena tune you keep whistling in your echo chamber sounds like crap out here in the real world ; it 's about as insulting as it gets .
For those of us who make it to one or two games a year , your arrogance is only eclipsed by the delusion that you actually strap it on each Sunday .
You like to say you 've been in the PR game forever . Apparently , forever is n't long enough ...
Read our related editorial : The credit crunch could be a boon for irrational belief
WHILE many institutions collapsed during the Great Depression that began in 1929 , one kind did rather well . During this leanest of times , the strictest , most authoritarian churches saw a surge in attendance .
This anomaly was documented in the early 1970s , but only now is science beginning to tell us why . It turns out that human beings have a natural inclination for religious belief , especially during hard times . Our brains effortlessly conjure up an imaginary world of spirits , gods and monsters , and the more insecure we feel , the harder it is to resist the pull of this supernatural world . It seems that our minds are finely tuned to believe in gods .
Religious ideas are common to all cultures : like language and music , they seem to be part of what it is to be human . Until recently , science has largely shied away from asking why . “ It 's not that religion is not important , ” says Paul Bloom , a psychologist at Yale University , “ it 's that the taboo nature of the topic has meant there has been little progress . ”

The origin of religious belief is something of a mystery , but in recent years scientists have started to make suggestions . One leading idea is that religion is an evolutionary adaptation that makes people more likely to survive and pass their genes onto the next generation . In this view , shared religious belief helped our ancestors form tightly knit groups that cooperated in hunting , foraging and childcare , enabling these groups to outcompete others . …
If you want to know what exactly Apple 's iCloud Drive is and does , you 've come to the right place .
Apple is great with hardware and software interfaces , but as you likely know , it 's stumbled a bit in the past when it comes to cloud storage , photo management , and even music social networks ( though more recently , with Apple Music , it seems to be doing alright in that department ) .
Anyway , iCloud Drive is the company 's latest effort at giving you better ways to manage all your files . Apple 's iCloud Drive is an online storage service ; a place to keep all your files and access them from across all your Apple devices , including your iPhone , iPad , and Mac . It might sound complicated , but thankfully , it 's not too hard to understand .
Apple , in our opinion , has hit a home run with iCloud Drive . Our only complaint is that it still takes guides like this for people to figure out how to enable it , pick a storage plan , access their files , and so on .
iCloud Drive is part of iCloud - Apple 's cloud storage service that launched in 2011 .
iCloud Drive lets you save photos , videos , documents , music , and app data to iCloud . Not only does it let you store all your stuff in one place , but it lets you access all of your files and data from your iOS device , Mac , and Windows PC , and then keep those files and folders up to date across all your devices . It even allows you to create new files and folders from iCloud-enabled apps and work on the same file across multiple apps . Simples .
Note : iCloud Drive also works with iCloud.com . You can use it to create , save , and share documents using Pages , Numbers , and Keynote . This support page has more information about how to get started with iCloud.com
When you sign up for iCloud , you get 5 GB of free storage for Mail , Backup , iCloud Photo Library , and iCloud Drive . The backup part includes the backup of your iOS devices and it 's often this that sees you reach your limit - especially if you have a lot of photos on , say , an iPhone and an iPad .

Ulster 's Democratic Unionist Party , which is expected to prop up Theresa May 's minority government over the coming months , has spurned Tory Remainers who hoped they would force the Prime Minister to ask the EU for a so-called ‘ Soft Brexit ' .
According to ITV 's Robert Peston , a source within the DUP “ was very keen to be quoted ” as saying that his party “ completely backs [ May 's ] vision of Brexit ” – and not that of her Chancellor of the Exchequer , Philip Hammond .
While both May and Hammond campaigned for a Remain vote during the EU referendum , the Prime Minister has subsequently endorsed what supporters call a “ Clean Brexit “ , taking Britain out of the bloc 's Single Market and its associated Free Movement regime , as well as the Customs Union which precludes member-states from conducting an independent trade policy .
Remain diehards , who want a ‘ Soft Brexit ' in which Britain would remain party to the Single Market and Customs Union in order to maintain the closest possible links to the European Union , term this a “ Hard ” or “ Extreme ” Brexit .
Hammond 's team at HM Treasury – the engine room of the Remain campaign 's ‘ Project Fear ‘ under his predecessor George Osborne – are said to have entered “ street-fighting mode ” as he canvasses support for such a deal .
DUP backs Theresa May 's vision of Brexit , not Philip Hammond 's – ITV News https : //t.co/am8htKLfJD — Robert Peston ( @ Peston ) June 15 , 2017
If Peston 's source is reliable , however , it seems the ‘ Soft Brexit ' faction have lost crucial leverage . It had been claimed that the DUP , which is keen to see a minimum of economic friction between Ulster and the Irish Republic after Brexit , would at least back their calls for Britain to stay in the Customs Union .
The ITV presenter has been led to believe that the DUP is “ 100 per cent committed to the UK leaving the Single Market AND the Customs Union ” – having preferred to use its bargaining power to press for plans to introduce means-testing for the winter fuel allowance and scrap the pensions triple lock to be dropped .
Leavers within the Government are predicting ferocious resistance to Brexit from without the Cabinet as well as within , with one minister predicting “ utterly bitter , trench warfare ” as opposition politicians and Tory rebels “ fight us line by line , in committees , on the floor and in the Lords , for months and months on end . ”
Prior to the Philadelphia Eagles ' first OTA practice on Tuesday , Doug Pederson stated three veteran players were not in attendance : Fletcher Cox , Jason Peters , and Donnie Jones . Indeed , all three of those players were not seen at practice .
But there was a fourth veteran Eagles player who was curiously absent from Eagles practice : Marcus Smith . At the timing of this post , there 's been no official explanation for Smith 's absence , but the “ early word ” is that Smith is simply skipping Philadelphia 's voluntary workouts .
If that 's truly the case , that 's really weird . Smith is far from an established player on the roster . The 2014 first round pick needs to be doing everything he can to work hard and fight for a roster spot — whether that 's with the Eagles or another NFL team .
I have a hard time imagining Smith believes skipping voluntary practices is a great idea unless there 's some other kind of motivation behind it . And maybe that 's the case . Twitter user @ igglesnut suggested Smith could be trying to get the Eagles to cut him so that he can land in a spot where he has a better chance of making the final roster .
According to Over The Cap , the Eagles can save $ 1,483,515 in cap space ( compared to $ 998K in dead money ) by cutting Smith before his roster bonus is due on the third day of training camp . Cutting him would be an easy decision from a financial perspective .
Smith 's chances of making Philadelphia 's final roster in 2017 decreased when the team signed veteran Chris Long in free agency and drafted Derek Barnett with the No . 14 overall pick . It 's also clear the Eagles do n't want Smith around in the long-term . The team unsurprisingly declined his fifth-year option earlier this month .
Smith has been a gigantic bust for the Eagles since being selected by Philadelphia with the No . 26 pick in the 2014 NFL Draft . He 's recorded 12 tackles and four sacks in 37 games played ( zero starts ) .
Perhaps Pederson did n't mention Smith because he simply forgot he was missing . Or maybe that kind of just shows how the team feels about Smith at this point : he 's just an afterthought who will be gone soon .
After seven months of obliterating protons , the 17-mile-around Large Hadron Collider paused this morning to switch over to smashing lead ions ( atoms of lead stripped down to their dense cores ) .
The goal is to recreate the energy of the universe back to just millionths of a second after the Big Bang .
`` The LHC 's lead-ion collisions may generate temperatures up to 500,000 times hotter than the center of the sun , '' Timothy Hallman , a physicist at the Science for Nuclear Physics in Washington D.C. , said in a release .
Around those temperatures , quarks and gluons – the `` glue '' that binds quarks into protons and neutrons – are in a plasma-like state . Hallman said recreating the ultra-hot conditions with collisions between lead ions may `` provide vital insight '' into how the universe evolved at such a crucial time .
The LHC , situated underneath the French-Swiss border and operated by CERN , paused proton collisions around 3 a.m. EDT this morning . For the next month , physicists will collide heavy lead ions that are expected to generate roughly 10,000 particles per collision . Three cylindrical , colossal detectors hugging the LHC 's beamline – known by their acronyms ALICE , ATLAS and CMS – will record the resulting particle soup .
Once the lead-ion collisions wrap up in December , engineers will perform two months of maintenance to allow the LHC to pick up in early 2011 where it left off with proton collisions today . Meanwhile , seven months ' worth of proton-collision data awaits physicists hunting for shadows of the Higgs boson – the particle theorized to give matter its mass – in the energetic collisions .
`` Over the last seven months , the intensity of the LHC 's proton beams has increased 200,000 times , '' Dennis Kovar , a nuclear physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy in Washington D.C. , said in a release . That collision intensity has led to double the data physicists around the world were hoping for , and could speed discovery of weird new particles including the Higgs .
`` The eyes of the world might be on the hunt for the Higgs boson , but ... there is a wealth of physics research being done using the LHC 's proton collisions , '' Joseph Dehmer , director of the National Science Foundation 's physics division , said in release .
The collider is not only the biggest ever built , but the most costly at an estimated $ 9 billion . And so far it has n't had an easy time trying to unravel the universe 's mysteries .
Shortly after engineers ramped up the LHC in September 2008 , faulty wiring between two particle-corralling magnets sprung a leak in the machine 's extensive liquid helium cooling system . The mishap flooded part of the subterranean tunnels with 6.6 tons of ultra-cold fluid , causing the helium to rapidly evaporated into gas and damage magnets at the leak site .
Engineers repaired the immediate damage , but unless the faulty connections are replaced , the LHC ca n't reach its promised particle-colliding power of seven times better than the Tevatron in Illinois ( the second-most-powerful in the world ) . For now it 's restricted to being about 3.5 times more powerful than the Tevatron .
To replace the faulty magnet-to-magnet connections , CERN plans to shut down the LHC for 16 months starting in December 2011 . The window may leave an opportunity for the Tevatron to help verify , or trounce , the existence of the Higgs particle .

Jackie Green made history recently being the first trans woman to enter the Miss England competition , and hopes to use the prestige of the pageant to stand up for trans rights , and against transphobia .
Jackie , 18 , is currently leading in her heat of the quarter finals of the competition .
Now she speaks to PinkNews.co.uk about Miss England , Lady Gaga , her aspirations , goals and love life .
Did you have any doubts about entering the competition , given the discrimination you have experienced in the past ?
No . I did n't even think about not being accepted into the competition . I felt and still feel that I deserve just as much a chance to compete as anyone else . I am a woman ( or a ‘ Miss ' for the sake of the competition ) and no one can tell me otherwise .
What would it mean to you to win Miss England and in what ways will you use the exposure of the competition to get your positive message across ?
To win Miss England would be beyond amazing . To be honest just being in the quarter finals feels great , and to be competing with other beautiful girls just confirms to me more that I deserve to be in the competition .
I want to promote the charity Mermaids because it helped me and my family through a lot of hardship . I met some amazing people in similar situations to me which made me feel less alienated . I hope to be a role model for kids struggling with gender issues . There are not many people for them to look up to and thus they fear for what might happen to them . I want to show people that trans people are very normal and that there is hope .
Other than the exposure of competing in Miss England , how do you plan to champion transgender rights , and combat transphobic bullying ?
I am working with a organisation called ‘ Trans Media Watch ' who aim to guide the media in the way they portray Trans people to ensure that it is fair .
I hope to shed light on trans people so that society can understand we are very normal people and all we wish is to live our lives . We are not hurting anyone , we were simply born a little different , with a defect if you like , and have a right to be comfortable in our own skin and treated as who we are , human beings .
I understand you want to be a model – is there a particular type of modelling you 'd like to do ?
I want to be a high fashion model for two reasons . I am told that I have a very ‘ High Fashion Face ' and I also love how expressive and unique the clothes can be . I love the very ‘ out-there ' designs and I feel fashion is an art form and one of the best ways to express yourself .
What would your dream job be ?
I would love to model for either Vivienne Westwood or Heatherette and do a shoot with Lady Gaga . I love Gaga . I would also love to get a role in the new show starring Zooey Deschanel , ‘ New Girl ' . It would also be amazing to appear in ‘ Glee ' .
What special talents will you bring to the Miss England if you get through to the next heat ?
If I was to get through to the semi-finals I would most likely sing . I have sung since I was young and am told I am rather good !
In what ways have the competition boosted your confidence , and what would you say to others who have let low confidence hold them back ?
Being in the competition has given me a huge boost of confidence . To see how many people have voted for me and to be in the quarter finals with such gorgeous women is just amazing . I cant even describe how outrageously great this feels . The support from family , friends and strangers who have read my story makes me well up ! It is very humbling too .
I feel that at the end of the day if you dont try something then you will probably regret it and what is the worst that can happen ? I know that Modelling is a hard business to get into and I know that I will be rejected a lot but I ca n't let that stop me .
All you need to know is that you are who you are and you are beautiful both inside and out .
Being the youngest person in the UK to have full gender reassignment surgery , do you have a message for anybody who might feel unsure ?
I have always been very sure and known what I wanted and who I am . I will say that if you are unsure because you are worried how people will react and you feel people may think of you as selfish as do n't . Is it not selfish of them to expect you to live in the wrong body knowing how much pain you are in and how much you are suffering ? You are who you are and people should be able to accept you for that .
You 've said that you want to combat transphobic bullying . What would you like to say to anyone experiencing bullying , or more generally bullying of any kind ?
It 's not your fault . There is a light at the end of the tunnel . Kids ( and adults ) can be cruel but it is due to fear and ignorance . Stay strong and talk to someone about it . Do n't keep quiet or it will hurt even more .

A lot of the time bullying can come from misunderstanding – what would you like to say to the bullies of LGBT people , and what message do you want to get across to people who perpetrate hate crime ?
You are not big , you are not clever , all you are doing is making a fool of yourself . I just wish that people could understand that we are all humans , we are not hurting anyone and if we are going to hell , as so many religions say we are , then thats our business and I will go down there knowing I have lived my life how I want to and not fallen to conformity .
How supportive is your boyfriend of you competing in Miss England and how difficult was it to tell him about your choice to have the operation ?
He has been amazing . He is very proud of me and loves that he is dating a Miss England contestant and model ! It was scary telling him due to the fact that I had received a lot of hatred in my past and so was scared he would run a mile , but he did n't . He told me he did n't care because he already had fallen in love with me . We are still going strong at two and a bit year .
How far do you think there is to go in the fight for equality ? You 've talked about not hiding who you are . How important do you think it is that people come forward rather than hiding away ?
I think that people need to see how normal we are . I came forward to do that . I am your average teenage girl who has friends , a boyfriend and so on . I go out , I play Xbox and I love to read . I am a normal person just born in the wrong body .
Jackie 's heat of the Miss England quarter finals closes on 6 Feburary , and voting is currently open .
With UFC 205 less the two weeks ago , the war of words has begun in earnest between Conor McGregor and Eddie Alvarez .
Things repeatedly got heated between the two UFC champions during a join conference call on Thursday , with both men vowing to make easy work of one another on Nov. 12 . And when asked about their first staredown before their historic fight , McGregor made no secret about what he believes he saw in Alvarez 's eyes .
`` He 's thinking it 's a game , '' McGregor said . `` It 's like you look into these people 's eyes and they do n't see it as a reality just yet . They 're trying to look away and make it something else . ‘ This is n't happening . ' And then we 're in the Octagon , and then we 're about to fight , and I see what I see in their eyes .
`` I see them break , bit by bit . And then we 're in the Octagon and I break them myself . So that 's it . I 'm looking forward to going in . He 's claiming it 's an easier contest . I look forward to seeing the eyes , when the eyes roll , and the electric shock darts through his whole body and goes to his knees . And then he comes up in survival mode , and that panic sets through his whole body , his whole face . That 's something I 'm looking forward to , and I will go out there and I will punish him for that , for those words that he 's saying . I 'm going to retire him on this night . ''
The clash between McGregor and Alvarez is the first champion versus champion superfight in the UFC since Georges St-Pierre and B.J . Penn memorably locked horns in 2009 .
With the opportunity , McGregor has a chance to become the only UFC fighter in history to concurrently hold two championship belts . And over the course of the lead-up , McGregor has taken exception to an oft-repeated line from Alvarez about the Irishman being the easiest fight in the UFC lightweight division .
`` I 'm going to hurt you badly . I 'm going to rip you up badly , I swear to God . Trust me , you 're going regret that , '' McGregor said .
`` I feel [ people are ] going to see something they have n't seen before . I 'm going to toy with this man . I 'm going to really , truly rearrange his facial structure . His wife and kids will never recognize him again . His friends and the people that he knows will know that he 's not the same man after this contest . So he 's going to be in a shock when he sees that . That 's it . ''
That promise is easier said than done against Alvarez . A grizzled veteran of the fight game , the 32-year-old UFC lightweight champion has only been stopped once by strikes over the course of his 14-year career , and it happened all the way back in 2007 . Since then , Alvarez has engaged in a slew of back-and-forth wars of attrition , becoming known for his toughness and willingness to never quit .
Nonetheless , McGregor believes the damage Alvarez has sustained over that time will ultimately work against the American , and he looks forward to testing the limits of Alvarez 's iron chin .
`` I like his durability , '' McGregor said . `` I know he gets badly hurt in fights . I know he 's been dropped many times , but he keeps going , so I look forward to that . I feel that will happen in the contest . He 'll get dropped , he 'll be half-out , he 'll be in survival mode . And then ? Then I 'm just going to butcher him and punish him and not let him out of there .
`` I do n't believe he 's been hit by anybody like me . I do n't believe he will survive . If he does survive and be in that survival mode , I 'm going to toy with him . I 'm going to rearrange his face for his words that he 's speaking right now . But , I still ca n't see him lasting one round . ''
McGregor also addressed past comments Alvarez has made about `` The Notorious '' being a two-round fighter who fades in the later rounds , with McGregor vowing that the time to capitalize on any cardio issues has long past due to his growth in the aftermath of his loss to Nate Diaz at UFC 196 .
`` I 'm swinging in the fifth round . I 'm pushing now in the fifth round , '' McGregor said . `` I 've gone to that next level on this . I 've been very focused on my cardiovascular endurance and my weight management and my nutrition . Now my body mass has come down , I 'm leaner at 155 , and my VO2 max has gone through the roof . My resting heart rate is extremely low , so I 'm ready . I hope he is , because he 's talking like he can outlast me over 25 minutes . But it 's a long 25 minutes in there against a guy who can strike you from any angle , from any position . I 've ended fights from everywhere . Everywhere , I 've finished fights . So good luck to him . ''
Unless Calgary makes major financial changes on taxes or developer payments , it ca n't afford to handle 40,000 new Calgarians arriving every year — an influx city officials warn council must prepare for in coming budget years .
Calgary will release its 2015-2018 budget next Tuesday . It comes with target tax hikes of 4.7 per cent a year for four years , and was based on annual population growth of 25,000 .
As city staff crafted that budget , the latest census said Calgary grew by a record 38,508 people this year , and city hall executives believe that could be the new normal .
It 's a new normal that means the city must release and prepare empty fields and redevelopment areas more quickly , and figure out a new way to pay for it all . Because the emerging patchwork system of deals with suburban developers is n't working , city manager Jeff Fielding said .
Even if the city leans on a new deal with developers to pay more for roads , fire halls and buses for new Calgarians , that does n't cover day-to-day operations , which property taxes pay for . Extra costs and debt charges under a high-growth scenario will create a $ 15-million budget gap in 2015 — which amounts to more than an extra one per cent in property taxes . That figure grows to $ 50 million by 2018 , council was told Monday .
Without reform of some kind , services will suffer for existing Calgarians as departments stretch to handle newcomers , Fielding said .
“ You 've asked us in the past to eat the cost of growth in our operating budget . We ca n't do it any longer , ” he told councillors at a strategic meeting .
That gap comes on top of a $ 50-million shortfall the finance department had to erase within department plans under the current tax and budget targets , chief financial officer Eric Sawyer said . More rapid growth “ drives us further into the hole . ”
Mayor Naheed Nenshi predicted the city can avoid raising taxes further for next year .
“ We can probably work within that parameter without having to go straight to the property tax base , but it starts to get ugly in years future , ” he said .
By 2016 , in the middle of that four-year civic plan , Premier Jim Prentice has promised a new fiscal framework as part of charters for Edmonton and Calgary . Nenshi is hoping for surer money flows to pay for growth infrastructure and possibly alternatives to reliance on property tax .
Every new family coming to Calgary in the future will require about $ 44,000 in city capital costs , from transit and fire trucks to sewer lines , the city says . The city asserts the existing developer levy deal does n't cover all those costs and saddles ratepayers with too much debt , and is due for renegotiation soon .
Councillors have urged a series of developer financing agreements that better cover startup expenses so companies can fast-track more suburban growth and meet demand . But Fielding said he wants to end the one-offs that risk deeper public debt and may leave infrastructure overbuilt in some outlying areas and under built in others .
The city 's developer association plans to meet with Fielding and others to begin talking about a new approach after late November 's budget debates .
Now that the problem of rapid growth is better defined , the two sides need to collaborate on solutions , said development consultant David Ford , chair of Urban Land Institute of Alberta .
“ Many other cities have gone through these challenges before , ” he said .

The tax revenues from marijuana in states where it has been legalised are relatively sizeable - is this one of the reasons why many places are consenting to pro-marijuana legislation ?
The legalisation of marijuana is n't just about liberal values - it 's about dollars
On Tuesday , Oregon , Alaska and Washington D.C. voted in favour of pro-marijuana legislation . A vote in Florida won 58 % support , falling just short of the required 60 % threshold . Nearly 18 million Americans now live in states where marijuana is fully legal .
Tuesday 's midterms were dominated by the Republicans .
NCSL ( @ NCSLorg ) # NCSLelections - Democrats will control the lowest number of state legislatures since 1860 # 2014elections
So , why is it that legislatures and voters in red states favourably lean towards what , on paper at least , would seem to be a liberal issue ? One reason ( at least when it comes to governments ) might be to do with money .
One of the states they now join is Colorado , where marijuana was legalised ( with some restrictions ) last year . On average , the state now gets more tax revenues from the plant than from alcohol .
The bottom line is there is a potentially sizeable crop of dollars waiting to be had from the legalisation of drugs . There 's a lot more green in the pot than meets the eye , if you will .
The graphic below looks at how this money stacks up around the world compared to other crops .
Methodology
We scored some data on yearly harvested area , production weight and wholesale value for the most common food crops from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization , and used it to calculate yield per km2 . Then we went sniffing around in various UN World Drug Reports and performed some backroom calculations to cook up some broadly comparable figures for illegal drugs – cocaine , heroin and the mighty marijuana . Data on illicit substances is , like the peeps who sell them , more than a bit sketchy . For example , the UN data on dried coca leaf production ( the raw material for cocaine powder ) is based on only the top three coca-producing countries – Bolivia , Colombia and Peru . And the price and purity of coke varies , so we made some assumptions here .

Summer time is all about enjoying yourself , so why sweat it out at the gym every day ? Not only can the gym temperature be pretty unbearable , but you 'll be cooped up inside a building all summer long .
So we put together a few odd ways you can burn calories this summer -- sans gym , of course .
1 . Bouncing
Got a yoga ball sitting around at home ? If not , get one . You can use it as your comfortable seat when watching TV , eating your dinner , or doing your work . Every hour you spend bouncing on the ball can burn between 50 and 100 calories , depending on how vigorously you bounce .
2 . Tapping
People that have a habit of fidgeting actually burn more calories every day than those that sit quietly , so it 's time to get fidgeting . Tapping your foot is one of the best methods of fidget-burning , and you can burn up to 100 calories in an hour -- though that requires some Thumper-level tapping . Even just gently tapping for an hour can help you burn 50 calories or so .
3 . Water Fight
Nothing will help you cool off from the summer heat better than a water fight , and you 'll get some great exercise in as well . You 'll be running all around your lawn , your arms will be pumping , your body will be dodging , and you 'll be burning a few hundred calories without even thinking about it . Just keep those balloons flying , and you 're in for a refreshing workout .
4 . Sex
Missionary sex is better exercise for the man , while the cowgirl position is ideal for the lady . Men can burn about 350 calories per hour in the missionary position , and it 's not impossible for a 30-minute session in the cowgirl position to burn 200 or more calories . Talk about an enjoyable way to get in shape !
5 . Shopping
Now you have an excuse to stroll around the mall or hit your favorite supermarket . If you speed walk through the supermarket or mall -- preferably hauling around a few heavy items -- you can get a great workout . Speed-walking while carrying gallon jugs of milk or juice will burn up to 150 calories per hour -- not bad for getting your weekly shopping done !
6 . Freeze
Oddly enough , a cold shower can help you to burn calories . Overheating from the sweltering summer sun ? Jump into the shower and let the cold water run over your body . It will have to work extra hard to keep itself warm , and you 'll end up burning about 100 calories extra just to keep your core temperature steady in the freezing cold shower .
7 . Summer Cleaning
The last thing you want to do with your vacation days is clean the house , but it 's a good alternative for your workout . You can burn about 65 calories washing the windows , 50 calories scrubbing out the bathtub , and another 200 calories or so giving your driveway a thorough sweeping and scrubbing ( no pressure washer -- hose and scrub brush only ) . By the time your house is sparkling clean , you 'll have worked up a sweat and burned a good few calories .
8 . Video Games
You may tell your kids , `` Go outside and play , '' but they may be onto something . Video games like Just Dance , Dance Dance Revolution , and Wii Sports get your body moving , and you can burn a good 400 calories an hour if you actually dance in time with the song . Have fun dancing and feeling like a fool with your kids , and get in shape too !

A singular event in Bingen , Washington marked Chris Hubbard 's transformation from glassblowing hobbyist to professional : “ On Aug. 3 , 2005 , a SWAT team kicked in my door . They thought the studio was a meth lab , ” Hubbard says . He had his medical marijuana card , and was inside “ listening to Bob Marley — ‘ No Woman , No Cry . ' They did n't find any meth . ”
They did , however , discover his marijuana . Though he was licensed to have it to help with a particularly unpleasant variant of migraine , Hubbard says things did n't go well . His medical marijuana card was in his truck , but his truck was towed away by the police . “ They took everything , ” he says , “ including the glassblowing equipment . ”
When the dust finally settled , Hubbard ended up with a misdemeanor conviction for displaying medical marijuana in public . “ One of the neighbors could see the plants from his backyard , ” he says . When the judge asked him how he was going to pay the $ 18,000 in costs and fines , Hubbard said he was a professional glassblower . “ I told the judge that 's what I did , so then I had to do it , ” he says . “ The only other skill I had was teaching snowboarding . ”
In those early days , he made marijuana pipes to sell to local headshops , and because he needed the money , he says , he took less than the pieces were worth . The West Coast market was flooded with pipe makers , but through tenacity , good work , and lending a hand to big name glassblowers , Hubbard made his mark . Now , after returning to the Valley four years ago — he grew up here and in Japan — Hubbard pays the bills with a steady stream of glass belt buckles and Sherlock-style pipes . The legalization of medical marijuana and decriminalization of possession of small amounts , he explains , opened up a new market . Luckily , Hubbard says , “ the growth [ of the market ] is exponential . ”
Hubbard shares a Florence studio with fellow glassblower Noah Rockland , and their two-room corner of the old Pro Brush building is a crazyquilt of posters ( mostly of impressive pipes ) , tools , and pieces of glass . Most of the glass is in the form of colored rods . It 's remarkable to see the gleaming , baroque patterns and colors in the finished products and realize that they start with simple glass cylinders and rods . The process , he explains , often starts with sandwiching colored rods between clear cylinders . That 's all melted together , creating a layer of color within clear glass . A bewildering array of methods then yield zig-zags , swirls , and basket weaves .
It 's hard at first to imagine how the weaves happen . To explain it , Hubbard displays a ribbon of rainbow glass . He says the ribbon is cut into pieces , and the pieces are then carefully placed to create a weave . It 's clear that a lot of work goes into every piece . “ This is not a spectator sport , ” he says .
Though Hubbard says a pipe that retails for $ 400- $ 500 can come together in a few hours , those few hours have to be preceded by the prep work that allows him to , for instance , slice a cylinder to reveal a complex pattern in cross-section , a pattern that becomes one small part of a large pipe . Breaking all that down to an exact number of hours per pipe is n't easy .
Hubbard sees his work as the centerpiece in people 's personal rituals around smoking . “ A pipe gives you something to relate to , something to appreciate , rather than just an apple or a tin can . ”
It 's not hard to appreciate his pipes — at their most ornate , they look like weird apparatus from Alien that 's in mid-spin through a psychedelic rainbow . The closer you look , the more layers of color and pattern reveal themselves . The aesthetic of glass pipes , and indeed the art of coloring this kind of glass , came from Deadhead culture , Hubbard explains . They 're not made of the “ soft glass ” used by most glassblowers . “ If you put a hot pan down on a table made of soft glass , ” Hubbard says , “ it would shatter . ”
Pipes are made of “ hard , ” or “ scientific ” glass , also known as borosilicate glass . Its chief useful characteristic is its heat resistance , which makes it a perfect choice for pipes . Coloring scientific glass is a fairly recent phenomenon , and it began with a glassblower named Bob Snodgrass , who stumbled upon the method and made a living selling pipes at Grateful Dead shows . From that beginning , a whole movement began . Unfortunately , that movement existed in a legal gray area . While the pieces got more and more ornate and interesting , the Bush administration got more and more draconian . In 2003 , Attorney General John Ashcroft — the same Ashcroft who had the naked statue of Justice covered — oversaw Operation Pipe Dreams , which resulted in the indictment of 50 sellers and makers of pipes . It 's par for the course in marijuana law : a complex , ill-defined , and inconsistently enforced set of rules that people like Hubbard have to be aware of , rules that can have major consequences even in the era of ever-loosening laws .
For Hubbard , such legal trouble had ironic consequences , leading him to the full-time pursuit of pipe-making . He just passed the 10-year anniversary of his SWAT raid , and he marked the occasion in high style . He grabs the prototype of the piece he devised , and it 's a spidery , gleaming conglomeration of glass that forms a large rectangle .
“ It 's a glass grow light , ” he explains .
He points to one end : “ The lights go in here . ”
He shows the other end , and it 's got a familiar shape . “ And you can smoke out of it ! ” •

That is all from Quora , hat tip goes to James Crabtree .
Remote-controlled helicopter drones are being flown over prisons in Canada to drop drugs and other contraband into the grounds for inmates .
Hull jail in the city of Gatineau in Quebec is having to tighten its security after a small helicopter drone flew over prison walls last weekend .
Prison guards searched the grounds and local area thoroughly but failed to find the package that the drone might have been carrying or to see where the drone landed .
Stephane Lemaire , president of Quebec 's correctional officers ' union , told the Ottawa Sun that this was not an isolated incident and the situation is becoming frustrating :
`` This sort of thing happens often in prisons all across Quebec . Usually the drones are carrying small packages of drugs or other illicit substances , '' he said .
`` The problem is , the drone can be controlled from more than a kilometre away , and the [ Hull ] prison is surrounded by forest . ''
Boost security
Lemaire is urging the government to help boost security in Quebec 's prisons by supplying either a net or a jammer to disrupt the signal from the drone to the remote-control .
In related news in the US , four men in Georgia were arrested this week for trying to drop packages of tobacco to prisoners at the Calhoun State Prison using a remote-controlled helicopter .
A prison lieutenant spotted the helicopter hovering over the gates and a search of the local area ensued .
An hour later , the police became suspicious of a car with license plates from another county many miles away .
Smuggle
Sheriff Josh Hilton told Channel 2 Action News in Atlanta : `` After we gained consent to search the car we found the helicopter and I do n't know exactly how much it was but probably about 1 to 2 pounds of tobacco rolled up . ''
Hilton added that this was the first time he had ever seen a helicopter being used to try to smuggle contraband into a prison .
In the US , attempting to cross prison guard lines with contraband is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison .
For many years , firearms manufacturers have looked for ways to successfully chamber rimless cartridges in a double-action revolver with a swing-out cylinder . The most successful attempts have used moon clips ; thin pieces of stamped spring steel which hold the rims of the cartridge in sets . Usually , the moon clips will hold two , three , five , or six cartridges , but there are clips made to hold seven and eight shots as well , for revolvers with as many chambers in the cylinder . The moon clip method works well , but there have also been designs that used no moon clips , using wire springs or other methods to retain and eject the cartridges . Most of this came and went without much commercial success .
Charter Arms of Shelton , Connecticut has been developing a rimless double-action revolver for several months now . I fired a prototype back in January of this year , and the revolvers are now in production . The Pit Bull uses a patented spring-loaded rim engagement assembly . As the cartridges are loaded into the chambers , they push the extractor out of the way . As the cartridge is fully chambered , the extractor , a sliding piece of stainless steel which is about three-sixteenths of an inch wide , snaps into the rim solidly . Upon ejection , as the ejector rod is operated as is normal with a double-action revolver , the extractor rod system ejects all five rounds at once , positively and quickly .
The execution of the system is a very good design , but why build a revolver for a rimless cartridge , when plenty of rimmed cartridges exist ? The answer to that lies in the performance , availability , and popularity of the 40 S & W cartridge . The 40 S & W is one of the most popular handgun cartridges in the United States . As such , availability of the cartridge is excellent , with 40 S & W ammo being available almost anywhere that ammunition is sold . Also due to its popularity , the cost of 40 S & W ammo is reasonable , compared to many popular revolver cartridges . Most importantly , the 40 S & W is a good , efficient cartridge for a medium-bore belly gun .
In their 44 Bulldog and Bulldog Pug revolvers , Charter Arms leads the industry in big-bore belly guns . The 44 Charters have somewhat of a cult following , and for good reason : the 44 Special in a small concealable revolver is a great defensive weapon . The 40 S & W Pit Bull follows in the same usage , with a slightly smaller bore , and a very efficient cartridge . The five-shot Charters are relatively small , lightweight , and compact ; almost as small as a five shot 38 Special revolver , but packing more punch . The cylinder locks into the frame at the front and rear for good alignment with the barrel . The Pit Bull is made almost entirely of stainless steel , and has a comfortable and controllable synthetic rubber grip , with molded-in checkering for a positive hold . The hammer is serrated for a non-slip surface for thumb-cocking the action for a single-action trigger pull . The trigger face is smooth for a steady double-action trigger pull . The stainless steel wears a satin bead-blasted finish . The front sight is a long sloping ramp and the ejector rod is enclosed , to make the Pit Bull pocket-friendly , for a smooth , snag-free draw under pressure .
A revolver of this type is carried for personal defense . If we know a fight is coming , most of us will either try to avoid it , or prepare with heavier armament , such as a shotgun , rifle , or a Marine platoon . However , we carry handguns concealed because we never know when the fight will come , so we must always be prepared , even if the fight is not expected . A belly gun such as the Pit Bull makes a lot of sense . Many folks think that five shots are not enough for a defensive handgun , but statistics show that in most gunfights , five shots are more than enough , and with the ejection system of the Pit Bull , reloads can be quick if needed . Five shots of 40 calibers in a compact , reliable package is a logical choice for most folks who want to go heeled . A revolver is very easy to use , is always ready with no safeties to manipulate , and has a very simple manual-of-arms . To load the Pit Bull , the cylinder latch is pushed forward with pressure on the right side of the cylinder , and the cylinder swings out for loading . Press a cartridge into each chamber , close the cylinder , and the Pit Bull is ready to fight , whether put into action immediately , or placed in a bedside drawer for months . I advocate rotating out the ammunition at least once a month , as you should practice at least that often , but the fact is , sometimes handguns are left loaded for months or years at a time . A good revolver is more likely to be ready to function reliably when left in such condition than is a semi-auto .

Accuracy of the Charter Pit Bull was very good . I made no attempt to make a bulls-eye revolver out of this handgun , as the sight radius is short , but I did try some twenty-five-yard shots on a silhouette target , and the Pit Bull did very well . Standing on my hind legs like a man , I could center a cylinder-full into the vital zone quickly , and making a headshot was also fairly easy , if I took careful aim . From the bench , the Pit Bull would cluster its shots into groups measuring between two and three-quarters and three and three-quarters inches with most ammo . My favorite load for the Pit Bull is the Buffalo Bore 180 grain jacketed hollowpoint . This load leaves the barrel of the Pit Bull in excess of one thousand feet-per-second , and would be my choice of a carry load for defense , against man or animal .
The Charter Pit Bull proved to be well-built and reliable . No problems were encountered at all . Every cartridge fired and ejected perfectly , even the Plus P hollowpoints . There was no sticky extraction experienced . The Pit Bull had a perfect barrel/cylinder gap , measuring only three one-thousandths ( .003 ) of an inch , which is tighter than many revolvers costing hundreds of dollars more . While on that subject , Charter revolvers have always been priced competitively , costing no more than many imported revolvers , but made entirely in the USA .

Tomorrow , April 22nd—Earth Day—scientists , people who love science , and citizens concerned that government policies are increasingly detached from empirical reality will march in Washington , D.C. , and nearly five hundred other cities around the world . Like any large group of protesters , the science marchers have struggled to craft their mission statement . “ The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity , ” they write , on their Web site . “ We unite as a diverse , nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policymakers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest . ”
It 's a good mission statement , but it contains a time bomb . The phrase “ science that upholds the common good ” may seem innocuous . But who decides what is in the common good ?
The March for Science is taking place alongside an ongoing debate , in the House , stoked by Lamar Smith , the chairman of the House Science Committee . Smith is an active critic of the scientific evidence for human-induced climate change . He argues that the National Science Foundation 's charter statement , which charges it with supporting research “ in the national interest , ” means that it should fund less social science and environmental research , which he views as of little value .
Statements about “ the common good ” or “ the national interest ” are inherently political . They should guide politicians in formulating public policy , and their interpretation should be clearly enunciated as the basis of the electoral process . But are they appropriate for governing scientific research ? If history is any guide—from the Soviet misdirection of research in genetics , to Nazi claims about “ Jewish science , ” to the more recent effort to restrict research on climate change—claims about “ the national interest ” often hinder science in its pursuit of its most important goal : the unfettered and open questioning of even our most fundamental assumptions about reality .
It 's true that the progress of science has brought unparalleled prosperity and wealth to a significant fraction of the world 's population , and that it has created technologies that have changed everything about the way we live and work , while enhancing human health and lifespan well beyond what it was even a century ago . These developments have been for “ the common good. ” But it has also brought us nuclear and chemical weapons , the dark side of the Internet , and , for some people , a sense of isolation from nature .
It 's tempting to locate the utility of science in the technology it produces , and in the way that technology improves the human condition . But the truth is that science is not equivalent to technology alone—nor is it equivalent to a set of facts , which can then be contrasted with another set of “ alternative ” facts to decide which set one prefers .
Science is a process for deriving facts about nature . It 's a process for enhancing our understanding of the world around us , and for separating nonsense from sense via empirical investigation , logical reasoning , and constant testing . Trying to define science as an activity that upholds “ the common good ” or is “ in the national interest ” distorts the fact that science is nothing more or less than a remarkably successful empirical process for uncovering the way the world works . At its best , this process is open-ended and curiosity-driven .
Of course , there are many specific public-policy issues that cry out for scientific research , from curing diseases to safeguarding the environment . But , as the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine stressed in its landmark 2007 report , “ Rising Above the Gathering Storm , ” written by a distinguished committee chaired by the former Lockheed Martin C.E.O . Norman Augustine , perhaps half of the current gross national product of the United States relies on the results of curiosity-driven fundamental research performed twenty-five to fifty years ago . The pursuit of science for its own sake led to discoveries such as penicillin and superconductivity , and it often created , almost by accident , remarkable benefits for society . Consider the creation of the World Wide Web , by groups working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) , which built the Large Hadron Collider . It was originally designed to help scientists working at different groups across the globe access information , but then expanded to change the life of almost every citizen in the industrialized world today .
And yet , as important as these economic and technological spinoffs of science are , knowledge , in itself , is still at the center of the scientific enterprise . In this respect , perhaps the greatest benefit of science for society is how it transforms our culture . Science provides us with a new perspective on our place in the cosmos and a better understanding of ourselves as human beings . It helps us overcome our otherwise myopic preconceptions about how the world works . At a deep level , it allows us to see through some of our illusions about reality , which result from the peculiarities of space and time within which we happen to exist , and to perceive , instead , the detailed , fundamental workings of nature .
In these aspects , science resembles those other human activities , like art , music , and literature , that distinguish humanity as a species . We don't—or shouldn't—ask what the utility of a play by Shakespeare is , or how a Mozart concerto or a Rolling Stones song upholds “ the common good , ” or how a Picasso painting or a movie like “ Citizen Kane ” might be in “ the national interest. ” ( Perhaps it 's because we insist on thinking in such terms that support for art , music , and literature is also under attack in Congress . ) The free inquiry and creative activity we find in science and art reflect the best about what it means to be human .
In 1969 , Robert Wilson , the first director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , near Chicago , was asked by Congress whether the huge particle accelerator being built there would contribute to “ the national defense. ” His response then is appropriate now :
No , sir . . . . I do n't believe so . . . . It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another , the dignity of men , our love of culture . . . . It has to do with , are we good painters , good sculptors , great poets ? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about . It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending .
The March for Science can meaningfully celebrate the ways in which the process of science enhances our lives , and it can usefully demand that the government pursue evidence-based public policy . It 's certainly true that Congress should use the knowledge developed by free inquiry to assist in developing policies to promote “ the common good , ” as the electorate conceives of it . But the standard of “ the common good ” should not be the one by which science is judged , because such a standard risks politicizing what is inherently apolitical . The March for Science must be clear-eyed in its defense of the scientific process as an independently valuable human activity . It should defend the core value of the scientific process : discovering more about the universe , and ourselves .
President Trump 's plan to deport millions of people appears to be underway . Last week , federal immigration officials arrested more than 600 people at their homes and workplaces in at least 11 states , sending terror through immigrant communities .
The abruptness of the raids provoked criticism from local officials , including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York , who vowed to “ stand with ” immigrant communities . But mass deportation under President Trump will also happen through a more routine policy that is in the mayor 's control : endless , unnecessary arrests for low-level offenses , which end up feeding immigrants into the federal government 's deportation machine .
It 's not enough for cities like New York to declare themselves “ sanctuaries , ” which simply means that the local police wo n't detain noncitizens on the federal government 's behalf . If cities really want to protect immigrants , they must also end the quota-driven style of policing that makes immigrants the victims of unnecessary arrests and disproportionate punishment .
Many of these unnecessary arrests stem from the discredited idea that a draconian crackdown on the most minor offenses — littering , selling loose cigarettes , biking on the sidewalk — will prevent more serious crimes . This model of policing , known as broken windows or zero tolerance , helped to drive mass incarceration . Its next cost could be mass deportation .
At a two-day meeting in Zurich this week , the FIFA Executive Committee deliberated on a number of forward-looking measures to improve governance as part of the reform process and to promote greater participation of women in football .
In regard to the proposed amendments to article 36 of the FIFA Code of Ethics to allow the independent Ethics Committee to publish more information about its proceedings , the Executive Committee declared its support in principle and asked the FIFA Legal Committee for a final deliberation ahead of the next Executive Committee meeting . The independent chairmen of the committee 's two chambers , Hans-Joachim Eckert and Cornel Borbély , had advocated this change in the interest of transparency and understanding of their work .
The executive also supported the call made by the FIFA Task Force for Women 's Football for greater inclusion and participation of women in football , which will be referred to the 2016 FIFA Reform Committee for consideration in the development of the final reform proposals . The committee also agreed to the amended regulations to ensure more female members of team delegations at the FIFA U-20 Women 's World Cup 2016 in Papua New Guinea . This follows on from a similar change to the regulations for the FIFA U-17 Women 's World Cup , which were approved last March . Sonia Bien-Aimé has also been appointed as the new chairwoman of the Organising Committee for the FIFA U-20 Women 's World Cup .
The chairman of the 2016 FIFA Reform Committee , François Carrard , briefed the members on his committee 's work and said that he would submit a set of recommended reform proposals to the Executive Committee at its December meeting . The Executive Committee welcomed François Carrard 's report and reconfirmed its commitment to reforms .
It was also re-confirmed during the meeting that there would be no obligation for clubs to release players for the Men 's Olympic Football Tournament Rio 2016 , given that the event is not part of the international match calendar . However , FIFA is asking for support from the clubs to allow players who are called up by their national teams to be given the chance to be part of the Olympic experience .
Given the current refugee crisis , the Executive Committee decided to donate USD 1 million to the UN 's refugee agency ( UNHCR ) . It was decided that this would be the most efficient way for FIFA to help refugees .
Other decisions taken by the Executive Committee included the following :
Approval of the agenda for the Extraordinary FIFA Congress that will take place in Zurich on 26 February 2016 in order to appoint a new FIFA President . The agenda will include a package of reforms and amendments to the FIFA Statutes .
The next Executive Committee meeting , the last of 2015 , will take place in Zurich in December with the date yet to be confirmed .
Approval of the international match calendar for the 2018-2024 period , including the competition dates for the 2022 FIFA World Cup™ to be staged from 21 November to 18 December 2022 .
Constant Omari has been appointed as the new chairman of the Task Force Against Racism and Discrimination .
The Oceanian Football Confederation ( OFC ) will receive an additional slot ( in total two ) for the FIFA U-17 and U-20 World Cups as of 2017 . UEFA will have 5 instead of 6 slots .
Futsal will replace football at the Youth Olympic Football Tournaments Buenos Aires 2018 .
The Pakistan Football Federation ( PFF ) has to revise its statutes and hold new elections within two years . FIFA will also act on the recent appointment of a court administrator to the PFF , which is considered as interference . The PFF must report to the FIFA Associations Committee every six months on the progress of this revision process .
To address the situation at the Benin Football Association , it was decided to appoint a normalisation committee in accordance with art . 7 par . 2 of the FIFA Statutes with a mandate until April 2016 . The tasks of the committee will be to normalise the situation of the national teams and to organise elections which will be open to all candidatures , including from the members of the outgoing FBF executive committee .
Kohzo Tashima will lead a joint FIFA/AFC delegation , composed of H.R.H . Prince Abdullah ( FIFA ) and Mariano Araneta ( AFC ) , to Jakarta to assist the Football Association of Indonesia in its negotiations with stakeholders and to identify solutions for Indonesian football to ensure that the suspension can be lifted as soon as possible .
To contact the Kuwait Football Association about the new sport law and warn about a suspension if nothing is done by 15 October 2015 to avoid the implementation of the new law due to come into force on 27 October 2015 .
To extend the mandate of the normalisation committees of the Guyana Football Federation ( GFF ) , the Football Association of the Maldives ( FAM ) , and the Togolese Football Association ( FTF ) until 30 November 2015 , 30 October 2015 and 31 December 2015 , respectively .

`` This is going to be one of the biggest moves in the history of the sport , '' ex-UFC fighter and current UFC Tonight analyst Kenny Florian said . `` Anything that FOX does , they do it big and they are always successful . This finally puts the UFC and its athletes at the same level as the biggest sports in the world , as they rightfully deserve . I 'm excited about the opportunity to be working there , and I 'm excited for all the athletes . It means a lot more exposure for all of them . ''
FOX Sports 1 , which will take over the channel now occupied by SPEED , as well as its sister channel FOX Sports 2 will regularly feature UFC programming .
For example , for the Aug. 17 Fight Night , FOX Sports 1 will air a pre-fight show , a two-hour preliminary card , and the three-hour main card . UFC Tonight will move to FOX Sports 1 on Sept. 11 . Other UFC programming that will appear on the channel includes season 18 of The Ultimate Fighter , which starts on Sept. 4 with women 's bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey and Miesha Tate as coaches , and shoulder programs like UFC Ultimate Insider and UFC Unleashed .
FOX Sports 2 — which is being rebranded from FUEL TV — will occasionally air Fight Nights as well , with the first one on Oct. 26 highlighted by a Michael Bisping vs. Mark Munoz main event . The channel will also feature live weigh-ins and other UFC programming .
The UFC-heavy schedule will air alongside other major sports on the FOX Sports 1 lineup . The network has already acquired rights to a diverse set of major properties including college football , NCAA Big East Conference basketball , UEFA Champions League soccer , Major League Baseball , NASCAR Sprint Cup races and the U.S. Open Golf Championship . The fighters of the Octagon and key bouts will also be discussed and analyzed regularly on FOX Sports Live , a nightly news show .
`` I think [ fans ] are going to see the UFC athletes at the same level as all the other mainstream sports athletes , '' Florian said . `` Fans and new fans alike will see and appreciate what kind of athletes the UFC has , once and for all . I believe that the UFC athletes are among the best in all sports . It 's one of the toughest sports out there , and FOX Sports 1 will be able to show why that is the case on a daily and weekly basis . ''
To date , the UFC has officially announced several other live events that will air on the channels , including Fight Night : Condit vs. Kampmann 2 on Aug. 28 , Fight Night : Teixeira vs. Bader on Sept. 4 and the aforementioned Bisping-Munoz event , among others .
But the honor of smashing the champagne on the maiden voyage goes to Rua and Sonnen , who , in a style that may foreshadow the channel 's expectedly irreverent personality , voiced his responsibility for setting a high bar .
`` There are a few things at play , '' he said . `` It 's the debut of the biggest sports network ever . It 's also going to be the most-watched fight in the history of combat sports . It 's also a main event , and most importantly , it 's in the boss ' home town . Not the boss , Dana White , but the boss , Whitey Bulger . ''
ISLAMABAD : Believe it or not but authorities in Pakistan 's Punjab province have `` arrested '' a monkey after it crossed the border with India , according to a media report today .
The monkey was captured by wildlife officials in Bahawalpur , Express News channel reported .
Local residents initially tried to capture the monkey after it entered Cholistan area of Bahawalpur district .
After the monkey evaded them , the people informed wildlife officials , who captured the animal after a struggle . The monkey was taken to Bahawalpur Zoo , where officials named him Bobby .
In May last year , Indian police detained a pigeon and kept it under armed guard after it was caught on an alleged spying mission for Pakistan .
The bird was found by a resident of India 's Punjab state , which borders Pakistan , and taken to a police station 40 km from Amritsar .
Donald Cerrone might not get in those six fights he was asking for in 2014 . But there 's no doubt the UFC is giving him the action he craves .
In about which promise lightweight fireworks , `` Cowboy '' will meet Edson Barboza on April 19 at UFC on FOX 11 in Orlando . FOXSports.com broke the news of the bout on Monday .
Cerrone ( 22-6 , 1 no-contest ) is fresh off his UFC on FOX 10 head-kick knockout of Adriano Martins . He earned Knockout of the Night honors for that effort , which is his combined 12 post-fight bonus between the UFC and WEC , most in Zuffa history . Cerrone has won two straight and three of four .
Barboza ( 13-1 ) , meanwhile , has staked his claim as one of the division 's most exciting fighters . At UFC on FOX 9 in Sacramento , he rallied from a wicked first round beating at the hands of Danny Castillo to take a majority decision , his third consecutive victory .
While not officially called such , the fight figures to be a main card bout on an event which features Travis Browne vs. Fabricio Werdum and Miesha Tate vs. Liz Carmouche .
In 1937 , a 41-year-old lounge lizard and sometime car dealer named Eddie Judson married 18-year-old Margarita . Her mother , who had been unable to protect the girl from her father , objected to her marriage to a man her father 's age and indeed , on occasion , slapped Judson during quarrels . Like her father , Judson saw the girl as , in her own words , `` an investment . '' He even demanded that Cansino turn previously earned money over to him . Judson did get her a seven-year starlet contract at Columbia Pictures , where she did a fiery flamenco in `` Criminals of the Air '' and played on an all-female softball team in `` Girls Can Play . ''
Judson promoted his wife 's film career by dying her hair auburn and raising her hairline with electrolysis . He also rented gowns for her , took her to nightclubs , paid press photographers to take her picture , fabricated awards for her and answered all remarks addressed to her . Hayworth silently welcomed his `` protection , '' probably believing she was unable to take care of herself . Her husband repeatedly threatened her with physical abuse and disfigurement . He also offered her body to any man he thought would advance her career .

According to Ms. Leaming , Harry Cohn , the head of Columbia Pictures - who had suggested she take her mother 's maiden name , Hayworth , and who cast her as a pilot 's wife in the classic Howard Hawks film `` Only Angels Have Wings '' - `` developed an obsession '' with the beautiful young woman . But in a rare , explicit show of strength , Hayworth refused her husband 's order to sleep with `` the notoriously crude movie mogul . ''
When he saw the famous Life pinup photograph , Orson Welles decided to marry her , and he did so in 1943 . The frayed `` boy genius '' later directed the `` love goddess '' in the acclaimed film `` The Lady From Shanghai . '' However , the real Hayworth 's emotional needs made Welles uncomfortable , and he cheated on her regularly with prostitutes and with other actresses , including Judy Garland .
The dissolute Prince Aly Khan fell in love with Hayworth 's image , too . The international playboy of the 1940 's , he was famous for his wealth , his racehorses and his love life . He asked Elsa Maxwell , the hostess and public relations woman , to introduce him to the glamorous star . The prince was still married , and his internationally publicized courtship of , marriage to and subsequent divorce from Hayworth were among the factors that ultimately led his father , the Aga Khan - the spiritual leader of 15 million Muslims - to reject his son as his heir and ultimately designate his grandson to succeed him .
After her divorce from Aly Khan in 1951 , Hayworth 's life went downhill fast . Custody battles over her daughters by Welles and the prince were bitter and public . Exploitative men were routine . She married the singer Dick Haymes , widely known in Hollywood as Mr . Evil , who took financial advantage of her . She began drinking heavily ; irrational outbursts became common . By 1962 , it was increasingly hard for her to remember dialogue . She seemed to blank out ; once she even failed to recognize her former husband Orson Welles when he kissed her hello . In 1980 , at the age of 62 , she was finally diagnosed as a victim of advanced Alzheimer 's disease , a less understood condition then than it is today . Her favorite daughter , Princess Yasmin Khan , became her legal guardian and lovingly cared for Hayworth until her death in May 1987 .
Ms. Leaming , the author of a fine biography of Orson Welles , has created a convincing historical portrait of Rita Hayworth 's world . The meticulous research makes the painful story of Hayworth 's personal problems vivid , which may diminish some envy of her public successes . The book teaches a harder lesson : Rita Hayworth 's tortured childhood , so well described in the early pages of `` If This Was Happiness , '' shaped her . Had she remained poor , she would probably have led at least as sad a life . Hollywood did not destroy her . Tinsel is , after all , no more and no less than tinsel .
A riled up Donald Trump spoke to George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America Monday morning , pushing back at the $ 40 million lawsuit filed against him by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over the weekend , and intimating that the order for the lawsuit came from President Barack Obama .
Trump found it highly suspicious that Schneiderman met with Obama in Syracuse on Thursday and then filed the lawsuit on Saturday .
“ This guy is a political hack looking to get publicity , ” Trump said . “ By the way , he meets with President Obama on Thursday evening in Syracuse . On Saturday at 1:00 he files a suit . ”

“ You 're saying President Obama is behind this ? ” Stephanopoulos asked . “ You just threw the charge out there . Do you believe it or not ? ”
“ Who ever heard of a government agency bringing a lawsuit on Saturday afternoon ? ” Trump said . “ He 's been looking into this thing for two years . He brings a lawsuit on Saturday afternoon , right after he meets with President Obama . Maybe it 's a mini IRS . ”
Trump also argued that his university had a greater approval rating than the Wharton School of Finance or Harvard .

NICOLAS SARKOZY HAS been dealt a surprise blow in his ambitions to win a second term as President of France - coming tied for second place in an opinion poll , two points behind the leader of the far-right National Front party .
Marine Le Pen , who took over as the president of the party in January succeeding her father Jean-Marie , commands the support of 23 per cent of voters in the poll , published in the Le Parisien newspaper yesterday .
The incumbent Sarkozy commands 21 per cent of support , as does the leader of the main opposition Socialist party , Martine Aubry .
Though the election is still14 months away , the poll will come as a bitter blow to the president - whose political agenda , the Daily Telegraph explains , has come to be dominated by topics like Islam and immigration , on which the National Front is perceived as strong .
It adds that the poll should be viewed in the context , however , that none of the main parties has officially declared a candidate - with the poll also leaving out a likely front-runner , IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn .
The BBC further adds that the poll has come under attack , with spokespersons from the more mainstream parties suggesting the poll - conducted online - was open to manipulation and virtual ballot-stuffing .
Nonetheless , the spike in her approval is significant : in polls taken last year , before she took the party leadership , she took between 11 and 13 per cent , the Wall Street Journal notes .
Jean-Marie Le Pen made international news in 2002 when he took a surprise second place in that year 's presidential election , forcing his way into a run-off election at the expense of the highly-fancied prime minister Lionel Jospin - taking 16 per cent of the vote , a much smaller share than his daughter took in the virtual poll .
French electoral law requires a run-off election to be held if no candidate takes more than 50 per cent of the vote in the first round of voting ; no candidate has passed that threshold on the first round of polling for decades .
Sarkozy was narrowly elected in 2007 following a run-off with the Socialist Party 's Ségolène Royal .
Artificial intelligence researchers in recent days have been speaking out against media reports that dramatize AI research that Facebook conducted .
An academic paper that Facebook published in June describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating . The agents ' improvement gradually performed through trial and error .
But in the past week or so , some media outlets have published reports on the work that are alarmist in tone . `` Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language , '' London 's Telegraph newspaper reported . `` 'Robot intelligence is dangerous ' : Expert 's warning after Facebook AI 'develop their own language , ' '' as London 's Sun tabloid put it .
At times some of the chatter between the agents did deviate from standard correct English . But that was n't the point of the paper ; the point was to make the agents effectively negotiate . The researchers finished their experiment , and indeed they noticed that the agents even figured out how to pretend to be interested in something they did n't actually want , `` only to later 'compromise ' by conceding it , '' Mike Lewis , Denis Yarats , Yann Dauphin , Devi Parikh and Dhruv Batra of Facebook 's Artificial Intelligence Research group wrote in the paper .
On Monday evening Batra weighed in on the situation in a Facebook post :
While the idea of AI agents inventing their own language may sound alarming/unexpected to people outside the field , it is a well-established sub-field of AI , with publications dating back decades . Simply put , agents in environments attempting to solve a task will often find unintuitive ways to maximize reward . Analyzing the reward function and changing the parameters of an experiment is NOT the same as `` unplugging '' or `` shutting down AI . '' If that were the case , every AI researcher has been `` shutting down AI '' every time they kill a job on a machine .
Batra called certain media reports `` clickbaity and irresponsible . '' What 's more , the negotiating agents were never used in production ; it was simply a research experiment .
Other researchers have been critical of the fear-mongering reports on social media in recent days .
Researchers at Alphabet and Elon Musk-backed OpenAI are among those who have recently explored the field of agent-to-agent chat -- one of many areas where AI is being applied today -- and at times the agents have developed their own styles of communication , which researchers have been able to subsequently modify .
Notably Facebook released the underlying software and data set for its experiment alongside the academic paper . In other words , if Facebook were trying to do something in secret , this was n't it .

The Legislation Committee of the Board of Aldermen gave the penultimate necessary approval to a zoning change proposal that would allow the New Haven Register to sell its building to a store rather than a factory .
Committee members voted unanimously in favor of the proposal at a public hearing held Thursday night at City Hall . The change would convert the 13 Long Wharf acres occupied by the Register building into a “ general business ” district .
The change would make it easier for the Register to unload the property and afford to move its newsroom to a smaller downtown locale—a cornerstone of its new “ digital first ” policy . ( Click here to read a full story about the Register 's attempt to adapt to a changing media climate , and here to read a previous story about the fate of the paper 's present building ) .
The Long Wharf area was designated as a “ light industry zone ” several decades ago , when New Haven was still a manufacturing center . Most industrial tenants have left the area , which has come to feature a nightclub , Long Wharf Theatre , the 1 Long Wharf medical and office building , and IKEA .
Attorney Marc Wallman , who represents the newspaper , explained the need for the zoning change in succinct terms .
“ The Register can not stay [ in Long Wharf ] , ” he said . “ The building is largely unoccupied , and it 's very expensive . The Register needs to sell the property if it is to stay in New Haven , and it would be much easier to find a retail buyer than an industrial one . ”
Neighboring businesses also spoke in support of the proposal . Joshua Borenstein , Long Wharf 's managing director , explained that a quick transition to a new occupant is in the interest of all the ventures in the area .
“ The worst possible scenario is that the building remains vacant for a long time , ” which could happen if the zoning change does not happen , he said .
After hearing the testimony of several Register employees—including Publisher Tom Wiley and Community Engagement Editor Angela Carter—the committee agreed to send the proposal to the full board .
Economics Vs. Traffic
Although much of the hearing was dedicated to discussion of the Register 's future , the question officially at hand was whether or not a general business district is the most appropriate zone for the Sargent Drive property .
The entire Legislation Committee expressed support for the zoning proposal , arguing that a retail establishment would create jobs , boost existing neighboring businesses , and make the Long Wharf area generally more attractive .
Dixwell Alderwoman Jeanette Morrison said that she worked for 10 years at the Department of Children and Families , which off located on Sargent Drive behind the Register .
“ I think [ the zoning change ] is an excellent idea ! ” she said . “ That area is very dark at night . And because you have so many different businesses , you have the DCF , medical providers , and all these people that come in and out throughout the evening , to have a vibrant business that might be well lit would make it a safer area . We need to look at economic development , but we also need to make sure that people feel safe . ”
Morrison also raised concerns about traffic from a large store . She explained that the cars of the neighborhood 's many tenants—including Gateway Community College and La Quinta Inn and Suites—often create jams .
“ If you do n't get out of there a little before 5 , you can be stuck in traffic 20 , 30 , maybe 40 minutes just trying to get out , ” she said . “ My concern is that in bringing a retail business , how would the new owners deal with traffic coming in and out . Would there be alternative routes ? Because right now there 's only one way in and one way out . ”
Joe Balskus , a traffic engineer who worked with the Register to draft the zone change proposal , responded that although a retailer would indeed bring more traffic to the area , the problem could be easily fixed . Widening certain roads and adjusting the length of green lights on strategic traffic stops could do a lot to prevent the jams , he said .
“ You can add more traffic and still have shorter waiting times , ” he claimed .
Unnamed Potential Buyers
Joe Miller , the executive vice-president of the Register 's parent corporation , had only vague words about the property 's potential buyers . He said that the company has already been approached by specific investors and users who are interested in the site .
“ Because of confidentially concerns , we are n't saying too much about it , ” he said when asked about those potential buyers and whether any foreign money is behind any potential deals .
The zoning proposal still needs approval from the full Board of Aldermen .
A day after THR reported that Michael Arndt has been working with Lucasfilm for several months on a treatment for the new Star Wars movie , Lucasfilm has confirmed that the Toy Story 3 scribe will write the screenplay for Episode VII .
Arndt had written a 40- to 50-page treatment that will bring the saga of the Skywalkers , the Force-imbued family comprising Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and twins Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa , to a close in a new trilogy . The story is said to focus on a new generation of heroes and would feature appearances by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in older incarnations of their beloved characters from the original Star Wars trilogy .
RELATED : New Star Wars Movie Has Treatment By 'Toy Story 3 ' Writer
Sources have said not to discount the possibility that a number of characters from previous Star Wars films could reappear — even the dead Jedis , who have a habit of showing up in spirit form .
The next step for Lucasfilm 's Kathleen Kennedy , who is overseeing the production of the new movies for Disney , is to hire a director . One name popping up consistently amongst insiders is Brad Bird , though insiders say no choice has been made and Bird already is working on another top-secret sci-fi project for the studio .
Arndt , repped by Verve , is described as a huge Star Wars fan and well-versed in the lore of the mythology . He won an Oscar for his script for Little Miss Sunshine and was nominated for his work on Toy Story 3 , helping make the Pixar movie the most emotional of the three . He also co-wrote the screenplay for the upcoming Hunger Games sequel Catching Fire .
Donald Trump promises a lot of charitable donations , but a Washington Post investigation found that over a seven-year period , Trump donated a maximum of $ 10,000 . Though Trump did spend $ 12,000 getting the Trump Foundation to buy him football souvenirs using other people 's money .
But just because Trump does n't give to charity does n't mean he ca n't take credit for millions going to charity .
One of the largest and most popular venues for these events is Donald Trump 's Mar-a-Lago club , where money is raised each year for charities like the American Heart Association . Trump has pointed to the money raised at the club as evidence of his own philanthropy , telling CNBC in 2011 , “ I believe there is more money in that club for charity than any other place in Florida . I mean , the place has been amazing , the kind of money we raise on a weekly basis , and I just believe that you have to give back and if you do n't give back , you 're not being honest with yourself . ”
Trump uses his facilities to raise millions for charity . Which sounds lovely . Except it 's not as if Trump is donating use of his locations …
As the owner of Mar-a-Lago , Trump brings in millions of dollars in revenue for his company by hosting these major charity events each year . … The fees for services provided by Mar-a-Lago — the venue , food , and drinks — can comprise more than half the total price for the major events .
Donald Trump is telling the truth when he brags about how Mar-a-Lago is used to raising millions for charity . What he 's not saying is that , rather than being a donor to those charities , he 's one of the biggest beneficiaries .
The Miami Hurricanes played their most complete game of the season and romped Loyola Md 71-48 this evening at the BUC .
The game was not nearly as close as the score .
In a game Coach Larranaga probably wishes he could bottle up and replicate time and time again for 2014 , UM ended this calendar year on a very strong note .
Miami opened the game on a 14-2 run behind the all around game of Davon Reed . When he was n't swishing open jumpers or getting fouled , he was finding teammates for good looks and causing havoc defensively .
Two three pointers by Eric Laster cut the lead to 3 , but UM tightened up their 2-3 zone and completely took over .
Miami 's length on the perimeter caused issues for Loyola all night long .
Rion Brown got hot from deep , and James Kelly used his athleticism and deep shooting touch to supplement the D and spark a monster run .
The lead quickly swelled to double figures and eventually the 'Canes doubled up the Greyhounds . During the very efficient stretch Brown also flushed a Grant Hill-esque alley hoop that was as good a finish as you will see .
In another promising development , the 'Canes also got a nice contribution from Tonye Jekiri ( 6 first half points ) . Jekiri would finish with 10 points , and has now surpassed his career high in back to back games .
Reed had 5 first half assists and RB and Kelly led the way with 11 points a piece . Brown also soared to 8 big first half boards , as UM would head to to intermission with a commanding 43-20 advantage .
UM shot 60 % from the floor in the first half .
In the second half , Miami kept the pressure up on D and pushed the ball inside on O , to complete the rout .
Donnavan Kirk was a presence on the offensive glass with a few nice stick backs in the final 20 minutes .
Brown would hit his 3rd and 4th triples of the game back-to-back to stretch it to 63-30 at the ten minute mark , and that was pretty much that .
The Greyhounds leading scorer Dylon Cormier , who came in averaging 24 ppg , was held in check with just 11 points on 4-12 shooting .
Loyola is certainly not an ACC type team , but they did hang around against UConn earlier this year . The fact that Miami was able to dismantle them so thoroughly is extremely encouraging .
They may not be the class of the conference this season , but certainly have a much better chance to make some noise , now that the roles seem to be defined and the team has an identity .
Next up : The Canes will test their new found success in the zone , against the master of the 2-3 , Jim Boeheim and his # 2 ranked Syracuse Orange . ( Saturday 1/4/14 2PM EST )
Technical Fouls : PLAYERS : None - TEAMS : None
The Berkeley Unified School District Board of Education discussed Wednesday the possibility of revising a districtwide elementary recess restriction policy , as well as an agenda item proposing a more community-oriented process for naming or renaming school sites and facilities .
The board first passed a recess restriction policy in November 2014 that allows certain staff members to restrict a student 's recess time as behavioral discipline . Common reasons for recess restriction range from noncompliance to class disruption .
During the 2014-15 academic year , more than 700 behavioral incidents , occurring mainly in classrooms and on playgrounds , led to recess restrictions , according to a report tracking restriction records from city elementary schools . Second- and third-grade students received significantly more recess restrictions than students in other grade levels .
Out of the elementary school demographic , 19 percent of students are black , yet nearly 33 percent of recess restrictions were given to black students . Similarly , 11 percent of the elementary demographic are special-needs students , and 26 percent of total recess restrictions were given to those students .
“ As you know , when this policy was authorized , there were a lot of parents opposed to the policy , ” said Sinead O'Sullivan , a Berkeley parent , during public comment . “ I am saddened now that the data is out to see that it is used disproportionately against students of color and students of special needs . ”
Judy Appel , board member and clerk , said she was concerned about the recess restriction policy after viewing the data . Appel said at the meeting that the recess restriction was intended to be an “ educational opportunity for teachers to work with kids at lunchtime or during recess ” but that she saw it being used as a “ strictly disciplinary measure ” after having seen the data presented .
Several elementary schools have yet to record recess restriction data . O'Sullivan , a parent of a student who attends LeConte Elementary School , said she is concerned about possible violations of the policy because some schools , such as LeConte and John Muir Elementary , have yet to report data .
“ I have repeatedly asked for the data ( from LeConte ) , and nobody would give it to me , ” O'Sullivan said at the meeting .
The board 's policy subcommittee is reviewing the policy in response to the compiled data report and community concerns , said board member Karen Hemphill at the meeting . The subcommittee seeks to include parent notification , length of recess restriction and frequency as possible revisions to the policy , Hemphill said . In addition , Appel suggested gathering feedback from school administrators and teachers to see how the policy is working in their respective school .
“ I totally understand the importance of ( disciplinary measures ) , but we do need to know that there are alternatives , ” Appel said at the meeting . “ We need to have that be a last resort . ”
Subsequently , the board discussed a policy that aims to establish streamlined processes for district members , including parents and school staff , to petition a name change of a school or school facility , according to board member Josh Daniels .
The review process would examine the individual after whom the building is named in “ light of the Berkeley community 's contemporary view on history and morality , ” the item said .
“ I think it 's an important point that the community 's views are critical , ” Daniels said at the meeting . “ The names are often meaningful to the community and ( alumni of ) the school . ”
The board , however , holds final jurisdiction over any naming or renaming process and will return to the item at a later meeting .

Ideological and religious differences will continue to limit ISIL 's ability to recruit from Afghan Taliban . On March 25 , 2015 , Afghan President Ashraf Ghani told the United States Congress that Afghanistan was the “ front line ” against the “ terrible threat ” of the self-proclaimed caliphate , the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) .
In February , the Pentagon spokesman had called ISIL 's presence in Afghanistan “ nascent at best ” , but by October , the US commander in Afghanistan , General John Campbell , said that the group had transitioned from “ nascent ” to “ operationally emergent ” . It had a presence , he said , in two regions of Afghanistan : Helmand and Farah provinces in the southwest and Nangarhar in the east , along the border with Pakistan .
Both leaders warned of ISIL 's threat as they tried to persuade US President Barack Obama to rescind his decision to withdraw , with the exception of a training mission , all US troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016 . Hence , they had incentives to magnify the threat , however sincere their evaluation . How dangerous is the threat ? We can analyse ISIL 's ideology , ability to recruit , financial base , organisational capacity , and operational environment .
At a track two meeting between the Taliban and other Afghans held in Doha in May 2015 , all participants agreed that “ the so-called Islamic State [ ISIL ] is alien to the tradition and the desires of the Afghan people ” . Some have speculated , however , that a portion of the Taliban might join ISIL out of unhappiness with the current leadership or to gain access to resources .
Antagonistic ideologies
The Afghan Taliban ( or the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ) and ISIL are often lumped together as jihadi organisations , but their ideologies are distinct , even antagonistic .
ISIL preaches a version of jihad that 's a militant form of contemporary Islamist political ideology that seeks to re-establish the caliphate , a state with jurisdiction over all Muslims , and enforce a harsh version of Islamic law based on a literal interpretation of the Quran and sayings and practises of the Prophet .
The Taliban , however , belong to the Deobandi school of Hanafi Islam . They accept Afghanistan as a nation-state and indeed express pride in its history . They have repeatedly said that their jihad is limited to their own country .
The Taliban 's leader , Mullah Akhtar Mansoor , like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of ISIL , uses the title “ Amir al-Mu'minin ” ( commander of the believers ) . For ISIL , this title signifies authority over all ( Sunni ) Muslims ( they consider Shia to be non-Muslim ) .
For Mansoor , and Mullah Omar before him , the title signifies leadership of a jihad . Afghan Amir Dost Mohammad Khan took the same title in 1836 when he recaptured Peshawar from the Sikhs . The King of Morocco and the Sultan of Sokoto in Nigeria also use the title without making any claim to pan-Islamic authority .
One group now in Afghanistan has recently renounced its affiliation to the Afghan Taliban and given allegiance to Baghdadi and ISIL : the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) , which Pakistan 's military has pushed out of the tribal areas and into Afghanistan .
The IMU has questioned the Taliban 's account of Mullah Omar 's death and shifted allegiance to ISIL . There is no sign yet that ISIL recognises the IMU 's adherence . According to some reports , the IMU fought alongside the Taliban in the September 2015 capture of Kunduz , despite ISIL-Taliban antagonism .
Sectarian differences
Ideological and religious differences have limited the ability of ISIL to recruit , even from aggrieved Afghan Taliban . Since the July 29 revelation that Mullah Omar had died in April 2013 , a dispute over succession has provoked significant opposition , including from Omar 's family . No Taliban leader who questioned the choice of Mansoor as a successor has been reported to consider Baghdadi as an alternative amir .
Despite differences , they have followed the advice of an open letter that Mansoor wrote to Baghdadi in June and have not created a parallel organisation . The letter accused Baghdadi of inciting divisions among Muslims and weakening jihad by trying to extend his authority to Afghanistan .
The best-known exception to the rule that Afghan Taliban do not join ISIL , Abdul Rauf Khadim , proves that sectarian differences can be decisive . Khadim , whom ISIL had appointed deputy amir of Khurasan province and was killed by a drone in July 2015 , had been expelled from the Afghan Taliban . While detained in Guantanamo , Khadim accepted the jihadist preaching of his Arab cellmates .
The cell of ISIL formerly led by Khadim is reportedly still in southwest Afghanistan , but it does not control territory . Nearly all surviving leaders of ISIL in Afghanistan are former members of the Pakistan Taliban .
A fragmented coalition
Former Pakistan Taliban members dominate ISIL 's sole territorial foothold in Afghanistan , which consists of about seven districts in eastern Nangarhar province , adjacent to the Pakistan border .
The ISIL leadership recognises the leaders of this area as officials of the caliphate . Hafiz Saeed , a former Pakistan Taliban member from Orakzai agency , whom ISIL central in Raqqa , Syria has appointed as amir of Khurasan province , is the top ISIL authority there . Saeed is aided by a few Arabic-speaking emissaries sent by ISIL central , who have also brought cash . Local Afghans report that the ISIL has more money than the Taliban ( there is no government presence in the area ) .
There was some speculation that ISIL established itself in this area to fund itself through control over the opiate trade , but instead it has decreed its signature punishment of beheading for participation in the narcotics industry .
Special brutality
ISIL has brought its special brutality to eastern Afghanistan . In one case , Saeed massacred 10 elders from Achin accused of supporting the Taliban by detonating explosives on which he had forced them to sit . This incident was so egregious that his deputy , Mawlawi Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost , a former Guantanamo inmate , broke with him . The two also differed on strategy : Muslim Dost , an Afghan and former Talib , wanted to fight the Pakistan army , while Saeed , a former member of the Pakistan Taliban , argued for military offensives to capture Nangarhar and Logar provinces of Afghanistan .
At present , there is little space for ISIL to expand in Afghanistan . While Afghanistan remains in a state of civil conflict , almost all of its territory is controlled by either the government or the Taliban , both hostile to ISIL . ISIL can not appear as in parts of Iraq , Syria , or Libya as the only force able to restore order .
A Swedish children 's TV show is taking an…interesting approach to teaching children about menstruation . The Barnkanalen children 's channel is set to air “ The Period Song ” on Friday , a short , public service-y video featuring dancing tampons , a handsome , guitar-strumming young man , and , yes , a rap breakdown .
`` You should be able to talk about the most natural thing as half the world 's population is involved , '' the channel 's programming head said in a statement .
Here are some sample lyrics , according to a Guardian translation :
It 's a thing that happens to girls sometimes
They do n't want to talk about it
Maybe they 're a bit ashamed
They do n't want us to know anything at all
But we know , that it , it 's something totally normal
We just need to be a little extra nice to them
Show a little patience
It 's just a little blood
Period , period , hip hip hooray for period !
The body 's working as it should
And that is really , really good—hooray !
If this seems a tad bizarre , keep in mind that the same Swedish children 's channel caused a stir earlier this year when it released a video featuring dancing cartoon genitals . The point there , the channel said , was to teach children about the human body .
Swedish broadcasters are n't the only ones taking wildly inventive approaches to introducing kids to menstruation . A “ Period Party ” kit , released by the doll maker Lammily last month , teaches children about periods by equipping a realistic , Barbie-like doll with underwear , menstrual pads , and an educational pamphlet .
“ I just do n't think that something as core to a woman 's life and health as menstruation should be seen as embarrassing in any way , shape , or form , “ Nickolay Lamm , the doll 's creator , told Upworthy . “ If it were n't for menstruation , I would n't even be alive right now ! ”
Hipp hurra för mens ! , indeed .

Power brokers at 2011 St. Moritz conference agreed US “ has no intentions of ever leaving Iraq ”
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , July 7 , 2011
Last month we reported that the occupation of Iraq would be “ prolonged indefinitely ” and that a substantial number of U.S. troops would remain in the country beyond the December 31 deadline , which is precisely what transpired yesterday when the Obama administration announced its intention to abandon the original withdrawal plan .
“ The Obama administration has been debating how large a force to propose leaving in Iraq . It made its proposal now in hopes of spurring a request from Prime Minister Nouri Maliki 's government , and to give the Pentagon time to plan , the officials said , ” reports the L.A. Times , confirming that plans for a full withdrawal by the end of the year have been all but scrapped .
Senator John McCain has also called for 10-13,000 US troops to remain in the country for for “ intelligence capabilities ” .
Of course , these troops will be supplemented by security guards , mercenaries and innumerable other assets , swelling that figure by tens of thousands .
How were we able to forecast that efforts would be made to prolong the occupation beyond the set deadline ? We did n't have to rely on any crystal balls – we were merely going on leaked information from the 2011 Bilderberg Group meeting – a conference of global power brokers that the establishment media still claims has no influence on world affairs .
While the mainstream press was busy obsessing about Weiner 's Weiner and claiming Bilderbergers were merely gathering to play golf and idly stroll through the mountains of St. Moritz , Bilderberg members themselves were busy forming the consensus on the big issues , namely Iraq .
Stock up with Fresh Food that lasts with eFoodsDirect ( AD )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As we first reported last month , in looking to exploit some form of “ squatter 's rights ” in Iraq , the US “ has no intentions of ever leaving Iraq , ” according to leaked information from moles inside the conference which has proven routinely accurate in the past .
“ When you think of Iraq , think big , ” one US Bilderberger remarked during the discussion , suggesting that the country will merely be used as a launch pad for a wider regional war that will “ include every nation in the Middle East except for Israel . ”
We reported these leaks more than two weeks before the Obama administration announced its intention to scrap the withdrawal plan which mandated that the US presence end on December 31 .
This is yet another example of how the consensus that is set at the annual Bilderberg meetings has an almost immediate impact on world affairs , just as it has many times in the past , notably when Bilderbergers agreed that the initial invasion of Iraq was to be delayed until 2003 when most observers had fully expected it to take place in the autumn of 2002 .
Barack Obama swept to power on the promise that he would “ immediately ” withdraw troops from Iraq .
In reality , even before the August 2010 “ withdrawal ” of U.S. troops , the New York Times reported that , “ Mr . Obama plans to leave behind a “ residual force ” of tens of thousands of troops to continue training Iraqi security forces , hunt down foreign terrorist cells and guard American institutions . ”
When the supposed August 2010 “ withdrawal ” was announced , a senior military officer spelled it out more plainly to the Los Angeles Times , “ ‘ When President Obama said we were going to get out within 16 months , some people heard , ‘ get out , ' and everyone 's gone . But that is not going to happen , ' the officer said . ”
While telling the American people one thing publicly , the Obama administration has fallen in line with the carefully contrived consensus of the global elite in ensuring the U.S. occupation of Iraq becomes a permanent fixture for many years and even decades to come .

Atlantis showcases on track for June 29 opening day
It 's T-minus 3 weeks and counting until the grand opening of the space shuttle Atlantis attraction at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida , just miles from where the orbiter was processed and launched on 33 missions .
Final touches are being made to the exhibits , interactive displays and simulators inside the 90,000-square-foot home purpose-built to house the retired shuttle , as well as topping off the full-size , high-fidelity mockup of an external tank and solid rocket booster stack in front of the $ 100 million facility .
`` We are on schedule to open June 29 . Everything is a GO , '' said Tim Macy , KSCVC 's director of project development .
On Friday , photographers and reporters were invited inside for a sneak peek at how things are progressing . The life-size Hubble Space Telescope replica was being hoisted into place adjacent to Atlantis during the media visit , crews were hooking up spacewalk simulators and workers outside were busy readying the upper section of the external tank for lifting into place .
Atlantis ' payload bay doors were opened last month , the protective covers removed from the cockpit windows and a replica 50-foot-long robot arm was installed and secured with suspension lines from the ceiling .
Tourists will experience Atlantis illuminated by more than 1,700 theatrical lights as a video of space scenes is played on a massive screen behind the shuttle .
Officials expect to soon begin using employees and even tourists to go through the Atlantis hall for rehearsals and demonstration tests to ensure all systems are operating properly before opening day on Saturday , June 29 .

Some residents on the Greek island of Chios are up in arms over the banning of rocket firing on the eve of Orthodox Easter .
Villagers from two rival parishes compete to see who can hit the other 's church the most times .
But this year the centuries-old ‘ rouketopolemos ' , as it 's known ,
has been forbidden by the authorities after complaints by some people living near the churches , whose homes are often damaged by the rockets .
“ Unfortunately , this year the rocket war can not be conducted due to the fact that many people have complaints about the damages that rocket war causes every year ” , said local man John Tatsis . “ But those people are not a lot , only 20 , I think . I 'm very disappointed about the decision that the authorities took , and I hope that next year this tradition will be continued . ”
The ban led to flag-carrying protests from those who want to see the tradition maintained , and some have even gone as far as to defy the ban .
Rockets could be seen being fired on Saturday evening . According to villagers more than 20,000 hand-made rockets had been prepared for the festival and some people just could n't resist launching them .
The Roma midfielder is in awe of his former club 's attacking trident and feels Luis Enrique 's men will have little trouble turning their treble triumph into a sextet success
Seydou Keita says that Barcelona have the best forward line in the world , claiming that it is `` unreal '' that the Catalans have been able to put Neymar and Luis Suarez in the same team as Lionel Messi .
Messi , of course , has spent his entire professional career to date at Camp Nou and he was joined in Catalunya by Brazil superstar Neymar in 2013 , while Suarez arrived from Liverpool last summer .
Uruguay international Suarez was only able to make his Blaugrana debut in October , as he was still serving a four-month ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at Brazil 2014 , and the striker initially took time to settle in his new surroundings .
However , he went on to play a key role in Barça 's treble triumph , with Suarez , Messi and Neymar racking up a record-breaking 122 goals between them as the Catalans claimed La Liga , the Copa del Rey and the Champions League .
“ Everyone knows it 's the best forward line in world football , '' former Barça midfielder Keita told the club 's official website . `` It was unreal for them to score as many goals as they did last season .
`` And it 's also unreal for a team to have three strikers of such class at the same time . Even with Suarez suspended for four months things worked out very well for them . ''
Keita , of course , was part of the Barça squad that won the treble in 2009 , under Pep Guardiola , but he was reluctant to compare Pep Guardiola 's side to the current team .
However , the Roma midfielder fully expects Luis Enrique 's men to add the Supercopa de Espana , Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup to their collection before the year is out .
“ It 's hard to compare two very different times , '' Keita added . `` Now they can win all six titles as well .
`` It is much harder to win the treble than the sextet . It takes five games to win the two Super Cups and the Club World Cup , a lot less than winning the Champions League or la Liga .
`` I would n't say the job is already done , but they are very close and they have the squad to do it . ”
Windows Phone : adding a first run tutorial to your app [ Feb. 5th , 2014|09:33 pm ] Greg

My Marriage Map app has gotten some bad reviews complaining about missing features that were actually present in the app . So , I decided to make a quick tutorial that would point out how to use the app the first time the user ran it . I did a quick search for some sample code but could n't find any , so I rolled my own . ( download the latest version of the app to try it out ! ) It features
graying out and disabling of controls under it
detecting first launch
ability to launch the tutorial again ( from the About page in my case )
back button goes back
nice fading in and out of tutorial steps
ability to highlight buttons , etc . in different steps
suspend/tombstone support
looks correct in dark or light theme
if taps are too close together , will ignore the second one None of these were particularly difficult , but adding them all took a bit of work . So I made a sample project with the same system to make it easier to add to your apps .
FirstRunTutorial.wp.zip
Some notes on the code :
Search for TODO to find places you need to make changes .
The _firstRunActive and _firstRunIndex keep track of whether we 're showing the tutorial and what step it 's on .
and keep track of whether we 're showing the tutorial and what step it 's on .
Most of the work happens in UpdateFirstRunCanvas ( ) - this is where you have to add new steps . Do n't forget to update MAX_FIRSTRUNINDEX when you do !
- this is where you have to add new steps . Do n't forget to update when you do !
The fading is done by a bunch of Storyboard objects in MainPage.xaml . ( see the Animation Overview for Windows Phone for more info ) Unfortunately , the best way I could find to make things fade was to set their opacity to 0.0 , make them visible , and then run the Storyboard to transition the opacity to 1.0 ( or whatever you want ) . This means you have to make two different calls to make this work . On fading out , you have to do the opposite - transition the opacity to 0.0 and then make it collapsed , but the HideWhenDone ( ) method that gets run when the Storyboard is done takes care of making it collapsed .

Making the button blink is also handled by a Storyboard - you can try different EasingFunctions to make it blink differently !
Disabling controls under the tutorial is handled in SetFirstRunActive ( ) . I was hoping that just putting the FirstRunCanvas with a high z-index would make it be on top of everything and intercept their clicks , but for some reason that did n't work .

RemoveBackAll=1 & Tutorial=1 , and OnNavigatedTo ( ) in MainPage.xaml starts the tutorial .

The Iranian authorities must immediately halt the execution of Mahmoud Barati , a teacher who was convicted of drug-related offences following an unfair trial that is believed to have included a confession obtained through torture and other ill-treatment , Amnesty International said .
According to contacts in Ghezel Hesar prison , Mahmoud Barati has been transferred to solitary confinement and is scheduled to be executed at dawn tomorrow morning ( 8 September 2015 ) .
“ Mahmoud Barati 's execution must immediately be halted . International law does not allow for the use of death penalty for drug-related offences . The Iranian authorities must immediately quash his death sentence , ” said Audrey Gaughran , Director of Global Issues at Amnesty International .
“ The Iranian authorities must end their unprecedented killing spree – more than 700 people have been executed so far this year , most of them convicted on drug-related charges . ”

According to a contact in Ghezel Hesar prison , following his arrest 10 years ago , Mahmoud Barati was held in a detention centre of the Office to Combat Drug Offences for 10 days where he was allegedly subjected to torture and other ill-treatment to “ confess ” . He subsequently made statements to both the prosecutor and the court retracting these “ confessions ” .

The prison contact also raised concerns that the principal witness against Mahmoud Barati may have retracted his testimony .
Iran 's Anti-Narcotics Law provides mandatory death sentences for a range of drug-related offences , including trafficking more than 5kg of narcotics derived from opium or more than 30g of heroin , morphine , cocaine or their chemical derivatives .
This is in direct breach of international law , which restricts the use of the death penalty to only the “ most serious crimes ” – those involving intentional killing . Drug-related offences do not meet this threshold .
There is also no evidence to prove that the death penalty is a particular deterrent to crime and drug trafficking or use . Earlier this year , the deputy of Iran 's Centre for Strategic Research admitted that the death penalty has not been able to reduce drug trafficking levels .

A Redditor on r/fantasy asked the following question : Can women Writers write ( non romance ) epic fantasy ?
To his credit , as with many of the people who have asked this question , he had a genuine desire to understand . So no bashing , BUT since this question keeps coming up over and over , I wanted a blog post so I could just copy/paste my answer henceforth . I made a couple of comments on his post , and I thought it might be nice to clean up my poor grammar and draw my comments together in a more coherent manner for future reference .
As I 've stated before , I 've noticed that this question has been introduced by both men AND women at various times in different forums , so I do n't think this is a question posed by only male fans . For future reference , here is what I said :
If a woman is writing epic fantasy , she is not writing romance . The misconception about `` romance in epic fantasy '' stems from a misunderstanding of the tropes within romance novels and the tropes within epic fantasy .
Each of the genres follows different plot arcs .
If you want to understand how the tropes and plot arcs work in romance , please read this very insightful post by Ilona Andrews called Brief Analysis of Alphahole Trope in Romantic Fiction . While Ilona is speaking primarily to the trope of the alpha male , she does give an excellent overview of the plotting arc utilized when writing romance .
If you are reading epic fantasy , you will not experience the same plot arcs as a romance novel ( i.e . girl meets boy , boy is asshole , asshole is redeemed , couple lives happily ever after -- see Ilona 's post for a much better description of how this works ) . Most often in fantasy , especially epic fantasy , the entire plot and characterization of the story are developed around an adventure of some kind . Fantasy is usually about the rise and fall of kingdoms , the slaying of monsters , and bringing myths to life . Therefore the plot and characterization of the story are developed in order to bring down kingdoms , slay monsters , or bring myths to life , and so on and so forth .
HOWEVER , the story , which is about bringing down kingdoms , slaying monsters , or bringing myths to life , will also involve characters . These characters will develop relationships of all kinds . Some will hate each other , others will tolerate one another , and some will even FALL IN LOVE .
This often comes as a shock to many people , but even epic fantasy by men has romantic elements involved in the story . I wrote about that with We Need No Stinkin ' Romance .
Romantic elements in epic fantasy novels written by men often experience romance through the male gaze , which is probably why male readers do n't notice them as much as the romantic elements in a story written through the female gaze . Men and women focus on different aspects of one another while in a relationship .
The best way to contrast the issue is by looking at the difference in how sex is presented in a television show such as `` Game of Thrones '' vs . `` Outlander . '' Take any sex scene in `` Game of Thrones '' and put it up against the wedding night scene in `` Outlander . '' `` Game of Thrones '' is one hundred percent male gaze with the camera focused on the objectification of the female body whereas in the `` Outlander '' scene , the camera is focused entirely on Jamie , AND with a heavy emphasis on Claire leading Jamie through the act .
These same `` camera shifts '' are going on in novels through the perspectives of the main characters as seen through the author 's eyes . Whether the focus is on `` tits and dragons '' ( as Ian McShane so eloquently put it ) , or on the emotional aspect of the relationship , can sometimes depend on the gender of the author , but not always .
When I wrote `` We Need No Stinkin ' Romance , '' there was a really nice discussion thread on r/fantasy about the post , and someone pointed out the difference in how men handled the romantic elements in their novels vs. how women wrote . From the male perspective , the fictional men were n't always taking the fictional women 's feelings or desires into consideration . `` Romance '' was a matter of pursuit and conquest . This was n't happening in all of the novels written by men , but by most .
Couple that with most people 's built-in prejudices and misconceptions about romance being girly and icky ( and when I was my late teens/early twenties , I thought that , too ) , and suddenly readers are seeing `` romance novel '' where none exists .
So it 's not that women are writing more romance into their epic fantasy , or that romance is bad , it 's that women are simply writing character interactions from a different perspective . It 's still epic fantasy , and women authors deserve the same respect as their male peers for turning out quality stories with or without romantic elements .
In 2010 , dozens of people gathered in a Brooklyn art gallery to smell each other 's unlaundered t-shirts . This was no fetish party , but an attempt at seduction through smell . The premise of the “ Pheromone Party ” was simple : unzip one of the many numbered bags containing someone else 's previously worn t-shirt and take a sniff . If you like what you smell , a date with the owner could be on the cards .
This olfactory outing was a success , and subsequent Pheromone Parties have now been held in Los Angeles and London . According to one magazine , they are for people “ hoping to find love using their sense of smell and faith in science ” .
The idea that human pheromones influence our chances of sex and love permeates pop culture
The idea that human pheromones influence our chances of sex and love permeates pop culture . It means some people are even willing to buy perfumes called ‘ love potions ' . Some contain androstenone – the most potent of all sexual attractants – which its sellers claim increases the libido of women while simultaneously making men more attractive . Androstenol , meanwhile , is promised to make you seem more approachable to the opposite sex . Other pheromones are sold as “ icebreakers ” , masculinity boosters , and chemical comforters during sexual intimacy .
So , does the science actually show that pheromones transform our prospects of sex ? Is love literally in the air , or do humans just smell ?
The term pheromone was coined in 1959 . Peter Karlson and Martin Luscher , two researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Munich , Germany , argued that within the cloud of molecules produced by animals some were more special than others . They were similar to hormones within the blood , but emitted away from the body , influencing the behaviour and physiology of others . Rather than just odours – a broad term for molecules that can elicit a spectrum of responses – pheromones were shaped over evolutionary time between members of the same species for a precise purpose .
That same year , the first pheromone was discovered . Produced by female silkworm moths ( Bombyx mori ) , the molecule Bombykol attracts the attention of males from miles around . It is a sex pheromone , an airborne aphrodisiac . Bombykol fit the definition of a pheromone perfectly . It was simple , just a single molecule . It was specific , working only on that moth species . And it elicited a stereotyped response ; time and time again males would flutter to the source of this molecule even when there was no female to be seen .
Excitement was in the air . Hormones were old news , and pheromones were the new thing . Shortly after this doublet of studies , one author wrote : “ Endocrinology has flowered magnificently in the last 40 years ; exocrinology is now about to blossom . ”
And so it did . Pheromones started to speckle and then spread through the scientific literature . On every branch of the tree of life , from microbes to mice , these chemical cues seemed to be influencing behaviour and physiology of others . Pheromones floated through the air , swirled in the oceans , and adhered to the ground . Some were even passed along directly , from individual to individual , like personal molecular messages .
Sex pheromones were just the beginning . Each discovery brought another distinctive purpose into the fold , from reshaping the reproductive cycles of prospective mates to acting as memory devices .
And , in 1971 , humans were brought into the mix for the first time .
It began with a finding that has now become common wisdom : when in close proximity , the menstrual cycles of women converge , like synchronising body clocks . The idea is founded and backed by a famous study from Martha McClintock , then a student at Wellesley College in Massachusetts , published in the journal Nature . In a sample of 135 female students sharing a suburban dormitory for six months , menses became closer and closer together as time went on . Ever since , this heavily cited study has been used as evidence for the existence of human pheromones , priming females to the same period .
Every storyteller wants it to be true , but it probably is n't happening – Tristram Wyatt , University of Oxford
“ Every storyteller wants it to be true , ” says Tristram Wyatt from the University of Oxford . “ But analysed in more detail , it probably is n't happening. ” A plethora of studies have failed to replicate McClintock 's original findings , and after poring over the data , one of her post-doctoral researchers found that it might be a statistical artifact . In other words , this phenomenon is just as likely to occur by chance as through chemical communication . The frequency , length ( five days out of 28 ) , and variability of menstruation in women make synchronisation very likely .
Back in the 70s , however , the apparent discovery was the source of much excitement . Off the back of McClintock 's study , the British physician Alex Comfort published a commentary titled the Likelihood of Human Pheromones , stating that it would not be long until the first human pheromone was discovered .
He was right .
That same year , H A Cook , writing in New Scientist , purported to have found at least two examples in human breath and sweat . One , as far as he could judge , had the same odour of garlic . “ This occurs in human female breath when the female is sexually aroused , and is not caused by the eating of garlic , ” he wrote at the time . Cook went on to suggest that this pheromone aroused males , and was the reason women use small amounts of garlic in cooking . “ The second human pheromone is the smell of fear , which is certainly apparent to dogs , ” he continued , not taking into account the species-specificity of pheromones .
Such claims were easily discounted and ignored . But others stuck . Follow the trail of supposed sex pheromones in humans and you arrive at a conference held in Paris in 1991 .
Earlier that year , Linda Buck and Richard Axel , two biochemists from Columbia University in New York , had discovered a family of olfactory receptors in mice , each encoded by a single gene . Within a mammal 's nose , each receptor binds to a specific odorant , initiating a cascade of signals along neurons in to the brain . Like an olfactory barcode , different ratios and amounts are translated into different smells . “ This was the first time we could see how we smell , ” says Wyatt . In 2004 , the two researchers were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work .
And yet , at the 1991 conference , another study stood out . A couple of psychiatrists from the University of Utah claimed to have found two sex pheromones in humans . “ They came along and they made this big splash , ” recalls Richard Doty , director of the University of Pennsylvania 's Smell and Taste Center in Philadelphia . “ But everybody thought it was a little strange. ” In 49 volunteers , their ‘ putative human pheromones ' were said to increase the electrical activity between the vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) and the brain . In mice , and many other mammals , the VNO , or “ secondary nose ” , detects a cocktail of chemical cues independently of the primary olfactory system .
A study from 2000 , written by McClintock , supported their findings and pushed the use of human pheromones into vogue .
However , there is no evidence that old world monkeys and great apes , including humans , have the ability to detect such chemical cues in the same way as mice . We simply do n't possess a functional VNO . Not only is the organ reduced to a few pores inside our noses , the nerves between these structures and the brain simply do n't exist in these primates . It is a vestigial organ , a hopeless hangover from our deep mammalian ancestry .
“ There 's nothing like that in humans , ” says George Preti , from Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia . And yet , the same putative pheromones are still sold today .
In fact , some researchers , including Doty , believe that no mammals are strongly influenced by pheromones . “ There 's no evidence that there are signals controlling creatures the way we 'd like to think , ” he says . This viewpoint reached its apotheosis in the 1970s , with Doty commonly at the vanguard . Mammals , many argued , were far too complex to be at the whims of such simple molecules . As one author wrote in 1976 , “ One wonders at this point whether the pheromone concept , so useful in insect behaviour and physiology , should be bastardised to the point where it is used to cover situations in mammalian behaviour . ”
Take copulin , a collection of molecules discovered in the late 1960s in laboratory-kept rhesus monkeys . Secreted from the vagina of females , a waft of this supposed pheromone could beget sexual arousal , masturbation , and mounting from males . That much is true . But they were n't pheromones . The handful of males used in the study had met the females before , learnt their distinctive smell , and were simply getting turned on .
Copulin was more akin to a perfume than a pheromone . ( Which is apt – copulin is also used as an ingredient in the perfume industry . )
This example is n't alone , says Doty , and there are many examples of the term 's misuse in the literature . “ People just throw the term [ pheromone ] around , so it 's lost its scientific validity , ” he says . Many so-called pheromones contain so many chemicals that they defy the definition of simplicity . Others only work on certain test subjects , and not others . And , just like copulin , the majority can be explained by prior learning to distinctive odour cues .
Named after the heart-throb from Pride and Prejudice , the darcin protein attracts females , but also acts as a memory device
A few years ago , Jane Hurst from the University of Liverpool agreed with Doty . Mammals , and humans , were simply too complex for pheromones , she thought . Then , in 2010 , she discovered darcin , a single protein found in the urine of male mice . Named after the heart-throb from Pride and Prejudice , this protein not only attracts the attention of females , but also acts as a memory prompt , allowing the female to remember the male 's other distinctive odour print and where she came across it . It 's both an attractant and a learning device . Without it – sans just one signalling protein – the female just does n't have an interest in , or memory of , the opposite sex .
“ I have changed my mind , ” Hurst says . “ There are specific chemicals that have the right to be called pheromones . ”
To find darcin , Hurst and her colleagues went back to basics . Using the same formula as the original 1959 study on Bombykol , the active molecule was isolated from urine and tested again on mice , in isolation . Importantly , darcin alone elicited the same response as when using pure urine . And to remove any possibility that the mice learnt the smell of choice males , the females were reared in girl-only clubs , away from the sight , sound , or smell of male mice . Any response , therefore , was innate – a product of their genetics and normal development , and not conditioned to certain masculine cues they 've encountered during their life .
The question is , can we do the same for humans ? It seems highly unlikely . “ In humans it would be pretty much impossible to do the classic isolation of a pheromone , ” says Hurst . Years of learning , personal preferences , and a lack of reflexive responses can break down any carefully controlled trial . There could be any number of extraneous factors not taken into account , too many other explanations for conclusions drawn .
In humans it would be pretty much impossible to do the classic isolation of a pheromone
But that might not be true for newborns . “ Compared with testing adults , babies are easier , are less influenced by culture and learning , ” says Wyatt . And in 2009 , a study hinted at a possible point of interest . When breastfeeding , the areolar glands that encircle a mother 's nipple swell and secrete an accessory liquid to milk . When placed under the nose of babies , a stereotyped behaviour follows . They open their mouths , stick out their tongue , and start to suck . They try to feed .
Importantly , secretions taken from unrelated mothers can elicit the same suckling response , eliminating the possibility that the babies were just accustomed to their mother 's distinctive odours .
According to Wyatt , this areolar secretion is the best hope to find the first human pheromone . If isolated and synthesised in the lab , such a chemical cue could help with babies that do n't latch on – a major cause of infantile mortality in many developing nations . In rural Ghana , for instance , just a one-hour delay in suckling after birth accounts for an estimated 22 % of infantile mortality .
It would also help pheromone research as a whole . “ If we can find the mammary pheromone , it will give us more confidence to look for the pheromones that might work in adulthood , ” says Wyatt . “ And the conclusion might be that we do n't have pheromones . It still stands that no molecules have been identified . ”
At the moment , the only thing that can be said with certainty is that humans smell .

HUNTSVILLE – Randy Blain flew into action when he saw a man attacking a female police officer in Toronto .
The Huntsville resident was driving home from the Hospital for Sick Children with his daughter , Sophia , 8 , on June 14 when he glanced to his right at an intersection and saw a crowd of bystanders watching a man beat a police officer .
“ She was struggling and down on the ground , ” said Blain . “ I pulled my truck half off the road and said to Sophia , ‘ Daddy 's got to help this police officer . ' ”
He said he ran to the scene as fast as he could and hit the man in his side , which knocked him to the ground . The police officer was then able to radio for backup and Blain held the man while she cuffed him . Three to four other officers soon arrived and took the man into custody .
His involvement lasted about eight minutes , during which time female bystanders , at his request , stayed with his daughter .
“ This was n't a pre-meditated decision . It was just a reaction . I sort of feel a little shy about taking too much credit because I just did it , ” he said , noting it was the first time he had done something like that . “ But I will say , a citizen 's arrest is off my bucket list . ”
Blain described the attacker as smaller than him , but wiry and fast .
“ The officer should get some recognition for holding onto a guy like that . She could have let him go , ” he said . “ But she held onto him while she was getting beaten up . Good on her . ”
He said he asked the police officer after the assault about her condition . She had several injuries , but responded that she was OK , he said .
He noted his daughter is doing well , though she had tears in her eyes when he returned to the truck .

Valve 's yearly Dota 2 Championships , The International , which is now in its third year , have begun with nearly 400,000 concurrent live viewers within hours of going live .
The world 's best Dota 2 teams have descended onto Valve 's headquarters in Seattle to compete for what is now over $ 2.8 million in prize money . Teams have flown in from around the world , including 2011 International Champions Na'Vi from Ukraine , 2012 International Champions Invictus Gaming from China , and 2013 favorites Alliance from Sweden .
In addition to the main tournament , Valve will also be hosting a 1v1 Solo Championship , and an All-Star match with players voted on by the fans . Star players competing in both include Danil `` Dendi '' Ishutin from Na'Vi , Luo `` Ferrari '' Feichi from Invictus Gaming , Jonathan `` Loda '' Berg from Alliance , and Chai `` Mushi '' Yee Fung from Orange Esports . A full list of teams and competitors can be found on the official International site .
“ Despite the importance of the tournament itself , I think players will remember the Stars and 1v1 matches with great fondness , ” Dota 2 analyst Bruno Carlucci told GameSpot . “ One can only imagine how much some of these legends dreamt of playing with each other on a LAN environment , or even , for some of the youngest competitors , face their idols in a 1v1 and prove themselves to the world as the best individually skilled player . ”
The prize pool , which continues to increase by $ 2.50 with every purchase of the $ 10 Interactive Compendium , is the largest amount ever given out for a single-event in competitive gaming/eSports history .
“ TI3 is already the tournament with the biggest prize pool in eSports , ” Carlucci said . “ With such an amazing start in stream numbers , I 'm betting it will soon become the biggest tournament in stream viewer numbers as well . ”
Last year Riot 's Season 2 World Championships peaked at 1.1 million concurrent viewers watching online only , making it the most watched competitive gaming event of all time .
The International 3 Main Event will begin on August 7 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle , Washington . The entire event will be streamed on the in-game spectator client Dota TV , and on TwitchTV . GameSpot eSports will be at the event to sit down with Valve regarding the release of Dota 2 and The International , and provide live coverage all week long .
One of the core issues at the heart of the Greek financial crisis is the enormous reluctance of the Greeks to pay tax . It 's been estimated that the so-called shadow or black economy in Greece represents at least 30 % of gross domestic product .
Average tax payments in Greece should , if tax were paid , be more than 30 % of average income . So , when Greece 's current deficit is running at just over 13 % of its GDP it 's easy to see that if 30 % tax was collected on the 30 % shadow economy , then the deficit would fall to about 4 % of GDP overnight -- very close to the target , which is 3 % . In a nutshell , Greece 's problems could be almost solved if only all tax due was paid .
Of course the issue is not as simple as that . No one , anywhere , at any time , has completely solved the problem of tax evasion . It would be quite unrealistic to claim it is possible to do so . But Greece is far from alone in facing this issue , even if it is doing so at a scale no other European country suffers . In the U.K. , for example , I recently estimated that unpaid tax is a massively more significant issue than the government has ever recognized .
In November 2009 the U.K .government admitted there were 28 billion pounds ( or $ 40.8 billion ) of unpaid tax . That 's simply bad debt in the U.K. tax system .
On top of that there is , in my estimate -- and the number is hotly disputed -- $ 36.4 billion of tax avoidance a year in the U.K. , split broadly equally between companies and individuals .
Both , however , are dwarfed by U.K. tax evasion , which I estimate to be $ 101.9 billion a year . The total of these estimates comes to over $ 145.5 billion a year , of which the country 's tax authority admits to just over $ 72.8 billion .
That gap between the official estimate and mine is significant . The U.K. structural fiscal deficit , which is the ongoing gap between income and expenditure , is estimated to be around $ 72.7 billion a year .
Greece is not the only country that could solve its problems if more of the tax already due was collected ; the U.K. could as well .
President Barack Obama has already recognized this in part . He has given the IRS more resources to tackle offshore tax evasion , but in this respect he is unusual . The U.K. response to this crisis in tax collection is more commonplace : It is currently midway through a program of making a quarter of employees in its tax authority redundant .
This is the wrong response right now . Like Greece , the U.K. needs to collect the tax owed to it . The U.S. likewise needs to collect more of its $ 436.5 billion-plus tax gap . We all know times are going to be tough . But if that 's the case then those for whom it should be toughest should be the tax crooks living in our midst who refuse to pay their share for the society we all live in . Politically it must be just about the easiest argument on earth to sell . And all it needs to fulfill it is modest extra public spending on tax officials , who are bound , just about anywhere -- even in Greece -- to collect much more in tax than they cost to employ .
I predict that even those governments , like the U.K. 's , that refuse to accept this logic now will do so soon . Cutting public services , at least in Europe , is going to be deeply unpopular when it becomes intensely personal . The political backlash it will bring will be large across the spectrum . When that happens , collecting tax is going to look like a much more attractive option to all politicians .
In which case expects the taxman , wherever he is , to become a lot more aggressive sometime soon . And rightly so if the targets are those illegally ducking out of the system at present . There 's no better target to diminish the strain of the recession .

Foreigners are among the casualties , with the Erawan Emergency Center saying that a Filipino and Chinese citizen were among those killed .
National police Chief Somyot Pumpanmuang said on state TV that Chinese tourists who had traveled to Thailand from the Philippines had been killed . The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok later confirmed the report , telling China 's state-run Xinhua that three nationals had died in the blast , while another 15 Chinese tourists were injured , some seriously .
Hong Kong 's Immigration Department reported that three residents were among the injured .
It 's too early to say who orchestrated the attack , Somyot said there had been warnings about possible attacks , if not exactly when or where they might occur .
Suspicious items turn out to be garbage bags
The device that exploded was a pipe bomb wrapped in white cloth , Somyot said , according to the state news agency . Police earlier described it as a 3-kilogram `` improvised device . ''
The Thai police chief told reporters the bomb came from a motorcycle , though the Bangkok Post reported it was fastened to a utility pole .
Police have not officially stated whether they believe the bomb had a specific target .
Whatever its intentions , the damage was undeniable . Steve Herman , a correspondent and bureau chief for Voice of America , said he thought it was thunder when the explosion first went off .
He saw six bodies under sheets inside the shrine and one outside of it , Herman said .
Another reporter , The New York Times ' Thomas Fuller , said body parts were scattered around the area . He estimated that several hundred military and police officials , some of them using dogs , were scouring the scene for more bombs .
Police initially sealed off the scene near the popular Erawan Shrine because , they said at the time , a second bomb in the area remained active and needed to be defused . Bomb squad members in blast suits responded , and an officer announced over a loudspeaker , `` The situation is still not safe . Please all stay back . There might be another bomb in the area . ''

But Somyot said later the suspicious items were not bombs .
`` They are just garbage bags , '' he said . `` Our ( explosives ) team is still working at the site , and we will close down the traffic around the area until noon tomorrow . ''
Maj. Gen. Sirwara Rangsribhramnakul said security was subsequently tightened throughout the city . Asked how many security forces had been deployed , he replied , `` As much as we have . ''

Busy area for tourists , commuters
The blast did n't cause immediate , rampant panic , as some bystanders were milling around peacefully and a family apparently unaware of the explosion was enjoying a meal at a nearby McDonald 's , freelance journalist Adam Ramsey said .
Vyas , the Indian DJ , said he initially did n't know what to think of the explosion -- thinking , as his ears were ringing , that it seemed like a Hollywood movie or maybe a major car wreck .
`` But then I was like , yeah , this has to be a bomb because of the utter scale of devastation , '' he said early Tuesday . `` I could see it in front of my eyes . ''
With school out and many in the city commuting home at the time of the blast , locals were among those caught up in the mayhem . So , too , were tourists there to visit the shrine , shop in the mall or stay in the many area hotels .
`` There was traffic , everybody was honking , '' Vyas recalled . `` It ( was ) utter chaos and mayhem . ''
Along with hotels , there are numerous shopping centers in the area , Google Maps shows , including the Platinum Fashion Mall and Central World , reportedly one of the largest shopping malls in the world . The city 's Skytrain rumbles nearly overhead .
The area was the target of another bombing in February when two explosive devices detonated near the entrance of a luxury shopping mall , Siam Paragon , 2013 's most Instagrammed location in the world . The mall is just over a block away from the shrine . No one was injured in that blast .
Though Buddhism is the predominant religion in Thailand , there are many Hindu shrines in Bangkok , and the Erawan Shrine is the best known among them , according to an English-language website providing news and tourism information about the country .
Streams of people pay respects at the shrine from early morning until late at night . Thais and foreign visitors make ceremonial offerings , ranging from floral garlands and fruits to teakwood elephants in the hope their wishes will be fulfilled , according to another tourist site
The shrine houses a golden statue of Phra Phrom , the Thai representation of Brahma , the Hindu god of creation . The shrine is so revered that Thanakorn Pakdeepol , a mentally ill man , was beaten to death in 2006 by two bystanders after they witnessed him vandalizing the statue .
Thousands of worshipers visit the site each day , praying for everything from good health to sports results . They light incense sticks and wai ( bow slightly with palms pressed together ) to each of the four faces of the statue . For extra luck , worshipers pay respect and money to the shrine 's Thai dancers .
The US stock market is a rigged game where high-frequency traders with advanced computers make tens of billions of dollars by jumping in front of investors , according to author Michael Lewis , who spent the past year researching the topic for his new book “ Flash Boys ” , which is published tomorrow .
Lewis rose to fame in the 1980s through his tale of life on Wall Street , “ Liar 's Poker ” , and more recently penned a much-publicised piece on Ireland 's economic troubles for Vanity Fair .
According to Lewis , while speed traders ' strategies , developed over the past decade with help from exchanges , are legal , “ it 's just nuts ” that they 're allowed , he said , adding that the tactics are too complicated for individual investors to understand .
“ The United States stock market , the most iconic market in global capitalism , is rigged , ” Lewis , whose books “ Liar 's Poker ” and “ The Big Short ” highlighted Wall Street excesses , said during an interview with CBS .
“ It 's crazy that it 's legal for some people to get advance news on prices and what investors are doing . ”
Everyone who owns equities is victimised by the practices , in which the fastest traders figure out which stocks investors plan to buy , purchase them first and then sell them back at a higher price , said Lewis .
To show how lucrative the tactics are , Lewis said a technology firm spent $ 300 million to build a line that would shave three milliseconds off the time it takes to communicate between New Jersey and Chicago , then leased it out to securities companies for $ 10 million each .
The author 's comments follow New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman 's decision to investigate privileges marketed to professional traders that allow them to place their computers within feet of exchanges and buy access to faster data streams . Officials at the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also said market rules may need to be examined .
Lewis is adding his voice to a debate that has obsessed the securities industry for almost a decade while only periodically surfacing in public via events such as the May 2010 flash crash , in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted an almost 1,000 point loss .
Previous books by the one-time Salomon Brothers trader have focused attention on everything from mortgage derivatives to baseball statistics and contributed to the outcry over the events leading to the 2008 financial crisis . His latest target , high-frequency trading , comprises a diverse set of software-driven strategies that have spread from US equity markets to most developed countries as computer power grew and regulators tried to break the grip of centralised exchanges . While the tactics vary , they usually employ super- fast computers to post and cancel orders at rates measured in thousandths or even millionths of a second to capture price discrepancies on more than 50 public and private venues that make up the American equities market . Dominating Volume
High-frequency traders account for about half of share volume in the U.S. , a statistic that shows their pervasiveness and hints at the obstacles faced by proposals to rein them in . Exchanges rely on HFTs for profits as well as liquidity , with electronic market makers all but eliminating the old system of human floor traders who oversaw the buying and selling of equities . While critics such as Lewis see a Wall Street plot , proponents say the new system is faster and cheaper .
My heart skipped a beat when I opened my mailbox 10 minutes ago . A parcel ! And even more , an Arbitrary Day gift ! I could barely contain myself , but I did - in a streak of superior self-control - manage to take a picture of the unopened parcel . Yet , 2 seconds later cardboard was flying all around the place . When I pried it open , my heart skipped another beat as I 've noticed the shiny plastic of jewel case cd 's . Whoah !
As an avid collector you can always get me to dance uncontrollably through my living room . This time it was no different . Especially because it seemed to be 2 No-Man cd 's and 1 Bass Communion cd .
I 'm a big fan of Steven Wilson in all his incarnations . In expectation of a new Porcupine Tree album , I 'm exploring the rest of his output . So my secret santa did me a huge favor ! Not only will it keep my entertained for the foreseeable future , it 's also another step towards a complete Steven Wilson collection .
Thank you very much , secret santa . You truly made my day . Strike that . Make that my summer !
Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would `` have to get used to a lot of '' Hillary Clinton shouting as the campaign moves towards the general election . | AP Photo Trump : I guess I 'll have to get used to Clinton 's 'shouting '
Turning his attention toward the general election on Wednesday , Donald Trump defended his line that the only thing Hillary Clinton has going for her is `` playing the woman card , '' remarking that the former secretary of state would be doing worse if she were not a woman .
`` She 's playing the woman card left and right , '' Trump said on CNN 's `` New Day , '' adding , `` She did n't play it last time with Obama but she 's playing it much harder this time , and she will be called on it . Absolutely . ''
Asked by CNN 's Chris Cuomo how one calls someone on being a woman , Trump responded , `` You just tell them they 're playing the woman 's card . ''
`` What does that mean ? '' Cuomo followed up .
Trump said that if she were not playing that card , `` frankly ... she would be doing poorly . ''
Asked how he knew that , Trump replied simply , `` I know it . If she was a man and she was the way she is she would get virtually no votes . ''
Appearing minutes later on MSNBC 's `` Morning Joe , '' Trump responded to a clip of Clinton addressing her supporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday night in which she said , `` if fighting for women 's health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card , then deal me in . ”
Trump said that he was still `` recovering '' from Clinton 's `` shouting . ''
`` I know a lot of people would say you ca n't say that about a woman , because of course a woman does n't shout , '' Trump said . `` The way she shouted that message was not -- that 's the way she said it , and I guess I 'll have to get used to a lot of that over the next four or five months . ''
Henrikh Mkhitaryan joined Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund Photo : Henrikh Mkhitaryan / Instagram
Henrikh Mkhitaryan is almost impossible to keep quiet in Manchester United training , Chris Smalling has revealed .
The Armenia international is currently getting used to life at Old Trafford following his summer transfer to the club from Borussia Dortmund .
Mkhitaryan initially struggled to have much of an impact at Old Trafford as he was hampered by form and fitness in the early stages of the season .
However , the playmaker has been in much improved form in recent weeks and has earned plenty of praise for his displays for Jose Mourinho 's men in the second half of the campaign .
And Smalling has lifted the lid on how he and his Manchester United team-mates struggle to keep Mkhitaryan quiet in training at Carrington .
Smalling told United Review : “ He is often thinking one step ahead [ in training ] , whether it is a pass or a dribble .
“ He is deceptively quick as well and he is probably quicker with the ball than he is without , which is rare for a lot of players .
“ He is a great , great asset for us . ”
Manchester United return to Premier League action after the international break with a home clash against West Bromwich Albion as they bid to continue their march towards a top-four finish .
Unionists clearly hope that the joint decision by the three main unionist political parties to oppose a currency union with an independent Scotland will critically damage the credibility of the Scottish Government 's economic plans and in doing so stymie a Yes vote in September .
But in adopting this wrecking-ball stance , what kind of post-No landscape are unionists preparing for Scotland ?
Consider the lie of the land in Scotland , in the aftermath of a No vote . First and foremost , the unionist hope that a No vote will `` put the independence debate to bed once and for all '' will prove to have been delusional . The desire for Scottish independence is here to stay ; its appeal has never been stronger , its possible forms never more precisely defined . Scotland 's independence advocates are not suddenly going to change their constitutional position just because a No vote has been declared .
But with recent developments , there is every chance that , post-referendum , many Scots would feel deeply resentful over how the No vote was won . They would reflect upon the UK Government 's lobbying of foreign governments against Scottish independence ; its threats that it would not promote Scotch whisky overseas if we vote Yes ; its prompting of big business to speak out against independence , the partiality of the state media and , of course , Westminster 's attempts to pull the rug from under the Scottish government 's currency aspirations .
It matters how Better Together engages with the referendum debate because if there is to be a positive long-term future for the UK then adopting a stance of simply cudgelling the Yes campaign 's ideas represents little more than futile short-termism .
The independence referendum has come about because of preferences the Scottish voting public has expressed at consecutive Scottish ballot boxes . This pattern of voting reflects a broad consensus among Scots that the status quo is unacceptable .
This is why the articulation of clear , novel reasons for voting No is of such importance to this debate . It would offer a genuine sense of what might be possible for Scotland within the UK ; it would also demonstrate the UK political establishment takes seriously the disgruntlements in Scottish society . Thus far , Better Together has demonstrated indifference to these challenges .
Casting an eye across Scotland in the aftermath of a No vote , even the most strident unionist might feel privately that what they have fought for feels neither `` better '' nor `` together '' .

Detailed tactical match analysis as Swansea City suffer their fourth home Premier League defeat against Leicester City .
The scoreline might suggest something of a close game at the Liberty Stadium , but it was anything but . Paul Clement referred to it as another “ marginal defeat ” but Leicester wasted clear chances throughout , while the Swans also had to rely on goalkeeper Lucasz Fabianski to keep the score down .
After an improved , winning performance against Huddersfield the week before , we were more upbeat about another decent result and performance against the Foxes , but it was anything but . There were some worrying signs in this performance , as well as our manager getting it badly wrong tactically .
The midfield shape in particular was non-existent , and his comments after the game about being caught between pressing and sitting in a defensive block couldn ` t have been more accurate , but this was happening within the first few minutes , and it was something that needed correcting from the touchline early on .
Swansea ` s poor midfield shape and ineffective pressing
Like Paul Clement said after the game , we knew what to expect from Leicester , in fact everyone in the crowd I ` m sure knew what style Leicester would bring . An energetic , dynamic display where they look to play pacey and long , direct balls forward for the likes of Vardy to chase off the shoulder of the last defender .
We produced a good pressing performance against Huddersfield that stopped them from playing out from the back , it suited that particular style , but our pressing game plan was all wrong against a side like Leicester .
And this was evident after about 35 seconds . There were so many examples of our poor pressing – leaving space behind the midfield that I must have deleted about 8-10 screenshots of almost-identical situations .
The screenshot below is from about 35 seconds into the game . The Swans have lost possession in the final third . Two of the three central midfielders are behind the ball chasing back , while Okazaki is about to receive possession in behind Leon Britton .
Within 2-3 passes , Leicester are already approaching our final third and are able to create a very early goalscoring chance .
4 minutes into the game , Okazaki is in acres of space through the middle , as Leon Britton is returning back having been involved in a pointless , and completely ineffective high press – leaving the defence without any protection .
This problem of a high press is more evident in the below screenshot . I say a high press , a higher press than normal for the likes of Leon Britton – playing as the deep-lying midfielder – to be involved in .
In previous games , Leon Britton , or whoever was playing the deep-lying role before him , was playing a strict deep role – and managing the space in between the lines – in the shaded area . However , the club skipper was continuously pressing high , allowing Leicester players to move into this large area of space .
In the example below , there ` s just no need for Britton to push forward and press . Renato Sanches is already pressing , and Leon Britton has to stay deep to manage the shaded area in front of his defence .
The pressing was also ineffective in the final third . Below , Tammy Abraham and Jordan Ayew were two players not short of effort and desire , but it was mostly wasted in these situations .
Firstly , Leicester are easily able to play the ball around them out from the back , and secondly , having been in such high positions , they weren ` t available to press in the middle third . As a result of this , the central midfielders were pressing in these positions instead , leaving the space behind them .
You can see what I mean below . Abraham is running back from a high press position , who needs to be pressing the Leicester player on the ball . Instead , both Leon Britton and Tom Carroll press the same player , leaving a queue of Leicester players waiting for the ball behind them .
Swansea ` s poor pressing led to a poor midfield shape :
Two out of three central midfielders are in Leicester ` s half “ pressing ” . Both Ayew and Narsingh , part of a three-man attack , are actually behind the two central midfielders ( Sanches and Britton ) . There was just no real structure to us at all . It was baffling really considering how we ` ve shaped up before under Paul Clement , who prides himself on team shape and organisation .
But against Leicester City , a very direct side , what on earth are we doing here ? There was no real 2 lines of 3 , and Leicester were finding large areas of space time and time again , it was surprising then that their first goal came off our own player .
The distance between the three central midfielders was also poor at times , as Carroll and Sanches tended to move into very wide positions to add support for the full backs . Sanches was almost playing as a left winger in the second half .
Leicester were able to create some good chances before their opening goal , crosses weren ` t stopped and players weren ` t getting picked up inside the box :
Where ` s the midfield ! ?
There ` s not one central midfielder in this screenshot , as Mawson competes for a long aerial ball . If he loses out , the defence is very vulnerable .
The midfield continue to press , despite the obvious problems it ` s creating , this needed to be stopped via the touchline but it kept happening time and time again .
One direct pass , which bypasses at least 2 of Swansea ` s three central midfielders , sees Leicester attacking with 4 players running into space :
Below is another example of a poor team shape , and ineffective pressing ( essentially by the wrong players in the wrong positions )
Carroll goes to press , he misses out , then Britton goes to press , but it ` s pointless again as MAhrez simply plays a first-time pass to Okazaki .
Looking at the Leicester players here , all but one have plenty of space to receive the ball . Ideally here , Abraham needs to drop back – forming a three-man press , allowing Carroll , Sanches and Britton to drop deeper – limiting the space in our own half .
Here ` s a rare screenshot of a line of central midfielders , but it ` s too high , as Leicester can simply play lofted balls over their heads .
Leicester opens the scoring
Swansea were guilty of coming to a halt for Leicester ` s first goal , assuming the ball had gone out of play . Mahrez continues though , Naughton fails miserably to stop the cross and the cross comes off Fernandez ` s head and flies into the net .
Swansea ` s poor attacking play
Swansea never really showed any evidence that they were capable of getting back into the game . Their attacking play was far too slow and predictable . The ball just kept being played into wide players , where Leicester had us covered easily .
Our slow build-up play allowed Leicester the time to get every outfield player back behind the ball , and we simply resorted to hopeful crosses into the box that were always cleared away .
There was also a lack of movement and player runs . Just look at the example below , not one player beyond Narsingh in possession ( except Abraham who ` s out of the picture ) . Against Huddersfield , it was the full back receiving the ball in these positions and having Narsingh or Ayew ahead of them to pass to , but this wasn ` t happening against Leicester .
Renato Sanches complained of a lack of movement in the second half , trying to instruct Carroll to make a run through , but in the end he has to make a simple backwards pass to the midfielder .
We were constantly too static , lacking any movement , and this meant balls played backwards before a midfielder simply lofted balls forward . Below , Carroll ` s only option is to play a long lofted pass forward , while Abraham is surrounded by five Leicester players .
Swansea also struggled to play the ball through the middle , as Abraham is under pressure and unable to hold up the ball , with nobody in close proximity to work off .
In the end then , the Swans simply tried to play in crosses via the full backs :
Leicester ` s second goal
Leicester ` s second goal and game killer was inevitable , but it occurred in embarrassing fashion . Tom Carroll played in another poor set piece , a free kick close to the penalty area , that was cleared away by the first man . Narsingh fails to win the loose ball in the middle , and Mahrez can then help start the counter attack .
Albrighton brings the ball forward into our half , before playing it across to the opposite side as Mahrez plays a first time squared pass across the penalty area that Okazaki finished easily .
The Swans got a goal back via Sanches ` corner . Ayew got a flick at the front post and Mawson did well to turn and fire into the far corner of the net , but we never looked like getting a goal from open play . Leicester really should have restored their 2-goal advantage but continued to waste some chances . Vardy went through on goal but Fabianski stopped well with his feet , but their lead never looked in doubt at any time .
It really was a worryingly , poor performance from the Swans that was poorly setup against a side like Leicester , who looked in a different League to us in all honesty . Like I said , the scoreline flattered us as we rode our luck throughout .
Huge improvements are needed to avoid another long , difficult season near the bottom .
Sweat is dripping off my nose and onto the barbell . The barbell . Sixty-five pounds that needs to be squatted and thrust above my head twelve more times . I am on the third round of the final workout in the 2015 CrossFit Open . I can feel a small group of people starting to form around me . I can hear them say my name and words of encouragement . But all I can see is the barbell , and I know that the only way to end this pain is to pick it up off the ground .
“ Stay with the bar , ” I hear Kyle say . Stay with the bar . Advice like that pisses me off . It sounds apt , but what does it mean ? I ca n't exactly leave the damn bar . I need it to get through this damn workout .
I wonder if I am in the Dark Place . You hear a lot about the Dark Place in CrossFit . That 's where you find your spirit , your power against self-doubt . All the elite athletes go to the Dark Place . I 'm not elite . But I pick up the bar and commit to three more reps. Nine to go .
Stay with the bar .
It 's been a rough week . My job , once challenging and exciting , has become tedious and unfulfilling . Ten years ago I would have easily forgone the comfortable paycheck and traded it in for a new stab at Greatness . But now it 's not so easy . Greatness does n't provide . The electric bill and the car payment do n't care about Greatness . And I no longer have the confidence that I can live without those comforts or that they can be replaced with new rewards . My 25 year-old-self thinks I am a sellout .
I can hear myself heaving and grunting . The barbell is back on the ground . “ Stay with the bar , ” Kyle says . I want to sneer at him . To tell him he can stay with the bar if he wants . But I tug it off the ground and do three more reps. Six to go .
Stay with the bar .
All my life I have loved books . There was never any doubt that someday I would write my own book . Many books . I would be an author . I dropped out of college because Greatness did n't need to be Degreed . But I did n't write . I moved to Los Angeles . I wandered . I worked . There would be time for writing later . You have to live , to experience the world , before you can write . I had plenty of time .
For a moment I 'm afraid I 'm the only one who has n't finished the workout . I often come in last , and despite the trademark CrossFit support for stragglers ( or maybe because of it ) , being last is lonely . You know everyone else has completed the task at hand and that the only person gasping for air and swearing is you . But right now I 'm not the only one gasping for air , and with a small sense of relief I yank at the bar and complete three more reps. Only three more to go .
Stay with the bar .
I 've spotted gray in my hair , and my tweezers can not keep up . Right now the wiry silver strands disguise themselves as highlights , but I know eventually the contrast will be too great for camouflage . The laugh lines around my eyes are deepening . I do n't hold much of a grudge against them . I love to laugh . But I ca n't forgive the fat that seems to have found a permanent residence on my thighs , or the extra bit of sleep I need to function properly . I 'm not old , but I 'm aging , and I ca n't help watching those younger than me with a touch of envy .
My judge counts my last three reps and I am finished with Round Three . I sit on the rower , allow myself a few short breaths and begin . Nine calories . I just have to get to nine . It takes twelve good pulls and I 'm walking back to the bar .
Stay with the bar .
Urgency . There 's an element of urgency to my daydreams now . It 's harder to push tasks off until tomorrow . I no longer tell myself I have plenty of time to start . My life has moved well past the starting line . I have an opportunity to learn , to rise , to finish strong . The past ca n't be a waste if it teaches you how to make the most of your future .
I wrap my fingers around the bar . I take a deep breath and crawl to the Dark Place . I cling to the strength I find and the will to finish . I see light instead of dark . At the top of the ninth rep , I look at the clock and drop to the floor .
Heart thundering , chest heaving , I lay on my back . For a few moments I am content . Happy . I am free of doubt and fear . The worries of the week are subdued , and I do n't think about the gray in my hair or the unfinished chapter of my book . Here , lying on the floor , sweating and sore , I remember my fate is my own . My 25 year-old self approves . It 's not too late to stay with the bar .
Washington ( CNN ) — President Donald Trump and his top immigration enforcers have begun to focus their attention on the deadly MS-13 gang , saying the administration 's hardline immigration policies are focused on stopping its spread in the US .
But the truth about the gang , the first street gang to be labeled a `` transnational criminal organization '' by the US government , is more complicated -- and experts say using MS-13 to justify cracking down on undocumented immigrants could actually make the gang stronger .
Mara Salvatrucha , known as MS-13 , is strongest in Central America , especially El Salvador , but extends its criminal enterprise across the US , including cities like Los Angeles , New York and the Washington , DC , region .
But MS-13 actually began in Los Angeles in the 1980s during a flood of Salvadorians fleeing to the US . Its offshoot in Central America took hold when many of the members were deported by the US back home , according to a University of Pittsburgh research paper hosted by the Department of Justice 's National Criminal Justice Reference Service and a study by the UN Office of Drug and Crime .
While it 's unknown how much of the Central American strength of MS-13 was homegrown , a Congressional Research Service analysis of MS-13 found that its ranks were continuously strengthened by deportees from the US returning home , even as members also migrated to the US .
As part of its heightened rhetoric against illegal immigration , the Trump administration of late has spotlighted MS-13 as a sort of public enemy No . 1 .
`` The MS-13 motto is 'kill , rape , and control , ' '' Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday in New York . `` That should tell us enough about the kind of group that we confront . ''
`` The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin . allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast ! '' Trump tweeted earlier this month .
Sessions has also blamed the Obama administration for a rise in MS-13 , saying a large number of the gang members are undocumented immigrants , including some minors , in an interview this month with Fox News ' Tucker Carlson .
At the time , Sessions suggested they could be designated a terrorist organization .
`` I think so , perhaps , I believe it could qualify for that , '' Sessions said when asked about the designation by Carlson . `` We know they 're violent . ''
But Sessions backed off slightly from that on Friday , saying while the group meets `` some of the qualifications , '' he is not sure it what all the `` standards for that designation '' are .
He also insisted Friday it was not `` anti-immigrant '' to go after the group .
Experts , however , say there is little statistical evidence that MS-13 is more prevalent in recent years or more dangerous to the US than other gangs . Their methods are particularly brutal , experts say , and in recent months several high-profile gruesome killings have made news across the nation .
`` This attitude that there 's a brand-new threat and it 's new and it 's all immigration , there is not a piece of that narrative that is accurate , '' said Jorje Leap , an anthropologist and longtime gang researcher at UCLA .
And the notion that the Obama administration ignored MS-13 is also hard to prove with data . It was the Obama 's Treasury Department in 2012 that sanctioned the gang as a transnational criminal organization .
According to data provided to CNN by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement , recorded arrests by ICE of MS-13 members have fluctuated but seen no steady drop-off for the past dozen years .
By the numbers
There were roughly 24,000 MS-13 members in Central America in 2012 , according to an analysis by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime .
Today , the Justice Department estimates roughly 30,000 members worldwide and more than 10,000 in the US , a number that has held steady for some years but that the department believes is trending upwards . MS-13 is active in 40 states plus the District of Columbia , the department estimates , and has found in recent investigations that gang leaders in El Salvador are directing US cliques to become more violent .
But DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security were not able to provide information on how many of those 10,000 were estimated to be in the US illegally , nor how many had been arrested or deported in recent years . There are roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US . And per the FBI 's most recent statistics , the roughly 10,000 MS-13 members are a fraction of the estimated 1.4 million members of US gangs nationally .
Last fiscal year , Homeland Security Investigations , a division of ICE that conducts investigations and has a unit focused on gangs , arrested 429 members of MS-13 , according to data provided to CNN . That year , ICE arrested 114,434 individuals in total . In FY15 , 322 MS-13 members were arrested by HSI out of 125,211 total arrested by ICE . In the current fiscal year , which began last fall , 253 MS-13 members have been arrested .
ICE 's other arresting agency , Enforcement and Removal Operations , does not track arrests by MS-13 and has no data on the gang .
Leap says the gang has earned a reputation above others in the US not because it is more dangerous , necessarily , but because its violence is known to be particularly brutal , because it is one of the rare gangs that operates internationally , and because in Los Angeles it was the only gang to not observe `` prison discipline '' -- the customary pause in rivalry among gang members who were incarcerated .
She added she was `` suspicious '' of the increased attention on the gang .
`` It 's not to say that the gruesome crimes have not occurred , I just question why they 're being highlighted now , '' Leap said . `` It 's troubling . Gang crime is always on people 's minds , brutal crimes are always on people 's minds , why here , why now , and why attribute it to immigration ? ''
ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said the agency has long been concerned about MS-13 because of the role it plays in cross-border crime , even when the gang members are US citizens .
`` They 're a very , very violent gang that has ties to the border involved in human smuggling , extortion , drug smuggling , with a lot of the money flowing back to fuel the violence in Central America , '' Bennett told CNN . `` So I think for us that 's why they 're such a target to go after . ''
DOJ undermining itself ?
Much of the concern about MS-13 in recent years is anecdotal -- with particularly heinous murders occurring across the nation .
In Montgomery County , Maryland , just outside Washington , Capt . Paul Liquorie , director of the Special Investigations Division , said that his jurisdiction has seen roughly 10 MS-13 related killings since June 2015 .
In his region , he said , the number of homicides linked to MS-13 members are roughly equal to the number of homicides linked to all other gangs put together , though that does not speak to other kinds of gang operations or size .
But while Liquorie appreciated the federal government wanting to help local law enforcement fight the gang , he questioned whether DOJ was actually undermining its cause by equating MS-13 to undocumented immigrants .
`` Undocumented immigrants are more likely , generally , to be the victim of gang crime to be a member of the gang , '' Liquorie said .
Undocumented immigrants are especially vulnerable , he said . They tend to lack stable family or work in their communities , are often paid in cash , and can fear reporting crimes to the police for fear of deportation . MS-13 preys on that vulnerability , targeting immigrants for extortion and manipulating minors into joining their ranks .
The Trump administration 's rhetoric and aggressiveness toward undocumented immigrants can help drive that , Liquorie said .
`` The silence in the community , which is driven sometimes by the message from the Trump administration , helps the gang thrive , because you 're further alienating that community that is victimized the most , '' Liqourie said . `` So it makes use harder to reach out and gain the trust of those communities . ''
Eric Olson , an expert at the Wilson Center 's Mexico Institute , said it was appropriate for the Justice Department to focus on MS-13 -- but not at the expense of other gangs and cartels that play a bigger role in drug smuggling , for example .
`` Are they a bad group of people who extort ? Who murder ? Yes , '' Olson said . `` But , they 're involvement in the transnational movement of drugs is not so clear , not so vivid . ... I think we should n't focus on one group . We should see the big picture . ''
This is the fourth and final installment in a series about the Department of Energy collaboration with the National Cancer Institute to use big data and high-performance computing in cancer research .
Combining advanced sensing systems and machine-learning algorithms allows a driverless vehicle to anticipate and avoid dangerous situations faster and more accurately than a human driver . To comprehend the biochemical signaling pathways that go awry in cancer , scientists are adapting similar approaches – applying the power of machine learning and simulation to decades of biomedical research .
High-performance computing is now powerful enough to address the daunting complexity that has stymied breakthrough treatments . That premise is behind a collaboration led by Fred Streitz of the Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Dwight Nissley of the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research ( FNLCR ) , one of four pilot projects between DOE and the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . Streitz , Nissley and colleagues aim to create a predictive molecular-scale model to accelerate diagnostic and targeted therapy .
Rick Stevens of the DOE 's Argonne National Laboratory , a co-principal investigator in the DOE-NCI collaborations , says the problem is so “ complicated we do n't want people to be steering the simulation . We want the computer to steer itself . We wrap the simulation in machine learning so the computer will learn where it needs to do more work to reduce uncertainty in what 's happening in the pathway . ”
The pathway in question here is called RAS/RAF . ( RAS is a protein named for where it was first found , in rat sarcoma ; RAF , for rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma , refers to an enzyme . ) Scientists have long understood that molecular-scale alterations in RAS/RAF help drive cancer in the lung , colon , pancreas and other organs – and that when RAS is involved , patients have a poor prognosis . Despite this understanding , therapies have n't been able to target the cancer-causing form of RAS . The complex environmental and multiscale interactions that drive RAS-initiated cancer growth have led some scientists to conclude that RAS pathways are impossibly elusive targets for anti-cancer drugs .
But the research team steering this pilot project has decades of progress to help guide them . Scientists have made great strides in the past 30 years toward understanding RAS signaling pathways . Biological data is available from analyzing cellular genetic , protein and metabolic processes , from structural studies and from other sources .
‘ We are building a new kind of molecular modeling tool . '
The idea is to apply multiscale , physics-based dynamic simulations , data analytics , machine learning and advanced computing architectures to go beyond the limitations of biological experiments , which can only partially reconstruct the tumor environment .
Nissley notes that “ the RAS protein operates exclusively in the context of a cell membrane . If we 're to develop an understanding of oncogenic RAS behavior , we need to start there. ” To capture that behavior , Streitz adds , the team plans to model RAS mechanics with a realistic simulated membrane .
The scientists believe that simulations spanning ranges of times and physical sizes will be necessary to assess the biological repercussions of RAS mutations . The models will be built to represent not only the cancer microenvironment but also other environmental and genetic factors specific to individual cancers . Creating simulations combined with experimental data allows the research team to include a vast amount of information that can be included only using high-performance analytics that remove human guesswork from the equation .
“ We are building a new kind of molecular modeling tool that can in essence zoom in and out on the interactions , ” Stevens says . “ It can use fully atomistic molecular dynamics for fine detail or it can zoom out to coarse-grained molecular mechanics . It can go to where interesting things are happening in the pathway . ”
Streitz says the team will build dynamic models of RAS protein biology in varying cellular membrane compositions and couple them with experiments at FNLCR . Simulations will exploit next-generation computing architectures in supercomputers arriving at Livermore , Argonne and the DOE 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory . The experiments will incorporate advanced imaging and interaction data from a range of tools that include cryo-EM , NMR , crystallography and neutron sources available at the FNLCR . The work will focus on membrane-bound RAS , mutated RAS and RAS complexes .
Once a dynamic model is built and validated against experiment , the team can begin to explore the many avenues of the RAS signaling pathway in search of possible drug targets .
“ By wrapping a machine-learning framework around our modeling capability , ” Streitz says , “ we can anticipate spawning thousands or millions of simulations , each exploring an aspect of the pathway . ”
By feeding this modeling information and new experimental data back into the machine-learning algorithm , the team hopes to map the pathways relevant for cancer initiation with RAS proteins – and thus point to possible drugs that target these pathways as they turn from normal to cancer-promoting .
Representative Barney Frank , the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee , is working on legislation that would transform the Federal Reserve 's decision-making process .
According to Bloomberg and The Hill , Frank plans to submit a bill that would remove the votes of the five regional Federal Reserve presidents from the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee ( FOMC ) , which sets interest rates , and replace them with five appointees that would be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate .
Frank is concerned that the process is undemocratic because the regional Fed presidents are not elected or appointed by elected representatives , and he believes that regional Fed presidents are overly likely to focus on guarding against inflation at the expense of more adequately tackling the country 's unemployment crisis .
Traditionally , seven governors of the Federal Reserve are appointed to the FOMC in such a way , while the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a permanent seat on the committee , and four of the 11 presidents of the other regional banks have one-year rotating terms on the committee .
The new legislation will be a revision of legislation that Frank originally proposed in May .
Frank said in a statement on Monday that the current structure of the FOMC allows for a `` self-perpetuating group of private citizens '' to keep `` skewing policy '' at the Fed , according to The Hill .
Frank 's committee analyzed the voting patterns of the FOMC in 2009 and found that 90 percent of the committee 's dissenting votes were made by the five regional presidents . That public naysaying has hurt the Fed 's ability to influence the economy , Frank said .
There has been a growing chorus of concern about the Federal Reserve 's secrecy . Bloomberg News revealed last month that the Federal Reserve loaned $ 1.2 trillion of public money to banks in an effort to save the financial system and the economy with it : a move that could have made Wall Street complacent about receiving such loans in the future when the economy sours .
Some economists also have expressed concern that the Federal Reserve is not serious enough about fulfilling its mandate to maximize employment . One Fed official found that the Fed 's purchases of more than $ 2 trillion in mortgages and U.S. debt may increase unemployment . New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has consistently lambasted the Fed 's fear of further action because it could cause inflation . Krugman wrote in August that the Fed has been `` intimidated into inaction . '' Berkeley Economics Professor Brad DeLong also has criticized the Fed 's focus on inflation . `` There is a requirement for price stability -- and right now prices and demand are unstable downward , '' DeLong wrote , arguing for the Fed to be more concerned about deflation and unemployment .
Frank has called the issue `` a matter of democratic principle , '' since the regional Fed presidents `` are not elected and not appointed by people who are elected making important decisions . ''
`` The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate for being concerned about unemployment and inflation , '' Frank told Fortune Magazine in May . `` There is a tendency by members picked by regional business people to focus much more on inflation and not enough on unemployment . So the current structure biases the Federal Reserve away from one half of its duty . I want there to be equal attention to unemployment and inflation . ''
Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher , a FOMC member who has often warned about the dangers of inflation , said on Monday that the Federal Reserve would risk a public backlash and its independence if it allowed prices to rise to help the economy recover .
`` There 's a difference between theory and practice , '' said Fisher , a former money manager . `` I think it is important to take into account the consequences . ''
Here is a powerful quotation from an early sermon of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones about the importance of centering church life around a powerful experience of Jesus :
“ Our Christianity has she appearance of being an adjunct or an appendix to the rest of our lives instead of being the main theme and the moving force in our existence….We seem to have a real horror of being different . Hence all our attempts and endeavours to popularise the church and make it appeal to people . We seem to be trying to tell people that their joining a church will not make them so very different after all . ‘ We are no longer Puritans , ' we say , ‘ we believe that they over-did things and made Christianity too difficult for people . They frightened people with their strictness and their unnecessarily high standards . We are not so foolish as to do that , ' we say , and indeed we do not do so . Instead , however , we provide so called ‘ sporting parsons ' , men of whom the world can say that they are ‘ good sports ' – whatever that may mean . And what it does so often mean is that they are men who believe that you can get men to come to chapel and church by playing football and other games with them . ‘ I 'll fraternise with these men , ' says such a minister . ‘ I 'll get them to like me and to see that I 'm not so different from them after all , and then they 'll come to listen to my sermons . ' And he tries it , but thank God , he almost invariably fails , as he richly deserves . The man who only comes to church or chapel because he likes the minister as a man is of no value at all , and the minister who attempts to get men there by means of that subterfuge is for the time being guilty of lowering the standard of the truth which he claims to believe . For this gospel is the gospel of salvation propounded by the Son of God himself . We must not hawk it about in the world , or offer special inducements and attractions , as if we were shopkeepers announcing an exceptional bargain sale… .
‘ The world expects the Christian to be different and looks to him for something different , and therein it often shows an insight into life that regular church-goers ofter lack . The churches organise whist-drives , fetes , dramas , bazaars , and things of that sort , so as to attract people . We are becoming almost as wily as the devil himself , but we are really bad at it ; all our attempts are hopeless failures and the world laughs at us….And the world today is laughing at the church , laughing at her attempts to be nice and to make people feel at home . My friends , if you feel at home in any church without believing in Christ as your personal Savior , then that church is no church at all , but a place of entertainment or a social club . For the truth of Christianity and the preaching of the gospel should make a church intolerable and uncomfortable to all except those who believe , and even then they should go away feeling chastened and humble . ”

The cable network has picked up a pilot for 'The Perfectionists , ' from showrunner Marlene King and 'Pretty Little Liars ' author Sara Shepard .
Freeform is going back to Pretty Little Liars .
The Disney-owned cable network has handed out a pilot order to Pretty Little Liars : The Perfectionists , with Sasha Pieterse and Janel Parrish set to star and reprise their roles from the flagship show .
The Perfectionists are based on the Sara Shepard book and is being adapted by Pretty Little Liars showrunner I. Marlene King . The project was first put into development at Freeform in November 2014 , with King and Shepard , the author of the original Pretty Little Liars book , opting to connect it with the original hit .
`` At Freeform , we are committed to delivering shows that push boundaries and become a part of our viewers ' lives . Pretty Little Liars was a cultural phenomenon so it 's no wonder fans wanted more , '' said Karey Burke , executive vp programming and development at Freeform . `` We ca n't wait to continue Marlene King 's rich and revolutionary storytelling with a new crop of leading ladies from Beacon Heights who will hold just as many secrets and lies as Rosewood did . ''
Here 's how Freeform describes Pretty Little Liars : The Perfectionists : `` Everything about the town of Beacon Heights seems perfect , from their top-tier college to their overachieving residents . But nothing in Beacon Heights is as it appears to be . The stress of needing to be perfect leads to the town 's first murder . Behind every Perfectionist is a secret , a lie and a needed alibi . ''
Pretty Little Liars : The Perfectionists is being produced by Alloy Entertainment and Long Lake Media in association with Warner Horizon Scripted Television . King , who also has Famous in Love at Freeform , penned the pilot and serves as executive producer with Alloy 's Leslie Morgenstein ( Pretty Little Liars ) and Gina Girolamo ( The 100 ) .
Pieterse and Parrish will reprise their respective roles of Alison DiLaurentis , the former queen bee whose mysterious disappearance rocked the small town of Rosewood , and Mona Vanderwaal , Hanna Marin 's best friend who was unmasked as the mysterious tormentor `` A '' at the end of the show 's second season and ultimately beat uber-villain A.D. at her own game .
`` I 'm beyond excited to continue my collaboration with Sara Shepard , Alloy , Freeform and Warner Horizon , ” said King , who renewed her deal with Warner Bros. TV in October . `` I ca n't wait to introduce our fans — and Sasha and Janel — to a new world of thrills and chills in Beacon Heights . ''
The Perfectionists come three months after Pretty Little Liars wrapped its seven-season run on Freeform . The series became a signature hit for Freeform and ranked as cable 's No . 1 drama among viewers 18-34 and 12-34 during its final season . That Freeform would connect The Perfectionists to the Pretty Little Liars brand is a savvy move that will automatically bring in an established audience and help cut through the cluttered landscape . This is the second spinoff to come out of Pretty Little Liars . The first , Ravenswood , was canceled after one season .
King hinted that The Perfectionists could tie into Pretty Little Liars during a June interview with The Hollywood Reporter : `` You know there might be some truth to that , but my hands are tied and I 'm not allowed to talk about it just yet . So hopefully we will get to share some news soon ! ''
The Perfectionists come as Freeform has been ramping up higher-profile development in a push for more ownership . The Tom Ascheim-led cable network 's slate includes a pair of Marvel shows in Cloak and Dagger and comedy New Warriors , as well as Black-ish spinoff Grown-ish , King 's Famous in Love , veteran The Fosters , Alone Together , Beyond , Shadowhunters and The Bold Type , the latter of which is awaiting a season-two pickup .
Overall , The Perfectionists is Freeform 's fourth pilot order , joining comedy Brown Girls , animated offering Sticks and a reboot of Misfits .

Setting the right project milestones can keep your projects on track . Setting projects milestones and developing a milestone schedule is a key factor in the success of a project . By following a little advice from experts in the project management field , you can increase your project success .
Project : A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product , service , or result . It has a defined start and end point . PMBOK 4th Edition
Milestone : A milestone is a significant event in a project that occurs at a point in time . A milestone schedule uses deliverables as a platform to identify major segments of work and an end date . Milestones should be natural , necessary control points in the project and should be easy for everyone to recognize . ( Project Management , the Managerial Process , Gray & Larson )
Paul Brough , an expert in Building Project Management , is an avowed user of project milestones and figures that their proper usage can help you avoid common pitfalls experienced project schedulers encounter . He says :
“ One of the biggest pitfalls met in using milestones occurs when trying to restrict a milestone to a particular date in the schedule , as opposed to being logic driven . .. Ideally , milestones should be logically tied to related schedule activities wherever possible . This means that , at a minimum , a start milestone should have successor , and a finish milestone should have a predecessor . ”
Tips Other experts , including Ginny Edwards of Bright Hub Project Management , tell us that when determining your project milestones use the following guidelines : Frequency – As a project manager , you may be tempted to overuse milestones as a motivation tool to keep the team moving along the ladder to reach the surface of success , but do n't fall into the trap of labeling every task completion as a milestone . In turn , do n't adopt the other extreme approach by ignoring or not recognizing significant and relevant events as milestones particularly at junctions of the critical path . A good compromise is to consistently designate important deliverables as milestones .

A good compromise is to consistently designate important deliverables as milestones . Timing – Milestones that are spaced too far apart will not have the benefit of the momentum derived from motivating team members by recognizing their major achievements . However , when milestones , appropriately represented as diamonds in MS Project , are placed too close together they quickly lose their luster and distinctiveness . As a rule of thumb try to space milestones at intervals for no longer than every two weeks for projects of several months in duration .

Fallibility – It may sound counter-intuitive , but you should select challenging milestones that carry a degree of risk for failure . Not every venture of NASA undertaken to pave the way for the Apollo 11 mission was successful . Ranger 3 , an unmanned probe sent to study the Moon missed its target by 22,000 miles . Do n't forget to treat milestones as learning experiences and opportunities to make adjustments early in the project 's execution .

Update on What We Know About Gordons Injury and the Royals Solution
UPDATE : Ned Yost has stated that Alex Gordon has a Grade 2+ Groin strain and is expected to miss 8 weeks . Brandon Finnegan has been recalled in his place on the roster .
In Wednesday nights win over the Rays , Royals fans were forced to watch on in horror as the heart and soul of the franchise lay motionless on the left field warning track .
Alex Gordon had crumpled in obvious pain while pulling up before crashing into the wall like we had all seen him do 100 times before . Superman was down .
Early reports are that it is a groin strain , though the severity of the injury will not be known until he is able to undergo an MRI . The early prognosis does not look so optimistic however , as he had to be carted off the field with a towel draped over his sunken head . Royals manager Ned Yost did little to stem the worry when he proclaimed that Gordon could potentially be out for months .
The defending American League Champions have certainly had their fair share of unfortunate injuries and performance woes this year . Yordano Ventura , Danny Duffy , Jason Vargas , Eric Hosmer , Mike Moustakas , Lorenzo Cain , Alex Rios , Salvador Perez and Omar Infante have all missed time this year due to injury or other reasons , some more than others .
It is certainly true that every team has hurdles to overcome during a season . The 2014 Royals were `` magical unicorn '' lucky on their way to the playoffs as they never endured even an average amount of injury . Well , this season it would appear , is back to even the score .
The one thing to take away from all of this ?
Even with the slew of injuries , including KEY players , a number of suspensions and a couple of underperforming players the Royals have maintained their standing as the best team in the American League .
What if you had been told before this season that come mid-July , the Royals rotation would only have 2 starting pitchers who even QUALIFY for the pitching title ? What if you were then told that one of those pitchers , Jeremy Guthrie , was rated as one of the worst pitchers statistically in all baseball with a 5.36 ERA and a negative WAR according to Fangraphs ? How about that THIRD on the Royals in total innings pitched would be none other than late pickup Chris Young ? And that Joe Blanton will have started several games ?
How about if you had been told the other qualifying pitcher wasnt one of the Royals young guns but none other than Edinson Volquez who 's signing was panned by many before the season ?
And that 's just a few of the woes with the starting rotation…it speaks nothing to what has happened to the position players . Omar Infante and Alex Rios have been huge disappointments for the Royals this year , and are downgrades over the production received from those positions last season . Injuries and players to the family emergency list have made their rounds like plague to almost every other position .
The moral of the story ? The Royals seem to find a way .
This may be the most significant hurdle presented to the Royals this season , but it certainly is n't the only one they have had to contend with . It 's not time to worry about the falling skies , and this club wont .
The club is in a far better shape emotionally than the fans . Alex Gordon did n't die . He will still be around the team . They can still lean on his leadership and follow by example as he puts his reputation for discipline to the test while rehabbing a groin injury .
Those hit the hardest will be the ones not able to tweet about Alex , or post Alex videos on Vine and pictures on Reddit/r/KCRoyals . There are many kinds of leaders , and there are certainly many leaders on this club , but since 2007 Royals fans have been able to watch # 4 morph from a disappointment to the pride of the club . He has been the person fans chose to represent the organization .
`` Who you guys got ? ''
We got Alex Gordon .
So the next question is , who will be there to fill the shoes of the team leader in OPS ?
Jarrod Dyson is the on staff solution , and is doing a decent job at the plate this season , posting a league average OPS+ on offense , which for him is a career high . Pair that with his outstanding speed and plus defense and he could be a viable option .
The Royals have many young options at AAA Omaha , but the front office has seemed reluctant to rely on unproven rookies for extended roles in the past . It isnt that they wouldnt be good options , It 's that the front office is probably not going to view them as such , so why bother talking about it . Cheslor Cuthbert has been brought up to replace Moose at 3b , and even that is a bit of a surprise , though it is most likely for an incredibly short period of time . A long term injury presents an entirely different circumstance .
Outside of Dyson , the best solution would be to trade for a rental player . There have been many names brought up , one of which being Ben Zobrist who would be capable of filling many holes in the Royals lineup should the need arise .
But a trade has n't been Daytons style . At least not a BIG trade . There may be a move for someone to sit in the wings , a Justin Maxwell type trade , but that will probably be the most of it .
Odds are , Dayton plans to use the players and depth that he had already acquired and expect them to do the job he signed them to do .
The biggest problem with trading for a player is that you have to give something up in return , and it has become obvious just how much the Royals front office covets the prospects they have . They are the future , and though it would seem easy to be nearsighted and give up a few for the now , it does n't play well when `` then '' comes along . Dayton knows he will still be fighting for his job in 4 years , and giving up players then for a half a season now carries different consequences for him than for us simply wanting another winner NOW .
So do n't be disappointed when the big name does n't come along . The Royals are fiercely loyal . They have depth…they have players who can fill in . Its time for the next man up .
If the front office decides they DO want to make a trade , then do it for someone to replace Alex Rios .
He is statistically the worst outfielder in the American League and has nearly dropped below .500 in OPS . Maybe to replace Gordon , they do n't find a left fielder , but upgrade somewhere else to make up the difference . There is n't an Alex Gordon out there to trade for , but there are guys , even in the farm system , that are capable of performing better than Alex Rios and making up the difference in WAR lost with an injury to Gordon .
Maybe playing Dyson and filling another blackhole is the answer , and with the year Rios is having , that would n't be hard to do . ( Infante is also having a poor season , but with that contract , it would seem a long shot the club would replace him )
This team has faced adversity all season long . They may have lost Gordon , but with Duffy returning and looking good , Ventura ready to come back , Vargas showing signs of being close and Chris Medlen working his way through rehab starts… .. well….there might be more reason for optimism than worry . Forget a trade , the Royals might actually get their pitching rotation back .
The Royals are on pace to win over 96 games this season . They are traditionally a second half team . It 's going to be just fine .

Rasila Raju was murdered in her cubicle by Infosys guard Saikiya Bhaben .
Rasila with her family
As Infosys techie Rasila Raju ( 24 ) slaved away in office , all alone on a Sunday , her sole consolation was that this was her ticket for a transfer out of the Pune branch . That was what she was discussing with her cousin seconds before she abruptly ended the call with the chilling words : `` Someone is entering my work bay , I will call you back . `` Rasila was n't thrilled about working alone on Sunday ( January 29 ) . In fact , she had told her family that she was often forced to put in extra time because her boss held a grudge against her . `` My transfer to the Bangalore office depends on my submission today . I should receive my transfer order by the first week of February , '' Rasila told her cousin sister Anjali Nandkumar on the phone . Then , seconds later , she hung up with the words : `` Someone is entering my working bay , I will call you back . `` Those were her last words . Around 8.30 pm , Rasila 's lifeless body was found in her cubicle , her neck strangled with a computer cable.The post-mortem indicated that Rasila had put up a fight but was bashed in the face and chest several times . `` We found bite marks on her left shoulder , which indicate that the accused tried to force himself on her and she fought back . A blunt object was used to assault the victim , and she sustained blunt injuries on the chest and face , '' said a forensic expert from BJ medical college , where the autopsy was done.The expert added , `` The body was brought to the mortuary with the power chord that was used to strangulate the deceased . So much force was used that the victim that blood oozed from her mouth and nostrils , which might have splashed on the accused clothes . `` What 's shocking is that the police neither took the forensic team to the crime scene , nor did they allow the experts to examine the accused for evidence.The next day , the police arrested Infosys security guard Saikiya Bhaben , who admitted that he killed after she rebuked him for staring at her . But the security guard was n't the only man harassing Rasila at work . `` My team manager is putting additional pressure on me ever since I refused to join him for a team lunch . My transfer approval is also pending with him and I will have to complete the work that I have been given , '' she had told her father , Raju OP , just three days ago.Even during the lunch break , while all her colleagues would leave for lunch , she would be made to stay back and work , revealed her brother Laijin Kumar OP , speaking from Calicut . He added , `` Rasila had told me on the phone a few weeks ago that she had refused to join the team in their social gatherings and this was not appreciated by the manager .

CNN 's Wolf Blitzer interviewed Giuliani on board the CNN Election Express Wednesday .
( CNN ) - Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that waterboarding should not be used regularly in interrogations , but might be called for in a “ once in a lifetime , once in a decade situation . ”
`` Having looked at this , it certainly should not be a practice that should go on generally , ” the former mayor of New York said in an interview in Columbia , Missouri .
But Giuliani told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that there may be situations where waterboarding - a technique where a person undergoes simulated drowning - would be warranted to obtain critical information from an alleged terrorist , such as the location of a nuclear bomb about to explode .
Many human rights organizations consider waterboarding to be torture .
`` I do n't think you can write this out as a procedure that should be written out for all situations , ” Giuliani said . “ I think the president and the appropriate officials should have some discretion here . ”

Over four nights starting Thursday , an Alaska scientist will try to create his own artificial aurora that could be visible as far away as Yukon .

The experiment is out of the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program ( HAARP ) Observatory at Gakona , Alaska , and is planned for 9:30 p.m .
Chris Fallen , an assistant research professor at the Geophysical Institute of University of Alaska Fairbanks , will attempt to create the artificial airglow in the sky .
`` It 's sometimes called the artificial aurora or radio-enhanced aurora or radio-enhanced airglow , '' Fallen said .
`` What that means is that powerful radio waves from the ground , from a facility like HAARP , can make the sky glow . ''
Understanding the aurora
Fallen is investigating which transmissions make the artificial auroras the brightest .
`` The reason why certain types of radio wave transmission cause the upper atmosphere to glow the same colours as the natural aurora is a process that 's not very well understood , '' he said .
Knowledge gathered from Fallen 's experiment could also help better understand the natural aurora .

It should also provide information on how communications between satellite and the Earth are affected by the ionosphere .
This would be important for navigation applications , Fallen said .
If conditions are clear , people in Whitehorse and Dawson City , Yukon , will have a good chance of snapping photos of the artificial aurora .
`` In the North , your best chance of observing the artificial aurora is actually to take pictures of it , '' he said , explaining the glow may be too low for the naked eye to see .

The success of his experiment will involve a good bit of `` luck , '' with the weather being a major factor , Fallen said .
Observation efforts in the past have been hampered due to cloudy conditions , he noted . This time , he 'll postpone the experiment if the weather does n't cooperate .
`` The facility , when in operation , burns almost 600 gallons of diesel fuel per hour . So that 's quite expensive , '' he said .
Aside from taking pictures , people who own a standard shortwave radio will be able to tune in to hear the radio frequency that creates the lights .
Fallen expects it will sound something like a fax machine .
I came upon the Midget City News by accident .
When my great uncle died in 1997 , my grandmother , mom and I went to his apartment to collect his things . My uncle had been a loner in his later years after his wife died . He was also somewhat of a hoarder with an apartment full of knickknacks and novelties .
Without any heirs—other than a half-dozen cats—or any other living immediate family members in the area besides his sister ( my grandmother ) , there was no one else to go through his stuff before the landlord gutted the place .
As an asthmatic , I learned quickly that this was not the place for me . The stench was horrific . While I was gasping for air and realizing I had to get out of there quickly , I noticed an old newspaper in a plastic cover : Midget City News . Whether my uncle bought it or acquired it firsthand , I 'll never know . Intrigued , I took it home and it has sat in my home office ever since . I had n't even taken it out of the bag until I began composing this blog for fear that the brittle pages would decompose . The newspaper was produced in 1934 as part of the Century of Progress World 's Fair that took place in Burnham Park on the Near South Side of Chicago .
Indeed , part of the World 's Fair had what was known as a “ Midget Village ” modeled after the “ ancient Bavarian city of Dinkelspuhl ” ( perhaps a misspelling of Dinkelsbühl ) populated by “ Lilliputians ” who were led by Mayor Major Doyle . The newspaper has stories about “ the world 's tiniest filling station ” and a $ 1,000 reward to “ any normally proportioned midget of the adult age of 21 years for men and 18 years for women , who is found to be as tiny in stature as , respectively for sex , Capt . Werner Ritter or Miss Margaret Ann Robinson . ”
While today this offensive exhibit would never take place , or at least we hope it would n't , it was n't out of the ordinary for the 1930s . People with dwarfism have historically had a hard time finding work , so it has been common for them to entertain to make ends meet , whether it 's on the carnival circuit , the big screen as “ Munchkins ” or “ Oompa Loompas , ” or TV shows such as Half Pint Brawlers . So has progress really been made ?
I emailed Gary Arnold , president of the Little People of America , or LPA , to get his take . “ I think the most significant difference between this generation and previous generations is awareness , ” Arnold told me .
Of course , I did n't know this at the time , but the LPA , a not-for-profit that was formed in 1957 to support people of small stature , had been embroiled in somewhat of a controversy when the entertainment website TMZ ran a story that quoted the LPA under the headline ” ‘ Snow White ' Screwed Us Out of Dwarf Roles ! ! ! ” The story was about how the movie Snow White & the Huntsman used , with the help of movie magic , average-sized actors instead of people with dwarfism as the dwarfs in the film . You can read Arnold 's response to that story here .
Today , thanks in part to the Americans with Disabilities Act , the estimated 30,000 people with dwarfism in the United States are protected against workplace discrimination . But , as we all know , discrimination has n't been eradicated . Arnold pointed to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission case from last year where a barista with dwarfism was fired from Starbucks , reportedly because she asked for a stool to do her job . Starbucks later settled with the woman for $ 75,000 .
Arnold also explained how the late Paul Steven Miller , the former commissioner of the EEOC who had dwarfism , had experienced discrimination . In Miller 's 1994 Senate testimony at his EEOC confirmation hearing , he stated that in the 1980s , when he was starting his career , he was highly recruited out of law school until people saw or learned how tall he was . Miller even said that one law firm told him that it would n't hire him because it did n't want clients to think it was running “ a circus freak show . ”
The LPA is taking an employment survey of its members , and Arnold shared some early returns : Of the 151 respondents 48 percent said they had experienced pre-employment discrimination ; 31 percent said that physical access had been a barrier in their careers ; 18 percent said workplace accommodations were denied or inadequate ; almost 8 percent said they are unemployed and looking for work ; and only 27 percent reported that they had no employment barriers . Overall , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that the unemployment rate for people with a disability was a staggering 15 percent , almost double the overall unemployment rate .
In 2012 , we 've come a long way from “ Midget Villages ” and “ circus freak shows , ” but barriers will still exist until hiring managers understand that being small in stature does not preclude someone from being big in ability .

Qualcomm on Wednesday unveiled several new processors designed to widen its lead in the mobile market .
The first , the Snapdragon 805 , is geared at mobile devices and 4K , Ultra HD TVs . The chip is part of the company 's high-end mobile chip line and was designed to `` deliver the highest-quality mobile video , imaging , and graphics experiences . '' Qualcomm noted it 's the company 's highest-performing chip so far .
Another , the Gobi 9x35 is Qualcomm 's fourth-generation 4G LTE modem . Along with LTE , the chip also runs 3G and other wireless technologies . Qualcomm also announced a new RF transceiver chip , the WTR3925 . The company noted that both chips offer `` significant improvements in performance , power consumption , and printed circuit board area requirements . ''
The Gobi 9x35 is Qualcomm 's first cellular modem created at 20 nanometers , or billionths of a meter . Its smaller size will allow for thinner and lighter devices .
`` Using a smartphone or tablet powered by Snapdragon 805 processor is like having an UltraHD home theater in your pocket , with 4K video , imaging , and graphics , all built for mobile , '' Murthy Renduchintala , executive vice president of Qualcomm Technologies , said in a press release . `` Coupled with our industry leading Gobi LTE modems and RF transceivers , streaming and watching content at 4K resolution will finally be possible . ''
Qualcomm provides applications processors that serve as the brains of electronics , and it leads the market for providing chips that allow mobile devices to connect to wireless networks . Its 4G LTE processors in particular have been gaining strong traction of late and are used in gadgets like the iPhone 5S . However , competition in 4G LTE is expected to increase as rival products hit the market from companies such as Intel .
Qualcomm first unveiled its Snapdragon 800 and 600 lines at the Consumer Electronics Show in January . Since that time , many devices have shipped with the processors , including the LG G2 smartphone and the Google Nexus 5 phone .
The Snapdragon 805 features Qualcomm 's new Adreno 420 graphics processor , with up to 40 percent more graphics processing power than its predecessor . The company said it 's the first mobile processor to offer system-level 4K/Ultra HD support , 4K video capture and playback , and enhanced dual camera image signal processors for better performance , multitasking , and power efficiency .
The chip has four cores and runs at speeds of up to 2.5 GHz per core . It 's able to stream more video content at higher quality using less power , Qualcomm said , and it allows for sharper , higher resolution photos in low light and advanced post-processing features .
Customers currently are sampling the Snapdragon 805 . It will be in devices in the first half of next year .

( GoldSilverBitcoin ) – Everex , formerly Midas Reserv , is making waves in the crypto-cash industry thanks to its contributions in cash-transfer technologies . Based on the Ethereum blockchain , Everex 's central product , Cryptocash , allows individuals to transfer cash across borders instantly in form of national currency on a blockchain . Applicable to remittance and cash transfers , Cryptocash is a digitized form of cash backed by national currencies thanks to Everex 's partner institutions .
But , the company did n't start out as Everex , and it did not start out with its eyes on developing a cash system . Instead , operating under the moniker Midas Reserv , the development team and its executives worked on a digital gold system .
The company 's website is still online . “ Midas Reserv is the umbrella fintech blockchain development company specializing in asset digitization protocols , ” reads its FAQ section .
Before the re-brand , the company apparently worked on the digitization of commodities ( MRGold ) , equities ( MRShares ) and simplification of payments and other transactions ( MRMoney ) by combining the world 's oldest asset , and its the new digital paradigm for assets .
“ We use proof of Issuance protocol , which allows us to issue into ( bitcoin ) blockchain various assets in the form of ‘ coins ' with the same attributes as bitcoin , while representing different values and are backed by physical asset reserves stored with the third-party custodians , ” reads the Midas Reserv website .
The coins are designed to represent investment grade gold bullion ( MRGold ) , shares of companies ( MRShares ) and equivalent of fiat currencies ( MRMoney ) .
“ We started with digitizing physical gold on bitcoin blockchain under Midas Rezerv ( MRGold ) name in Thailand back in 2015 , ” Everex CEO and Founder Alexi Lane told Crypto Coins News . “ Soon enough we understood that in order to successfully conduct business on blockchain , both product and payments must be on blockchain . Having just one part wo n't make the business model scalable . Therefore , we put gold aside and switched to cryptofiat , with the idea to get back to gold , once it will be available for regular Joe to purchase and trade it with cryptocash . At this time bitcoin is the only tradable cryptocurrency in the world . We even call it “ world 's reserve cryptocurrency ” , as many altcoins now are priced on exchanges not to USD , but BTC . ”
He added : “ However , the time when bitcoin will become globally acceptable is still far from now . So we want to introduce regular Joes to cryptoworld today through the introduction of cryptocash , which will open global crowd -finance space on a global scale . ”
The company 's token sale in support of Cryptocash , Chainy , The Everex Wallet and Ethplorer , are designed to power a capital transfer system . It 's presale period , ending early AM on July 8 in Singapore , has an undisclosed cap . The following token sale starts July 24th and has a $ 15 million cap .
Everex also has plans on introducing micro-lending via blockchain standards , enabling individuals in disenfranchised locations to build public credit and receive loans .
The Singapore-based startup has received attention globally . In New York at the United Nations , it received a Remittance Technology Award ( RemTECH ) for “ Service Originality. ” Everex will also join seven other startups as a ‘ Bluefin ' startup in Bangkok Bank 's incubator in the following months .
Tuesday morning on CNN 's three hour long program New Day , anchors Alisyn Camerota and Chris Cuomo surprisingly held Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama 's feet to the fire , after many people have noted the two leaders silence over the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal that broke last Friday .
Camerota asked her guests if there was a “ double standard ” for Democrats , when one of their own was caught up in these types of scandals , while their analyst guests said Clinton and Obama had “ situational ethics . ”
Starting off the first hour of New Day , Camerota asked her guest , Real Clear Politics associate editor A.B . Stoddard , if there was a “ double standard ” for Democrats “ not coming out and condemning this ” behavior from Weinstein . She noted that Clinton gave a lengthy speech the night before without one mention of the major Democrat donor , who had given money to her own campaign . Stoddard noted that President Obama also benefitted from Weinstein 's contributions , so it was “ time ” for both to “ man up ” and speak out :
ALISYN CAMEROTA : Harvey Weinstein has been ousted after a series of really disgusting sexual harassment and just sexual -- I mean , it 's beyond sexual harassment , some of the things that he is accused of . But do you think there 's a double standard in terms of Democrats not coming out and condemning this ? In fact , Hillary Clinton gave a 90-minute-speech last night in California , did n't mention it . A.B . STODDARD : Absolutely there 's a double standard . I do n't care whether she ever weighed in on Roger Ailes or anyone else , she is a public person , she has benefited from his support in the past . She needs to talk about whether , you know , corporate culture permits this kind of complicity where they cover up for each other . Let alone how the women have been treated and what they 've suffered . This is not one incident , it went on for decades . And I think it 's time for her to man up and President Obama as well . And people who have really enjoyed his support through the years .
As she was speaking , CNN 's graphics team put up photos of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner smiling with Weinstein . Anchors Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota chuckled and joked that they were not insinuating that Weinstein was friends with the current White House . “ He is a huge Democrat . This is not about him pawning up to the White House , ” Cuomo said . Camerota added , “ He 's given millions to Democrats and bundles for Democrats . ”
Political commentator Chris Cillizza noted that Weinstein was a major figure in both candidate 's campaigns , and that it was “ amazing ” that neither one had spoken out against Weinstein yet :
He has held fund-raisers , he held multiple fundraisers for Barack Obama 's campaign , not just donating money but raising money . He held fundraisers for Hillary Clinton 's campaign . Yes , he is a person who gets his photograph made because he is famous with other famous people including , yes , Donald Trump , yes Ivanka Trump , yes Jared Kushner , thank you my Twitter followers for being sure to send me that picture of Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein 10 million times . The broader point is that this guy is a Democrat , he is a very high-profile Democrat , fund-raiser and bundler of money and I just think it 's amazing that you do n't see Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama who frankly are still the two highest profile Democrats in the country not say this is unacceptable behavior .
After Camerota asked Cillizza why , Cillizza noted it might be “ situational ethics , ” which Cuomo roundly condemned :
CAMEROTA : Why is that , Chris ? Because it 's not the easiest thing to say , to come out and condemn this ? Why are they not doing it ? CILLIZZA : I do n't know . The cynics take would be situational ethics . It 's easy to condemn people you 're not friends with . It 's harder to condemn people you are friends with . CUOMO : That 's a phrase but there is no thing such as situational ethics . CILLIZZA : There should n't be but there is . CUOMO : There 's doing the right thing and there 's not doing the right thing . Lawmakers too , if you took his money , there should be a watch , what do you do with Weinstein 's money . CILLIZZA : Of course . CUOMO : Do you give it back ? When do you give it back ? CAMEROTA : All sorts of people are giving it to charity . That sounds like the right answer . But we have n't heard that yet from other high profile Democrats . CUOMO : All sorts but not that many .
Cillizza agreed that it would be good for Democrats to give back their donations , but the bigger issue was that neither of the Clintons nor our former president were saying anything about one of the biggest stories this week :
But again Alisyn , I think it 's important to remember : It 's good if Dick Blumenthal from Connecticut gives back the $ 5500 dollars or whatever Weinstein gave him but you 're talking about Bill Clinton , Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , the three biggest names in Democratic politics for the past fifteen years , twenty years , not saying anything about -- forget money , donations and bundling . But not saying anything about this story , forget money and donations and bundling -- but not saying anything about this story , which is , you know , inarguably one of the five biggest stories in the country . You could argue it 's the biggest , but certainly one of the bigger stories in the country . Nothing ? Not a statement , not one sentence saying “ I condemn this behavior. ” Of course they do . The point is when you 're a public figure you need to be on record on these things .
Even Cuomo noted the discrepancy between their public criticism of President Trump but their silence over Weinstein :
Especially if you want moral high ground . That 's been such a big pushback against the President of the united States . You have to own it and you have to do it when it 's not convenient as well as when it is playing to advantage .
Later , in the 7am hour , Camerota sat down with Senator Tim Kaine and asked him about his former running mate 's silence over the Weinstein allegations , and whether they should give back their campaign donations :
He gave $ 35,000 to yours and Hillary Clinton 's 2016 election effort . Should that money be given back ?
Kaine explained the money had already been spent during the campaign , but said Clinton should “ call out ” the “ bad behavior ” from Weinstein .
“ But you would recommend that she do that ? ” Camerota pressed Kaine for a more direct rebuke . He replied , “ Any leader should condemn this . ”
Camerota brought up that part of the interview during the 8:00 hour , asking CNN 's Political Director David Chalian if it was “ too dangerous a territory ” for Clinton to speak about , considering her husband 's history with sexual assault :
Chalian dismissed that argument , saying he did n't “ understand ” that perspective at all .
She explained that Clinton could be getting into “ dicey territory ” by condemning Weinstein , when she would n't defend the victims of her own husband :
Well because her husband was accused of things and it gets into very dicey territory for her to condemn it so strongly against Harvey Weinstein and then people say why did n't you ever speak out for the victims of Bill Clinton . You heard this story in the campaign !
Chalian again dismissed this notion , saying Clinton had spoken out against domestic violence for years :
“ I do n't think it 's complicated for her to come out and condemn someone who gave her political donations , simply for that fact alone , ” he pressed .
“ So why is she not doing it ? ” Camerota asked .
“ I do n't know the answer to that , ” Chalian replied . But he argued , she should be speaking out anyway , along with Barack Obama , who also received donations from Weinstein :
Barack Obama , also , this is just unconscionable to me , that people with huge megaphones , and even more important because they did receive his donations and have been patronized by him , do not come out and speak out against this .
Cuomo echoed Chris Cillizza 's earlier take , that they were silent on Weinstein because it was easier to criticize people outside your party :
Is n't that the answer ? You do n't criticize people who you are close to the way you do with people you are not close to . Let 's be honest . This has been quiet , this story . There 's another layer to it . “ Oh well , we did n't really know. ” No , we keep hearing well , everybody knew , everybody knew . That 's their problem . If everybody knew and you delayed saying anything when it wound up being public , what is your defense ?
CNN political analyst David Gregory , agreed there was no defense for Clinton and Obama not speaking out , saying that anyone who knew about Weinstein 's behavior before was a hypocrite now :
“ You are at least a hypocrite if you are going to really step out and speak about people who are in the middle of all of this , ” he noted , after both Democrat politicians had come out strongly against presidential candidate Donald Trump after the 2005 Access Hollywood tape was leaked in 2016 .

Riding the train in Canada is like stepping into a time warp . Via Rail Canada 's passenger car fleet is a hodge-podge of mismatched equipment built as long ago as 1947 , and it is a national embarrassment .
In February , Via placed a bid for 12 RDCs – Rail Diesel Cars – that were offered for sale by Dallas Area Rapid Transit ( DART ) . These RDCs were built in the 1950s and were originally owned by Via . They were sold to DART in 1993 following the cuts to Via by the government of Brian Mulroney in 1990 . Via placed a market-value offer but were outbid by a Vermont startup interested in developing regional rail services in and around Burlington .
Via intended to refurbish the RDCs for expanded regional services in Ontario and the Maritimes . However , the fact that Via placed a bid on 1950s-built railcars in 2017 is reflective of a bigger problem with Canada 's national passenger railway . It is starved of capital funding and as a result its fleet truly is ancient .
If you board a train in Montreal , you will ride on one of three types of equipment . The newest cars are Via 's Renaissance trains . These cars were purchased from the United Kingdom by the government of Jean Chrétien in late 2000 . The fleet was built for proposed overnight Channel Tunnel services and was entirely unsuited to Canadian weather and track , but as the cars were surplus they were very affordable . Today , the Renaissance cars are the most expensive to operate : Each train requires an extra non-revenue car to provide controls to the coaches ; the cars are not interchangeable with any other railcars in Canada ; and the fleet has exhibited serious corrosion problems , with many cars stored unserviceable .
Via 's LRC ( Light , Rapid , Comfortable ) fleet was built by Bombardier between 1981 and 1984 . The LRCs are in the final phase of a major refurbishment program , but this does not alter the fact that these lightweight train cars were not designed to operate for 36 years and counting . Many are exhibiting structural problems and will need to be replaced soon for safety and reliability reasons .
The oldest trains in VIA 's fleet are HEP-2 ( Head End Power ) cars . These were built between 1947 and 1953 for American streamliners . They were purchased secondhand and refurbished by Via in the 1990s without any extra government capital funding . These antique trains are not used out on quiet remote services . They are used on fast intercity trains in southern Ontario and Quebec . Some of our nation 's busiest trains are 70 years old , and this is a disgrace .
Via 's mismatched fleet requires expensive duplication of skills and materials for maintenance . It may be a rail enthusiast 's dream to ride on a 1940s ' passenger car between Toronto and Montreal , but for a national passenger railway it is an embarrassment .
Canada is the only G7 nation that has not seen significant capital funding in intercity passenger rail in a generation . Since 2000 , Via has only received a total of $ 1.6 billion ( 2017 dollars ) for capital investments . In comparison , the United Kingdom spends more than that on passenger rail capital projects each year , with work wrapping up in 2018 on a new , $ 26-billion passenger rail line through London . When Via received its last purpose-built passenger cars in 1984 , China still had trains pulled by steam engines . Today , China has the largest high-speed rail network in the world . Canada has yet to build a single high-speed line .
A new fleet needs to bring standardization and flexibility to Via 's operations in Ontario , Quebec and the Maritimes , and allow expansion of services in western Canada . It needs to be reliable , and must thus be an adaptation of a current intercity passenger train product offered by one of the major suppliers : Alstom , Bombardier , CAF , Siemens . The supplier needs to offer a “ build and maintain ” contract , so reliability issues are the responsibility of the supplier and not the Canadian taxpayer .
Most importantly , a new fleet for Via needs to be modern and reflective of 21st-century Canada and its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint by providing fast and efficient intercity train service . It should not be a British hand-me-down or a rebuilt train from the 1950s .

The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party , which has strong ties to Labour .
Members of the group , the UK 's biggest mutual organisation , voted on the issue at their annual general meeting .
They passed a motion by 48,579 for , to 39,479 against , to approve `` political expenditures '' of up to £1m which support the movement 's objectives .
Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party .
This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years .
The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say .
The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen .
The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013 , bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year .
Members ' motion
The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs , including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy .
The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party , and the two political movements have strong historical ties .
The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party , or any other party .
Allan Leighton , chairman of the Co-op Group , said : `` There 's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party .
`` It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next . ''
There was also a members ' motion on the agenda , put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year .
The motion to approve political funding `` not to exceed £1m per annum '' was carried by 55.17 % to 44.83 % .

BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said : `` To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds .
`` It 's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members . ''
He said that `` in theory '' , each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms , as well as how its bosses are paid , and retaining the links to the Co-operative party .
One of the group 's largest independent societies , Midcounties , recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group 's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote .

You do n't need to hate the way things are to look forward to change . The Guild Wars 2 hype has set it up as a rebuttal to the way things are done in MMOs : a rejection of unchanging worlds , heroism without consequence and epic battles that are more about logistics than bravado .
These expectations have been generated as much by the gaming community as by NCsoft 's marketing . Simply by promising to do things differently , Guild Wars 2 has found itself nominated as the saviour of its genre . Lead designer Eric Flannum is more modest . “ What we tried to do was take a look at what an MMO could be , and try to make it appeal to not only people who love MMOs but also people who maybe have n't tried an MMO for various reasons . ”
As someone who likes MMOs – and who is n't necessarily convinced they need saving – I 'm treating my uninterrupted weekend with the game as an opportunity to see how far it can deliver on its big ideas . If it can convince me that we really have been doing everything wrong since World of Warcraft , then ArenaNet could be on to something .
I opt to play a female human warrior . My choice of race is down to the fact that the human starting area – lush farmland under attack by roaming centaur warbands – is the most frequently cited example of GW2 's evolving 'events ' system , where quests are thrown out in favour of dynamic objectives based on the independent actions of players , monsters and friendly NPCs . I become a mail-clad warrior , meanwhile , because I want my character to put some bloody clothes on . The land of Tyria is populated by clear-faced underwear models , and it 's an uphill struggle to make a female character who does n't look 15 years old . The best I can do is a kind of Disney Joan of Arc , a waif-thin airbrushed beauty wielding a sword bigger than she is . I avoid spellcasters entirely because there 's only so much Renaissance-themed fetish gear I can handle .
It 's a negative first impression , albeit one that 's down to personal preference . The first Guild Wars had a similar look , after all , and it 's classier than Aion or Lineage . As with the rest of GW2 's art direction there 's an obvious investment of thought , detail and style – it just wo n't be to everyone 's taste .
I 'm asked a series of questions about my character 's life , from the serious – her biggest regret – to the mundane , such as deciding what kind of helmet she wears . These choices are written up as a letter in the first person , describing the kind of person my character is . Signing the letter establishes her name , and we 're off . It 's a lovely system , and successful in making me feel ownership of my character straight away .
After a hand-painted introduction I 'm dropped into the village of Shaemoor during a centaur attack . This is an instanced crisis , the kind that many MMOs begin with – but what 's striking is that no one immediately tells me what to do . I rush towards a nearby player and help her take down a spear-wielding centaur . Control-wise , everything is where I expect it to be . I 'm equipped with a one-handed sword , and hammering the ' 1 ' key makes things die . So far , so MMO .
An NPC shouts at me to get to the inn , and a waypoint appears on my minimap . I start to notice quirks in the combat system : while I can target enemies , I do n't need to do so in order to hit them , and pressing the attack key causes my character to swing her sword regardless of whether she 's in range . Damage is based on stats , but hitting a foe is partly twitch-based – a fact backed up by the evade system that lets you double-tap a movement key to roll out of the way .
When I reach the inn I enter a brief conversation with an NPC . These sequences are presented as oneon- one dialogues against a painted backdrop . Players are voiced , but you do n't have any choice about what they say : it 's not The Old Republic . I 'm told to help out at a nearby guardhouse , and off I go again .
On the way , I loot a two-handed sword from a centaur warrior . Equipping it , my abilities immediately change . Every weapon in Guild Wars 2 has its own set of special moves , which range from area-of-effect attacks to throwing a greatsword like a four-foot steel boomerang . Moves are unlocked as you rack up kills with the weapon , so you have to work to access the full potential of a given loadout . It 's very straightforward in practice , and it 's impressive that only a few minutes into the game I 'm already playing differently to the hammer-and-shield warrior next to me .
I 'm the first player to reach the guardhouse , and as I arrive a message pops up : event started , defend the gate . Centaurs charge in from the hills and , of course , I fight them . I 've got no kill-quota to hit , and I do n't actually know how long the siege will last . More players join , and the centaur onslaught increases in intensity – I suspect the game is scaling up the encounter to match the amount of defenders , but my focus is on murdering horse-men , not mechanics . I 'm paying attention to my goals as a character rather than my goals as a player .
Guild Wars 2 's events system is starting to make sense . “ Events are very visual , ” Flannum says . “ They do n't require a lot of explanation . You run into a city and there are centaurs attacking everyone – you kind of know what to do , right ? ”
The subtle Zionist propaganda of the New York Times
By Lawrence Davidson
In our house we get the New York Times ( NYT ) because the Philadelphia Inquirer 's ( that is our city paper ) coverage of international affairs is very limited . Sometimes I wonder why we bother . One can find a more thorough and certainly more balanced coverage on the web . However , we still enjoy the tradition of perusing a newspaper at the breakfast table .
It is important to keep in mind that a newspaper , or really any media source , really , is a reflection of the political and cultural sensibilities of its owners and managers . So you can politically and culturally peg those who run a media outlet such as a newspaper by what makes up its content as well as what is left out .
“ Snowy sky in Jerusalem ”
For instance , take the front page of the NYT for Saturday 14 December 2013 . There , above the fold , we find a large picture of what looks like a resort in the middle of a snowstorm . The description under the picture orients us : “ Under a snowy sky in Jerusalem , Laps in a pool . A snowstorm around Jerusalem disrupted travel and electricity on Friday but did not deter a swimmer at the David Citadel Hotel. ” Beyond these few words there is no story . There is just the picture of what is an unusual climatic occurrence . Yet the photo also presents an image of Israel as a well-developed place . Some might see the photo as proof of their conviction that the Israelis really have made “ the desert bloom ” – with swimming pools .
What is left out ?
One thing you will not learn from the NYT is that Israeli development is always balanced by Palestinian de-development . This is the inevitable result of the fact that Israel is a nation built on property acquired through a long and ongoing process of ethnic cleansing . This consistent off-setting of development with de-development is reflected in present-day conditions in the Gaza Strip .
On the same day that the NYT put its poolside “ Snowy sky in Jerusalem ” picture on its front page , a spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) stated :
Large swathes of Gaza are a disaster area with water as far as the eye could see… Any normal community would struggle to recover from this disaster . But a community that been subjected to one of the longest blockades in human history , whose public health system has been destroyed and where the risk of disease was already rife , must be freed from these man-made constraints to deal with the impact of a natural calamity such as this .
The flooding in the Gaza Strip is in part a consequence of the same snowy weather depicted in the NYT 's Jerusalem photo . However , it is also the consequence of Israel 's systematic destruction of the infrastructure of Gaza . That process of de-development has been going on for a long time . Thus , no one should be impressed because the Israelis , responding belatedly and half-heartedly , recently permitted into Gaza two weeks ' worth of fuel and some pumps to help with the flooding . These were not timely gifts from a concerned neighbour . Most of these supplies were paid for by Qatar . It is to be noted that Gaza 's only power plant went dead months ago thanks to Israel 's refusal [ and the destruction of the tunnels by Egypt ] to allow the import of adequate fuel supplies and replacement parts for its infrastructural equipment . Gazans have been subsisting on an average of three hours of electricity per day .
On 15 December 2013 the NYT did print a piece entitled “ Gaza , vexed by floods , gets fuel and power ” . However , reading this piece ( which did not include the UNRWA statement ) you get the impression that the Israelis have nothing to do with Gaza 's problems . The article makes it seen that the fault lies with the West Bank-based Palestine Authority ( PA ) . It claims that the PA “ can always ship oil to Gaza through Israel ” . This is a highly misleading claim , for the Israelis regulate the import of fuel to a trickle of the population 's real need . However , the article goes on to claim that the PA taxes the fuel and this contributes to its scarcity in Gaza . Laying the blame on the PA , as awful as the organization otherwise might be , is a terrible distortion of the truth .
Rationalizations
Of course , both the Israelis and those who run the NYT have their reasons for acting as they do .
The Israeli rationale goes something like this : “ The Palestinians hate us and want to destroy our state . The Hamas government in Gaza even fires missiles into southern Israeli cities . We keep all the people of Gaza locked up in order to protect ourselves from their enmity . ”
Yes , some of this is accurate . But why deal with the situation by locking 1.6 million people up in a ghetto , reducing them to poverty , and systematically destroying their infrastructure ? ( A particularly ironic strategy by a state , Israel , that claims to represent a people who were themselves oppressed in ghettos . ) Does it revenge for those missile attacks which are themselves revenge for Israeli aggression ? Despite the fact that Israeli hatred and fear of the Palestinians quite equals that of their adversaries , I do n't think the revenge hypothesis fully explains Israeli behaviour .
…most of the NYT 's editors and reporters working on Israeli and Palestinian issues are just the latest generation in a long line of supporters of the Zionist movement .
It is probable that the Israelis would have no need to implement their ghetto strategy if they were ready to reach a just and fair solution with all of the Palestinians ( the PA represents only a shrinking minority ) . However , they are not willing to do this , so the ghetto strategy follows naturally . As long as Israel persists in stealing Palestinian land in a process of relentless expansion , they must convince themselves of the irreconcilable nature of the conflict and persecute not only those who would resist , but the entire population of Palestinians .
How about the NYT ? Why is it that its staff refuse to accurately contextualize the paper 's coverage of Israel-Palestine ? Part of the answer is to be found in the imperatives of running a newspaper business ( that is , selling advertising ) in the ethnic climate of New York City . However , to this must be added the fact that most of the NYT 's editors and reporters working on Israeli and Palestinian issues are just the latest generation in a long line of supporters of the Zionist movement . They probably prefer so-called moderate Zionists rather than hard-core Likud-style ones such as Binyamin Netanyahu , but in practice this does not matter . They are sufficiently dedicated to Israel as a “ Jewish state ” to support it regardless of its sins . Thus , de facto , the NYT 's self-censors when it comes to Israel 's behaviour .
Alternative reads
Of course , readers are not limited to the NYT or any of the mainstream media . The World Wide Web has liberated us from these sources if only we know about the alternatives and take the time to go to them . I encourage readers to consult the links at the side of the home page of my blog , To the Point Analysis , for some of these important sources . In addition I have listed below other examples of sites that give a different take on US government behaviour both at home and abroad :
There are many others as well . The important point is not to remain passive and , out of inertia , simply rely on the mainstream media at hand . To do so is to lock yourself away in a small and easily manipulated world that , almost inevitably , will have you justifying unnecessary warlike actions against peoples whose enemy status is based more on propaganda than truth .
The real world is much larger . It deserves a bit of effort to get an accurate sense of what is happening to it , and to you .
Does anyone remember the horror movie “ Hostel ” ? This deep/dark hotel where its victims get slaughtered could n't be further from reality . In fact , hostels of today are comfy , a great way to save money , and most of all meet new friends ! So , here are five youth hostels near ski resorts that are a treat instead of a trick .
5 Best Youth Hostels near Ski Resorts
Mellow Mountain Hostel – South Lake Tahoe
One of the hippest on the list , this hostel has been featured in Powder Magazine and has that cool vibe that you look for not only in a hostel but even a hotel . The best part is it 's just steps away from Heavenly 's gondola and a short ride to Sierra-at-Tahoe .
St Moritz Lodge – Aspen
Aspen is known for its luxurious lodging and amazing terrain . From Ajax to Buttermilk , there is a mountain specifically designed for your skill level . Does that mean you ca n't hit these resorts without spending a fortune on lodging or staying 60 miles away ? Nope ! This is where St. Moritz Lodge comes into play . Named after the high alpine resort in the eastern Swiss Alps , this is a great choice if you 're looking for that European style hostel lodging at a great price . To sweeten the deal even more , it 's within walking distance of the après scene and transportation to all the ski resorts .
Taos has been home to art and furniture making for centuries . From Georgia O'Keefe to DH Lawrence , many famous artists have called this place home . Besides the amazing skiing , this region is still a hot bed of artistry with nearly 80 galleries and three museums . If you want to keep this spirit alive , stay at the Snow Mansion hostel . Owned by the art commune in Taos called the Seco Pearl , the hostel is how they make money to support their community . Our Local Freshies® contributor ‘ Q ' stayed at the Snow Mansion and raved about it on his Local Lowdown spotcheck . With free parking , a pool table , organic dinners , coffee/cereal/fresh fruit breakfasts and an option for having your own room , he said it was pretty awesome .
Hostels afford you the opportunity to meet people and learn about others ' cultures . The Hostel in Jackson Hole is considered as one of the best in the world near the slopes . It 's especially amazing since it 's located at the base of the famous Tram which accesses nearly 4,000+ vertical feet of steep snow covered terrain .
Whistler is one of the few ski destinations that does n't have just one hostel but multiple options . Out of all the choices , the Whistler Lodge Hostel is a bit more unique . Built in 1965 by University of British Columbia students , it was designed as a touring lodge with a reputation rooted in its legendary parties . Over time though , it has grown more refined along with the surrounding area . Today , it still has that cozy cabin feel but with an upgrade to its interior .
Skiing and snowboarding can be expensive sports , but with a little bit of flexibility you can enjoy these mountains at a fraction of the cost by staying at a hostel . Let us know if you 've crashed at any others deserving of a place on the list .

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lord Steel : `` I just detect that there 's a general feeling that we need to recharge our batteries and recharge our values ''
Former Liberal leader Lord Steel has said he doubts Liberal Democrat members will want to be part of a coalition after May 's general election .
He told the BBC `` the most '' Lib Dems would accept in another hung parliament is a confidence and supply deal - where policies are agreed on a case-by-case basis , rather than a formal coalition .
There was a `` feeling '' the party needed to `` recharge our values '' , he said .
Lord Steel added : `` Association with another party is not the way to do it . ''
With polls predicting no clear winner at May 's general election , the Liberal Democrats could be called upon to shore up a Conservative or Labour-led government , says BBC parliamentary reporter Rebecca Keating .
Lord Steel told the BBC 's parliamentary programme The Week in Parliament : `` I 'm pretty certain that the mood in the party will be to say the very most we would accept would be confidence and supply .
`` I just detect that there 's a general feeling that we need to recharge our batteries and recharge our values and that association with another party is not the way to do it . ''
Minority government
Lord Steel , who was leader of the Liberal Party until it merged with the Social Democratic Party to form the Lib Dems in 1988 , said he did not think there would be a mood in the party to go into another coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour .
He said : `` What 's more , I think in the other two parties if you examine what 's happened a lot of David Cameron 's Tories want a Tory-only government , even if it 's a minority one , and similarly on the Labour side .
`` So I suspect if you have to look into the crystal ball that we 're going to get a minority government which will have a multitude of minorities in the parliament , which is something new , and they 'll be able to play one off against the other .
`` There 's no reason why it should n't succeed . ''
Asked about the possibility of a change of leadership in the party after the poll , Lord Steel said : `` We must n't start pushing Nick Clegg out the window until we 've actually had the election . ''
Mr Clegg , when asked earlier this week if he would miss being deputy prime minister , said that he `` very much hoped the Liberal Democrats would be back in government '' .
The Scottish Liberal Democrats spring conference is currently taking place in Aberdeen .
Addressing the conference on Friday , Mr Clegg also said his party `` will do so much better than anyone thinks '' at the general election .
`` It wo n't be easy , but winning should n't be , '' he added .
Willie Rennie , who leads the Lib Dems in Scotland , said the party should be `` seeking alliances '' in the event of a hung Parliament if it helps see their policies put into place .
The Mid Scotland and Fife MSP said : `` We need to stay the course , not the swings from left to right but actually keeping the course , the steady course that we 've pursued in the last few years . ''

The public editorship of the New York Times was always a fictitious job . That essential truth was made clear on Wednesday morning , when the paper 's publisher , Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. , announced that he would be terminating the position , less than a year into the term of its sixth and final occupant , Liz Spayd .
Spayd 's columns were widely mocked and despised , especially by other people in the media . Still , she was probably not the worst public editor the Times ever had . She produced only one valuable column , in an otherwise unbroken string of dumb and wrong ones , but that was one more than readers ever got from Byron Calame or Arthur Brisbane or that other guy , whoever he was . Clark Hoyt ?
Story Continued Below
The majority of the public editors were bad because the public editor 's job was designed to be badly done . It was created after the Jayson Blair scandal and the collapse of Howell Raines ' executive editorship , as a means of showing that the Times was serious about managing the institutional damage . The first public editor , Daniel Okrent , was sharp and rigorous , befitting a newspaper that saw its mission as a sacred trust and had obvious lessons to learn from its failures . Once the crisis had passed , though , Sulzberger seemed to approach the routine duty of holding his paper accountable the same way a surly 12-year-old approaches the task of mowing the lawn—if he could do it badly enough , maybe people would decide he should n't have been made to do it at all .
So the work of minding the Times fell to a series of timid people , dull-witted ones and bores . Only the fifth public editor , Margaret Sullivan , broke with that pattern and did her job energetically enough that she ended up being hired as a real media columnist , at the Washington Post . Sometime between Sullivan 's tenure and the end of Spayd 's , though , the boilerplate on the public editor 's web page was revised so that the word `` independently '' disappeared from the phrase , `` The public editor works independently , outside of the reporting and editing structure of the newspaper . ''
It was an honest enough change . All along , the public editor had been hired by the publisher—and therefore could be shut down by the publisher . Like a president facing a nettlesome attorney general or FBI director , Sulzberger had the power to end the scrutiny whenever it suited him .
From a certain angle , then , Spayd was the most successful public editor of all , achieving harmony with her boss . The overriding message of her brief time in the position was that the job , as she conceived it , was a foolish one and not worth doing .
Sulzberger felt the same . Announcing the early end of Spayd 's job , he wrote that the paper must now take its guidance from the mass voice of social media and the internet . `` Our responsibility is to empower all of those watchdogs , and to listen to them , rather than to channel their voice through a single office , '' he wrote .
This deference to the dubious wisdom of the online crowd was Spayd 's guiding principle as public editor , spelled out in the headline of her debut column : “ Want to Attract More Readers ? Try Listening to Them. ” In that introductory piece , she disparaged journalists ' “ reflexive aversion to interacting with readers ” and wrote that the Times newsroom was “ too distant from the people it serves ” :
Take reader comments on stories . This is arguably the most elemental way The Times can let its audience engage . Yet only about 10 percent of articles on any given day are open for comment .
This morning , Sulzberger neatly echoed the message :
Currently , we open only 10 percent of our articles to reader comments . Soon , we will open up most of our articles to reader comments . This expansion , made possible by a collaboration with Google , marks a sea change in our ability to serve our readers , to hear from them , and to respond to them .
The idea that online comments will be a force for improvement is an odd one to encounter in 2017 . But Spayd had a powerful faith in the public , made more powerful because she had no coherent idea of what the public was . She was a deeply conventional journalistic insider—managing editor of the Washington Post , then editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review—trying to imitate an outsider .
As counterpoint to her familiar , sacred professional journalist 's viewpoint from nowhere , she offered a mangled , imaginary viewpoint from everywhere . No complaint was too bogus or vapid to merit serious consideration :
One reader from California who asked not to be named believes Times reporters and editors are trying to sway public opinion toward their own beliefs . “ I never thought I 'd see the day when I , as a liberal , would start getting so frustrated with the one-sided reporting that I would start hopping over to the Fox News webpage to read an article and get the rest of the story that the NYT refused to publish , ” she says .
Here 's frustration as it crests , from James , an Arizona reader : “ You 've lost a subscriber because of your relentless bias against Trump — and I 'm not even a Republican . ”
You can imagine what the letters from actual conservatives sound like .
Most people with experience writing about politics online did know exactly what letters like conservatives would sound like—they would sound just like those letters , complete with suspicious disclaimers of bias on the letter-writers ' part . Spayd , though , operated as if the contents of her inbox were some reasonable sampling of public sentiment , rather than the weaponized claims of various pressure groups .
Some amount of this confusion was a built-in hazard of the job . The much-admired Sullivan once devoted a blog post to a letter criticizing the Times ' indifference to the March for Life , a complaint copied straight from a Catholic League press release . But Spayd had , if anything , an affirmative preference for chaff over wheat .
If there was a unifying concept to her work , it was that the newspaper should above all cater to the sensibilities of people who do n't like the newspaper—culminating in a flabbergasting column earlier this month in which she worried that not enough people were suing the New York Times for libel . It would be “ disconcerting , ” Spayd wrote , if the shortage of lawsuits “ suggests that those with a legitimate claim feel too intimidated to even try . ”
But even Spayd 's best column was undermined by her inability to defend real values against bogus sentiment . Back in December , she presented an unflinching , reporting-based indictment of the Times ' failure to diversify its newsroom , under the ruthless and accurate headline “ Preaching the Gospel of Diversity , but Not Following It. ” It was a model of what an aggressive internal watchdog could do :
Only two of the 20-plus reporters who covered the presidential campaign for The New York Times were black . None were Latino or Asian . That 's less diversity than you 'll find in Donald Trump 's cabinet thus far . Of The Times 's newly named White House team , all six are white , as is most everyone in the Washington bureau ...
The executive editor , Dean Baquet , is African-American . The other editors on his masthead are white . The staff with the most diversity ? The news assistants , who mostly do administrative jobs and get paid the least ....
Given The Times 's ambitions across global cultures and languages , it would seem that instead of being a lagger , it would insist on being a leader—and make that an explicit goal . I see no sign that this is happening .
Three months later , Spayd devoted an entire 690-word column to the fact that the Times culture writer Sopan Deb had made a joking quote-tweet around a tweet in which the rapper Bow Wow had insulted First Lady Melania Trump—a complicated nest of referents that nevertheless set off a right-wing complaint campaign . Spayd wrote :
Deb accurately pointed out that some far-right conservative groups have latched onto his tweet for their own purposes , and in fact some of the letters I 've received may be the result of that .
On the other hand , you do n't have to be a conservative to look at the language and imagery in the original tweet from Bow Wow and be offended . I was . As a journalist it would seem to have a red flag staked through the middle of it .
Even though she concluded there was no malice behind Deb 's tweet , Spayd warned that “ mainstream readers … might easily take offense. ” The Times needed to hire more minorities , but those minority employees risked being dressed down by the public editor if they did anything to upset “ mainstream ” sensibilities .
Spayd 's reportorial view of the inside workings of the Times apparently commanded less of her attention than the vision of the paper she attributed to outsiders . So , too , in April , when the op-ed section announced it was hiring Bret Stephens from the Wall Street Journal , Spayd could only respond to reader outrage with bromides about “ hiring people who do n't conform to a liberal orthodoxy of thought ” and “ whether The Times should be a paper for all of America . ”
Spayd did mention that Stephens was “ yet another white male ” in the op-ed department , but not that he was , in fact , the section 's third self-identified anti-Trump conservative columnist . The idea of promoting ideological diversity was what mattered , not the resulting lack of diversity of ideology .
Nor did she mention that the opinion editor who hired Stephens , James Bennet , was a white man , who had been hired by Sulzberger to replace a white man , Andrew Rosenthal , who was the son of the former Times top editor A.M. Rosenthal , also a white man . The elder Rosenthal had been hired by Arthur O. Sulzberger Sr. , the father of Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr . Some institutional problems were less open to discussion than others . The public editors were a flagellating instrument , meant to sting the paper on its surface , never to cut to the bone .

Julie Isphording has run in more races than she can count .
She won the Los Angeles Marathon in 1990 . A Cincinnati native , she 's won her hometown 's Thanksgiving Day Race 12 times . Now , she 's managed the charity race for 12 years .
Yet Isphording has n't slept since Thursday 's event , as she contemplates changes to next year 's race .
`` It 's 2 a.m. in the morning and I ca n't shake the thought of watching people steal food , '' Isphording said . `` People were stealing food , cussing kids out and one threw a box at me . They threw it right in my face . ''
The Thanksgiving Day Race is one of the longest running road races in the United States . For 105 years , Cincinnatians have been running through downtown on the morning before turkey feasts at home .
Every year the numbers have grown . The 2014 run had more than 15,000 participants . Money raised from the event goes to 12 local charities that range from the Ronald McDonald House to the Alzheimer 's Association of Greater Cincinnati .
After running 10 kilometers , participants are greeted with energy bars , granola bars , yogurt , bagels , fruit and more . There 's always enough to go around from first finisher to the last . In fact , there 's often so much that the extras are packed up and donated to the Freestore Foodbank .
Not this year .
`` There were people jumping in dumpsters ... ''
Thanksgiving Day was nearly a perfect day for runners .
The temperature was a bit low , right around freezing at the start , but skies were clear and the roads were dry .
`` The course was clean , the water stop was beautiful and we had a gorgeous 25-minute start line , '' Isphording said . `` It was a perfect day . ''
Isphording said the things she worries about most on race day are usually the health of runners . One Thanksgiving she recalls sitting in the emergency room with a man who had a heart attack in the middle of the race . She still remembers hugging the man 's wife when she showed up .

`` The day is about friends and family , '' Isphording said .
But what happened this year is haunting Isphording .
Early finishers of the Thanksgiving Day Race on Thursday wanted more of the post-race snacks than their hands and arms could hold .
Workers from Pure Protein came to pass out small , tissue-box-sized boxes of about four samples of their energy bars on Saturday . They were encouraging runners to take one of the small boxes . People took these and then some .
Isphording and other finishers saw people filling these small boxes with treats from every station to which they could hustle . When those small boxes were full , they looked elsewhere .
`` There were people were jumping in dumpsters to find bigger boxes , '' Isphording said . `` I could n't believe it . People brought bags of their own just so they could stuff them full . ''
After the plundering of the post-race snack zone , many finishers fled as fast as they finished . They did n't leave much behind .
`` All that was left was liquid , '' Isphording said . `` There was n't any food left for the walkers . ''
The Freestore Foodbank became a distant afterthought .
Liz Harvey , of Hebron , participated in the race and wrote a letter to The Enquirer on Friday that detailed her own account of the post-race raid .
`` Everywhere I looked the boxes were getting bigger , '' Harvey said . `` Some were having trouble carrying their full boxes that were now overflowing . I was completely disgusted by this display of greed , made worse by the irony that this was a day to give thanks and remember those less fortunate . ''
Dozens of runners shared similar thoughts with Harvey and with The Enquirer .
`` I 'm shocked by the growing amount of entitlement I see now , '' Isphording says . `` I watched this happens on Thursday and then see similar things happen with people knocking others over just to save a few hundred dollars on a television on Black Friday . ''
' I 've thought about resigning '
`` I spent eight months out of the year preparing for this event , '' Isphording said . `` I 've thought about resigning . ''
Isphording said she still has n't had a Thanksgiving dinner . She 's been too upset .
She thinks the honor system in place for years at the run may be a thing of the past .
`` Operationally we 've done something wrong , '' Isphording said. `` We 're going to have to streamline the whole system . We 're not going to be able to use high school students anymore . They were n't able to stop the people stealing the food . ''
Isphording has been on the phone constantly since the event . She 's talked at length with her close friend , Doug Olberding , about what steps to take in 2015 . Olberding volunteered at the Thanksgiving Day Race and is on the board of the organization that runs the Flying Pig Marathon .
Isphording says the Flying Pig has never had a problem like this . But she noted that marathon is much smaller in comparison - and the participants were much more tired .

Olberding and Isphording came with short-term solutions that include the removal of young volunteers , stricter boundaries around and behind tables and only allowing people through the distribution area once , akin to the Flying Pig finish line .
The event is meant to encourage giving and thanks , Isphording stresses . `` We 're always just trying to maximize what we give to the charities , '' she said
`` We can only hope that those people went straight to the Freestore Foodbank with that food , '' Isphording said .

Hundreds of staff at Scotland 's largest local authority have voted in favour of strike action in an on-going dispute over pay and conditions .
The GMB union said it would ballot for strike action unless Glasgow City Council `` immediately withdraw '' proposed cuts affecting its members .
In a consultative ballot of 1,000 staff , more than 80 % voted , with 95 % backing industrial action .
The council said it had consulted with the unions `` every step of the way '' .
Those balloted work in areas such as refuse , street cleaning and parks .
'Financial crisis '
GMB officer Benny Rankin said : `` There has never been such a level of support for strike action in living memory .
`` After years of pay freezes and seeing their standard of living eroded , our members have had enough . ''
Mr Rankin said GMB members were `` not going to pay for the financial crisis in Glasgow '' .
`` We do n't care if the financial problems are down to John Swinney 's cuts or failings in Glasgow City Council , enough is enough , '' he said .
`` We demand that Glasgow City Council immediately withdraw the cuts to pay and conditions they tabled . If they do not , we will move to a formal ballot for strike action . ''
Cllr Frank McAveety , leader of Glasgow City Council , said : `` I 'm surprised to hear of these claims from the GMB . When the budget options are put to the council next week , I believe there will be no grounds for the threat of strikes .
`` We have consulted with the unions every step of the way and have delivered our pledge of no compulsory redundancies . Staff will also have among the best terms and conditions in the country .
`` This is despite having to save £130m over the next two years after the Scottish government made unprecedented cuts to our budget . ''

The Bulls ' primary press conference last week on the day the moratorium ended was for the official signing of Jimmy Butler to a maximum level contract worth about $ 95 million over five years .
You conduct a major press conference when your player is expected to perform like an All-Star and all-NBA player , as the one time 30th pick in the draft now is as among the highest paid players in the NBA .
Mike Dunleavy , who turns 35 in September , probably will not make as much money in his entire career . But Dunleavy 's return is perhaps as vital because the 6-9 veteran forward quietly was the Bulls the best three-point shooter last season . And then in the playoffs , Dunleavy was by far the Bulls most reliable shooter , which is especially important for a team that will be looking more to shooting threes this season .
Particularly as the Bulls starting backcourt of Derrick Rose and Butler is relatively undistinguished as long distance shooters .
“ I think I always knew what I was capable of , ” said Dunleavy , who agreed to a three-year deal worth about $ 14.5 million . “ I 'm pretty versatile , can play a bunch of different roles . I knew that coming in . Maybe I proved that to other people . But the big thing for me was not having a lot of playoff experience coming in and the last two years getting to the playoffs , this year to the second round . It just reassures me I like being in the fire , in the moment , when it all counts . When things are on the line I 'm very comfortable and those are things I am looking forward to as we move forward . Hopefully some deep playoff runs .
“ I 'm open to whatever role they want me to play , ” said Dunleavy , who likely will remain a starter with second year pro Doug McDermott getting his first significant playing time as a backup . “ The most important thing to me is the other R word , and that 's ring . I 'm open to whatever they want me to do . I feel we 'll have a good style of play . I know my teammates pretty well and have that comfort level . So I 'm just happy with whatever I can do to help . ”
Dunleavy averaged 9.4 points and 3.9 rebounds last season on a team best 40.7 percent three-point shooting . But numbers rarely tell the complete story with a player like Dunleavy , who passes and moves well , creating opportunities for others on offense . When Dunleavy missed 19 games with an ankle problem—after playing in all 82 games for the Bulls in 2013-14—the Bulls were 9-10 . With Dunleavy playing , they were 41-22 .
Plus , Dunleavy then excelled in the playoffs . He was the high scorer with 20 points and four of six threes in the best game the Bulls played in the playoffs , the Game 6 win in Milwaukee . Dunleavy shot 54.8 percent on threes against the Bucks or the Bulls may have lost that series . Overall in the two rounds , he shot 46.2 percent on threes and averaged 10.9 points , four rebounds and 2.6 assists . Dunleavy had been in the playoffs twice in his 11 seasons before signing with the Bulls in 2013 . But in his first playoff with the Bulls , his 35 points and eight of 10 threes were in the only game the Bulls won in the 2014 playoffs against the Wizards .
It was uncertain whether the Bulls could resign Dunleavy after last season with the big contract required to retain All-Star Butler . Plus , top teams like Cleveland were making inquires to get his three-point shooting abilities .
“ I had some flattering ( contacts ) , but for the most part I was dealing with the Bulls , ” said Dunleavy . “ And sure enough they came through on the first of July and held true to their word ( indicating during last season they hoped he 'd return ) and we were able to get a fair deal done . ”
Dunleavy probably could have shopped around for more money in an exploding NBA marketplace where role players like Alan Anderson signed for $ 4 million and Amir Johnson for $ 12 million . Dunleavy likewise took less than the Bucks offered to resign him in 2013 to be in a stronger playoff position with the Bulls . And even with the Bulls quiet in free agency other than retaining their players , Dunleavy says he 's both comfortable with what he felt was a fair and straightforward negotiation and optimistic about the Bulls ' playoff chances .
“ I think we have a chance to have a really good team that competes at the highest level , ” Dunleavy said . “ I know my teammates . I know what I 'm getting into as opposed to the other options , the unknown . I think my skill set and knowledge and things I bring to the table…is needed on the roster . So I think it works for both sides ; it appeals to me and appeals to them .
“ First and foremost the level of talent , ” Dunleavy said about his confidence in the team . “ We have a very good , deep talented roster ; secondly , we are a resilient , tough group . We 've shown that over the years . No matter what happens , what type of adversity , guys hang in there . We fight , we claw and you need that type of grit to get to a championship level . Hopefully everybody feels locked in and comfortable in their situations .
“ I 'm excited for Derrick not having to deal with a summer of rehab and questions and all that , ” said Dunleavy . “ I think he 'll be in a great place mentally to start the season and physically . I think he 's doing great . It 's great to have Jimmy back . Jo ( Noah ) will be healthy . There are so many things heading in the right direction , which is encouraging .
“ Also , everyone gets along , ” said Dunleavy , dismissing talk of friction . “ It 's just a matter of , at times , making it work on the court . Having that synergy , particularly on the offensive end , knowing where you are supposed to be , getting to spots , playing together , flowing through an offense . I 'm optimistic about that . I think we have some work to do , but I think we can get to where we need to be .
“ I think offensively we 'll look to flow more and get into stuff quicker and play a little bit more freely , less structured , ” Dunleavy predicted . “ But that all develops over the course of the season . I 'm sure Fred ( Hoiberg , coach ) will feel it out and see what 's best for our roster and we 'll go from there . Basically the biggest thing ( toward returning ) was my relationship with my teammates . This is the first team I 've been on where I 've felt the true bond with guys where every night you are going out there , there is a unity . I have n't necessarily felt that before throughout my career . Also being in Chicago , being a Bull and playing for one of the great franchises in all sports that ca n't be underestimated . That was a huge part of my decision in coming back . ”
And while there was initial uncertainly about Butler 's contract desires and a later move to add Aaron Brooks , Dunleavy said negotiations with the Bulls went smoothly .
“ I really enjoyed my first two years ( with the Bulls ) , though it was a very way different than I and most expected , ” Dunleavy said with a laugh . “ I think it went pretty well for me personally and I grew comfortable with the organization , my teammates , the city . From the time the season ended my thoughts were returning to the team and wanting to be back as long as we could make it work . The front office was super open about it . They made me feel wanted and made me feel part of this team and we were able to work something out . I 'm thankful but also excited about coming back for another couple of years .
“ My outlook did n't change , ” said Dunleavy . “ Be prepared for anything . That 's how it was the first time around . A lot of people thought I was going to play 18 to 20 minutes a night and lo and behold things changed . It 's my same outlook coming back for another couple of years . ”
Dunleavy also knows he 'll be counted on as a mentor for McDermott , and Dunleavy welcomes the role .
“ I 'm excited for Doug , ” Dunleavy said . “ He had a tough go his rookie year as a lot of guys do . Getting a good summer underneath him and coming back with confidence will help . I saw him in practice his rookie year and I had high expectations for him . He 's a really , really good basketball player and I 'm sure he was frustrated he did n't get to show it that much last year . I look forward to helping him and playing along side him . I 'm very excited for Doug 's future . My role is helping this team win . That 's the biggest thing for me .
I 'm open to anything . I just want to win . ”
UPDATE : No girl trapped in collapsed Mexico school ; all students are accounted for , officials say
A delicate effort to reach a young girl buried in the rubble of her school stretched into a daylong vigil for Mexico , much of it broadcast across the nation as rescue workers still struggled in rain and darkness early Thursday trying to pick away unstable debris and reach her .
The sight of her wiggling fingers early Wednesday became a symbol for the hope that drove thousands of professionals and volunteers to work frantically at dozens of wrecked buildings across the capital and nearby states looking for survivors of the magnitude 7.1 quake that killed at least 245 people in central Mexico and injured over 2,000 .
The death rose after Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said the number of confirmed dead in the capital had risen from 100 to 115 . An earlier federal government statement had put the overall toll at 230 , including 100 deaths in Mexico City .

Mancera also said two women and a man had been pulled alive from a collapsed office building in the city 's center Wednesday night , almost 36 hours after the quake .
Even as President Enrique Pena Nieto declared three days of mourning , soldiers , police , firefighters and everyday citizens kept digging through rubble , at times with their hands gaining an inch at a time , at times with cranes and backhoes to lift heavy slabs of concrete .
“ There are still people groaning . There are three more floors to remove rubble from . And you still hear people in there , ” said Evodio Dario Marcelino , a volunteer who was working with dozens of others at a collapsed apartment building .
A man was pulled alive from a partly collapsed apartment building in northern Mexico City more than 24 hours after the Tuesday quake and taken away in a stretcher , apparently conscious
In all , 52 people had been rescued alive since the quake , the city 's Social Development Department said , adding in a tweet : “ We wo n't stop. ” It was a race against time , Pena Nieto warned in a tweet of his own saying that “ every minute counts to save lives . ”
But the country 's attention focused on the collapsed Enrique Rebsamen school on the city 's south side , where 21 children and four adults had been confirmed dead .
IN PICTURES : A look at the damage to Mexico City after devastating earthquake
Hopes rose Wednesday when workers told local media they had detected signs that one girl was alive and she 's speaking to them through a hole dug in the rubble . Thermal imaging suggested several more people might be in the airspace around her .
A volunteer rescue worker , Hector Mendez , said cameras lowered into the rubble suggested there might be four people still inside , but he added that it was n't clear if anyone beside the girl was alive .
Dr. Alfredo Vega , who was working with the rescue team , said that a girl who he identified only as “ Frida Sofia ” had been located alive under the pancaked floor slabs .
Vega said “ she is alive , and she is telling us that there are five more children alive ” in the same space .
WATCH : Dozens of buildings have collapsed and more than 200 killed in Mexico City after a 7.1-magnitude quake hit the capital Tuesday .
Education Secretary Aurelio Nuno confirmed that the girl was alive , but said it was still not confirmed if other children were also alive under the rubble . Strangely , Nuno said , no relatives of a girl named Frida could be found .

While optimism ran strong for the girl 's rescue effort , only four corpses had been found in the wreckage during the day , Mendez said , and workers were still trying to get to the girl as the operation crossed into a new day .
The debris removed from the school changed as crews worked their way deeper , from huge chunks of brick and concrete to pieces of wood that looked like remnants of desks and paneling to a load that contained a half dozen sparkly hula-hoops .
WATCH : Workers dig through the night to search for victims of Mexico earthquake
Rescuers carried in lengths of wide steel pipe big enough for someone to crawl through , apparently trying to create a tunnel into the collapsed slabs of the three-story school building . But a heavy rain fell during the night , and the tottering pile of rubble had to be shored up with hundreds of wooden beams .
People have rallied to help their neighbors in a huge volunteer effort that includes people from all walks of life in Mexico City , where social classes seldom mix . Doctors , dentists and lawyers stood alongside construction workers and street sweepers , handing buckets of debris or chunks of concrete hand-to-hand down the line .
At a collapsed factory building closer to the city 's center , giant cranes lifted huge slabs of concrete from the towering pile of rubble , like peeling layers from an onion . Workers with hand tools would quickly move in to look for signs of survivors and begin attacking the next layer .

Government rescue worker Alejandro Herrera said three bodies had been found Wednesday afternoon at the factory .
“ There are sounds ( beneath the rubble ) , but we do n't know if they are coming from inside or if it is the sound of the rubble , ” Herrera said .
Not only humans were pulled out .
Mexico City police said rescue workers clearing wreckage from a collapsed medical laboratory in the Roma neighborhood found and removed 40 lab rabbits and 13 lab rats used by the firm that had occupied the building , now a pile of beams and rubble .

In addition to those killed in Mexico City , the federal civil defense agency said 69 died in Morelos state just south of the capital and 43 in Puebla state to the southeast , where the quake was centered .
The rest of the deaths were in Mexico State , which borders Mexico City on three sides , Guerrero and Oaxaca states .
In Atzala in Puebla state , villagers mourned 11 family members who died inside a church when it crumbled during a baptism for a 2-month-old girl . People at the wake said the only ones to survive were the baby 's father , the priest and the priest 's assistant .
Power was being restored in some Mexico City neighborhoods that already spent a day without power . The mayor said there were 38 collapsed buildings in the capital , down from the 44 he had announced previously .
California businessman touts New Mexico as prime place to invest Copyright by KRQE - All rights reserved Video
ALBUQUERQUE ( KRQE ) - One California investor says he sees a lot of potential for a now vacant metro property .
Not everyone could see the potential in these four buildings off Gibson near the Sunport , but one California investor did .
`` What it is , where it is , what type of property it is , '' explained Gregg Herbert .
Herbert says those qualities made the 22-acre property a good fit for his company , a business with nationwide reach aimed towards revitalizing real estate .
`` Part of our game plan is to reestablish the property , which we 've done , into the marketplace , '' said Herbert .
The buildings used to be administrative offices for Presbyterian . Now , they 're back on the market awaiting new tenants and , already , Herbert says they 're getting a lot of eyes .
`` Very pleased with the interest to date that we have in this property , '' Herbert said .
Herbert 's not surprised . He says he has wanted to invest in New Mexico for several years now .
`` A , because of the size of the real estate B , because of the size of the market , '' said Herbert .
Not only does Herbert see potential in the property , he also sees potential in New Mexico 's real estate market . He says it 's big enough for them to expand and in a state where the economy has been slow to recover since the recession , Herbert says things are only looking up .
`` The market continues to gradually improve as time goes on , '' Herbert said .
Plus , it did n't hurt that Herbert felt welcomed in New Mexico , especially after several meetings with some of Albuquerque 's government officials .
`` The people part of why we 're there is a big part of it there are properties that I look at in other parts of the country where the real estate on its own really fits us well but I did n't have the confidence as a new investor in the state , '' said Herbert .
It 's not like the confidence he says he has in New Mexico .
Herbert says another draw was the proximity to his offices in Los Angeles- it 's just a short flight away .
Herbert says he 's offering the building up for sale or lease . He says he 'll add amenities depending on demand . Some of those could include auto detailing , dry cleaning , Wifi , bike lockers and food truck stations .
Albuquerque economic experts say the property up for sale is a great opportunity and a great deal for businesses . They say they 've been pitching the property to businesses across the country .
James Faulkner , Shaun Marsh , Peter Siddle and Steve O'Keefe have all been jettisoned from Cricket Australia 's proposed list of centrally contracted players for the 2017-18 season , amid pay negotiations that show few signs of a swift resolution .
The Australian board named 33 male and female players on the list on Monday , and offered contracts for the first time to the left-arm spinner Ashton Agar , the tall fast bowler Billy Stanlake and the batting allrounder Hilton Cartwright , who made his Test debut at the SCG in January . The young batsmen Matthew Renshaw and Peter Handscomb , who impressed on the tour of India , have also been offered their first full contracts , having earned incremental deals over the 2016-17 season .
Cricket Australia 's contract offers for 2017-18 Male cricketers : Ashton Agar , Jackson Bird , Hilton Cartwright , Pat Cummins , Aaron Finch , Peter Handscomb , Josh Hazlewood , Travis Head , Usman Khawaja , Nathan Lyon , Mitchell Marsh , Glenn Maxwell , James Pattinson , Matthew Renshaw , Steven Smith , Billy Stanlake , Mitchell Starc , Matthew Wade , David Warner , Adam Zampa
Female cricketers : Kristen Beams , Alex Blackwell , Nicole Bolton , Lauren Cheatle , Rachael Haynes , Alyssa Healy , Jess Jonassen , Meg Lanning , Beth Mooney , Ellyse Perry , Megan Schutt , Elyse Villani , Amanda-Jade Wellington
Apart from Faulkner , O'Keefe , Siddle and Marsh , the wicketkeeper Peter Nevill and batsmen Joe Burns and George Bailey were also not on the list this season . Faulkner , incidentally , was left out of the team for the Champions Trophy , his first omission from an Australia squad for an ICC event since 2012 . All the above players are now cast as domestic cricketers who , according to CA 's pay offer to the players , do not contribute to the game 's financial returns . The chief executive of the Australian Cricketers Association , Alistair Nicholson , emphasised that much still needed to be done before the current MOU expires at the end of June .
`` It is important to remember that the in the absence of an MOU ( Memorandum of Understanding ) agreement beyond 30 June , all the terms and conditions that underpin any contract have not been finalised , '' he said . `` The ACA has expressed a commitment to working with CA to reach a new agreement before the end of June , but in reality we are still a long way apart on a number of issues .
`` The uncertainty created for a number of key stakeholders is not ideal as we know that alongside the players , it is their families , state associations , corporate partners and broadcasters all wanting to understand what lies ahead for the game .
`` The absence of a Revenue Sharing Model in CA 's proposal is the number one element that drives a wedge between the players and the administrators at this point in time . The Revenue Share Model has underpinned a very successful period in Australian cricket for the past 20 years , and we consider it vital that all playing groups are afforded the opportunity to be partners in the game going forward . ''
Trevor Hohns , chairman of Australia 's selection panel , said players had been picked on their potential to play for Australia in all three formats over the next 12 months , with assignments like the Ashes in the home summer and an away Test series in South Africa in March next year .
`` We have selected 20 players for this year 's contract list with a focus on players who we believe could play a part in an exciting 12 months of cricket , which includes the Ashes and an important away Test Series against South Africa , '' Hohns said . `` Consideration has also been given to some players who we believe could potentially play in all three formats for Australia . ''
Cartwright , the second-highest run-getter in the 2016-17 Sheffield Shield , Renshaw and Peter Handscomb all made their Test debuts over the home summer as Australia sought to revamp their side following a stunning defeat against South Africa in Hobart , where they were dismissed for totals of 85 and 161 .
Agar , who has not played a Test since his debut in the Ashes in 2013 , last played an international for Australia in March last year but was one of the four spinners the team picked for the India tour . He has effectively taken the place of O'Keefe , recently fined and suspended for offensive behaviour at the New South Wales end of season awards night following a strong performance on the India tour .
Stanlake , meanwhile , was given a debut in the limited-overs matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka and Hohns said the selectors wanted to monitor his progress , similar to what they had done with Pat Cummins , who has held a national contract continuously since 2011 despite a raft of injuries that have only recently shown signs of abating .
`` Hilton has thoroughly earned his spot in the list this year , '' Hohns said . `` He was the second-highest runs scorer in the Sheffield Shield last season and , when given his opportunity with the Test side last summer , he impressed . He is an exciting prospect for Australian cricket and we look forward to seeing him perform for Australia in the coming 12 months , if given his opportunity .
`` Ashton is a talented young player who we consider offers a fantastic package with his batting , bowling and fielding , and someone who is capable of playing all forms of the game .
`` Billy has picked up the last spot on the contract list for the coming season . We see him as a player of immense talent and a great option for Australia in the future . We want to be able to monitor his progress in the coming 12 months , not dissimilar to what we have done with Pat Cummins in the past . ''
Among the women 's cricketers , the 19-year-old legspinner Amanda-Jade Wellington was offered a contract for the first time , while Rachael Haynes was given a contract for the first time in four years . Wellington impressed over the summer , snaffling 17 wickets in eight limited-overs appearances , while Haynes recently made a comeback to the ODI side after three years .
During the health-care debate in 2010 , some politicians were fond of issuing dire warnings of government bureaucrats “ coming between you and your doctor. ” But when it comes to treating heroin addiction , it 's often the politicians themselves who are barring the door .
A study released today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that giving heroin to addicts who have been resistant to treatment , instead of the traditional methadone , may in the end be the most cost-effective way to mitigate the societal damage done by this form of addiction .
It 's the latest in a string of clinical investigations pointing to heroin-assisted therapy—or HAT—as the best way to attack a scourge that costs the U.S. about $ 22 billion each year .
“ What this study has shown is , for people who fail methadone , do n't put them on methadone again , ” said Dr. Aslam Anis , director of the Centre for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences at Providence Health Care in Vancouver and an author of the study . “ There 's a better option : put them on heroin . You 'll end up saving money and doing better . ”
Sounds great—the only problem is , in the current U.S. political environment , it will never happen .
HAT , also known as heroin maintenance , is based on the premise that while methadone treatment is effective by many standards , most methadone users end up back on heroin or other opiates eventually—either with or without methadone supplementing their habit .
Since the search for heroin is , in many ways , more harmful to society than the use of it , methadone may have important limitations as a means of mitigating the damage done by heroin addiction .
Monday 's study is the second to come out of the first North American clinical trial of medically prescribed heroin , known as the North American Opiate Medication Initiative ( NAOMI ) . For three years , NAOMI targeted long-term heroin users in Montreal and Vancouver ( a city with a history of heroin issues ) who had already sought treatment at least twice without success .
The first NAOMI study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 , confirmed the findings of several European studies that heroin maintenance is a safe and efficient way to deal with long-term heroin addiction .
In the new study , researchers found that heroin—despite being up to 10 times as expensive as methadone—is also more cost-effective , in part because users are more likely to stay in treatment on heroin than on methadone . How long users stay in treatment is key to mitigating societal damage , since it keeps them in contact with the medical system and lessens or even prevents other health and crime problems that stem from heroin dependency .
The NAOMI numbers are striking . A year after the start of the study , nearly 90 percent of those given heroin remained in treatment , while just over half in the methadone group did . And giving users injectable heroin reduced their rate of “ illicit-drug use or other illegal activity ” by 67 percent , while this number was under 50 percent for the methadone group .
But what the study shows perhaps even more starkly is how far behind the curve the United States is when it comes to addiction issues .
HAT is already old news in parts of Europe , where it is an established facet of addiction treatment . It has been implemented most notably in Switzerland and the Netherlands—both of which tend to take more open-minded approaches to addiction policy—and it exists in a limited capacity in the U.K. and Germany . ( Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001—a policy that appears to be a success so far . )
Each country applies HAT a bit differently , but the general outline is the same : long-term users are administered heroin in a clinical setting , with safeguards to prevent the drug from leaking onto the black market .
“ It 's not controversial in either [ Switzerland or the Netherlands ] , ” said Peter Reuter , a policy analyst at the University of Maryland 's School of Public Policy , “ and in Switzerland it 's been there for so long that people have forgotten that it was once controversial . ”
In the United States it 's a different story altogether .
Our tendency to defer to politicians who court votes , rather than scientists who study addiction , manifests in a variety of ways , from our penchant for locking up drug offenders to our unending supply of sensationalized reporting on the subject .
Recall former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani proposing in 1999 to shut down the city 's methadone clinics , or Sen. John McCain , leading up to his first run for president , calling methadone treatment “ disgusting and immoral ” and “ an Orwellian drug swap . ”
While other countries move forward on cheaper and more effective ways to treat drug addicts , we remain mired in arguments over needle exchanges and methadone clinics—issues that are more or less settled in the public-health community . ( And do n't forget the ever-powerful NIMBY factor . )
Compared with other wealthy democracies , “ what 's striking is not how punitive we are , but how unwilling we have been to take an evidence-based perspective on matters pertaining to both harm reduction and to law enforcement measures to deter drug use , ” said Harold Pollack , a professor of social-service administration at the University of Chicago , in an email . “ And that underlying mindset perpetuates our poor track record in HIV prevention , drug treatment , and other areas of drug policy . ”
In the hope of winning the economic argument , Anis and his colleagues have set up an online tool where anyone with basic demographic information about a city or state can estimate how much money implementing HAT would save .
“ When people are in treatment and they 're retained , they live normal lives and their criminal activity is reduced , justice systems spend less money keeping them incarcerated , ” Anis said . “ So when you take all those costs into account , even though the drug cost is higher , [ because of ] the savings that accrue from the other parts of the economy , on net it 's cheaper . ”
Still , even researchers sold on HAT 's promise will themselves admit that the idea of giving heroin addicts heroin is hard for many people to swallow .
“ You sort of have to get over some pretty large hurdles of face implausibility , ” Reuter said . “ There 's something strange about the notion that on the one hand you prohibit this drug , but … if the user causes enough damage to society and to himself , well , we 'll give it to you free . ”
We 've been fed some information by an established tipster today that paints an interesting picture of what sort of Android gear Sprint will -- and wo n't -- be getting next . First , we 're told that the EVO Shift 4G trademark HTC recently filed for is the device known as the Knight , a downsized EVO 4G with a four-row sliding keyboard and a larger battery . Interestingly , as far as our tipster knows , the front-facing camera is off the table -- but in light of all the buzz around video calling these days , we would n't be surprised if it had been added back.Perhaps more interesting , though , is some buzz around the display on the Nexus S . You might remember that we noticed it 's concave on the front during its brief reveal at the Web 2.0 summit yesterday , an extraordinarily unusual design element for a full-touch phone . Well , our tipster tells us Samsung 's been shopping this curved display technology to carriers for a while -- as early as CES at the beginning of this year behind closed doors -- claiming that its research showed such a design improved perceived usability over a perfectly flat display . Sprint bought the line and wanted to get a curved-display model on shelves in time for the holidays this year , but Sammy was apparently unable to deliver product in the volume it was asking for ... so that 's where the Nexus S might come into play ; seems the Google-branded model could be the first to ship with it . We 're unconvinced that it 'd be any better , but our judgment is fully reserved until we 've got a device in our hands -- which hopefully happens sooner rather than later . [ Image via xda-developers Commenters are pointing out that the Dell Venue Pro also has a curved display , but it 's a different situation -- that 's longitudinally convex glass over a flat display . Here , it 's laterally concave -- though we do n't know whether the underlying AMOLED component is curved or not .
Though U.S. policy in Afghanistan is murkier than it should be after more than 12 years of war , this year is expected to mark the formal end of the conflict . In 2014 , President Obama has repeatedly said , the nation will bring servicemen and women home – or at least most of them , depending on a possible agreement on a residual force that would remain on the ground .
As U.S. officials prepare for this transition , they 're also shaping expectations for a post-war Afghanistan . In a piece that did n't generate as much attention this week as it probably should have , David Cloud reports on the scope of the pessimism .
U.S. intelligence agencies warn in a new , classified assessment that insurgents could quickly regain control of key areas of Afghanistan and threaten the capital as soon as 2015 if American troops are fully withdrawn next year , according to two officials familiar with the findings . The National Intelligence Estimate , which was given recently to the White House , has deeply concerned some U.S. officials . It represents the first time the intelligence community has formally warned that the Afghan government could face significantly more serious attacks in Kabul from a resurgent Taliban within months of a U.S. pullout , the officials said , speaking anonymously to discuss classified material . The assessment also concludes that security conditions probably will worsen regardless of whether the U.S. keeps troops in the country .
One of the officials told Cloud , “ It 's very pessimistic about the future , more pessimistic than ever before . ”
I do n't imagine this comes as too big a surprise for those who 've followed developments in Afghanistan over the last several years . For that matter , it 's possible that the still-classified NIE is mistaken and overly pessimistic .
But looking at the larger context , consider what the collective judgment of domestic intelligence agencies is telling us : by the time U.S. troops withdraw , a 13-year old war , paid for by heartbreaking blood and treasure , will have produced gains so tenuous that the Taliban may reclaim much of the country within months – Kabul could fall within a year – and if U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan in significant numbers , it wo n't make a difference .
Going forward , when it comes to the domestic political debate , there are those who continue to argue that the status quo remain in place even longer and there are those who believe a U.S. military presence is no longer effective or responsible , making withdrawal necessary .
Dash interested but not yet serious about acquiring Mallory Pugh
The NWSL faces a critical moment when it comes to Mallory Pugh staying or going . At this point the Dash are not major players in keeping her in the United States .
Already with four goals in 20 appearances with the U.S. national team as a 19-year old , Pugh is the country 's brightest rising star . The forward recently left UCLA to pursue a professional career .
Sports Illustrated 's Grant Wahl reported Wednesday night the Dash are among the teams interested in acquiring Pugh . Dash coach Randy Waldrum said he and president Chris Canetti have had discussions about it but that none of the discussions have been serious .
`` We have an interest , but we have made no overtures one way or the other , '' Waldrum said .
Wahl also reported Wednesday night UEFA Women 's Champions League finalist Paris Saint-Germain has offered Pugh a contract but that Pugh would prefer to stay in the United States .
If Pugh did not care which NWSL team she played for , she already would have joined the Washington Spirit because the Spirit are No . 1 in the allocation order .

According to Wahl , Pugh does not want to play in Washington and would rather play for Portland Thorns FC . He added that Washington owner Bill Lynch does not want to trade Pugh 's rights to Portland because he still is bitter about Portland coach Mark Parsons leaving Washington in September 2015 .
Although the Dash are not in serious discussions with Washington right now , Waldrum said the door is not closed .
`` It could change , and it could change in the next 48 hours , '' Waldrum said . `` I know she supposedly is slated to be going to Europe to talk to the teams there .
`` I have heard so many conflicting stories about Washington . The ball is in their court . They are the ones who have to make the deal . If they do n't want to make the deal then where does that leave everybody else ? It really is going to depend on Washington handles it . ''
If Washington offered the Dash a trade it likely would ask for one or two major players such as Morgan Brian , Kealia Ohai , Janine Beckie or Rachel Daly in return . Waldrum said he is not ready to do that because he is confident in the group he has now .
He and others believe the Dash finally are in a great spot to contend for the playoffs . After some on- and off-field struggles in the first three seasons , it may be too big a risk to shake things up yet again .
`` We would n't break up what we 've been building the last couple of years , '' Waldrum said . `` It just would n't make sense . All that will be contingent on what the ask would be if we ever got to that point . We have n't been approached about that . We have n't put any kind of offer on it . It is all just conversations right now . ''
In a bewildering turn of events that has rocked the world of cable news , George Zimmerman agreed to an interview with Reverend Al Sharpton on MSNBC . The following transcript of the no-holds-barred interview which airs tonight on Sharpton 's show , PoliticsNation , was leaked by an anonymous source inside MSNBC .
AL SHARPTON : George Zimmerman , you are my exclusive interview that I will conduct tonight . Under normal circumcisions I would expose a gracious welcome on my show to your presence , but I can not do that because I 'm an African American .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : OK
AL SHARPTON : Since you coldly murdered one of my own in blood , I must resist to adhere to social edifice . In sincerity I will not apologize .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : OK
AL SHARPTON : Millions of people expect me to ask the tough questions . To get to the heart in the batter so the almighty truth can be set free .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : OK
AL SHARPTON : Since I am an African American with my own news show I 'm under more mutiny than a white news man , but that 's the way it is in America for people of color .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : OK
AL SHARPTON : You would n't know about that because your ancestors were n't tackled and shamed by white folks , some who you may have had relations with .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : ( stares blankly )
AL SHARPTON : George Zimmerman , did you or did you not profile an African American ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : No sir .
AL SHARPTON : Did you or did you not hunt down an innocent child just because he was an African American man of color ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : No I did not .
AL SHARPTON : Did you or did you not have malignant hindsight when you profiled your victim ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : I do n't think so .
AL SHARPTON : You told Sean Hannity that God told you to shoot an African American child .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : No , that 's not what I said , sir .
AL SHARPTON : It was on TV ! I watched it with my eyes !
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : I said what happened that night was God 's will .
AL SHARPTON : Are you saying God profiles African American children who eat candy ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : No I …
AL SHARPTON : Because that 's what it sounded like to me . If I thought God calzoned racial profiling I would n't have my own show on MSNBC .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : Why is that ?
AL SHARPTON : No defense , but I pardon you to let me ask the questions .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : Sure .
AL SHARPTON : Were you working under orders from God the night you miscarried an African American child ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : No , sir .
AL SHARPTON : Are you changing your story and saying you acted on your own ? That God was n't there ? Which one is it ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : When I was asked to explain what happened that night I said it happened so fast and was so confusing that it must have been God 's plan … .
AL SHARPTON : Are you aware of what I am in additional to being an African American with my own show on MSNBC ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : One of those civil rights people ?
AL SHARPTON : Well , on top of that .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : A troublemaker ?
AL SHARPTON : ( laughing ) Oh , I 'm a troublemaker all right ! But I 'm also something else .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : A race hustler ?
AL SHARPTON : I 'm a man of the cloth . Have been since I was four years old . So do n't be talkin ' to me about God , because I will march !
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : OK
AL SHARPTON : I 've been preachin ' God 's holy matrimony since I was a baby . I 've even prayed at funerals . Have you ever healed the sick ? Made the blind to see ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : No , sir . Have you ?
AL SHARPTON : I 've come close !
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : OK
AL SHARPTON : You 're a self- appointed white Hispanic . You got yourself a white daddy and a Hispanic mama .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : My mom is from Peru .
AL SHARPTON : A woman from Beirut is good enough for your daddy but an African American woman is n't ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : I do n't …
AL SHARPTON : As we say in the bullpit , the apple does n't fall from the tree .
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : Sir ?
AL SHARPTON : Did you hunt down and shoot an African American child because your daddy is a racist ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : My dad is n't … .
AL SHARPTON : I 'm an African American . If you had a gun right now … would you shoot me ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : Of course not .
AL SHARPTON : What if I busted your nose and slammed you onto the floor ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : I uh …
AL SHARPTON : What if I sat on top of you and pounded your fat head into the floor over and over and over ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : Sir , I do n't … .
AL SHARPTON : You gon na tell me I can bash your skull against the floor and you ai n't gonnna do nothin ' about it ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : Sir , I uh… .
AL SHARPTON : What kind of man let 's another man bust his head open ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : What would you do , sir ?
AL SHARPTON : If you are on top of me slamming my head against the floor ?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN : Yes , sir .
AL SHARPTON : I 'd bust a cap in your white , Hispanic cracker ass !

It is no secret that the MPAA and RIAA spend millions in Washington to guarantee that their anti-piracy interests are secured . However , it turns out that not all the lobbying dollars go to secure the well-being of workers in the entertainment industry . The MPAA has also spent significant funds on the implementation of a Wall Street reform law , one that was proposed by the new MPAA CEO Chris Dodd when he was senator .
With several new anti-piracy bills in the works , the MPAA and RIAA have ramped up their lobbying efforts in Washington . With more than a $ 5 million spend in the first half of 2011 , this year might even break all previous records .
As is tradition , the RIAA is the biggest spender of the two entertainment industry lobbying groups . In the first two quarters of this year the music industry representatives spent over $ 3.8 million in Washington .
The topics covered by the RIAA are as expected . They lobbied at the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives in favor of ACTA , the PROTECT IP Act , and to support new legislation that will make streaming of copyrighted material a felony .
And then there 's the MPAA .
Thus far , the MPAA 's lobbying efforts have cost over $ 1.2 million dollars this year . Nothing out of the ordinary there , but some of the topics they are lobbying for in Washington are quite interesting to say the least . Aside from focusing on the traditional copyright-related matters , the movie industry group is also concerned with reforming Wall Street .
By hiring Michael Torrey Associates , the MPAA has spent tens of thousands of dollars to advance the implementation of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act . Unusual , since the topic does n't relate to the interests of the thousands of movie industry workers whose jobs are at stake .
No , these lobbying efforts are only meant for MPAA 's Chairman and CEO Chris Dodd .
The Wall Street Reform Act the MPAA is heavily invested in is also known as the Dodd-Frank Act , as the current MPAA Chairman proposed the act late 2009 when he was still a senator .
Lobby report
Looking at the history of MPAA 's lobbying efforts we see that Wall Street Reform was already a topic the movie studios where interested in while Dodd was still acting as senator . Dodd was officially announced as MPAA Chairman March 2011 , but the MPAA 's lobbying efforts already started in the last quarter of 2010 .
The timeline above suggests that the MPAA was putting money into supporting Dodd 's legislation in the hope of convincing him to join them as Chairman . And it worked , as he signed on for the job by the end of February .
And it looks like the MPAA and Dodd made a long tern deal to support his old work . Even today the MPAA continues to put money in supporting Dodd 's Wall Street Reform plans ( $ 180,000 and counting ) , all at the expense of those poor lighting technicians and makeup artists who work in the movie business .
Update : It appears that we jumped to conclusions .
The MPAA informed TorrentFreak that the lobbying efforts with regard to The Wall Street Reform Act are limited to combating a proposal to let financial traders speculate on motion picture box office revenues .
“ Contrary to TorrentFreak 's accusation that this matter “ does n't relate to the interests of the thousands of movie industry workers whose jobs are at stake , ” derivatives based on box office futures are “ no more than over-under bets on a movie 's performance and would have a detrimental impact on movies industry workers and businesses , ” as we said at the time , working together with a broad coalition that included entertainment industry unions , independent filmmakers and distributors and theater owners . ”
“ Both the House and Senate , through their respective Agriculture Committees , wisely decided to examine this issue closely . Recognizing the serious problems that could be caused by these proposals , Congress approved a ban on trading box-office derivatives , sponsored by Senator Blanche Lincoln , as part of the much larger financial reform bill . ”
“ Because the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) is still in the process of implementing these provisions of the financial reform bill , the MPAA is continuing to monitor the situation . We are NOT , nor have we ever been , engaged in lobbying any other issues concerning the financial reform bill . ”
Innovative Space Propulsion Systems ( ISPS ) , a Houston-based consortium developing rocket engines that run on a proprietary , environmentally benign propellant , announced May 15 that it had recently passed a NASA safety review for flying a demonstration payload to the international space station ( ISS ) next year .
ISPS has arranged for Space Exploration Technologies Corp. ( SpaceX ) to fly a thruster test bed , dubbed the ISPS NOFBX Green Propellant Demonstration , to the space station in mid-2013 in the unpressurized cargo compartment of SpaceX 's Dragon spacecraft during one of its NASA-funded cargo missions . Once Dragon is berthed to the station , the orbital outpost 's robotic arm will extract the NOFBX test bed and place it on the outside of the European Columbus module . The test bed , which features a deep-throttling 100-pound-thrust-class engine that burns a nitrous-oxide-based monopropellant called NOFBX , will remain on orbit for one year and undergo a series of in-space performance validation tests , ISPS said in the press release .
ISPS passed NASA 's ISS Payload Safety Review Panel phase 1 review in April .
“ Satisfying the safety panel is an incredibly high bar for any new technology , ” ISPS President Greg Mungas said in a statement . “ Safety is obviously paramount for the space station and this review panel has been thorough and uncompromising in their scrutiny of every technical aspect of our demonstration . ”

— A fire early Monday damaged a downtown Durham building that houses a pizza restaurant and several apartments .
Investigators are trying to determine what sparked the blaze about 1:20 a.m. at the building on East Chapel Hill Street . Chris Iannuzzi , deputy chief with the Durham Fire Department , said firefighters arrived to find smoke and fire on the roof . They thought the blaze was under control , but they continued to see smoke .
Iannuzzi said firefighters then found fire burning in a void space above one of the apartments . The ceiling collapsed into the apartment 's living room .
Two other apartments sustained smoke damage , and Pizzeria Toro had water damage . Other business in the building – including Bullseye Bicycle and The Cupcake Bar – are closed as investigators and inspectors complete their work .
`` It 's been really great , but unfortunate things happen , '' said Rob Clites of Bullseye Bicycle . `` Hopefully , we 'll just roll with the punches . ''
The same building caught fire in April , when flames erupted in the duct work of Pizzeria Toro .
The fire displaced five residents , but no one was hurt .

In 2004 an underdog team of four undocumented Mexican-American teenagers managed to win a major student underwater robotics competition , beating the likes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The team—Lorenzo Santillian , Christian Arcega , Oscar Vazquez and Luis Arranda—from Arizona 's Carl Hayden Community High School had little funding and no experience in similar contests , but they won the Marine Advanced Technology Education Robotics Competition , sponsored in part by NASA and the Office of Naval Research . Their scrappy and self-admittedly “ ugly ” robot Stinky impressed the judges by locating underwater objects , collecting samples and measuring distances in the water better than its competitors .
When Wired editor Joshua Davis wrote about their story for the magazine back in 2005 , he expected a feel-good piece about an upstart team beating the odds , but what he found was more complicated . The students all struggled to continue their education past high school because they were not legal U.S. citizens . Although Arizona was the only home most of them knew , they did n't have many of the rights their fellow students took for granted , including access to in-state tuition rates for college .
Davis stayed in touch with the students over the years and his new book , Spare Parts : Four Undocumented Teenagers , One Ugly Robot and the Battle for the American Dream ( Farrar , Straus and Giroux Originals , December 2014 ) , tells their story to date . A film about the team , also called Spare Parts , is due out in January 2015 . Many of the students are still held back by their undocumented status . They could benefit from proposed laws such as the Development , Relief and Education for Alien Minors ( DREAM ) Act , which would give young people who came to the U.S. as children a path toward permanent residency , but that bill has not yet passed .
Scientific American spoke to Davis and Hayden High robotics team member Oscar Vazquez separately . An edited and condensed transcript of the two conversations follows .
Josh , when did you realize this story was not just about a high school robotics team , but larger immigration issues ?
Davis : In my reporting I started to find out there was a subtext . It was n't just that these kids were impoverished . It was that they had many fewer opportunities because they were undocumented . This was clearly a major factor in the lives of these students . I said , “ Can I talk about this ? ” All of them had to make a decision , and they all felt like this was important . One of them , Oscar , said this is a Rosa Parks moment , when you just have to do something .
What impact did the original Wired article have on their lives ?
Davis : Back when the story was published all these kids wanted to go to college but had no hope of doing so . Even though they had lived in Arizona most of their lives they did not qualify for in-state tuition and as a result could n't afford any of the state schools . When we left them Oscar was putting up drywall ; Louis was a file clerk . When Wired readers read the story they e-mailed me , and called the magazine , saying , “ Where can we send money , how can we help ? ” We ended up getting over $ 100,000 of donations to send these kids to college . Oscar ended up graduating from A.S.U . [ Arizona State University ] with a degree in mechanical engineering . Louis and Lorenzo went to cooking school and now run a catering company .
But after graduating from college Oscar had a tough time trying to become a legal citizen .
Davis : Now that he had gotten a degree , he decided he needed to do the right thing . After age 18 and a half , if you are found to be living in the country illegally , you are not only deported but then banned from reentering the country for 10 years . Oscar crossed over the border , went to Juarez and said he 'd like to apply for citizenship . He said , “ I 'm a graduate of A.S.U. , I have a degree in mechanical engineering , I 'm a robotics expert . The clerk who interviewed him asked if he had ever stayed in the U.S. illegally after the age of 18 and he said , “ Yes , I did , this was why. ” He was summarily denied entry to the U.S. for 10 years .
That went on for a year , he found a job at a car parts manufacturing factory in Mexico and eventually [ Illinois ] Sen. Dick Durbin was able to intervene and have the ban overturned , and Oscar returned to the U.S. To him that meant he was finally able to fulfill his original dream , and enlisted in the U.S. Army .
Oscar , what are you up to now ?
Vazquez : I got out of the U.S. Army in August . Now I work in Montana for BNSF [ Burlington Northern Santa Fe ] Railway . I am a foreman in a locomotive diesel shop . It 's kind of like I run a Jiffy Lube for locomotives .
How did you end up in Montana ?
Vazquez : That 's where they offered me a job and I took it . The whole family 's here with me . My wife Karla and I have two kids . Samantha is six and Oskar is two .
Josh , how are the other robotics team members doing ?
Davis : Christian is unemployed , he 's looking for work . He does n't have a college degree [ the scholarship money was still insufficient to cover the cost ] , and so it 's a little hard for employers to perceive him intelligently even though to people who know him it 's apparent . Luis has a night job—he cleans U.S. courthouses . Lorenzo is a chef at a nice restaurant in Phoenix . The two of them have a catering company .
Oscar , how does it feel to finally be a U.S. citizen ?
Vazquez : When I went to get my Montana license , it did feel good . I definitely appreciate it and I do n't take it for granted . I grew up with a bunch of boundaries that I could n't cross . There were a lot of things I could n't do because of that , so now when I can it 's just a great relief . It 's hard to describe . Just growing up and knowing you ca n't do something really changes your mentality .
Are you involved in immigration activism ?
Vazquez : I try , but it 's been a tough for me to participate . I 'm still hoping that the laws can change . The solution for the “ DREAMers ” [ young people who would qualify for the DREAM Act , if it were passed ] is not permanent and they do n't know if they 'll be able to change that or what . It 's kind of a Band-Aid right now . I hope that more of them can get the opportunities that I did , especially those that want to serve in the military . I would definitely like to see some change , there 's still more to do .
What do you hope readers take away from the book , and from the movie they 're making ?
Vazquez : Hopefully , it opens their eyes to the talent that 's out there ; that , just based on prejudices , [ immigrants ] are not being allowed to grow and become what they should be . I would hope we could give them opportunities so they can use their full potential .
Josh , what do you hope people take away from this story ?
Davis : I want to put a face on the debate . I want people to be able to meet these young people and understand why they are here and what they want , because in lieu of that , I think some Americans rely on stereotypes . They hear reports about crime and that is their first instinct when they think about immigrants . And I do n't think that that 's accurate .
On a more specific level , a lot of these kids have great , amazing talents , specifically in science and technology , and at a time when America needs that talent more than ever , when STEM is a huge issue for the country going forward , we should be doing everything we can to encourage that kind of talent .
We 're a country of immigrants . We all know that . These immigrants oftentimes are the people who work the hardest and contribute the most because they are trying to achieve the American dream—and for them , the American dream is the freshest . I saw that time and again in my reporting . These kids who are first-generation or even were born in another country but have chosen America to be their adopted country are extraordinarily hardworking and absolutely committed to doing great things . I would like to live in a country that welcomes that spirit .
Heroin dependence treatment reduces HIV infections in Spain
Spain 's provision of methadone maintenance treatment for heroin dependence , combined with the distribution of sterile injecting equipment and access to treatment for AIDS , has led to a turnaround in the country 's HIV epidemic , according to a study published this month in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization .
Spain 's experience in this area is relevant to other countries where illicit drug injection is a common problem , such as those in eastern Europe and central , southern and eastern Asia
During the 1980s , Spain had some of the world 's toughest regulations on the treatment of heroin dependence and , at the same time , it had Europe 's highest rate of new HIV infections among people who inject illicit drugs . In the early 1990s , HIV prevalence in this group reached 60 % .
Back then , virtually the only treatment available for heroin dependence in Spain was based on abstinence , but most patients relapsed and continued to inject drugs . That changed after two laws were passed in 1990 and 1996 , making methadone and similar medicines widely available on prescription in public health-care centres in every region of the country free of charge to patients diagnosed with heroin dependence .
The study found that , as a result of these laws and the way Spain 's national programme was re-designed , by 2010 , 60 % of the people in the country who were injecting illicit drugs were on methadone maintenance treatment , up from 21 % in 1996 , and , thanks to these changes in the law and other HIV prevention initiatives , the number of new HIV infections among drug users had dwindled from an annual average of 6200 in the early 1990s to 690 new infections in 2010 .
“ Spain achieved this success by lifting unnecessary restrictions on which heroin-dependent people can receive methadone , by not limiting the dose or the duration of treatment and by allowing suitable patients to take some doses at home , ” said lead author and researcher Marta Torrens , head of the Addiction Programme at the Institute of Neuropsychiatry and Addiction of Mar Health Park and coordinator of Substance Use Disorders Research Group at IMIM ( Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute ) in Barcelona .
“ Some drug treatment programmes discharge people from treatment at the first sign of difficult behaviour , but the Spanish methadone programme makes every effort to keep patients on treatment for as long as possible , ” she said .
“ Each day , patients receive a daily dose of medicine , usually methadone , and at the same time any other health care they might need , such as antiretrovirals for HIV infection , ” said Torrens , adding that with this approach , which is consistent with WHO guidelines on the treatment of opiate dependence , they are able to maintain more than 72 % of patients in treatment after the first year .
Methadone , which is usually ingested in syrup form , produces stable levels of opioids in the patients ' blood over the 24 hours between each dose . This results in patients experiencing neither intoxication nor withdrawal . Over time and with adequate doses , methadone blocks the effect of heroin and , as a result , patients eventually stop using it . Less heroin use means less use of dirty needles , fewer HIV , hepatitis and other infections , fewer overdoses and less crime . Methadone treatment helps patients re-build shattered relations with their families and reintegrate into society .
“ Public perception of this treatment is positive in Spain , with 66 % of the general public in favour of methadone treatment , ” Torrens said , adding : “ Governments are currently under immense financial pressure because of the economic crisis , but our message to them is : heed this sound evidence and maintain funding for these programmes . ”
Methadone is not expensive , according to the WHO Opioid Substitution Therapy and Morphine database , which shows that treatment can cost as little as US $ 28 a year per patient . http : //www.who.int/entity/hiv/amds/ControlledMedicineDatabase.xls
“ HIV prevalence was as high as 60 % in people injecting drugs in Spain 20 years ago . Since there is great potential for transmission of HIV from the drug injecting population to the general population , control of HIV in the drug injecting population is essential to controlling HIV in the general population , ” said Dr Nico Clark , from the WHO Management of Substance Abuse unit . “ By providing this kind of treatment , health authorities not only prevent drug-related deaths and help patients reintegrate into society , but they also prevent HIV from spreading throughout the general community . ”
The study is one of a series of articles in this month 's issue of the Bulletin of the World Health Organization devoted to the theme of opioid substitution therapy .

METROPOLIS—In a transformation that has baffled nuclear physicists and gynecologists alike , an area woman recently gained superhuman powers through an accidental radioactive yeast infection .
Though her real identity remains a mystery , to the millions of honest , law-abiding citizens of Metropolis who live in constant fear of crime , she goes by one name : Yeastwoman .
Advertisement
`` Evil-doers beware ! '' the statuesque superhero announced via satellite from her secret underground Fortress of Yeast-itude . `` My powerful yeast ray causes burning , itching and cheesy discharges from the genital area , and I will not hesitate to use it on those who do wrong . ''
Police first became aware of Yeastwoman last week when an officer on patrol stumbled across one of Metropolis ' most notorious arch-villains , the evil Professor Prostate , bound and gagged in the wharf district . Upon closer inspection , a single-use applicator of Monistat-7 was discovered near his side .
`` We saw this as the 'calling card ' of a new , powerful ally in our war on crime , '' Metropolis Chief of Police William Brautigan said . `` Her bacterial brand of justice will spread quickly throughout the city . ''

Each day , more and more criminals are finding out about the formidable new crimefighter first-hand .
`` I had just ripped a purse off some old lady 's shoulder and was running down an alley when Yeastwoman caught up to me , '' said Jay DiFrenzi , a repeat offender now in police custody . `` There was this burst of light , and suddenly it felt like my crotch was on fire . The burning sensation was too intense to fight . ''
At yesterday 's press conference , Yeastwoman discussed the origin of her powers .
`` One year ago , I agreed to participate in a top-secret government testing program for a new tampon containing the experimental absorbing agent Plutonium-235 , '' she said . `` But during one of the experiments , something went horribly wrong . There was an explosion , and before long , my discharge was 200 times more powerful than that of an average woman . ''

`` I went to my gynecologist , Dr. Meyer , to have it checked out , '' she continued . `` But when one vaginal twitch sent him crashing through the wall , I knew I had been transformed . ''
Ironically , the same gynecologist who attempted to cure Yeastwoman of her infection is now her worst enemy . After flying through the wall , Dr. Meyer smashed into a cart of toxic pap smear samples that were being disposed of . Horrifically disfigured by the accident , James Meyer is now Dr. Gynosaur , a stunted sociopath whose bodily functions are serviced by a gigantic metal speculum exoskeleton .
Dr. Gynosaur vowed to make destroying Yeastwoman his life 's goal .
`` Yeastwoman ! I and my hordes of subhuman Smegmalons will ruin you , just as you ruined my once-beautiful face ! '' said Gynosaur at his own press conference . `` Re-venge will be mine when you attempt to stop my assault on the Women 's Health Center ! Take a long look in the mirror , dear ! One last look before I deform you with my speculum pincers ! ''

`` Such evil can not be faced alone , '' Yeastwoman said yesterday , responding to Gynosaur 's statement . `` That is why I have chosen a partner in my war against crime , Urinary Tract Infection Girl . ''
City officials have given Yeastwoman and Urinary Tract Infection Girl full rein in their crimefighting efforts .
Support has also come from local businesses like Bob Blastwick Ford , who donated a brand new '97 Taurus to serve as the Yeastmobile .
For years , the Virgili brothers — the identical twins Alex and Albert , 27 , and their older brother , Jordi , 32 — hectored their father to modernize the family winery , Casa Berger . It had long churned out mass-produced , undistinguished wines , to be shipped over the border and folded into table wines bearing a label that fetched money , “ Product of France . ”
The brothers had visions of bottling their own wines . But their father rejected their entreaties as foolhardy . He and his own father had done it the same way for a half-century . The business had sustained them .
Yet even before the crisis , Casa Berger 's sales were slipping . The crisis threatened it with bankruptcy . For the brothers , here was an opportunity .
They conceived of an idea that seemed at once ridiculous and sublime . They would bottle white wine made from the xarel-lo grape , a local varietal of no particular distinction . They would label their bottles with a crude Catalan pun , calling it El Xitxarel-lo , which roughly translates to “ young , stupid guy. ” They covered their bottle with six dozen other Catalan insults .
“ When we told our father and our uncle that we wanted to launch a bottle with 77 different Catalan insults , they said ‘ O.K. , but please do n't put our brand on the bottle , ' ” Albert recalled .
Today , El Xitxarel-lo , marketed through a homespun and irreverent social media campaign , amounts to the blockbuster that has saved the family business . Starting with 3,000 bottles in the fall of 2013 , it now sells 85,000 bottles a year .
Air Force Alters Texas UFO Explanation
toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images
The Air Force is changing its story on what happened on a recent night in Stephenville , Texas , when dozens of witnesses say they spotted a UFO .
Two weeks ago , witnesses reported seeing a large aircraft with white lights hovering for about five minutes before being chased away by jet fighters .
The Air Force Reserve in nearby Fort Worth initially scoffed at reports and denied the possibility that it had fighters in the area . Air Force officials reversed course Wednesday , however , and admitted there were nearly a dozen F-16s over Stephenville that night .
Does this new revelation bolster or cast doubt on the witnesses ' stories ?
The night of the supposed UFO sighting , just after 6 p.m. , Claudette Odom , her husband and two other friends , were clearing brush near her house . They were standing on top of a hill with visibility that extended more than 20 miles in every direction . From out of the west , Odom saw an object approach in the darkness .
`` I 've never seen anything that fast . Maybe a rock or a missile or something , '' she says .
Odom says they watched in wonder as the aircraft approached Stephenville and then silently hovered outside the outskirts of town . The lights flickered then went solid , shaping into a massive arch , she says , before forming a single bright vertical line that split into two .
`` They were extremely , extremely bright . Like an arc on a welder , they were that sharp , '' Odom says .
As they watched the object hover in place , they were startled by the explosive sound of two F-16s , screaming directly over their hill at low altitude , heading toward the UFO , she recalls .
The Matter of the Jets
Whether there were military jets in the area that night was the first substantive doubt that was cast on the UFO witnesses ' credibility .
When contacted , the Air Force at Carswell Field near Fort Worth stated that they definitely did n't have any fighter jets over Stephenville that night . The officials suggested the UFO witnesses might have seen an optical illusion .
When Odom heard the Air Force 's response , she says she knew that something was amiss .
`` I do n't know what they 're trying to cover up . We saw what we saw . I knew they were fighter jets , '' she says .
Now , two weeks later , in a plot line that 's out of the X-Files , Air Force officials are saying that there was a communications error . They concede that they had F-16s flying over Stephenville , Texas , on the evening of Jan. 8 .
Major Karl Lewis attributes the change in response to an internal communications mistake .
`` There was an error that was reported and we corrected that error as soon as possible , '' he says .
Could Jets Have Been Mistaken for a UFO ?
Angelia Joiner , the reporter at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune who broke the story , says that none of the UFO witnesses believe they mistook the F-16s for the massive object that put on a dazzling lights show . The Air Force 's belated admission that it did indeed have F-16s there — the exact fighter jet that was described by several of the UFO witnesses as giving chase to the UFO — only bolsters the witnesses ' story , she says .
`` It just makes it seem like something 's going on . The military coming out with this at this point is just going to fuel the fire , '' Joiner says .
Still unanswered is whether any F-16 pilots saw bright lights and a massive , incredibly fast aircraft . Major Lewis says that as far he knows , nothing unusual was reported . But he also says that he would n't want to speculate about what the pilots might have seen that night and that , as far as he knows , the pilots have not been interviewed .
A recent visit to Turkey reminded me of its enormous economic successes during the last decade . The economy has grown rapidly , inequality is declining , and innovation is on the rise .
Turkey 's achievements are all the more remarkable when one considers its neighbourhood . Its neighbours to the west , Cyprus and Greece , are at the epicentre of the eurozone crisis . To the south-east is war-torn Syria , which has already disgorged almost 400,000 refugees into Turkey . To the east lie Iraq and Iran . And to the north-east lie Armenia and Georgia . If there is a more complicated neighbourhood in the world , it would be difficult to find it .
Yet Turkey has made remarkable strides in the midst of regional upheavals . After a sharp downturn in 1999-2001 , the economy grew by 5 % a year on average from 2002 to 2012 . It has remained at peace , despite regional wars . Its banks avoided the boom-bust cycle of the past decade , having learned from the banking collapse in 2000-2001 . Inequality has been falling . And the government has won three consecutive general elections , each time with a greater share of the popular vote .
There is nothing flashy about Turkey 's rise , which has been based on fundamentals , rather than bubbles or resource discoveries . Indeed , Turkey lacks its neighbours ' oil and gas resources , but it compensates for this with the competitiveness of its industry and services . Tourism alone attracted more than 36 million visitors in 2012 , making Turkey one of the world 's top destinations .
Even a short stay in Ankara allows one to see these underlying strengths . The airport , highways , and other infrastructure are first class , and a high-speed intercity rail network links Ankara with other parts of the country . Much of the advanced engineering is homegrown . Turkish construction firms are internationally competitive and increasingly win bids throughout the Middle East and Africa .
Turkey 's universities are rising as well . Ankara has become a hub of higher education , attracting students from Africa and Asia . Many top programmes are in English , ensuring that Turkey will attract an increasing number of international students . And the country 's universities are increasingly spinning off high-tech companies in avionics , information technology , and advanced electronics , among other areas .
To its credit , Turkey has begun to invest heavily in sustainable technologies . The country is rich in wind , geothermal , and other renewable energy , and will most likely become a global exporter of advanced green innovations .
Waste-treatment facilities are not typically tourist attractions , but Ankara 's novel integrated urban waste-management system has rightly attracted global attention . Until a few years ago , the waste was dumped into a fetid , stinking , noxious landfill . Now , with cutting-edge technology , the landfill has been turned into a green zone .
The private waste-management company ITC receives thousands of tonnes of solid municipal waste each day . The waste is separated into recyclable materials ( plastics , metals ) and organic waste . The organic waste is processed in a fermentation plant , producing compost and methane , which is used to produce electricity in a 25MW power plant . The electricity is returned to the city 's power grid , while the heat exhaust is piped to the facility 's greenhouses , which produce tomatoes , strawberries , and orchids .
Turkey 's diversified , innovative base of industry , construction , and services serves it well in a world in which market opportunities are shifting from the United States and western Europe to Africa , eastern Europe , the Middle East , and Asia . Turkey has been deft in seizing these new opportunities , with exports increasingly headed south and east to the emerging economies , rather than west to high-income markets . This trend will continue , as Africa and Asia become robust markets for Turkey 's construction firms , information technology , and green innovations .
So , how did Turkey do it ? Most important , the prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , and his economics team , led by the deputy prime minister , Ali Babacan , have stuck to basics and looked to the long term . Erdoğan came to power in 2003 , after years of short-term instability and banking crises . The International Monetary Fund had been called in for an emergency rescue . Step by step , the Erdoğan-Babacan strategy was to rebuild the banking sector , get the budget under control , and invest heavily and consistently where it counts : infrastructure , education , health , and technology .
Smart diplomacy has also helped . Turkey has remained a staunchly moderate voice in a region of extremes . It has kept an open door and balanced diplomacy ( to the extent possible ) with the major powers in its neighbourhood . This has helped Turkey not only to maintain its own internal balance , but also to win markets and keep friends without the heavy baggage and risks of divisive geopolitics .
No doubt , Turkey 's ability to continue on a rapid growth trajectory remains uncertain . Any combination of crises – the eurozone , Syria , Iraq , Iran , or world oil prices – could create instability . Another global financial crisis could disrupt short-term capital inflows . A dangerous neighbourhood means inescapable risks , though Turkey has demonstrated a remarkable capacity during the last decade to surmount them .
Moreover , the challenge of raising educational quality and attainment , especially of girls and women , remains a priority . Fortunately , the government has clearly acknowledged the education challenge and is pursuing it through school reforms , increased investments , and the introduction of new information technologies in the classroom .
Turkey 's successes have deep roots in governmental capacity and its people 's skills , reflecting decades of investment and centuries of history dating back to Ottoman times . Other countries can not simply copy these achievements , but they can still learn the main lesson that is too often forgotten in a world of `` stimulus '' , bubbles , and short-term thinking . Long-term growth stems from prudent monetary and fiscal policies , the political will to regulate banks , and a combination of bold public and private investments in infrastructure , skills , and cutting-edge technologies .

Fans of National Geographic are very angry that Rupert Murdoch and 21st Century Fox are set to purchase the magazine . They are making that anger known by vowing to boycott the the magazine , and the cable channels associated with it , if the deal goes through .
Across Twitter calls to boycott rang out .
“ Cancel your subscriptions people ! ” said one Twitter user . “ Boycott National Geographic . Shame on them for selling out . ”
“ I give National Geographic 18 months before publishing its first piece of climate change denial , ” said Greg Stolze .
“ National Geographic readers care about the planet , ” said another Twitter user . “ People who care about the planet , boycott # Murdoch . ”
But the allure of Murdoch 's cash has proven too attractive for National Geographic to pass . On Wednesday , the National Geographic Society announced their deal with Murdoch .
“ The value generated by this transaction , including the consistent and attractive revenue streams that National Geographic Partners will deliver , ensures that we will have greater resources for this work , which includes our grant programs that support scientists and explorers around the world , ” Gary Knell , the Society 's president , said . “ We now will have the scale and reach to continue to fulfill our mission long into the future . ”
Murdoch is a well-known climate change denier though and it 's unlikely that , with Murdoch having 73 percent of the company 's control , the ideals of conservation and environmentalism will last long .

The futuristic Tesla Model S is about to get much cooler and a whole lot safer . As promised , Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Thursday delivered a number of important announcements regarding the highly revered Model S .
First and foremost , an upcoming software update to the Model S will include a “ range assurance ” application that will alert users when they drive out of charging range . By keeping tabs on how much juice is left in the car and always monitoring how far or close the nearest charging stations are , the car 's software promises to relieve range anxiety altogether . As Musk boldly stated , the new software update will make it “ basically impossible ” for a user to run out of charge before finding a station . Impressively , the software will be “ smart ” enough to assess if nearby charging stations are full or temporarily out of service .

Additionally , the new Model S software will also plan trips for users such that they 'll automatically be routed through Tesla 's vast network of Superchargers .
And speaking of chargers , Musk reiterated Tesla 's plan to blanket all of North America and Europe with Supercharger stations by the end of the year .
Notably , the impending software update has a few more tricks up its sleeve . Some other new features include :
Automatic Emergency Braking This new Collision Avoidance Assist feature automatically engages the brakes to reduce the impact of an unavoidable frontal collision . Automatic Emergency Braking will stop applying the brakes when the driver presses the accelerator pedal , the brake pedal , or sharply turns the steering wheel . Blind Spot Warning Blind Spot Warning assists the driver to change lanes safely . When Model S is travelling between 20 mph ( 30 km/h ) and 85 mph ( 140 km/h ) and detects a vehicle in the driver 's blind spot , a white arc will appear on the instrument panel near the bottom of the speedometer . If a collision with the vehicle becomes likely , two red arcs will appear , the steering wheel will vibrate , and the driver will hear a chime .
What 's more , the software update includes a new Valet Mode . With Valet Mode enabled , Model S owners can prevent other drivers from accessing certain settings and reaching certain speeds . All in all , a great way to prevent adventurous valet drivers from taking your prized Model S for an unauthorized joyride .
The software update is expected to drop in a couple months and seemingly delivers a whole a lot of cool features . As the Tesla press release notes , “ Model S is the only car on the road that improves with time , thanks to Tesla 's free , over-the-air software updates . ”
No doubt about that .
The update should be available in about 10 days .

The federal government is spending $ 950 million to fund an `` Innovation Superclusters Initiative '' that it says will `` create more middle-class jobs and more opportunities for Canadian businesses to grow into globally successful brands . ''
Minister of innovation , science and economic development Navdeep Bains made the announcement at the offices of BlackBerry QNX in Kanata , Ont . near Ottawa on Wednesday morning .
`` We are looking for bold proposals with ambitious visions and missions , '' Bains said .
The initiative seeks to create superclusters in specific industries :
Advanced manufacturing .
Agri-food .
Clean resources .
Clean technoology .
Digital technology .
Health/biosciences .
Infrastructure and transportation .
Up to five superclusters will be created . Each supercluster will be a non-profit consortium created by large and small companies , along with post-secondary educational institutions or non-profit organizations . Applications will be accepted from both Canadian companies and international companies with Canadian operations .
`` Each business-led consortium must commit to matching dollar for dollar the amount it is requesting under this initiative , '' said a government press release .
Minister Bains said he hoped to announce the successful applicants by the end of the government 's fiscal year .
The supercluster program follows up on innovation commitments made by the federal government in its 2017 budget .
Lawyer argues that chimps have free will and would prefer to live in a sanctuary .
This Feb. 19 , 2013 , photo shows two chimps walking together at Chimp Haven in Keithville , La . ( Photo11 : Gerald Herbert , AP ) Story Highlights Nonhuman Rights Project says chimp is being held against its will
Lawyer sees precedent in court rulings on slaves and pets
Group wants chimp to be moved to a sanctuary
A first-of-its-kind lawsuit filed Monday asks a judge to free a chimpanzee that a lawyer says is being held against his will as a pet in New York .
Tommy , who lives with a couple who have a reindeer farm in Gloversville , N.Y. , is illegally imprisoned and under New York law has the right to live a more `` chimpanzee-like '' life at a sanctuary , says attorney Steven Wise , president of the Nonhuman Rights Project .
The lawsuit accuses Patrick and Diane Lavery of holding Tommy , a 26-year-old chimp , captive . The Laverys are `` detaining Tommy in solitary confinement in a small , dank , cement cage in a cavernous dark shed '' at their property , the lawsuit says .
Chimpanzees can make choices and , like humans , have an interest in freedom to live as they wish , Wise says . `` It would seem exceedingly unlikely that any chimpanzee would choose to live life in a cave . ''
Patrick Lavery says Tommy is one of 11 chimps he has rescued from abusive or neglectful homes and cared for until they could be relocated to sanctuaries . Tommy , the last of the 11 , has lived with them for more than a decade while they search for an appropriate place for him near enough to the couples ' Ocala , Fla. , farm so they can visit him , he said .
`` He 's actually my favorite . He 's so attached to us . When we get home , he 'll be so excited to see us , '' Lavery said from Florida .
The cage in New York where Tommy now lives exceeds federal and state standards and is inspected every year , he said . One wall of the cage opens to an outdoor area . This time of year , Tommy stays inside in a building heated to 70 degrees with concrete walls decorated with flowers and trees to look like a jungle , Lavery says . `` The chimp has color TV and cable , '' Lavery said . `` He watches cartoons . ''
`` I 've got 20 years experience with chimpanzees . We 're not just some Joe Blow on the street who just happens to have a chimpanzee , '' Lavery said . `` I 've had animals all my life , horses , dogs reindeer . It 's not a fly-by-night operation . ''
The Nonhuman Rights Project , represented by Wise , has asked a New York civil court for a writ of habeas corpus for Tommy , arguing that New York laws `` do not limit legal personhood to Homo sapiens . '' The lawsuit notes that , in the past , the court has decided legal issues involving other domestic animals .
State law allows any person unlawfully detained to seek a writ of habeas corpus that requires the jailers to prove the basis for the detention . New York issued such writs for slaves , not considered people under the laws of the time , to determine whether the slaves should be returned to their purported owners or given freedom , the lawsuit argues .
`` Not long ago , people generally agreed that human slaves could not be legal persons , but were simply the property of their owners , '' Wise said . `` We will assert , based on clear scientific evidence , that it 's time to take the next step and recognize that these non-human animals can not continue to be exploited as the property of their human owners . ''
The Nonhuman Rights Project intends to file two additional lawsuits to free two male chimpanzees , Hercules and Leo , allegedly owned by New Iberia Research Center and used in locomotion research by the anatomy department at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook , N.Y. , and Kiko , a 26-year-old chimpanzee living on private property in Niagara Falls , Wise says .
Wise wants the chimps to be released to a sanctuary where the animals can live among other chimps in a more natural setting .

5000 Minirobots Are Being Deployed to Map the Universe
TL ; DR : Starting in 2019 , the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument is set to explore the universe using cylindrical robots , boldly going ‘ where no map has gone before . '
For the longest time , mankind has been navigating the unknown in search of the answers to a slew of never-ending questions . Unfortunately , one fact remains : many questions are still left unsolved– including ones about our place in the universe .
A few of the 5,000 close-packed robotic positioners that place the ends of optical fibers to collect the light from a single galaxy or quasar . The blue circle represents a patch of sky with numerous astronomical targets reachable by a single robot . In seconds it can rotate , extend , or retract to place its fiber in position with millionths of a meter precision . ( Image R. Lafever , DESI Collaboration )
But now , under the command of scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBL ) , an army of 5,000 tiny robots will boldly go “ where no map has gone before . ”
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument ( DESI ) has received the US Department of Energy 's ( DoE ) approval to move from the design phase to construction of 5,000 10 cm-long , finger-width robots which will take on the job of aiming fiber-optic cables at galaxies , stars , and quasars to produce an enormous 3D map of the sky .
These cylindrical robots , which will begin making observations in 2019 , will keep on firing fiber-optic cables for five years . According to a press release , this technology will give scientists new insight into galaxy evolution , dark matter , and the nature of dark energy that is driving the accelerating expansion of the universe .

Women supporting Islamic State use social media to lure sympathizers with `` the promise of an Islamist utopia ''
LONDON ( Thomson Reuters Foundation ) - Islamic State militants have been using female supporters to persuade European Muslims to travel to Iraq and Syria as part of the group 's efforts to establish a caliphate there , an anti-terrorism thinktank said on Tuesday .
Analysing social media accounts , the Quilliam Foundation said female supporters of the Islamic State were using sites like Instagram , Twitter , Ask.fm , VK and Facebook to lure others with `` the promise of an Islamist utopia '' .
`` While other groups like Al Qaeda have had women supporters before , Islamic State has recruited females and is getting women to go out to live in the caliphate , '' Charlie Winter , programmes officer at the Quilliam Foundation , told the Thomson Reuters Foundation .
Islamic State declared a caliphate across vast swathes of Syria and Iraq earlier this year , after sweeping into the conflict-ridden region and driving out Christians , Shi'ite Muslims and other communities .
Determined to re-draw the map of the Middle East , the group are engaged in nation building and are calling on people from all over the world to help them create a new society .
`` They call for lawyers , doctors , engineers and people who can help form a working administrative state and among those are women as they need wives for their fighters , '' Winter said .
Quilliam Foundation estimate that as many as 200 European women have travelled to the region to join the Islamic State as the recruitment efforts continue .
`` There are a number of very vocal female IS supporters in Syria and Iraq who document their daily lives in great detail and provide advice on what people should expect when they come out , and this is directed at women , '' Winters said .
The British Home Office ( interior ministry ) estimate that as many as 500 people have travelled to Syria and Iraq from Britain since the Syrian conflict started more than three years ago .
Home Office officials did not say how many British Muslims are fighting for Islamic State .
The Quilliam Foundation estimates that 2,500 Western Europeans have journeyed to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .

Of the many feats that can be accomplished on Hillclimb Racing , not many can compare with winning Pikes Peak International Hill Climb . Even less can compare with having the All-Time Overall record on said Legendary race ..
But that´s exactly what 9-time World Rally Champion Sebastien Loeb achieved on 2013 with the help of Peugeot Sport . Onboard the unvelievable 875Hp/875Kg , 4wd , 3.2L Twin Turbo Peugeot 208 T16 Pikes Peak Special , the French Ace posted a ground-breaking 8.13:878 , which to this day stands as the overall record on the Colorado Springs-based event .
But now on 2017 , something curious happened and somehow Mr. Loeb is the new owner of this Monster , with Peugeot Sport letting it go from their museum . Of course this means it will be possible to watch this machine getting some action . Turn out that will happen exactly this very weekend at Turckheim Trois Epis Hillclimb in France .
So , to everyone interested in watching not only one , but two incredible pieces of Hillclimb Racing History ( Romain Dumas will be also present with the Norma Prototype with which he won this year´s edition of Pikes Peak ) , all eyes will be on the Eastern Region of France near the Germany-Switzerland border , to watch once again some of the definitive Monsters of the Sport .

Saskatoon voters have elected Charlie Clark as the city 's mayor-elect .
Clark defeated incumbent Don Atchison who was seeking a fifth term . He was named the unofficial winner after polls closed at 8 p.m. CST .
The unofficial results were Charlie Clark with 41 per cent of vote , Don Atchison got 37 per cent , Kelley Moore received 22 per cent and Devon Hein got one per cent of the vote .
The final leg of the campaign was a close three-way race between Clark , Atchison , and Kelley Moore .
Entering city hall to a roar of cheers , Clark said he 's proud of his campaign team and he 's excited to lead Saskatoon forward into a new era .
`` I 'm over the moon . It 's an incredible feeling to have the support of voters . We worked very hard to offer up a choice for change in this city in what I feel is a very important time for us in this city , '' Clark said .
Despite being behind the polls throughout the campaign and trailing Moore and Atchison in the two final polls leading up to the election , Clark said it was those moments where the team around him pushed harder to ramp up support .
`` In a lot of ways , every result that was n't good for us , we saw more people get engaged and more people fighting harder for this city they knew we could create together and there 's so much talent in this city and so many incredible people behind me in this campaign . ''
Speaking to reporters at city hall following the final results , Atchison reflected on the campaign and respected the outcome of the election .
`` The voters have spoken tonight and the voters are always right in the end , '' Atchison said , adding he has no idea why he lost in the end .
`` We thought we ran a wonderful campaign in the sense of being honest , straight-forward and telling people what we believed in . ''
Clark served as the city councillor for Ward 6 for the past decade . He said he wanted to focus on smarter spending and on core services during the campaign . He also focused on issues including taxes , transit , crime in the city and how the city plans to grow .
The voters have spoken tonight and the voters are always right in the end . - Don Atchison
One common theme leading up to the election was how the new mayor would control taxes , after what 's been a string of record tax increases in Saskatoon .
While Clark did n't go into specifics about how he would lower the tax burden , he said one thing he would not endorse was a shift to lower the commercial tax ratio .
Clark said from 2001 to 2010 city hall approved a tax shift from business to homeowners that accounted for a 14 per cent tax increase for residents . He said that lowering the commercial property tax would not bring business into Saskatoon as some in the business community had argued .
The issue of street checks and carding came frequently in the campaign . Clark stated he stands against racial profiling and carding and the solution starts with building community relationships and working with social services .

Clark also outlined his plan for growth stating his plan calls for growth upwards , not outwards , and a focus on the city 's core development . He said his plan will save the city $ 500 million a year with no need to build new overpasses for every new neighbourhood .
`` I 've been working with citizens and leaders and council for 10 years on making a new infill guidelines plan , '' he said . `` When infill comes into neighbourhoods , it 's designed to fit into the neighbourhoods and to not overwhelm surrounding neighbourhoods . Where the city has gone wrong is adding neighbourhoods on the outside with choke-points that now require $ 50 million overpasses . I 've been fighting against that kind of planning for 10 years . ''
The right infill plan will help build the tax base , create jobs and lower costs in the long run .
Why did the chicken cross the road ? Nowadays , it 's to get to his backyard chicken coop . Your “ free spirited ” aunt is n't the only one raising chickens anymore . Urban chicken coops – and the fresh eggs that come from them – have become the hottest trend among health conscious eaters and locavores . Even celebrities are hopping on the chicken train , including Jennifer Aniston , Reese Witherspoon , Martha Stewart , Ellen Pompeo and Rachel Weisz . Whether it 's a $ 100,000 dollar Versailles-inspired chicken coop or a do-it-yourself pen , chicken enclosures are popping up everywhere .
But which cities have embraced this trend the most ? Today Redfin named the top five best cities to be a chicken , based on the percentage of homes that have hit the market or sold in the past three months with chicken enclosures mentioned as a feature in the multiple listing service description .
For anyone who has seen Portlandia , it comes as no surprise that Portland tops the list as the city with the most chicken coops . And people in California must love fresh eggs ; three of the top five cities are in the Golden State , including Ventura ( # 2 ) , San Diego ( # 3 ) , and Sacramento ( # 4 ) . Seattle rounds out the list at number five , meaning all of the top cities are on the West Coast .
So what kind of person keeps chickens ? It turns out they 're not necessarily suburbanites with a lot of land ; in fact on average , listings with chicken coops have smaller homes and smaller lots , but larger price tags . It appears some buyers are willing to pay a little more for a home with a henhouse .
But not everyone wants the responsibility . Trevor Smith , a real estate agent at Redfin , had clients who were neck-and-neck with another bidder on a home in Seattle that had a chicken coop . The sellers were moving to an apartment and could n't take the chickens with them , so they were hoping to find a buyer who would care for them . Unfortunately , Trevor 's clients were n't in a position to keep them . To help his clients win the bidding war , Trevor volunteered to adopt the chickens himself . The tactic worked ; the sellers decided to accept the bid from Trevor 's clients , and now the four hens , Martha , Abigail , Jackie O. , and Lady Bird , are enjoying their new coop at Trevor 's home , while his clients are enjoying their new home !
Stories like those are likely common in the top five cities with the most chicken coops – read on for more !
The locavore movement is strong in Portland , with many restaurants boasting a menu made of ingredients from less than 50 miles away . The city 's residents were among the first to raise backyard chickens en masse , and even the former mayor , Sam Adams , had a couple of hens .
“ From community urban farms to edible front yard gardens , Oregonians are crazy about keeping it local . We make our own cheese and sausage , brew our own beer , roast our own coffee… we even trade canned food . Chickens fit right in . The eggs taste way better , your neighbors will love you ( if you share ) , and if you have a good chicken coop , you might be sitting on a little pot of gold when you sell your house ! ” said Jeff Bale , a Redfin real estate agent in Portland .
In order to raise more than three chickens in Portland , residents must build a humane enclosure at least 15 feet away from their home , and obtain a permit from the city . But a permit is n't required if you have less than three hens . Additional details can be found on Portland Online .
Perhaps it 's the temperate climate that drove so many residents of Ventura to build chicken coops . It 's much easier to take care of chickens when you do n't need to worry about them freezing to death ! Locals in Ventura , California , have been quick to embrace the backyard chicken movement ; there 's even a Facebook page called Ventucky Chicken , where residents can discuss the local chicken culture .
“ The year-round weather in Ventura and the surrounding communities is terrific for raising chickens and other animals or having personal gardens for vegetables . With such a mild climate , it is no surprise that farming plays such a large part of the lifestyle in the area , ” said John Underwood , a Redfin real estate agent in Southern California .
City officials are trying to catch up with the trend . Last October the City of Ventura Planning Commission recommended that the City Council change the definition of domestic animals to include chickens , so residents can keep up to six hens without a permit , as long as they are in a penned area at least 35 feet from a home . The laws and regulations currently vary by city ; for specific details on the regulations in Ventura County , it 's best to contact your local community council .
Chickens are popping up all over San Diego , and we do n't mean the Famous San Diego Chicken . Backyard coops have gained in popularity since the city amended its code last January to allow single family residents to keep chickens .
“ Chicken coops are the trendiest house accessory in San Diego . Some have a small one-hen coop , while others have deluxe multiple-level coop brightly painted in neon colors . Hens can often produce more eggs than a household can eat , so some homeowners hold weekly egg sales on their sidewalk or at the local farmer 's market , ” said Jordan Clarke , a Redfin real estate agent in San Diego .
San Diego residents are allowed up to five hens , as long as they are in the backyard , five feet from side property lines , 13 feet from the rear property line , and kept in an appropriate coop . The city offers residents an online form that makes it easy to look up the guidelines in their area . More information is available on SanDiego.gov .
Sacramento was one of the first major metros to allow chickens , but unlike other cities , it requires a fee . Unfortunately , many residents are unaware of the license and fee requirements , and are keeping undocumented chickens .
“ There are a lot of reasons people in Sacramento keep chickens . Some value the free , farm-fresh eggs , some see it as being good for the environment , and others simply enjoy having them as pets . It seems to be a growing trend ; over the past few years I 've been seeing a lot more chicken coops as I go on home tours with clients , ” said Lindsay Martin , a Redfin real estate agent in Sacramento .
People within Sacramento city limits can keep up to three hens in their backyard , as long as the enclosure is 20 feet away from any homes . An annual license fee of $ 10 per household and permit fee of $ 15 per chicken is also required . Additional information is available within the Sacramento City Code .
Seattle and Portland have a lot in common , including their love of urban chicken farming . An organization called Seattle Tilth encourages the practice by hosting a tour of the top 25 urban farms in the area .
“ Seattleites are foodies and conscientious about what they put into their bodies . A lot of people have created urban farms on their property ; they grow organic vegetables in their garden and raise chickens in their backyard . You 'd be surprised by how many homes for sale have coops . Sometimes they 're the front-and-center focal point of a yard , and sometimes they 're unobtrusive , covered by trees and bushes , ” said Bree Al-Rashid , a Redfin real estate agent in Seattle .
Seattlites can keep up to eight chickens , as long as their enclosure is at least 10 feet away from any home . They are n't allowed to roam off your property , so some type of pen needs to be created . People with larger lots can keep additional chickens . Additional information is available on Seattle.gov .
Program Boosts Special Forces Members ' Physical , Mental Capabilities
( Editor 's Note : Names of service members not used because of security concerns . )
Special Forces soldiers , known as Green Berets , are some of the most highly-trained troops in the Army . Their readiness requires them to have a performance training program designed to increase physical performance and emotional well-being , prevent injuries and improve mental skills necessary to perform optimally in training and combat operations .
This is the goal of the U.S. Special Operations Command 's human performance program , also known as the Tactical Human Optimization , Rapid Rehabilitation and Reconditioning program , or THOR3 .
The purpose of THOR3 is to create programs for special operations-focused missions by using professional sports-quality staff to provide coaching in strength and conditioning , physical therapy , dietetics and cognitive enhancement , officials said .
Increasing Mental , Physical Capabilities
“ Our goal is to increase their mental and physical capabilities to help them recover from injuries sustained in combat or training , helping them to stay combat ready , longer , ” said a cognitive enhancement specialist with THOR3 . “ Cognitive enhancement is a formal part of the program , which seeks to provide a systematic way to build mental and emotional strength . ”
A soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group here said the THOR3 training significantly enhances troops ' physical capabilities . He also said the physical improvements made by those who have participated are resulting in increased attendance in the program .
“ The biggest thing about the THOR3 program is its growth , ” the soldier said . “ You see more people filtering in . The facility will definitely need to be expanded to accommodate that . ”
A strength and conditioning coach said the THOR3 program strives to optimize special operations troops ' mental , spiritual , and physical condition .
The THOR3 program staff at 10th Group consists of a human performance program coordinator , strength and conditioning coaches , physical therapists , a dietitian and a cognitive enhancement specialist .
In addition to the mental aspect of the program , proper nutrition is required to optimize rehabilitation and performance . This is an often overlooked , yet vital aspect of human performance , which is emphasized by the THOR3 team .
“ We have added THOR3 nutritional items at the dining facility that are scientifically proven to improve a soldier 's performance , ” said a performance dietician with the performance program . “ Often overlooked , there are specific foods you must eat to effectively optimize the body 's potential , along with rest , recovery and training . ”
Holistic Approach
Additionally , the total holistic approach to fitness includes the collection of data . Information is collected through sports science data during heart rate monitoring , GPS tracking , mobility tests , lactate testing , and body composition testing . This testing is needed to assure the effectiveness and overall management of the program .
“ We collect the data from tests run on the soldiers and personalize a training program for them to optimize their abilities physically , tactically , technically and mentally , ” said the performance analyst assigned to the program .
Brendan Eich , famous for founding Mozilla and creating JavaScript , has presented Brave , new software that pays in bitcoin for web advertisements .
With Eich 's new project , you can receive bitcoin micropayments for browsing and pass them forward to your favourite websites to support them financially even if you choose ad-free viewing . The source code is already in GitHub ready to be tested . The official launch is expected later in 2016 .
Although referred to simply as a browser , Brave is in fact a whole new vehicle for advertisement sales or “ browser-based ad-tech platform ” , as Eich himself calls it . The software allows surfing the web just like Firefox or Chrome . But with one addition : it blocks banners replacing them with 'clean ads ' which do not slow down browsing or harm users ' privacy . These ads still bring 55 % revenue to their publishers and 15 % to the advertisers , in bitcoin . But it 's not all : Brave owners and users also get 15 % of revenue each .
Brave automatically registers bitcoin accounts for publishers and pays the reward onto them . It is up to publishers then to find a way to collect the payments .
Earlier this month CoinFox reported about the release of LetsBrik , a web browser-based communication platform which offers HD video chat , cheap international calls and SMS exchange . The accounts can be topped up in bitcoin as well as in credit and debit cards and via PayPal .
In December 2015 Google Chrome added a new extension Netki which simplifies the use of bitcoin wallets , helping to create neat wallet names instead of lengthy 32-character public addresses .

No , Games Ca n't Change The World
Of all the garbage claims made by the soapbox brigade in the niche games press , this is the one that gets me the most : The idea that “ Games can change the world. ” When someone like Jane McGonigal — a ( rich , white , well-maintained ) woman who was granted an honest to god PhD by an academic institution — says a thing like “ The best hope we have for surviving the next century on this planet ? Games , ” I instantly know that person is the most first-worldly of egotist , mired in a never-ending , never-challenged haze of his or her own self importance .
Let 's put this illusion to rest : Like debate class , media can be very good at getting a bunch of privileged first-worlders ( like McGonigal ) to discuss great , grand ideas and ideals they do n't have a dusty fuck 's chance in hell of ever using or affecting . What media does n't do is change the world in a tangible , widespread , lasting way . Not since a brief period during the 60s has this been a delusion that otherwise reasonable people might entertain .
And if music — a relatively inexpensive artform with a low bar to entry — did n't ultimately change this miserable , corrupt rock in any lasting way , what chance has a medium that claims often-expensive electronic devices as a prerequisite ? Even a shit mobile or outdated laptop can cost more than most of the world makes in a year ( $ 1-2 a day , depending on the study ) . Most of the planet is stuck trying not to die of hunger or get raped each night , or praying they do n't catch something that will be lethal to them , but that you and I would fix with a trip to the drugstore or box clinic . These people need food , medicine , basic infrastructure and basic education initiatives . They do n't need a bunch of circlejerking first-world hipsters trying to figure out how they can get their garbage apps into the hands of starving , wartorn peoples .
You see this “ games will change the world ” shit , too , in another idea that has gained quite a bit of traction lately in the games press . The hipsters have started to complain that horror games stigmatize mental illness by , you know , having crazy people in them . Even as a child growing up in a Catholic household , I often wondered if the idea of Heaven just sounded a bit too , you know , boring . I wondered what it would be like to sit on a cloud all day singing Kumbaya . Having read and written about video games for a while now , I can tell you this is exactly the sort of world these jokers would like to see — a world where nobody has any fun , nobody accomplishes anything . The dream is a utopia where everyone spends each and every day in a state of uber-aware hypersensitivity to everyone and everything .
What makes this notion even more laughable is that 1 ) the big-budget ( i.e. , good ) horror game is all but dead , and 2 ) I live in a country where a not-insignificant portion of people still think those with suicidal ideation “ just need Jesus. ” Here , if you 're a dude , admitting you struggle with depression is viewed as a sign that you 're maybe half a step away from putting on a sundress and parasol for a stroll in the gloryhole park . In this self-professed grandest of all nations , one of the most lionized figures in our political history literally created a perpetual underclass of mentally ill people by shutting down the institutions erected to treat them . Tell me again , then , how the real work to protect the mentally ill in our shitcastle society can be accomplished by making the antagonists of fiction less entertaining .
But , you know , if you 're one of these folks and you 're reading this , I freely admit I could be wrong about you and your intentions . I could be a bitter hole and you could be a great humanitarian . So let 's do a test : The next time you want to develop an app to help Africa or whatever , scrap that project and spend the development cost on simple fishing netting coated with anti-malaria chemicals . You 'll probably get it at a great bulk discount , and make a real , tangible impact in potentially thousands of lives overnight , no development or crunch time required . ( You wo n't be able to stick it on your CV or get a TED talk with it , though , so nevermind . )
As the starving African child lay dying , his stomach was distended , but his heart was comforted , for he had heard the words of Saint McGonigal , and so he knew the world he was about to depart would become a better one through bleep bloops .
Every group of self-important jackasses needs someone to give them a slap on the back . That 's why shit like this exists : Games For Change is a festival that prides itself on a partnership with Tribeca and a slate of past speakers including Al Gore and Sandra Day O'Connor . And yet , all the highbrow trimmings in the world ca n't mask the fact that this is a festival that gave its highest gameplay award to Gone Home , a miserable pile of dung that contains about as much “ gameplay ” as a spreadsheet program .
But then , it 's not about fun , or mechanics with these people . It is about shoving an agenda into a medium that is entirely unsuited for it . In some ways , I am thankful for the vocal nature of this insufferable lot , because it makes them that much easier to identify and avoid . The idea that video games can ( or need to ) make so much as a dent in even the smallest Real Issue is the thought process of a person I 'd sooner watch die in a chemical fire than spend a single moment engaged in conversation with .
On some subconscious level , I believe these wretches understand the futility of their crusade : This is why they 've defined “ raising awareness ” as the eternal victory condition : Realistically , not 1 % of 1 % of these sensitive souls have a hope of impacting a multibillion-dollar entertainment industry : Their software is terrible , their ideas are esoteric wank , their thoughts on how to “ change ”  the industry are so far outside the realm of commercial tenability as to be hard fiction . Therefore , if the goal is to make a tangible change in what mainstream ( i.e. , good ) video games are produced and the way they are produced , they fail every time .
Jane McGonigal employs the Kevin Trudeau school of hyperbole while also revealing her stupid priorities .
But if they convince their peers ( and their own egos ) to award a medal just for “ raising awareness ? ” Then it 's a continued stream of self-satisfaction . When every half-baked pile of code , every navel-gazing tweet , every Tumblr reblog , and every overly long blog post only 2 people in the author 's gender studies class will read qualifies as a victory , it becomes possible to frame oneself as undefeated . It is ironic that in this sense , the social justice brigade has much in common with fundamental religious zealots : The great commission is fulfilled by the mere act of shouting the gospel loudly and often , even if the audience thinks you 're a nutter .

If you had n't figured it out from my review of the InkWorks Projector pen , I really liked Star Wars : the Force Awakens – especially the adorable , new BB-8 droid . And , shortly after writing that review , I stumbled across another BB-8 themed pen , one with a large , molded-plastic clicker to go along with its orange and white paint job . I just could n't resist .
This BB-8 pen , however , is produced by TGL , a company that seems to make a lot of similar pens for Disney . Unfortunately , they only seem to be available in Asian and European markets , so it took some hunting around online to find one I could purchase in the U.S . Eventually , eBay came through , and $ 10 and 30-days later , my BB-8 pen arrived on my doormat directly from Malaysia .
The pen , flat-out , looks great . It 's surprisingly detailed , with BB-8 's antennae and eyes protruding from his head . But it 's also immediately clear that this pen is not very functional for anyone with adult-sized hands . The barrel is just too thick , it does n't fit in a pocket , and , it probably goes without saying , I feel rather ridiculous using this pen in public . And poor BB-8 's head constantly bangs into my hand whenever I write with it .
Obviously , it 's a novelty pen , most of which look nice but function poorly . In this instance , the size of this BB-8 pen might be best suited for children 's hand . But in my case , I 'm happy just to prop it up on my shelf next to my Rey bobble-head .
A French man has appeared in court charged with possessing an air rifle and a knife following an evacuation at Gatwick Airport .
Jerome Chauris , 41 , from Vendome in central France , was arrested on Saturday after allegedly walked into the airport 's North Terminal carrying the weapons .
Wearing a white striped shirt and his black shoulder-length hair swept back , Chauris identified himself with the help of an interpreter .
During the hearing he wept and made several comments in French .
The incident , which took place at around 9.30am on Saturday , sent parts of the airport into lockdown and caused significant disruption to travellers .
Check-in was closed for six hours and is said to have cost airlines and passengers an estimated £1.2m .
The court heard how thousands of passengers and airport staff were evacuated from the terminal 's 'landside ' concourse , the area before luggage screening and security checks open to the public .
Officers from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team then moved into the departure hall and carried out a small controlled explosion on a suspicious package .
Mr Chauris , of no fixed address , was remanded in custody to appear before Lewes Crown Court on 14 December .

By By AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Mike Doll December 24 , 2013 , 12:16:38 AM EST
While the Midwest dug out from heavy snow , ice brought down trees and power lines from Michigan to Maine , much of the East Coast experienced temperatures representative of September or May this past weekend .
Some locations tied or broke all-time high temperature records for the month of December , while some spots broke daily records that were more than a century old .
`` Dozens of records melted this past weekend and morning temperatures in some places matched what is expected in early June , '' said AccuWeather.com Expert Senior Meteorologist Elliot Abrams .
Records were either broken or tied this past weekend in New York City , Philadelphia , Washington , D.C. , Baltimore and Atlanta , Ga .
New Record Highs Set This Past Weekend City New Record ( Day ) Old Record New York City 71 degrees ( Sun ) 63 in 1998 Hartford , Conn. 64 degrees ( Sun ) 59 in 1998 Philadelphia 67 degrees ( Sat ) 66 in 1895 Washington , D.C. 72 degrees ( Sat ) 68 in 1923 Baltimore 71 degrees ( Sun ) 70 in 1889 Atlanta , Ga. 71 degrees ( Sun ) 70 in 1889 Jacksonville , Fla. 84 degrees ( Sun ) 82 in 1967 Norfolk , Va. 81 degrees ( Sun ) 76 in 1967
Highs were in the 70s and 80s from southern Virginia to Florida and in the 60s and 70s from southern New England to the mid-Atlantic .
On the other end of the spectrum , highs in the northern Plains on Sunday were below zero , creating a temperature difference of nearly 100 degrees across the Lower 48 states .
A colder pattern will set up for the East through the middle of this week .
Highs on Tuesday from the Carolinas to the Northeast will be at least 30 degrees colder than Sunday 's highs .

A woman who streamed live video of herself driving drunk around Lakeland on Saturday faces DUI charges after an officer determined her location and tracked her down , police said .
The Lakeland Police Department began receiving 911 calls soon after Whitney Marie Beall , 23 , began broadcasting her video on Periscope , a live video streaming platform owned by Twitter , police said .
In the video , which could be viewed by anyone on Twitter , Beall is heard slurring her words and telling viewers how drunk she is and that she is completely lost .
A Lakeland police officer used a personal Twitter account to determine Beall 's location , based on landmarks in the area . She was driving a 2015 Toyota Corolla with a flat left front tire , and as officers tried to pull her over on Carpenters Way , she hit the south curb with her right front tire , police said .
Beall continued without braking before pulling over on Carpenters Way . She smelled of alcohol , spoke slowly , and her eyes were bloodshot and glassy , police said .
She seemed disoriented , failed a sobriety test and refused a breath test .

For many years , feminist blogger and Pasadena City College professor Hugo Schwyzer was welcomed by the lefty feminist community . His writing was published by The Atlantic , the Good Men Project , Jezebel , HuffPo , Alternet , The Frisky and the Guardian .
Sure , he alienated some femme-a-gogues over the years , inspiring the Fuck No , Hugo Schwyzer Tumblr . Here 's part of the most recent post :
But Schwyzer promoted SlutWalks and ran around with his speculum-handled abortion pom-poms reciting “ pro-choice ” cheers , so he continued his cushy gig teaching courses on porn and gender studies while receiving a platform in the feminist media .
Last month he kinda , sorta quit the Internet . The next day , screen caps of a sexting affair between the married “ male feminist ” and a porn star surfaced . He told New York magazine he was done with the Internet because of his “ fragile ” mental health and also that feminists are meanies .
This week , the Pasadena Star-News reported that following the sexting scandal and extramarital affairs , Schwyzer would be taking some sick time . At least one trustee does n't want him to return to teaching “ Navigating Pornography . ”
Schwyzer returned to Twitter yesterday , admitting in dozens of tweets to years of deception as he weaseled his way into feminist academia . He also said he was in the middle of a manic episode . Here 's a selection of those tweets from the self-described “ notorious bad boy male feminist ” :

The Charlotte Hornets are down to the NBA-mandated 15 players for opening night , and rookie guard Aaron Harrison is among them .
Harrison was the undrafted twin brother from Kentucky last summer ; Andrew Harrison was selected 44th by the Phoenix Suns and was traded on draft night to the Memphis Grizzlies . Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer detailed how Aaron was able to secure a spot for the Hornets ' opener on Wednesday night , when they will visit the Miami Heat :
`` After going unselected in June 's draft , Harrison drew the Hornets ' attention in Orlando summer league . A 6-foot-6 guard , Harrison played mostly off the ball in his two seasons at Kentucky , but the Hornets used him as a point guard in Orlando . He showed a knack for getting to the rim off the dribble and has the length to be a solid defender . Harrison was n't a particularly good shooter at Kentucky , making just 41 percent of his shots from the field . He worked extensively with Hornets shooting coach Bruce Kruetzer over the summer to improve his 3-point range . ''
When small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had shoulder surgery in early October that will likely sideline him for the entire season , Charlotte brought in veteran swingman Damien Wilkens . Wilkens presented a threat to Harrison making the team , but Wilkins was waived Friday .
Harrison averaged 3.5 points playing in six of Charlotte 's eight preseason games , which resulted in a 7-1 record .

In nerve electrophysiology , it is widely believed that two colliding nerve pulses annihilate and can not pass through each other . However , there is little evidence in the literature that this process actually occurs . We show that action potentials in the nerve fibers of earthworms and lobsters in fact pass through each other without inducing major perturbations .
We compare two different approaches for explaining the nerve pulse : the Hodgkin-Huxley model and a more recent electromechanical soliton model . The former does not allow for pulse penetration ; the latter treats the nerve pulse as a nondissipative electromechanical pulse and predicts pulse penetration . Therefore , penetration experiments are critical for discriminating between the two approaches . We use the ventral cords of earthworms and lobsters , specifically the median and lateral giant axons . We stimulate the axons with two pairs of electrodes , one at each end of the nerve . Our measurements reveal that the myelinated fibers ( from earthworms ) and nonmyelinated fibers ( from lobsters ) yield no change in the shape or velocity of the colliding pulses , implying that action potentials propagate as electromechanical pulses . The presence of electromechanical pulses is consistent with the experimental finding that changes in nerve thickness are found and no heat is dissipated during the nerve pulse .
Our findings are not consistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model , which has long been accepted as a description of nerve-pulse propagation .
Anglo-Saxon Social Organisation
The young son of a Gebur farmer
The Anglo-Saxon community in England was basically a rural one , where primarily all classes of society lived on the land . At the top of the social system was the royal house . This consisted of the king and princes ( æðelings ) , who claimed a common ancestry with the king ; they had special privileges and responsibilities which included military service and command in the field . By the middle of the ninth century the royal family of Wessex was universally recognised as the English royal family and held a hereditary right to rule . Succession to the throne was not guaranteed as the witan , or council of leaders , had the right to choose the best successor from the members of the royal house .
Below the king were the eoldermen , the ruling nobility . The eolderman was the king 's 'viceroy ' in a shire , responsible for administration and justice , for calling out the fyrd and leading its forces in the field . The office was not hereditary , but it became usual in the tenth century to choose eoldermen from a few outstanding families .
The same eoldormanry frequently remained in one family for more than one generation . By the early 11th century the term eolderman began to be replaced with eorl , possibly influenced by the Danish 'Jarl ' . In the second half of the 10th century the title became more important , an eorl now governing several shires . æðelings , eorls , bishops and archbishops formed the high witan .
The next class down the social ladder was the ðegn ( thane ) . Good service by a ðegn could result not only in rich gifts but sometimes in the granting of lands and , on rare occasions , elevation to eorl or eolderman . The eoldermen were all high ranking ðegns . Ðegns formed the backbone of the Anglo-Saxon army . Most ðegns were the 'king 's ðegns ' . These were the ðegns whose lord was the king himself , as opposed to one of the richer ðegns or eoldermen . They held their lands from the king and could lose them ( and sometimes their lives ) if they did not answer the king 's summons . Their service to the king was performed on a rota and they would accompany him everywhere , both as bodyguards and lesser officials . Ðegns were primarily warriors whose duty was to carry out the 'common burdens ' of service in the fyrd , overseeing fortress work and bridge building . A ðegn 's status as a warrior is confirmed by the interchangeable use of the word 'ðegn ' and 'milites ' in contemporary manuscripts depending on whether the text was in English or Latin . The 'cynges ðegn ' is usually referred to as a 'milites regis ' in the latin texts . A ðegn 's wereguild ( blood-price ) was set nominally at 1200 shillings .
The young boy 's Grandfather and pregnant Aunty
The ðegns were a numerous class , there were approximately two thousand landowners of the thegnly class in Wessex and Mercia . Ðegns were not restricted to the king 's service for the great eorls had their own ðegns ; even some of the more powerful and landed ðegns had their own lesser ðegns . In return for land a ðegn performed certain duties which are well described in a late tenth century document which states :
'The law of the ðegn is that he be entitled to his chartered estates , and that he perform three things in respect of his land : military service and the repair of fortresses and work on bridges . Also in many estates further land duties arise by order of the king , such as servicing the deer-fence at the king 's residence , and equipping a guard ship and guarding the coast , and attendance on his superior , and supplying a military guard , almsgiving and church dues and many other different things . '
A lesser ðegn could gain promotion to a king 's ðegn through service as the early eleventh century document , Gethynctho , shows :
' 3 . And the ðegn who prospered that he served the king and rode in his household band , on riding errands , if he himself had a ðegn who served him , possessing five hides on which he had discharged the king 's dues , and who had attended his lord in the king 's hall , and had thrice gone on his errand to the king - then he [ the ðegn 's ðegn ] was afterwards allowed to represent his lord with a preliminary oath . '
The boy 's Father and Mother
Below the ðegns were the ceorls , freemen , farmers and independent landed householders who formed the mainstay of the Saxon kingdom , based as it was on a rural economy . The term free in an Anglo-Saxon context can be misleading , since there were many degrees of freedom . Ceorls were 'folcfry ' ( folk-free ) , that is , free in the eyes of the community . They enjoyed weregilds and had the right to seek compensations for other free kinsmen and kinswomen . They were allowed to bear arms and be considered 'fyrd worthy ' and 'moot worthy ' . This meant they were considered worthy to serve in the fyrd and take part in folk meetings . They did not have the same degree of freedom as ðegns or eoldermen . A ceorl 's wereguild was set nominally at 200 shillings , one sixth that of a ðegn . There were three main classes of ceorl , although the dividing line between the classes was indistinct . First were the geneatas , the peasant aristocracy who paid rent to their overlord . geneat originally meant companion , implying that the class originated from the lord 's household , often receiving land as a gift . The geneat 's duty was also recorded in the same document as the ðegn 's law , kotsetla 's duty and gebur 's duty .
'The geneat 's duty varies , depending upon what is determined for the estate . In some he must pay ground rent and one store-pig a year , and ride , and perform carrying services and supply cartage , work and entertain his lord , reap and mow , cut deer-fences and maintain hides , build and fence fortifications , conduct strangers to the manor , pay church dues and alms , attend his superior , and guard the horse , carry messages far and near wherever he is directed . '
Second were the kotsetla , who paid no rent but had to perform numerous duties for their overlords .
'The kotsetla 's duty depends on what is determined for the estate . In some he must work for his lord each Monday throughout the year , or three days each week at harvest-time . He need not pay ground rent . He ought to have five acres ; more if it is the custom on the estate ; and if it is ever less , it will be too little , because his labour must always be available . He is to pay his hearth-penny on Ascension Day , just as every freeman ought , and serve on his lord 's estate , if he is ordered , by guarding the coast , and work at the king 's deer-fence , and at similar things according to what his station is ; and he is to pay his church dues at Martinmas . '
Third were the gebur , who were totally dependant on their lord . The gebur 's life was dominated by the labour services owed to his lord . It is probable that the gebur class started out by giving their land to a ðegn in return for protection from raiding parties .
His elder brother examines his new shield whilst his Grandfather takes his neighbour to set some traps .
'The gebur 's duty varies ; in some places they are heavy , in others moderate . On some estates it is such that he must perform such work as he is directed for two week days each week for every week throughout the year , and three week days at harvest-time , and three from Candlemas to Easter ; if he performs cartage he need not work while his horse is out . At Michaelmas he must pay ten pence tax , and at Martinmas twenty-three sesters of barley and two hens ; at Easter one young sheep or twopence . And from Martinmas until Easter he must lie at his lord 's fold as often as it is his turn . And from the time when they first plough until Martinmas he must plough one acre each week and prepare the seed in the lord 's barn himself ; if he needs more grass , then he is to earn it as he is allowed . He is to plough his three acres as tribute land and sow it from his own barn . And he is to pay his hearth penny . And every two are to support one deer-hound . And each tenant is to give six loaves to the swineherd when he drives his herd to the mast pasture . '
The arrangement is not totally one sided however as the lord :
'ought to give the tenant , for the occupation of the land : two oxen and one cow and six sheep and seven sown acres on his piece of land . He is to perform all the duties which appertain to him throughout the year . And they are to give him tools for his work and utensils for his home . When death befalls him , his lord is to take charge of what he leaves . '

The economy depended on slave labour and although the gebur was a lowly peasant , he was privileged compared to the ðeow , and had the right and duty to serve in the Fyrd . All ceorls could win promotion through prosperity or military service , and if for example a ceorl possessed five hides of land , he became entitled to the rights of a ðegn ( although he would not necessarily become a thegn ) as the Gethynctho tells us :
' 2 . And if a ceorl prospered , that he possessed fully five hides of his own , a church and kitchen , bell-house and burh-gate , a seat and a special office in the king 's hall , then he was entitled to the rights of a ðegn . '
He could not , however , rise to be an eorl .
Below the gebur were the ðeow - slaves or bondsmen . Although ðeow were slaves they did have many rights and there were rules set down for what they should be provided with :
'One slave ought to have as provisions : twelve pounds of good corn and the carcasses of two sheep and one good cow for eating and the right of cutting wood according to the custom of the estate . For a female slave : eight pounds of corn for food , one sheep or threepence for winter supplies , one sester of beans for Lenten supplies , whey in summer or one penny . All slaves ought to have Christmas supplies and Easter supplies , an acre for the plough and a 'handful of the harvest ' , in addition to their necessary rights . '
Ðeow were allowed to own property and could earn money in their spare time . If they earned enough they could even buy their freedom , although slaves were sometimes freed by their owners 'for the good of their souls , ' often on their owners deathbed as a manumission . Sometimes , when times were particularly hard , people sold themselves into slavery to ensure they were provisioned , and thus survived .
When looking at Anglo-Saxon social organisation it is important to describe the geographical division of Saxon Britain . The basic unit of land was the hide . This is usually described as enough land to support one family , however the actual size of the hide seems to have varied considerably from estate to estate - estimated at anything from 40 acres to 4 square miles ( 120 acres seems to be an 'average ' hide ) . More usual ( and more evenly supported from contemporary sources ) is a unit of land worth approximately £1 . For the purpose of assessment of tax and military service , hides were grouped together in units called 'hundreds ' , comprised of approximately 100 hides . In charge of the hundred was the 'hundred eolder ' , and each shire contained many hundreds .

A technical recession , but not an “ outright recession . ”
That is the verdict from economists Tuesday after Statistics Canada reported that the Canadian economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , following a 0.8 per cent decline ( revised from an earlier figure of 0.6 per cent ) in the first three months of the year . A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
While growth overall for the first half was weak , the second quarter ended with a strong handoff — GDP grew by 0.5 per cent in June , the strongest monthly reading since May 2014 . At the same time , strength was seen in a number of areas of the economy , including the labour market , the services sector and consumer spending — all signs that Canada 's economy is healthier than the Q2 reading is suggesting , say economists .
“ The lack of a net drop in employment over the same period meant that this was not yet an outright recession , and a solid gain in June GDP points to at least a one-quarter breather , with the economy likely to return to growth in Q3 , ” said Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at CIBC World Markets .
Whether the worst is behind Canada has become a focal point of the federal election , which has made use of the R-word contentious .
Two quarters of negative growth is considered a technical recession , but economists judge an actual recession by the length , depth and breadth of weakness . Given that the unemployment rate has remained steady and wages continue to grow , most economists say Canada is not currently experiencing what would be seen as a true recession .
Most of the damage in the second quarter can be blamed on declines in both business spending ( which plunged at an annual rate of 12 per cent ) and inventory accumulation . The declines did not catch economists off guard , however , given the collapse in oil prices and spending cuts in the energy sector had foreshadowed the drops .
The declines were offset , however , by strong gains in consumer spending , the housing market and government spending . When looking at the non-energy portion of gross domestic product — roughly 90 per cent of the economy — GDP actually expanded by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter , with 17 of 20 industries reporting higher output in June alone .
Those readings lend support to the idea that the so-called technical recession is likely in the rearview mirror , said Stéfane Marion , chief economist for National Bank of Canada .
“ So far , industrial production is the only sector that has seen a significant decline in activity in Canada , ” he said . “ We need to see economic weakness spread to the service sector to confirm the end of the economic expansion . ”
Dana Peterson , economist at Citi , notes that while the June data is encouraging , the Canadian economy faces a number of obstacles that do n't guarantee a third quarter rebound .
“ Downside risks related to an extended period of low oil prices ( oil prices declined again in Q3 ) , slowing Chinese growth , and financial market volatility are intensifying , which could thwart a Canadian revival [ in the second half ] , ” she said .
And while consumers helped prop up the economy in the second quarter , with spending rising 2.3 per cent , they did so while drawing down their savings — the savings rate declined from 5.2 per cent to four per cent during the period . Real disposable incomes also dropped by 2.9 per cent .
“ For consumption spending to maintain the pace of growth in the second half , the labour market will have to remain resilient , ” said Krishen Rangasamy , senior economist at National Bank Financial .
This week will see the release of further data from Statistics Canada which will help paint a clearer picture of where the economy is heading . July trade figures are set to be released on Thursday , while the employment report for August will be released on Friday .
The data comes ahead of the Bank of Canada 's interest rate announcement next week . The central bank has already cut its benchmark rate twice this year , from 1 per cent at the start of the year to 50 basis points after the latest cut in July .
Markets are not pricing in a high chance that the Bank of Canada will trim its rate again next week , with Peterson of Citi noting that bets have declined with the better-than-expected Q2 reading .
Charles St-Arnaud , economist at Nomura , said the GDP figures should add confidence to the bank 's view that the Canadian economy rebounded in the third quarter following a disappointing first half of the year .
“ Today 's number is in line with what the Bank of Canada ( BoC ) expected in the July MPR , and we do not believe that it materially changes the BoC 's view of the economy , ” he said . “ We continue to expect that the BoC will leave its policy rate unchanged at next week 's meeting . ”
On Wednesday afternoon in Seoul , two players faced off in a game of Go - one of civilisation 's oldest board games . But this game was different to the billions played in the game 's 3,000-year history .
For the first time ever , a computer program beat the world champion at the strategy game at which previously only humans excelled .
Lee Se-dol , a 33-year-old South Korean legend of Go , has lost two of five matches against the AlphaGo program , built by the Google-owned British company DeepMind . The first 3.5 hour game left even first-time viewers , like me , dumbstruck by its swift outcome , with commentators calling it a “ superb ” game that would be studied for years to come . AlphaGo won its second game the day after ( a victory that left Se-dol , who had originally said it would win one if it were lucky , speechless ) .
This is probably the first time you 've ever heard of Go - a fiendishly complex checkers-style game allegedly invented by a Chinese emperor to teach his son about political wiles . So why should we care ?
The Bulls made two transactions Friday , neither of them involving Nikola Mirotic .
The Bulls signed summer-league star Antonio Blakeney to a two-way contract , a new provision in the latest collective bargaining agreement that allows a team to let a player split time between the franchise 's NBA and Gatorade League teams .
The Bulls also claimed guard David Nwaba , whom the Lakers waived to create cap space to sign Kentavious Caldwell-Pope .
Both Blakeney and Nwaba are 6-foot-4 shooting guards and fit the organizational philosophy of trying to accumulate as many young assets as possible to see what pans out in this full rebuild .
Blakeney went undrafted after averaging 14.8 points over two seasons at LSU , including one with 2016 No . 1 overall pick Ben Simmons . In averaging 16.8 points and five rebounds in the Bulls ' first four summer-league games , Blakeney displayed an ability to make big shots and get to the free-throw line .
Teams are allowed two two-way contracts in addition to their 15-man roster . Players can spend up to 45 days with the NBA club . Blakeney will spend the rest of his time with the Windy City Bulls , but his contract could be converted to an NBA deal at any time .
And , yes , it 's called the `` G-League '' now that Gatorade is sponsoring what previously had been the Development League or D-League .
Nwaba 's $ 1.3 million deal only becomes guaranteed if he 's on the roster Jan. 10 . He would be a restricted free agent next summer if he sticks .
A possessor of a 7-foot wingspan , Nwaba played in 20 games last season with two starts after the Lakers liked him at a G-League tryout camp . His nickname is `` Mr. Dunk , '' and he also is known for aggressive defense . Nwaba averaged 6.0 points and 3.2 rebounds in 19.9 minutes .
As for Mirotic , the Bulls ' approach of waiting out the restricted-free-agent market has worked to this point . According to a league source , Mirotic 's camp sought an annual salary near $ 16 million before free agency began .
The Bulls consistently have said publicly they want to retain the fourth-year forward . But it 's clear they 're trying to make Mirotic sign an offer sheet with another team if he wants a salary higher than what the Bulls have slotted for him .
If Mirotic does n't sign an offer sheet , it 's possible he could play next season on his $ 7.2 million qualifying offer and re-enter free agency unrestricted next summer .
Brady Heslip scored 28 points , including eight 3-pointers , as the Bulls closed their 2-3 summer campaign with a 99-82 victory over the 76ers . Denzel Valentine added 21 points .
The Bulls played without Blakeney , who sat with a sinus infection , and Lauri Markkanen , out his second straight game with a big left toe contusion .

Crediting the Republican tax plan , Fifth Third Bank said Wednesday it would boost the minimum pay for its employees to $ 15 per hour .
Congressional passage of the $ 1.5 trillion tax cut this week allowed the regional bank to re-evaluate its pay structure , Fifth Third officials said .
The pay increase will affect 3,000 hourly workers – one-out-of-six Fifth Third employees . About 13,500 workers or three-quarters of the bank 's payroll will also receive a one-time $ 1,000 bonus . It will be distributed by the end of the year , assuming President Trump signs the bill before Christmas .
Senior managers and executive leadership are excluded from the compensation .
“ We want to invest in our most important asset – our people , ” Fifth Third CEO Greg Carmichael said . “ Our employees drive our reputation , our business and our success . ”
Carmichael said the higher wage is an important step to help support individuals , their families and the communities in which the bank operates .

Alberta 's NDP government is taking the reins back from yet another arm's-length regulatory board set up by the Progressive Conservatives .
This time , they 're targeting the controversial Alberta Motor Vehicle Industry Council ( AMVIC ) , which licenses and regulates auto dealers and repair shops , and investigates consumer complaints .
The NDP introduced a bill Wednesday that would increase the power of government over that regulator , a move they hope will give the agency more teeth .
John Bachinski is executive director of AMVIC . ( CBC ) The legislation would give the minister of Service Alberta power to issue orders related to reviews of the agency 's conduct , to dismiss board members or employees if those orders are n't followed , and appoint a representative to oversee management of the organization of its compensation fund .
`` In these tough economic times , Albertans need to be protected , '' said Stephanie McLean , the minister of Service Alberta . `` They need to know that the purchases they make are good , sound deals . ''
Problem history
AMVIC has faced numerous complaints over the past several years about how the organization is run . Two examples come from a review in 2014 , which found evidence of inappropriate interference with consumer investigations , and dysfunction in management ranks .
The review made 16 recommendations for changes , including that `` action be taken forthwith '' to deal with the high turnover rate among employees . At that time , the attrition rate over eighteen months was 70 per cent .
AMVIC has also been accused of negligence and faces a class-action lawsuit , which is ongoing .
`` The previous government , despite being confronted with these issues , did nothing , '' said McLean .
`` These amendments are crucial . ''
Rising to meet the standard
Denis Ducharme was the PC MLA who introduced the original fair trade act , which created the arm's-length AMVIC in 1999 .
Ducharme 's family owns a Ford car dealership that has operated in Bonnyville since 1959 . After he decided not to seek re-election in 2006 , he became president of the Motor Dealers Association of Alberta .
`` When the bill was introduced , I do not recall if there was any reason to purposefully omit the government 's oversight provisions in the legislation , '' said Ducharme . `` And today 's amendments correct that unintended omission .
`` It 's no different than what occurs in all the other government-delegated organizations . ''
The changes come shortly after similar power shifts at other government-appointed boards .
Health Minister Sarah Hoffman has taken a stronger role in directing Alberta Health Services . And Environment Minister Shannon Phillips dissolved the independent regulator , Alberta Environmental Monitoring , Evaluation and Reporting Agency , created two years ago by the PCs .
The income tax raids on many people associated with the film industry continued even on Thursday . While actors Vijay , Samantha and Nayanthara were under the IT net , so were the producers of Puli Shibu Thameens and PT Selvakumar . Film financiers Madurai Anbu and Ramesh were also a target of IT officials .
Now , a report in The Hindu states that actors Vijay , Samantha and Nayanthara have evaded tax to the tune of nearly Rs 25 crore . IT officials have also recovered cash of Rs 2 crore and gold worth Rs 2 crore . The report adds that IT officials state that all the actors have paid tax , but not fully . Vijay has reportedly not paid tax fully for nearly five years now .
Meanwhile , Vijay 's film Puli opened to mixed reviews today . The release of the movie was delayed due to the IT raids and compounded financial issues to release the KDM in theatres around the world . Morning shows were cancelled in Tamil Nadu and the Telugu version of the film did not release today . The premieres abroad were also cancelled on Wednesday , but the film released today .
Slacker has surprised everyone here in making it to the final round of Epic App Battles of Android . I think that even the folks at Slacker were surprised . With only 2 votes in our reader poll , I think that it 's safe to say that Slacker is the underdog in the competition .
Google Play Music , however , comes into the competition at the top spot in our reader poll with 54 % of the votes . It 's no wonder that it 's made it this far . So without further ado…
In the green corner , we have Google Play Music , launched in 2011 , with over 500m downloads and a user rating of 3.9 .
In the black corner , we have Slacker , launched in 2006 , with over 10m Downloads and a user rating of 4.2 .
Who will win in this Epic App Battles of Android ?
Round 1 : App design
Google Play Music uses Android 's material design . If they did n't we 'd be shocked . It 's Google after all . That makes for a very familiar interface that does n't require you to spend any more time trying to find your way around than you need to . When you first open the app , you 'll be greeted by the exact same interface found on their web portal , just resized for smaller screens . This makes it very easy to transition from the app to the web portal and vice versa . The color scheme is very light and clean . Personally I like the darker color scheme of Slacker better . It would be nice if Google would give the consumer a couple of themes to choose from .
When you first open the app you are greeted by some automatically generated playlists . This is a feature that they brought in from their Songza acquisition last year . Songza 's streaming service , of course , still exists . In fact , it went head to head with Spotify last week . Even though it lost the battle , its automatic playlist feature is pretty cool and it really helps Google Play find you some music that you want to listen to quickly .
Right below the playlists are the recently listened to stations .
Rating : 8.9
Slacker takes a completely different approach to their UI from Google , but they have a similar feel in the way that you navigate through the app . This is important because Google has a very easy to use interface and so does Slacker . However , Slacker 's UI takes that familiar UI and adds lots and lots of eye candy . Most of the eye candy is n't any more functional than Google 's UI , but it is so much cooler to look at . To me , this is a huge wow factor .
The elements that differentiate Slacker 's design from that of Google 's are transitions , animations , and a darker color scheme . The color scheme is not as dark as Tidal 's or Amazon Prime Music 's UI . It 's a nice blend of dark and light . The transitions and animations are also very nice . One of the things that I love is that when you scroll downwards on the page , the headers shrink to make a little more viewing room on your screen .
Slacker has done a great job branding the app . Instead of using Material Design , they took the elements that made sense and combined them with their own unique UI to make a great user experience . From the buttons to transitions to animations this app has by far is the best-designed app of the bunch , If we were to stop the battle here , then Slacker would be declared the winner . However , we still have two more categories to grade .

Round 1 : App Design Score /10 Google Play 8.9 Slacker 9.3
Round 2 : Features
Google Play Music comes to the table with some pretty strong features . As I mentioned in previous Epic App Battles of Android , one of Google 's strongest features is its enormous catalog . With over 30 million songs to pick from , I was able to find the most obscure music that I could think of . I even found a relatively unknown Salvadoran band called R.E.D.D .. They are very well known in El Salvador , but not so much in the rest of the world . Every song and every artist I looked for , I found . To me , that is a huge benefit of a streaming music app .
Another nice feature of the paid version was that when you listen to a song that has a music video on Youtube , there will be the option to watch the music video . This is more of a novelty than anything . I usually listen to music while I am otherwise occupied with another task , which makes it difficult to enjoy this feature . It 's more of a cool feature to show your friends . Also , the video does n't open up in the native Youtube app , where you could cast it to your TV . It instead opens in a player within the app . To be fair , you can still open the video in the Youtube app , but it 's not intuitive . Slacker does not feature music videos
Chromecast support is another feature that you 'll find on Google Play . If you want to play your music on your television , you can with the Chromecast . Technically if you have Youtube on your TV or other streaming device , you can open the video in the Youtube app and cast the music video to other non-Chromcast devices .
One of the best features of Google Play is that you can upload 50,000 songs from your own music library . You do n't need to subscribe to the premium service to enjoy this feature either .
Another feature that Google Play has is the ability to filter explicit results from radio stations . As a father of 3 children , this is especially important to me .

Slacker has a relatively small catalog of 12 million songs when compared to Google Play 's 30 million song databases . Do n't get me wrong 12 million songs are nothing to scoff at , it 's just that Google has more than twice the available music .
It seems that Slacker is aware of their shortcomings and offer several unique features not found on other services . For one , Slacker offers over 300 expert-curated radio stations . For another , many of their radio stations are DJ'ed by professional DJ 's . This gives you more of a traditional radio feel without the commercials , provided you are paying for Slacker premium . Another option that they have is to interject your music with headline news and sports updates from ESPN . Again , this gives Slacker a more traditional radio feel . The best part is that if you change your mind and want to listen to the next song , you can skip the spoken word and move to the next song . This may or may not be a benefit to you , based on your tastes , but it 's there if you want it .
Slacker like Google Play offers a block for explicit content and Chromecast support .

Round 3 : Price
Google Play Music offers both paid and free tiers . The free version is essentially Songza with Google 's UI . You get unlimited ad-supported music streaming with 6 skips per hour . Chromecast support is included .
The paid subscription will give you offline play , unlimited skips , and no ads . You can watch music videos for many of the songs , as well as play specific songs and albums . It costs $ 9.99/month and you get a free 30-day trial .

Slacker has 3 pricing tiers . They have a free tier and like Google 's free tier , you can not listen to specific songs , but you can select from preset radio stations . You get 6 skips per hour . Their second tier is Radio Plus . This is basically the same as the first tier , except you get unlimited skips , no ads , and offline listening . The cost is $ 3.99/month if paid on a yearly basis or $ 4.99/month if paid monthly . Their premium tier gives you everything from the first two tiers , with the additional of custom playlists and the ability to listen to specific songs and albums . The cost is $ 9.99/month . They offer a 7-day trial .

Summary
With 45 % of the popular vote in our user poll , Google came into this Epic App Battles of Android as the crowd favorite . It would seem that their preference was not without merit . However , Slacker came into the battles with the best UI of all our contenders . They also had some killer features and flexible pricing plans .
Slacker really was the underdog in this fight . They surprised everybody by taking out Pandora and Spotify , two of the largest juggernauts in the competition . In the end , it was n't quite enough to take the title .
Googles massive music catalog was really the deciding factor here , but Slacker went the distance . This was the first Rocky vs. Apollo Creed fight of app battles . Slacker went the distance and the final result came down to the score card .

ANALYSIS/OPINION :
Hillary Clinton clinching the Democratic Party nomination is n't a victory for women , it 's a betrayal .
As a former leader within the American feminist establishment I cringe every time I realize that someone as corrupt and incompetent as Hillary Clinton filched this milestone from the nation .
Courtesy of Mrs. Clinton , we are now saddled with something truly historic : the first time an American political party has nominated a person under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Moreover , two days after that nomination and on the very day President Barack Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton , the White House itself confirmed the DOJ examination into her use of a private server was , in fact , a “ criminal ” investigation .
But those are n't the only historical firsts for Mrs. Clinton . She is also the only nominee in history to have a former staff person , the IT person who set up and managed her homebrew computer servers , plead the 5th Amendment out of fear discussing his work for her could lead to criminal prosecution .
When Mrs. Clinton won the New Jersey and California primaries on June 7 , she officially hoovered up the necessary delegates for the nomination , and the legacy media made sure to hector everyone . On MSNBC we were told we should pause in awe of the accomplishment . Guest Maria Shriver agreed ,
“ I hope we pause not only to think about how this is historic and unprecedented for her , for women , but about all the people that made this moment possible , all the women who went before her , all the women whose shoulders she stands on… ”
As a newsflash for Ms. Shriver , those on whose shoulders Hillary stands includes Russia . After presenting them a much-ballyhooed “ reset , ” her new friend annexed Crimea , went to war with Ukraine , threatens NATO , and harasses NATO nations . Russia also became the power-broker in the Middle East , filling the power vacuum Mrs. Hillary 's State Department left behind .
Then there 's ISIS , which needed a safe , ungoverned space within which to grow , and Hillary gave them Libya . For some reason , emboldened terrorists then thought they could attack an American consulate in Benghazi , murdering our ambassador and 3 others , with no repercussions . And they were right .
Then there are the shoulders of Bryan Pagliano , Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills , a gaggle of Clinton aides who are the enablers of a secretary of State so paranoid , controlling and careless that she decides to set up a completely autonomous ( and unsecured ) email server system with which to conduct federal business .
The latest on the email server debacle ? The Associated Press is reporting Mrs. Clinton 's exposed emails could have revealed the names of CIA agents . The Wall Street Journal is also now reporting Clinton homebrew emails dealt with CIA drone strikes in Pakistan .
Russia . ISIS . Benghazi . Collapse of the Middle East . Genocide of Christians . 250,000 people dead in Syria , a refugee crisis on the scale of World War II , and the inexplicable decision to set up an email server that is likely still compromising national security . Big , bloody , disastrous shoulders , indeed .
Knowing her history will forever be established as what ‘ the woman ' brought to the table , any woman with this track record , who truly wants women and girls to be inspired and proud , would never have run for president .
For trailblazers the responsibility is n't just the act of winning ; it comes with the additional requirement of a moral grasp of the standard this person creates as “ the first . ”
It is an obscene turn of events that the first woman nominated for the presidency is a person so morally bankrupt she lied to the families of the Benghazi fallen , as she stood next to the caskets of the dead and their loved ones .
Mrs. Clinton is so devoid of conscience she claims her nomination is a victory for all women as she brings to the table a history of lies , abandonment , failure and excuses . Yet , she believes she deserves a promotion because… Woman .
I also want a woman in the White House , and we 'll get one , and most of us know we 'll get one , but it does n't have to be Monica 's ex-boyfriend 's wife .
I also know that woman had better know what she 's doing and do it well . Unlike Hillary , who is insisting that she as a woman can do whatever a male president can do , but continues to say she 'll put her husband in charge of the economy “ because he knows how to do it . ”
Hillary Clinton represents everything that is wrong with the leftist American feminist movement and our disconnected and corrupt political system . She 's a favorite of the establishment because she 'll protect the bureaucracy 's secrets and continue with the expected wealth and power distribution amongst the members of their private power club .
Hillary Clinton may be the first women nominee by a major party , but there 's still time to make sure she does not become the first woman president . Why ? Because little girls , women , and the men who love them all deserve a trailblazer they can be proud of .

Fighting and heavy casualties are setback for government efforts to forge nationwide ceasefire and end patchwork of insurgencies
YANGON , Feb 13 ( Reuters ) - Forty-seven Myanmar soldiers have been killed this week in fighting with ethnic minority insurgents near the border with China , the military said in a statement issued on Friday .
The fighting and heavy casualties are a setback for government efforts to forge a nationwide ceasefire and end a patchwork of insurgencies that have bedeviled Myanmar since shortly after its independence in 1948 .
The clashes in Shan State in the northeast between the army and a group called the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army ( MNDAA ) have alarmed China which fears an influx of villagers fleeing violence and called this week for peace on the border .
The military said 73 soldiers were wounded in clashes from Monday to Thursday .
It gave no more details of the fighting but the state-backed Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported on Thursday that the military had carried out five air strikes against the rebels .
Officials from the MNDAA were not available for comment .
Myanmar 's reformist , semi-civilian government , which took power after 49 years of military rule , wants to implement a nationwide ceasefire agreement with all rebel factions .
The government has struck truces with almost all of the groups but clashes do occasionally flare up .
An official in an alliance of ethnic minority factions which has been discussing the nationwide ceasefire with the military said the clashes near the Chinese border did not bode well for the talks .
`` Because of the fighting , negotiations will have some difficulty , '' said Nai Hong Sar , vice chairman of the United Nationalities Federal Council , which represents 11 minority factions .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China supported efforts to resolve their dispute peacefully so that the refugees could return to Myanmar as soon as possible .
`` We hope that all sides in Myanmar can work hard with China to quieten down the situation and return the border as soon as possible to peace and tranquility so these border people can go home , '' she told a daily news briefing .
The MNDAA was formerly part of the Communist Party of Burma , a powerful China-backed guerrilla force that battled the Myanmar government until the group splintered in 1989 .
Fighting between the rebels and the army in 2009 pushed tens of thousands of refugees into southwestern China , angering the government in Beijing . ( Reporting by Aung Hla Tun ; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING ; Editing by Jared Ferrie and Robert Birsel )

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) — When Alex Balinski prepared for his Mormon mission to Argentina five years ago , he went to the library and rented a few documentaries to learn more about the South American county where he would be spending the next two years .
Today 's young Mormons like 18-year-old Jake Townsend , however , are much more likely to pull out their iPads or laptops and scour the web to learn about their mission countries .
That 's why Balinski , a 23-year-old student at Brigham Young University in Provo , Utah , has spent the last eight months creating a website that serves as a database of YouTube videos about the food , history and traditions of many of the countries where Mormon missionaries serve .
The website , www.preparetoserve.com , features nearly 10,000 videos about 85 countries and 34 American states , Balinski said . Most of the videos are existing ones he found on YouTube that have been indexed within the site . About 1,300 of the videos are based on interviews Balinski has done with returned missionaries .
`` When it comes to understanding the country , the people , the place and the food , I think there is a need there that can be filled , '' Balinski said .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has its own website for missionaries , and sends men and women first to special training centers where they learn languages and prepare spiritually for missions that are considered a rite of passage for many Mormons . Men serve two years while women go for 18 months .
Balinski does n't want to interfere with that training , and got the blessing from a local church leader to move forward with the site , which is not an official church site . He believes his website supplements that preparation by helping missionaries better understand the cultures they 'll be living in . Each video has been screened to make sure they are appropriate for young missionaries . Beach scenes , for instance , are edited out , he said .
Townsend , of Draper , Utah , is going on a mission to Saltillo , Mexico , and found the videos about Mexican culture and traditions quite helpful .
`` I 've grown up around the church , but the members there are probably different than the members of church here , '' Townsend said of Mexico . `` It 's cool to know some of the differences . ''
The website is hitting its stride just as the Mormon church sends out more missionaries than at any time in its history .
Within weeks of Balinski quitting his job last fall and deciding to go all in on the website , LDS church leaders made a surprise announcement that there were lowering the minimum age for missionaries from 21 to 19 for women and from 19 to 18 for men .
That led to a surge in mission applications as new , younger missionaries joined older missionaries already planning to go . The 70,000 young men and women serving missions now is a record . Church officials say there will be 85,000 by the end of the year . The previous record total of missionaries at one time was 61,600 in 2002 , church figures show .
`` The timing could not have been better , '' Balinski said .
More recently , the church leaders announced that missionaries will do less door-to-door proselytizing , and instead , use the Internet to recruit new church members .
Balinski said his website is mainly geared to helping missionaries and their families before they leave , but said he 'd be ecstatic if church officials allowed missionaries to view the site while serving .
For now , he 's just working about six hours a day to improve the site by adding more videos . His goal is to make website profitable enough to serve as his main job .
He pulls in about $ 600 a month from businesses who pay to have their ads on the website , which gets about 200-300 visits a day .
He weaves the work in alongside his final college internship and his responsibilities to his wife , Rebecca , and 10-month old son , Nephi . His wife served a mission in the Philippines .
`` We are both very passionate about missionary work , '' Balinski said . `` We 'd like to help missionaries get more excited than they 've been before and help them learn everything they can . ''
As Kanye West looks to expand on his artistic endeavors within different realms , snippets of information have begun to surface that indicates a new project releasing on March 20 . A mysterious website “ www.772233688.com ” has been found , which does n't give much away except a static video and some text that reads “ KANYE WEST , ” “ NASA , ” “ PROJECT 10 ” and “ MARCH 20. ” MTV reported a package being delivered to its office with some cryptic contents that included a VHS tape with a label reading “ E PLURIBUS UNUM ” and a white card , which can be seen below .
A quick input of the numbers “ 772233688 ” on an older phone pad yields the words “ SPACED OUT , ” while a music release would in fact be Kanye 's 10th album ( if you counted Watch The Throne and Cruel Summer ) , hence “ PROJECT 10. ” However , MTV was also told by Def Jam representatives that it 's most likely a hoax at this point and they know nothing about it , but the speculation still continues when looking back at the artist 's surprise releases throughout the years .
Stay tuned for any further updates and let us know what you think it means in the comments section .
What an exciting week !
I have been very busy , dealing with taxes , doing business type stuff , polishing up the February update , and get settled into a nice marketing groove .
Suddenly , I get a message , telling me an article that was started way back in November would be going live . To be honest , I had forgotten about the article . So many times have I given a statement or talked to someone from the media , only to never hear from them again .
It seems this time , it would be different . And different it was .
This is the most well researched , well written article , I have ever seen about a video game , never the less about MAV . Sure , the first 75 % of it is about Chromehounds , but that 's really where the MAV story starts . It 's only appropriate .
The article does a very good job of covering the whole story of MAV , even the dark times , and presenting it in a good light . I highly recommend reading it when you can .
Of course the first thing I did when seeing the article was to tweet it to Angry Joe 🙂
Overall , the article seems to be very well received ! Even Reddit likes it 🙂
In other marketing related news , we have started to compile a list of twitch streamers that have either expressed interest in streaming MAV or stream games like MAV .
We just want to show these streams some support , carefully mention that MAV might be a good fit for them , and let them make a choice on that . So far they have been very receptive to streaming MAV once they see the support that the game has !
Streamers seem much more open to trying new games , even games they might be bad at , as it provides a great interaction with the viewers of the stream .
If you find a streamer that is streaming MAV or wants to , please let me know ! I want to promote them on Twitter , facebook , emails , anything I can to ensure they are successful with their streams !
That 's all for this week ! Have a lovely Valentines day [ do n't make it too hot ! ] and I will see you next week ! 🙂
A Painful Topic prefix = o /
by Kali Munro , M.Ed. , Psychotherapist , 2000
Sexual abuse perpetrated by mothers on their daughters is an uncomfortable subject for many people . It defies everything we believe , or want to believe , about women and mothers . Most people do n't want to believe that female perpetrators of sexual abuse exist , and certainly do n't want to believe that a mother could sexually abuse her own children . While mothers sexually abuse their sons as well , in this article I focus on the impact on daughters .
Sexist Views About Women and Mothers
Most of us are raised to view women as being very different than men - to view them almost as opposites . Some people ca n't even imagine women doing the same things that men do , or being anything like men . Even when cultures view women to be strong , capable , and competent most continue to view women as inherently different than men because of their child-bearing abilities . Many character traits are presumed to be true about women because of their ability to bear children - women are believed to be more caring , sensitive , nurturing , and maternal than men . The reality that there are female perpetrators of sexual abuse , particularly mothers , is a fact that many people are not willing to believe . This view of mothers , and even of all women , runs very deep in most cultures , and is linked with another assumption - that all women ( and particularly mothers ) are naturally heterosexual .
Heterosexism and Homophobia
Sexual abuse has nothing to do with the perpetrator 's sexuality or sexual identity ; many same-sex abusers identify as heterosexual . Many people confuse sexual abuse with sex , but sexual abuse is not sex . Yet because of homophobia , same-sex sexual abuse is linked , in many people 's minds , with lesbian or gay sex . How often do we see in the newspapers exclaiming `` lesbian sex abuser '' but not `` heterosexual sex abuser ? '' It is an ingrained association -- same-sex abuse equals same-sex sexual orientation .
This mistaken association is important to examine for many reasons . That the perpetrator is perceived to be lesbian fuels many people 's denial . Mothers ca n't be lesbian , the thinking goes , therefore the abuse could n't have happened . On the other hand , some people may be more likely to believe that the abuse happened , precisely because they perceive the perpetrator to be lesbian . It confirms their belief that lesbians are child molestors . When this occurs people are far more outraged than they are with father-daughter sexual abuse because a female perpetrator of incest has violated the social expectations of women and mothers . Sadly , this reaction also points to how little we expect of fathers .
How People View Mother-Daughter Sexual Abuse
People tend to feel far more conflicted and confused about mother-daughter sexual abuse - or female perpetrators generally - than they are about father-daughter sexual abuse ( or male perpetrators ) . People respond with outright denial : `` A mother would n't do that sort of thing . '' Others minimize the abuse : `` How bad could it be ? The abuser was a woman ; she was probably gentle . '' And still others vilify female perpetrators , viewing them as worse than male perpetrators because they are women or mothers .
Some people try to explain away the behavior of female perpetrators by pointing to the history of sexual abuse that they have undergone . Having been sexual abused is one factor that can contribute to a mother abusing her own daughter ( although there are plenty of survivors who do not sexually abuse children ) - and it is possibly one of the more important factors that might lead female perpetrators to sexually abuse their children because they , unlike men , are n't socially conditioned to be sexually aggressive , or to sexualize children . However , this argument should not be used to minimize the responsibility of female perpetrators nor the devastating effects of this form of abuse .
It is not uncommon when female perpetrators are discussed , the tone is often distinctly softer and more sympathetic than when male perpetrators are discussed . This misplaced sexist sympathy for female perpetrators minimizes the effects of the abuse that a survivor went through and denies a survivor 's reality of the trauma . In addition , when survivors are aware of this attitude , and many are , it can make it even harder for them to take their own abuse , and the effects of that abuse seriously .
Survivors of Mother-Daughter Sexual Abuse
Imagine how a survivor of mother-daughter sexual abuse feels , when the general population who has not undergone this trauma feels this confused and conflicted about it . Survivors tend to be very confused and conflicted about the abuse and their mothers , especially when , as usually is the case , their mothers were their primary care givers . They may have a lot invested in not acknowledging that the abuse happened - both because of their own beliefs about mothers ( never mind the emotional trauma of acknowledging the abuse ) , and because of the often rigid assumptions made by others about mothers .
When survivors of mother-daughter incest are able to acknowledge the abuse they experienced , they often believe that there must be something terribly wrong or bad about them . `` How could my own mother sexually abuse me ? '' This belief that they are bad comes from the myth that mothers are intrinsically caring and loving . If all mothers are loving to their children , the thinking goes , then there must be something really bad about the child whose mother abused them . It makes sense that a child would think this way , especially in a context loaded with societal myths about mothers . It 's easier for a child to believe that the abuse is her fault than to admit that the person who was supposed to love and protect her actually harmed her . Sadly , this way of thinking is carried into adulthood by many survivors , and it hurts them a great deal .
That Which Has No Name
It is very difficult for even survivors themselves to acknowledge that they were abused by their mothers because of the sexist beliefs many of us hold about women , and particularly mothers . It can be a great struggle to label their experience as abuse . Survivors may not have words to describe what happened ; they may not know what to call it . They may fear that the incest was lesbian sex ; something `` dirty '' - not to be talked about or admitted . They may be afraid of being perceived as lesbian , or afraid that the abuse makes them lesbian . Survivors who are lesbian may fear that their sexuality was caused by the abuse .
It is also difficult for survivors to acknowledge their abuse because there are very few places that survivors can hear or read about mother-daughter incest , or even about female perpetrators . Sexual abuse and incest have become almost synonymous with male sexual abuse of females and father-daughter incest . It is within this vacuum that survivors of mother-daughter incest struggle to make sense of and understand their experience .
Homophobic Beliefs - One Effect of The Abuse
Many people confuse same-sex sexual abuse with lesbian sex , thinking that the perpetrator and even the victim is lesbian , or was made lesbian by the abuse . None of this is true . Yet these myths continue to exist , and they confuse and haunt many survivors who live in fear and shame that they really are lesbian when they are n't , or that their lesbian sexuality was caused by the abuse .
Being abused by her mother does not make a survivor a lesbian . Even if the survivor 's body physiologically responded to the sexual stimulation , this has nothing to do with sexuality . It is the body 's natural physiological response to stimulation , and has nothing to do with the survivor 's own sexual desires , or even consent . Sexual abuse effects a survivor 's comfort level with and responses to being a sexual person , but it does not cause her sexuality .
Identifying With Mother Perpetrators
Even when survivors acknowledge that they were sexually abused by their mothers , they often strongly identify with their mothers . Just both of them being female in a sexist society can lead to identification with the mother . This identification with the perpetrator can make it more difficult for survivors to separate themselves , emotionally and otherwise , from their abuser .
Many daughters look to their mothers as a mirror for their future lives . Survivors of mother-daughter sexual abuse often see their future as a woman and mother as dismal . Many adult survivors painfully worry that they will sexually abuse children , that they are unsafe around children , or that they are potential perpetrators - just like their mothers . This may lead survivors to feel that they are untrustworthy , thus many survivors are reluctant to have children of their own ( although the choice to not have children can be a perfectly healthy choice on its own . )
Are They Victims Or Are They Abusers ?
Daughters , and thus many survivors , often look to their mother 's experiences ( in the home and with their fathers ) as their future , and identify with their mother 's situation . If their mother is in an upsetting situation , survivors will often feel empathy for their mothers , and want to help them . This is heightened for survivors whose mothers turn to them for support .
If the perpetrator views herself as a victim of circumstances , or is a victim of her husband , the survivor often feels sorry for her and fears losing her . This dynamic makes it very hard for the daughter to see her mother as an abuser . Many of us tend to see people in extreme categories - either victim or abuser . For children , this either-or-thinking is the norm , but for survivors it often remains with them and becomes entrenched . The truth is that people can be both - victims in one context , and abusers in another .
`` I Feel Like I Am My Mother ''
The more a survivor identifies with her mother , the harder it is to separate her identity from her abuser - a crucial step in healing . Many survivors of mother-daughter incest report looking in the mirror and seeing their mothers , and hating themselves for it . When they see their own body naked ( which they may avoid doing ) , many survivors see their mother 's body , and as a result feel deeply ashamed of and angry at their bodies . Some survivors respond to these feelings by not wanting to be women , or lesbian ( as they may perceive their mother to be ) , or anything associated with women or lesbians .
The feelings of shame and self-hatred that survivors can have may lead to their feeling uncomfortable with and/or hatred toward women and lesbians ; inadequate and bad about themselves ; confused and ashamed about being women ; uncomfortable with their sexuality ; engaging in self-injurious behavior ( particularly in the genital and breast area ) ; developing an eating disorder ; experiencing body-shame ; and having difficulties in relationships , particularly with other women .
It is crucial for survivors of mother-daughter sexual abuse to create boundaries with their mothers ( physical , emotional , intellectual , and spiritual ) ; to re-claim their bodies as their own , and to truly know the differences between themselves and their mothers .
Longing for a Mother 's Love
Mother-daughter sexual abuse wounds survivors ' hearts and souls . Their mothers were often their only care-givers and the only source of much-needed care . When this care is mixed with sexual abuse , the effects are devastating . This mixture of nurturance ( if there was any ) and sexual abuse may have been all the parenting a survivor received . Often the father was absent or simply did not take an active role in parenting . This mixture of caring and sexual abuse leaves survivors with an unpleasant , and often sickening or repulsive feeling . On the one hand , the survivor desperately needed to be loved , held , kissed , and nurtured , but when that nurturance comes with such a high price , it is devastating to the child 's psyche . Even nurturance that is offered separate from the sexual abuse becomes hard to trust or to take in freely and openly . This leaves many survivors feeling a desperate need for love , and at the same time , highly conflicted about that need , and wary of those , particularly women who offer support . The grief connected to not receiving safe love from a mother or primary caregiver is profound .
Summary of the Effects of Mother-Daughter Sexual Abuse
While survivors of mother-daughter sexual abuse experience many of the same effects as other incest and sexual abuse survivors , they tend to have heightened difficulties with :
Naming their experience as abuse .
This is particularly true in light of the myth that women do not sexually abuse children .
Identity .
Many survivors have difficulty knowing that they are separate from and different than their perpetrators .
Boundaries .
Many survivors have difficulty maintaining their boundaries , especially with other women . They may be overly flexible or overly rigid .
Self-blame .
This is particularly true in light of the fact that they were abused by their mothers who are mythologized as all loving and caring .
Gender identity .
Many survivors do not want to be a woman , have trouble identifying as women , or do not like what they perceive women to be , because the abuser was a woman .
Gender shame .
Many survivors feel great shame about being a woman because of their identification with the perpetrator .
Body-shame .
Survivors often feel great shame about their bodies , particularly their bodies ' womanliness , because the perpetrator had a woman 's body .
Homophobic fears about one 's actual or perceived sexuality .
Survivors are often very confused about the differences between sexual abuse and lesbian sexuality , and may believe the myth that abuse causes a survivor 's sexuality .
Longing to be loved .
Survivors frequently have a profound need to be loved in the way that they were not as a child , and they may fear or be unable to accept it , particularly from other women .
Final Thoughts
Abuse is never pleasant . However , mother-daughter sexual abuse seems to provoke particularly strong reactions in people , even those working in the area of trauma . Sometimes , when mother-daughter sexual abuse is acknowledged , people feel the need to say that it does n't happen as frequently as father-daughter sexual abuse , or that women are n't as violent as men . Even if those things are true , it is not helpful information when listening to and understanding women who have been sexually abused by their mothers ( or other women ) . If we want to create a safe environment for women to speak about their experiences , we need to talk and write about the fact that women and mothers do sexually abuse children . Only in that environment will survivors be truly free to tell their stories and heal themselves .

CHAPEL HILL , N.C. ( MarketWatch ) — Few paid attention a couple of weeks ago when the government announced that corporate profitability had declined markedly last quarter .
Yet future historians may eventually look back and pinpoint that report as the beginning of the end of this aging bull market .
That 's because the first-quarter 's decrease could signal the long-awaited return to historically average profitability levels . If so , the stock market will have to struggle mightily just to keep its head above water over the next five years .
Here 's the sobering data : According to the latest calculations of the U.S. Department of Commerce , corporate profits in the first quarter of this year represented 8.8 % of gross domestic product . That 's the lowest level in nearly four years , and represents a big drop from the 10 % -plus profitability that prevailed in the last quarter of 2013 .
Those who focus on corporate profitability have worried for some time that such a decline was imminent . That 's because , in the past , profit margins have exhibited a strong tendency to “ revert to the mean , ” according to James Montier , a member of the asset allocation team at Boston-based GMO . In other words , margins in the past have eventually declined whenever they rose significantly above their long-term average , and vice versa .
That long-term average is 6.3 % , according to the government 's data . Unless corporate profitability has reached some kind of permanently high plateau , the recent drop is just the beginning of a much bigger decline .
What would it mean for the stock market if profitability reverted to the historical mean ?
To calculate the consequences of a reversion to mean of corporate profitability , we must first make a few assumptions , as follows :
How long it takes for the mean reversion to be complete . I 'll assume five years , which is close to historical norms , according to Montier . He says that , whenever the profit margin in the past has risen to be at least 1 % above its mean , or fallen to be at least 1 % below , it was back at its mean in an average of 4.8 years .
How fast the economy grows over the next five years . I will assume there will be no recession , which is very generous . But I 'll do so in order to make my point . I 'll assume that nominal GDP will grow over the next five years at the same pace it has since the last recession — 4.1 % annualized .
Where the stock market 's price/earnings ratio will be in five years ' time . I will assume it stays at current levels , which once again is generous , since it is already above the long-term average today .
Once we make these assumptions , calculating the stock market 's return over the next five years becomes a matter of simple math . The picture is n't pretty : Its five-year return , annualized , is minus 2.8 % .
If so , the S & P 500 in the summer of 2019 would be trading at 1,703 .
In fact , given the data , coming up with a rosy outlook for the next five years is n't easy . If we assume that corporate profit margins stay constant , for example , then the stock market 's future growth will be the same as economic growth . That 's 4.1 % annualized on a nominal basis , given my generous assumptions .
Even a return to the record levels of corporate profitability above 10 % of GDP wo n't produce anything like historically average stock market returns over the next five years . The only way for that to happen is for corporate profits to take an even bigger share of GDP in the future .
While anything is possible , that seems unlikely , according to Robert Arnott , chairman of Research Affiliates . For that to happen , the share of national income going to workers would have to shrink . In that event , Arnott says , “ the backlash could be so widespread that it would turn Occupy Wall Street into a mainstream event . ”

According to KTLA , more than 30 federal , state and local law enforcement agencies and task forces , as well as the Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force , participated in the third annual “ Operation Reclaim and Rebuild ” enforcement operation , according to a sheriff 's news release .
The operation resulted in 474 arrests including 142 males on solicitation charges , and 36 males for pimping .
It is important to note that some of these arrests included people trying to simply pay another willing adult to have sex with them .
In the Land of the Free , it is against the law to get paid to have sex , unless that sex is filmed , distributed on DVD , and taxed . One of the least talked about systems of oppression in the US is that of persecuting prostitutes .
When referencing prostitution , it is critical to point out that we are talking about the mutually beneficial exchange of sexual favors for money by two or more consenting adults ; not forced human trafficking .
That being said , however , during the operation , officers rescued 28 children who were being sexually exploited and offered services to 27 adults they said were victims of sex trafficking . These victims were not part of a voluntary process and instead were bought and sold as commodities to sick individuals without their consent .
As corporate media writes off talk of ‘ pizzagate ' as if it 's some tinfoil conspiracy theory that could n't possibly happen , this scenario shatters their claims . In fact , Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell says the arrests represent a “ very sad commentary on the condition we 're dealing with . ”
“ Pretending this issue does n't exist only makes us more complicit in it , ” newly elected San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott said .
While it is currently unknown if any of these charges involve high-level government officials or law enforcement , the fact that it existed should not be ignored . Throughout the first and second weeks of December , since the mainstream media first reported that Edgar Maddison Welch , of Salisbury , N.C. , fired a shot inside the Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria in Washington , DC , the mainstream media has been declaring the so-called child-sex “ Pizzagate ” child-sex ring , a false conspiracy theory based on lies .
Welch was reportedly searching for child-sex slaves inside Comet Ping Pong based on stories he 'd read online involving pedophilia and the Washington elite . Ironically , and without any real investigative , Chris Hanson style journalism being conducted , the mainstream media and its pundits have declared all the claims found in the conspiracy theory to be false , lies constructed by “ fake news . ”
In fact , The Washington Post simply declared , “ None of them were true. ” That may , indeed , be the case . But if it can happen in California on such a large scale , it can certainly happen anywhere else in the United States , and all such claims must be investigated thoroughly by properly trained police officers with the tools necessary to uncover such deviant sex crimes involving children . We applaud the California authorities for their investigations of child-sex rings . May justice be swift to the sickos involved in exploiting children .

This is a jewel of a web app .
I may sound a little overzealous here but its primarily due to the fact that I 've been scouring my brain over recent weeks for a unique name for a small project I 'm working on , but to no avail , i 'm still struggling .
Within about 10 minutes of using wordoid , I 'd found the ‘ perfect ' name and I 'm delighted with it ( no , I 'm not sharing it here just yet : ] )
So how does wordoid make the magic happen ? Well , it gives you a number of awesome options to make finding that brand./product/URL a breeze .
Firstly , you can select from English , Spanish , French and Italian languages . Secondly , you can select whether you 'd like the word results to be completely random or based on a specific selection of letters placed at the start , middle or end .
Finally , you can also choose whether you 'd like the word to look natural , almost natural or hardly natural – a wonderful little feature .
“ I 'd like an example ” , you say ? Well , lets say I 'm looking for a word to include the word ‘ zee ' for a new site all about me . I select the language , English , I then select the fact that I 'd like the ‘ wordoid ' to include zee somewhere in there and , finally , I 'd like it to look almost natural .
Wordoid then does a quick search and in seconds produces page after pages of potentials , along with the uniqueness of the word and its .com availability . Marvellous , do n't you think ? This is bound to give brand naming companies a run for their money .
My one minor gripe with the product is it took me a few moments to establish where the search button was . After completing the form to the right of the page , you have to divert your eyes to the top left to actually search . Aside from that and a curiosity regarding its business model , it 's a wonderfully powerful little app .
Give it a try yourself , hours of fun .

During our recent 'Beyond The Edge ' Radio interview with JC Johnson , we briefly discussed a new investigation launched by the Crypto Four Corners crew The incident involved a family group and other residents living in a non-specific location in the vicinity of Gallup , New Mexico . According the witnesses , Bradford and Maria , a series of gunshots and heavy ground artillery could be heard and felt from the distance . Soon after , bright beams of light appeared from above their hogan . The lights were so bright that it illuminated the inside of the hogan through the windows and , incredibly , through tiny cracks in the walls and ceiling . The lights seemed to cause disorientation , but the witnesses were able to tell that the beams came from a honey-combed shaped array from a craft hovering above.The witnesses made their way towards the main house behind the hogan . As they were running , they noticed a saucer-shaped craft hovering over the house with multi-colored lights rotating around it . The beams were displaying from different directions from other nondescript craft . These craft were creating torrents of strong wind that literally pushed the pinon and juniper trees to the ground . The witnesses also noticed very small entities scurrying around the enclosed dogs ... suddenly causing the dogs to stop barking and rendered unconscious.At the same time , Bradford stated that his uncle was battling an entity at his house nearby . It became apparent that the uncle either incapacitated or killed the being.Bradford and other residents in the area started to confront the craft with personal firearms . At one point , Bradford was discharging his AK-47 at the craft when the weapon started to 'heat up ' ... to the point that Bradford had to set it down because it was becoming too hot to hold . He states that 'something ' from the craft directed itself onto the weapon.It is interesting to note that some of the elderly residents were yelling at the craft 'go back to the stars . 'Back in the house , the witnesses described hearing footsteps on the roof ... as well scampering outside on the ground . They were making desperate calls to 911 and local authorities.When the fire department and state police started to arrive , the craft started moving away . Someone from the fire department stated that 'they could see bright headlights on the roof ' as they made their way to the location . There were four state police cruisers on the scene ... as well as an individual in a black Cadillac Escalade SUV . The witness referred to this man as a 'universal soldier ' decked out in flack gear and armed to the teeth . This person never said a word , but it was obvious that the state police knew who he was ... and they were taking directions ( through hand signals ) from him as well.When this 'universal soldier ' overheard the witness statement describing his uncle 's encounter with one of the entities , he immediately made a beeline to the uncle 's residents . The SUV was driven to the uncle 's house ... and very soon something was carried out of the house and placed into an unknown vessel ( possibly cryogenic ) in the SUV.Not long after JC Johnson was contacted by Navajo Criminal Investigations in reference to the incident.At this point , the investigation is still ongoing . Any available updates will be posted in the future .

The Koch Brothers do n't actually run for office—at least not since David Koch 's amusingly ambitious 1980 bid for the vice presidency on a Libertarian Party ticket that proposed the gutting of corporate taxes , the minimum wage , occupational health and safety oversight , environmental protections and Social Security . Ad Policy
That project , while exceptionally well-funded for a third-party campaign , secured just 1.06 percent of the vote . The Kochs determined it would be easier to fund conservative campaigns than to pitch the program openly . Initially , the project was hampered by what passed for campaign-finance rules and regulations , to the frustration of David Koch , who once told The New Yorker , `` We 'd like to abolish the Federal Elections Commission and all the limits on campaign spending anyway . ''
The FEC still exists . But the Supreme Court 's decision in Citizens United v FEC and the general diminution of campaign finance rules and regulations has cleared the way for David Koch and his brother Charles to play politics as they choose . And they are playing hard—especially in Wisconsin , a state where they have made supporting and sustaining the governorship of Scott Walker a personal priority .
Two years ago , David Koch said of Walker : `` We 're helping him , as we should . We 've gotten pretty good at this over the years . We 've spent a lot of money in Wisconsin . We 're going to spend more . '' The Palm Beach Post interview in which that quote appeared explained , `` By 'we ' he says he means Americans for Prosperity , '' the group the Kochs have used as one of their prime vehicles for political engagement in the states .
AFP and its affiliates are expanding their reach this year , entering into fights at the local level where their big money can go far—and where the Koch Brothers can influence the process from the ground up .
As Walker prepares to seek a second term . AFP is clearing the way in supposedly nonpartisan county board and school board races that will occur Tuesday .
Consider the case of Iron County . Elections in the northern Wisconsin county have always been down-home affairs : an ad in the Iron County Miner newspaper , some leaflets dropped at the door , maybe a hand-painted yard sign .
This year , however , that 's changed . Determined to promote a controversial mining project—and , presumably , to advance Walker 's agenda—AFP has waded into Tuesday 's competition for control of the Iron County Board .
With dubious “ facts ” and over-the-top charges , the Wisconsin chapter of the Koch Brothers-backed group is pouring money into the county—where voter turnout in spring elections rarely tops 1,500—for one of the nastiest campaigns the region has ever seen . Small-business owners , farmers and retirees who have asked sensible questions about the impact of major developments on pristine lakes , rivers , waterfalls and tourism are being attacked as “ anti-mining radicals ” who “ just want to shut the mines down , no matter what . ”
Iron County is debating whether to allow new mining , not whether to shut mines down . And many of the candidates that AFP is ripping into have simply said they want to hear from all sides .
But those details do n't matter in the new world of Big Money politics ushered in by US Supreme Court rulings that have cleared the way for billionaires and corporations to buy elections .
Most of the attention to money in politics focuses on national and state races . But the best bargains for billionaires are found at the local level—where expenditures in the thousands can overwhelm the pocket-change campaigns of citizens who run for county boards , city councils and school boards out of a genuine desire to serve and protect their community .
That 's why it is important to pay attention to Tuesday 's voting in Iron County—and in communities such as Kenosha , where the group has waded into local school board races . The Kenosha contest goes to the core issues of recent struggles over collective-bargaining rights in Wisconsin , pitting candidates who are willing to work with teachers and their union in a historically pro-labor town versus contenders who are being aided by the Koch Brothers contingent in Wisconsin .
But it is equally important to pay attention to the efforts by citizens , working at the local level , to upend the big money and to restore politics of , by and for the people .
The month of March started with a grassroots rebellion in New Hampshire , where dozens of towns called on their elected representatives to work to enact a constitutional amendment to overturn the high court 's Citizens United decision .
On Tuesday , the same day the Kochs are meddling in local elections in the state , communities across the state will vote to get money out of politics .
Clean-politics advisory referendums are on ballots across Wisconsin . Belleville , DeForest , Delavan , Edgerton , Elkhorn , Lake Mills , Shorewood , Waterloo , Waukesha , Waunakee , Wauwatosa , Whitefish Bay and Windsor will have an opportunity to urge their elected representatives to support an amendment to restore the authority of local , state and national officials to establish campaign finance rules ensuring that votes matter more than dollars . The initiative is backed by groups like Move to Amend and United Wisconsin . “ The unlimited election spending by special-interest groups , allowed by the Supreme Court 's Citizens United ruling , has drowned out the voices of ordinary people , ” says United Wisconsin Executive Director Lisa Subeck . “ Urgent action is needed to restore our democracy to the hands of the people . ”
That urgency is especially real in rural communities—places like Iron County . That 's why the Wisconsin Farmers Union is calling for a “ yes ” vote . “ Citizens of all political stripes—Republicans , Democrats and independents—agree that we need to curb the corrupting influence of money in politics , ” says WFU Executive Director Tom Quinn . “ Voting yes…will send a clear message that we the people are ready to take back our democracy . ”
RACIAL politics were a lot more charged back in 1991 , when Derrick Bell , then a professor at Harvard law school , went on strike to demand the hiring of a black woman faculty member , and at the same moment inadvertently launched the political career of the student who would become America 's first black president . In the midst of that polarised racial environment , Barack Obama , then a member of the law school 's black students ' association and president of its Law Review , made it clear that while he supported Mr Bell , his natural inclinations were towards compromise and conciliation . A video of a young Mr Obama delivering a speech to protesters , released early this year by the late Andrew Breitbart in the vain hope it would hurt Mr Obama 's presidential campaign , shows him smoothing Mr Bell 's ego and drawing laughs from the crowd with comically exaggerated flattery . At the same time , as Gary Kamiya noted in Salon when the video was released , Mr Obama `` tried to find a middle ground in the bitter dispute . '' Mr Kamiya quotes from Thomas Sugrue 's 2010 book , `` Not Even Past : Barack Obama and the Burden of Race '' :
Obama positioned himself as someone who could reconcile Harvard 's bitter differences by bringing a tone of civility to the debate . He refused to denounce his critics and hurl polemics . In the words of Bradford Berenson , a conservative student who would later work in the second Bush administration , “ Even though he was clearly a liberal , he did n't appear to the conservatives in the review to be taking sides in the tribal warfare. ” Obama 's position in the middle allowed him to build a winning coalition of liberal and conservatives in his bid to be elected president of the Harvard Law review in February 1990 . Later that year , in a dispute about the law review 's affirmative action policy , Obama again attempted to reconcile the opposing camps . He defended the principle of affirmative action while suggesting that he respected the “ depth and sincerity ” of its opponents beliefs .

The inclination to bridge ideological and partisan gaps became the defining trait of Mr Obama 's character and of his political career . David Remnick , in his biography `` The Bridge '' , wrote that during Mr Obama 's time in the Senate , `` conciliation was his default mode , the dominant strain of his political personality . '' In his 2008 speech on race , in his televised meetings with Republicans during the Obamacare negotiations , and in his meetings with Wall Street titans , Mr Obama has displayed the same pattern Mr Berenson recognised : first , he voices the concerns of the opposition in order to make it clear he understands and to some extent shares them . Then he puts forward a proposal he views as an acceptable compromise . Indeed , Mr Kamiya argues , the conciliatory impulse is Mr Obama 's Achilles heel , the trait that at one point threatened to make a half-baked disaster of his presidency .
Obama has shown time and again that he will not get tough until he absolutely has to—and sometimes not even then . He 's conflict-averse . He prefers making beautiful speeches to taking on enemies , or committing himself to one position . He seems to always be slipping away from the fight , thinking he can have it both ways . It is a trait that got him elected , but it is his greatest weakness .
As of yesterday , Barack Obama , the great mediator , appears to have left the building . The proposal his administration has offered Republicans to avoid the fiscal cliff is a frankly Democratic proposal , reflecting Democratic priorities and economic beliefs . Mr Obama offers to achieve the necessary deficit reduction by raising $ 1.6 trillion in taxes over ten years , almost entirely from the rich , and by cutting up to $ 400 billion from the Medicare budget , if Republicans can come up with a proposal to do so . At the same time , the proposal extends the suspension of payroll taxes and long-term unemployment insurance , both measures targeted to aid the poor and middle class , and designed to minimise the contractionary hit the still-fragile US economic recovery will take next year if current law is not changed . This is progressive taxation and spending policy designed to reduce income inequality and protect the social safety net , reflecting a Keynesian belief in counter-cyclical economic policy focused on protecting demand by sparing the taxpayers most likely to spend rather than save . It 's precisely what one might expect from a Democratic administration .
Whether Republicans will be able to put forward their own priorities and ultimately come to a compromise proposal depends on the GOP leadership , and on whether it now has enough control over its fractious , ideologically extremist tea-party backbenchers to be able to negotiate . The initial rhetoric coming from Mitch McConnell and John Boehner is not promising . But given the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts the Republicans will face if they fail to reach a compromise , and the fact that Mr Obama 's proposals to hike taxes on the rich back to Clinton-era levels are overwhelmingly popular , it is difficult to imagine they will be able to avoid negotiating . And we 've seen Republicans characterise Mr Obama 's proposals as unacceptably left-wing before . In fact , that 's what we 've seen every time Mr Obama has come out with a proposal , regardless of how conciliatory those proposals were . When Mr Obama offered a health-care reform plan based on Republican proposals from the 1990s , when he offered to close the deficit with formulas including two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar of taxes raised , when he offered financial reform legislation that declined to break up large banks or ring-fence risky trading activities , Mr Obama encountered a blanket wall of Republican opposition and rhetoric painting him as the most radically left-wing president in history .
The old saw , which Robert Frost started retailing heavily in his late-life publicity blitz around JFK 's inauguration , goes that `` a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel . '' ( Apparently the first available citation is actually from William Earnest Hocking , a Harvard philosophy professor , in 1942 . ) Mr Obama may at one point have had a vision of his presidency as standing above the partisan fray in Congress , brokering compromise . This seems not to be a time in which such a presidency is possible . The partisan incentives in current American politics prevent Republicans from giving Mr Obama any credit when he attempts to be pre-emptively conciliatory , and Mr Obama appears to have decided that in the fiscal-cliff negotiations at least , he 's better off negotiating as an interested party , rather than as a mediator .

Until a judge told them to stop last week , penal authorities in Arkansas planned to kill seven people in 11 days . All seven were convicted of horrible crimes and sentenced to die by the state ; put aside how you feel about that for a moment . What 's salient here is how those men are supposed to die—the execution of their executions .
According to Arkansas ' Lethal Injection Procedure , each man will first get an intravenous injection of a sedative called midazolam , a benzodiazepene—the same class of drugs as Valium . On death row it 's supposed to induce a deep , insensate coma .
Then comes a dose of vecuronium bromide . Technically that 's a nonpolarizing neuromuscular blocker , a muscle relaxant . On death row , it 's a paralytic , intended to keep the prisoner still and , maybe , to suffocate . If you ca n't move your diaphragm , you ca n't inhale .
All that 's just a wind-up for the real kill shot : potassium chloride . The potassium ion messes up the electrical properties of the cells of the heart , making it impossible for them to contract . The heart stops beating .
Not every state executes prisoners the same way . Some only use one drug , or follow different protocols . But the idea , everywhere , is the same : to execute people without violating the Constitution 's Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment . In fact , the whole point of lethal injection was that it seems like a more humane way of executing someone than hanging , shooting , head-chopping-off , gas chambers , stuff like that .
The problem is , no one knows if lethal injection really is more humane . In court case after court case , lawyers have argued that botched executions by lethal injection show that it 's a painful and faulty method . What little research exists hints at the same conclusion . No matter how you feel about the fact that the criminal justice system sometimes kills people , even innocent people , you have to also feel something about the fact that the criminal justice system is n't very good at killing people .
Execution Is n't Easy
An Oklahoma medical examiner named Jay Chapman pitched the three-drug protocol in 1977—without a single study or piece of scientific evidence . But hey , it definitely killed people , and executed them less disgustingly than poison gas or gunshots . “ No one has done any peer-reviewed experimental research into the mechanisms of death by lethal injection , ” says Teresa Zimmers , a researcher at Indiana University 's School of Medicine and one of the few people to publish research on the practice . “ That , of course , is because support for the death penalty in the US has generally rested on the fact that people perceive lethal injection to be humane . ”
Chapman 's original protocol called for a tranquilizer from the barbiturate family . But by the 2000s , barbiturates were in short supply . Drug companies find the use of their medicines as engines of death to be distressingly off-brand , barbiturates were falling out of favor as anesthetics , and all of Europe had prohibited the use of those drugs in executions , shrinking the market .
That forced states to search for an alternative . Ohio landed on the sedative midazolam , and Florida started using it in 2013 . The problem is , midazolam turns out to be a terrible coma-inducer . Prisoners were waking up mid-execution , coughing and snoring . “ It 's not even close to being an appropriate drug for executions , ” says Robert Dunham , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center . “ But when states were no longer able to get ahold of anesthetic for use in executions , they casually looked around to see what else doctors use to put somebody to sleep . ”
The thing is , when you 're being executed with a three-drug protocol , you really want to be knocked out . That second drug , the paralytic , is probably extraordinarily painful the whole time you 're suffocating—except no one can tell , because , well , you 're totally paralyzed . ( Fun side note : The paralytics are typically synthetic versions of curare . ) The potassium chloride injection burns like fire . And even with a barbiturate on board , people might feel all of that every time .
The Search for a New Necrology
These gaps in knowledge seem fillable , but states have been less than transparent about their practices , and scientists have n't wanted to look too closely at lethal injection . “ It 's either that they do n't know too much about the science , or that they 're not telling us , ” says Megan McCracken , an attorney at UC Berkeley 's Death Penalty Clinic who specializes in Eighth Amendment challenges . “ As lawyers , we want to know , how did the state come up with a drug formula ? Who told them , or with whom did they consult , to come up with this dose and this timing ? And those questions they decline to disclose . ”
Even if states wanted to know more about anesthesia for executions , the anesthesiologists themselves could n't help . In general , big medical societies like the American Medical Association prohibit their members from studying or helping with executions . “ It 's inherently unethical to conduct experiments on how to best execute people , ” says Dunham . “ And the people best qualified wo n't do it because it 's a clear violation of the Hippocratic oath. ” One of the lethal injection researchers I called for this story declined even to comment on the subject .
You could imagine the set-up for a study to look at how lethal injection drugs work , or might work better—depending on your definition of “ better , ” of course . Maybe an institutional review board ( a group that approves the ethics of study designs ) would allow condemned prisoners to consent to analyses of their responses . Or maybe not ; the so-called Common Rule that protects human research subjects singles out prisoners for special protections , having already been deprived of various rights .
Or you could look to other literature on chemically-caused death . Some states in the US allow physician-assisted suicide , for example . The Netherlands allows euthanasia . But having a Dutch doctor standing by your bedside as you slip into a coma you asked for is pretty different from someone pumping drugs from a separate room through 20 feet of tubing . Veterinary protocols for large-mammal euthanasia might be helpful , too , but they usually have more to do with keeping handlers alive while trying to kill a dangerous animal . Oh , and the veterinarians want about as much to do with executing humans as physicians do .
In a final cruel and unusual twist , a subsidiary finding in Glossip v. Gross—the same 2015 Supreme Court decision that said it was OK if execution methods caused pain and gave the go-ahead to using midazolam—said that any challenge based on Eighth Amendment rights had to include an alternative execution method . It was basically the equivalent of saying that if you do n't want to incriminate yourself in courtroom testimony , you have to incriminate someone else . ( Do it to Julia ! Not me ! )
That 's a problem , because the science to figure out that better alternative does n't exist . Still , some states have started advocating execution methods beyond lethal injection anyway . Utah is looking at the firing squad . ( A classic ! ) Louisiana officials have talked about a gas chamber using nitrogen , which is either a death as peaceful as falling asleep or just like drowning . No one knows for sure . And for those half-dozen men on Arkansas ' death row , it 's too late to find out .

A Method of Google Search Bias Quantification and Its Application in Climate Debate and General Political Discourse
Abstract
The percentage of domain traffic , referred by Google Search , net of brand searches ( PGSTN ) , tends to be in or around the range 25 % -30 % for a broad class of web domains . This hypothesis is tested by calculating the correlation between the popularity of news/opinions websites and their PGSTN , and finding it to be near zero . Thus , PGSTN can be used rigorously to detect and even quantify Google Search intentional bias . Intentional bias is the bias that has been introduced by internal Google decisions , and unrelated to external factors , such as the dominance of particular viewpoints on the web . Here , the PGSTN method is applied for intentional bias detection about climate debate and in general political discourse .
Google Search is found to be extremely biased in favor of climate alarmism and against climate realism . The PGSTN ranges for climate realism and climate alarmism do not even overlap ! Some of the most important climate realist domains , including low-controversial judithcurry.com , have such a low PGSTN that they can be considered blacklisted by Google .
Google Search is found to be biased in favor of left/liberal domains and against conservative domains with a confidence of 95 % . Further , certain hard-Left domains have such a high PGSTN that their standing raises suspicions that they have been hand-picked for prominent placement . Certain respected conservative domains are blacklisted .
Introduction
Left-liberal political bias in Google Search has been noticed for years . See Robert Epstein et al , A Method for Detecting Bias in Search Rankings , with Evidence of Systematic Bias Related to the 2016 Presidential Election ; Todd Dunning 's 2015-09-15 comment ; Leo Goldstein , Why are Search Engines so Hostile to Climate Realism ?
These observations have not completely resolved the question whether the bias was intentional , or reflected the biased web content . Recently , Google 's official Search Evaluation Guidelines have shown intentional bias against climate realism . At least one former Google employee claimed intentional demotion of “ anything non-PC ” by the Google Search team .
This paper uses published SEO data from multiple sources , including BrightEdge Research , 2017 : Organic Search Is Still the Largest Channel , updating its 2014 report . From here on , the term ‘ bias ' means intentional bias . This paper formulates , substantiates , and applies a quantitative method of bias detection in Google Search .
Methods
It is known that Google Search provides 25 % -30 % of the user 's traffic to an average website . As Google executives and PR repeated many times , Google Search service exists to provide the most relevant and useful results to the user 's queries . Google Chairman Eric Schmidt even joked that there should be only one result for each query – the result that the user seeks . Google servers crawl the whole web , extracting text , links , and other data from trillions of pages . Google constantly and successfully fights attempts to artificially promote websites through collusive linking , and other search engine optimization techniques . In its undertaking , Google also uses an enormous amount of off-web information , which it collects through Chrome browser , other Google applications and services , analytics beacons , domains registrar status , and so on . This information includes domains popularity and ownership . Google also processes immediate feedback from the users in the form of frequency of clicks on the results , bounce rate , the frequency of repeated searches with modified terms , etc .
Google is very good at its job . Sites and domains that are less popular with the visitors tend to be less likely to receive traffic from Google , and vice versa . The effect is that percentage of net traffic that domains receive from Google Search tends to be similar across web domains ! This fact is illustrated by nearly zero correlation between domain popularity and percentage of net traffic it receives from Google within each of the sets of the left/liberal media and conservative media , despite the domain popularity ( according to Alexa.com , lower values mean higher popularity ) , varying from 24 to 1,469 for the left/liberal media set , and from 56 to 12,795 for the conservative media set . Traffic from Google Ads is about 5 % of the total Google traffic , so it is not a factor . “ Net traffic , ” used throughout this research , excludes traffic received from the users , intentionally searching for the website by its name ( i.e. , searches for ‘ foxnews ' and ‘ Fox News ' are excluded from the net traffic for foxnews.com ) . Net traffic better reflects Google intent , because Google Search does not have much choice when the user searches for a website by its name or brand . Alexa.com provides information which allows PGSTN calculation for hundreds of thousands of web domains .
Given the robustness of PGSTN , I conclude that statistically significant difference in PGSTN between a priori defined sets of comparable domains is due to intentional bias by Google , unless there is another good explanation .
Methodological Details
All the data in this research is based on Alexa ( free version ) snapshots from September 4 , 2017 . For each domain , Google Search Total was taken from “ Upstream Sites | Which sites did people visit immediately before this site ? ” table . Branded traffic was taken from the “ Top Keywords from Search Engines | Which search keywords send traffic to this site ? ” table . It should be noted that only five top values , appearing in the free Alexa snapshots , were used . All Google search domains shown in the table were included ( google.com , google.ca , google.co.uk , google.co.in etc . ) If the total of the branded traffic were less than 5 % , the value 1 % was entered . PGSTN was calculated by deducting branded search traffic from the total Google Search traffic .
PGSTN is not expected to provide sufficient certainty for individual domains , because multiple factors influence it , including possible error in Alexa data . Nevertheless , the Google attitude toward a domain has been provisionally noted and color coded in the attached spreadsheet PGSTN-Domains.xlsx as follows :
Whitelist / Green Light : > 36 %
Normal : 20 % -36 %
Grey Area : 12 % -20 %
Blacklist : < =12 %
Most domains were expected ( based on the cited SEO research ) to have PGSTN in the 20 % -36 % range . This expectation has been met . PGSTN < = 12 % provisionally indicates that the domain is blacklisted by Google . Everything between the blacklist and the normal range is considered a grey area . Finally , PGSTN > 36 % provisionally indicates unusual favoritism by Google .
Google Bias in Climate Debate
The domains were selected mostly according to Alexa classification . Detection of extreme bias Google Search has against climate realism did not require statistical methods .
There is a huge gap between PGSTN of realism domains ( 6.3 % – 17.4 % ) , and PGSTN of climate alarmism domains ( 23.5 % -52.4 % ) . The gap is 6.1 % . Except for drroyspencer.com , all climate realism domains are blacklisted by Google ( PGSTN is 6.3 % – 11.0 % ) .
On the other hand , self-appointed “ fact checkers , ” including snopes.com and politifact.com have PGSTN about 50 % . That gives ground to the suspicion that they had been hand-picked by Google for prioritization . Another two sites with suspiciously high PGSTN are sourcewatch.org ( PGSTN = 50.1 % ) and prwatch.org ( PGSTN = 40.9 % ) . These two sites grossly exchange links ( they refer to each other as the source ) , have overlapping content , and are known to Google to belong to the same organization , the Center for Media and Democracy . These are well-known signs of spam – yet Google has not only failed to downrank them as spam , but likely manually prioritized them .
This section includes netrootsnation.org , a site of a radical left conference , not specifically geared toward climate alarmism . Its PGSTN = 44.5 % . This domain could have been hand-picked or its owners had been advised by Google insiders on gaming the rankings . Google has funded the conference , and Google representatives attended it and made presentations on relevant subjects , like this one . A quote :
“ We 'll share some ways to leverage the power of online video and how to integrate Google and YouTube 's tools with other advocacy efforts . ”
All other alarmist domains have PGSTN in the whitelisted or normal range .
Google Bias in General Political Discourse
To quantify Google general political bias , I selected top U.S. news and opinions sites by their ranking in Alexa , then added some lower ranking conservative sites based on my personal knowledge and/or Alexa suggestions . There was an element of subjectivity in selection and classification , and I omitted some domains that I could not classify . Nevertheless , the most popular domains in both left/liberal ( including Left , Mainstream Liberal , and Mainstream Center ) and conservative ( including Conservative and Mainstream Conservative ) categories have been selected and classified rigorously , and use of weighted statistics minimized the element of subjectivity in the results .
The results show that Google Search is heavily biased against conservative domains , and some respectable conservative domains seem to be blacklisted :
thegatewaypundit.com
pjmedia.com
americanthinker.com
redstate.com
powerlineblog.com
drudgereport.com
There might be an alternative or additional explanation for low PGSTN of the Drudge Report – the site mostly consists of links to articles on other sites , a practice Google looks down on .
On average , the conservative domains have almost two times lower PGSTN than the left/liberal ones : conservative 15.5 % ( standard deviation 5.1 % ) vs. left/liberal 27.4 % ( standard deviation 4.9 % ) . Hypothesis of Google Search left/liberal bias is confirmed with a confidence of 95 % .
Discussion
Although PGSTN of individual domains is not sufficient for conclusions , I can not avoid noticing that extremist websites , such as dailystormer.com ( PGSTN = 13.6 % ; ceased to exist by the time of the research ) and dailykos.com ( PGSTN = 20.2 % ) are preferred by Google over many conservative and climate realist domains .
Conclusions
Google Search is biased in favor of left/liberal websites against conservative websites , and is extremely biased in favor of climate alarmism against climate realism .
Disclosure
I hold short positions in Google stock .

Three were lightly wounded and a 25-year-old was in critical condition Friday night when a rocket from Gaza struck a road in the area of Ashdod . The attack came at the tail end of a day of heavy rocket fire from Gaza .
A 4-year-old child named Daniel Tregerman was killed in the evening after being critically wounded in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council by mortar fire during a large barrage of rocket fire from Gaza that also reached central Israel .
Security sources later claimed that the mortar fire that killed Tregerman had been fired by militants from within an UNWRA school in the northern Gaza neighborhood of Saja'iyya .
Hamas claimed responsibility for the fire on central Israel , saying that they had aimed for Ben Gurion International Airport . Iron Dome intercepted one rocket over Tel Aviv during the barrage .
At least 130 rockets were fired at Israel on Friday in total , with one landing a direct hit on synagogue in Ashdod , lightly wounding two and putting one woman in moderate condtion . Ten were treated for anxiety on the scene .

Iron Dome intercepted a rocket over Be'er Sheva late Friday evening and another two projectiles fell in open areas during the same barrage .
Earlier rockets fell near a preshcool in Be'er Sheva , wounding a man while another landed meters from another preschool in the south . The heavy-handed attacks on Friday came after a quiet night gave residents a much-needed rest from renewed fighting which have seen a record number of rockets slam into Israel .

In the late afternoon hours , an apartment in Sderot also suffered a direct hit by a rocket from Gaza . Reports from the scene indicated that nobody had been injured in the attack .
Meanwhile , a Gaza health official said four Palestinians were killed in an two seperate IAF airstrike as fighting continued for a third day after the collapse of Egyptian-led cease-fire talks .

A rocket was fired at Tel Aviv in the early afternoon , but fell in an open area , failing to cause damage . Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack .
A 52-year-old Israel man was moderately wounded from shrapnel in his arms after a rocket hit in Be'er Sheva noontime Friday ; damage was also reported and he was taken to a local hospital .

As part of the salvo , three rockets were fired at the city , two were intercepted while a third fell in an open area .
Dani Schtrukerman , the paramedic who took care of the man , said `` when we arrived at the scene we saw heavy damage to the surrounding buildings and cars and shattered glass was everywhere . Citizens took us to a 54-year-old man who had massive shrapnel wounds on his arms . He told us he was hiding between two buildings when the rocket het , sending shrapnel his way . '' The hospital said he was in light to moderate condition .

The salvo which wounded the man was followed by a rocket barrage at Sderot , three of which were intercepted by Iron Dome . Two more rockets fell in Eshkol an hour later , causing damage to a local house .
Earlier three rockets were intercepted and two fell outside communities in the Eshkol Regional Council and rockets were also intercepted over Ashkelon and Sderot .
Earlier , at least five rockets hit the south , mostly the Eshkol Regional Council , during the late morning hours , with one of the rockets landing 12 meters from a pre-school . Two rockets fired at Ashkelon were intercepted by Iron Dome and later two others fell in open areas near Netivot , with one also being intercepted above the town .

Sirens pierced the early morning silence , waking residents of the Eshkol Regional Council , which has suffered the majority of rocket hits in recent days , and informed them of incoming rocket fire shortly after dawn .
A rocket then exploded in an open area in Eshkol , and was followed by another rocket which fell outside one of the regional council 's communities . Afterwards , a third rocket slammed into an open area in the Hof Ashkelon Regional Council , while Iron Dome intercepted the fourth shortly after .
According to the IDF , five more rockets were fired since midnight , though no sirens were reported until 6 am .

The early morning rocket attacks followed violent days which saw ceasefire efforts to reach a long term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapse , amid renewed cross border rocket fire by Gaza militants .
The IDF said it carried out 20 airstrikes early on Friday , targeting rocket launchers and weapons sites , and Gaza health official , Ashraf al-Kidra , says two workers were killed at a livestock farm that was hit in the airstrike .
Two men aged 22 and 24 were killed in a strike on Nusseirat refugee camp early on Friday , emergency services said .
Two more were killed in an air raid near neighboring Deir al-Balah .
Earlier this week , Hamas rejected an Egyptian truce proposal under which Israel would gradually ease its blockade of Gaza , without giving specific commitments .
Hamas demands a lifting of the border closure , imposed by Israel and Egypt after the militant group 's takeover of the coastal strip in 2007 .
A quick resumption of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Cairo seems unlikely , particularly after Israel killed three top Hamas military leaders in an airstrike Thursday .
Responding to the killing of the three , senior Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said late Thursday that his group would not budge from its demands .
`` We will not accept anything less than an end to the ( Israeli ) aggression and an end to the blockade , '' Haniyeh said in a statement posted by the Hamas-affiliated Al Rai news service . `` Anyone involved in cease-fire efforts must understand that our people will not accept anything less than this . ''

An illustration of a pair of Glyptodonts . ( Peter Schouten )
A family of ancient animals called Glyptodonts have long been thought of as giant armadillos , and now scientists have the genetic data to back it up : According to a study published Monday in Current Biology , the long-extinct armored beasts were indeed very closely related to modern armadillos .
Scientists led by Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University and Frédéric Delsu of the French National Centre for Scientific Research analyzed the genome of a Glyptodont called Doedicurus . Doedicurus was one of the largest-known species in the family , growing to be over 13 feet long and weighing some 3,000 pounds or more . The hulking animals featured spiked , club-like tails that they probably used in combat . Unlike modern armadillos , their shells were generally made from one solid piece – they did n't have the articulated armor that makes their modern cousins so roly-poly .
Another interpretation of the ancient Glyptodont . ( Carl Buell )
The last Doedicurus died about 11,000 years ago , and the tiny fossil sample analyzed for the study was about 12,000 years old – so extracting DNA , which degrades and gets more contaminated over time , was no small feat .
[ 125 million-year-old fossil shows remarkably preserved organs and hair ]
`` Ancient DNA has the potential to solve a number of questions such as phylogenetic position -- or the evolutionary relationship -- of extinct mammals , but it is often extremely difficult to obtain usable DNA from fossil specimens , '' Poinar explained in a statement . `` In this particular case , we used a technical trick to fish out DNA fragments and reconstruct the mitochondrial genome . ''
According to the new analysis , the Glyptodonts are a distinct subfamily in the family Chlamyphoridae , which includes the ( absolutely adorable ) pink fairy armadillo . The ancient bruisers probably diverged from the rest of the family about 35 million years ago , which is more than 30 million years before modern armadillo species hit the scene .
Based on the fossil record , the researchers believe that this 35 million-year-old common ancestor would have weighed just around 13 pounds , suggesting that Glyptodonts saw a tremendous increase in size as they evolved . It 's possible that their unarticulated backs evolved to allow this massive growth .
While their size probably made them much more formidable fighters than their modern cousins , they joined other megafauna in dying off during the last Ice Age . Their lineage is gone , but now we know that their extended family lives on .

With Xbox SmartGlass , Microsoft wants to revolutionize the second screen .
Microsoft is committed to extending the appeal of the Xbox brand beyond gaming and beyond the console . This was clear with last week 's unveiling of Xbox Music , and it 's even truer with Tuesday 's official unveiling of Xbox SmartGlass , along with the news that Xbox Video and Xbox Games are coming to Windows 8 .
SmartGlass , which was first announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) in June , will launch alongside Windows 8 on Oct. 26 . It allows users to view content on multiple devices , and to control or enhance that experience .
At its most base level , SmartGlass will allow users to shift content from device to device ; that means you can start watching a movie on the Xbox 360 , and then use SmartGlass to resume playing that film on your Windows 8 tablet . Likewise , you can start a movie on your Windows 8 device and finish on the Xbox .
If SmartGlass only worked with the Windows 8 ecosystem , it would be pretty great . What makes SmartGlass genius is that apps will be available for iOS and Android . Microsoft does n't have specific dates on when those apps will be available , but says they will debut `` very soon . ''
Navigation : A 10-Foot UI That Finally Works
One of my favorite aspects of SmartGlass is the remote-control functionality . With the SmartGlass apps , users will be able to control their Xbox 360 with their phone or tablet . This is great news ; it means no more searching for an Xbox remote ( or even a Harmony Touch ) — just grab your phone and control the Xbox . Functions such as playback , pause , rewind and search all work on the phone .
Where the remote control element really shines is when you use it with Internet Explorer for Xbox . Microsoft helped pioneer the movement to get the web onto televisions back in the Web TV days , but it has n't really succeeded with the concept until now .
As someone who has built and customized more Home Theater PCs ( and Mac mini HTPCs ) than I can count , I 'm all too familiar with the problem of putting a web browser on a television set . The biggest issue is that making content accessible and controlling page movement with a traditional remote , keyboard or mouse is just a total pain .
Microsoft has decided to take a page from some of the better third-party iOS remote control apps , and turn the tablet or phone screen into a trackpad . Move your fingers across your device to control the cursor on Internet Explorer for Xbox .
Tap a text field , and use the device 's native keyboard to enter content . Pinch to zoom on the trackpad to get a closer look at content on the TV . This is the way web browsing on the TV was supposed to work . Even better — if you want to send a URL from your Xbox to your phone or tablet , you can do that with the tap of a button .
Creating a Real Second Screen for TV and Movies
We already touched on one of the larger aspects of SmartGlass when it comes to watching TV shows or movies : shifting content from one device to another . Again , if Microsoft stopped there , SmartGlass would still be a cool product .
But it did n't . What has the potential to take SmartGlass to the next level is true second-screen integration within those apps . For example , if I 'm watching a movie on a Windows 8 tablet and I want to shift it to my Xbox 360 , my tablet now becomes a hub for second-screen content .
If you 're watching a movie or TV show , the cast members of that program will be part of the tablet experience . You can then browse through an actor 's filmography or learn more about his or her background . What 's more , specific details about a scene — as well as visual highlights of what 's happening in the scene — can appear on-screen .
Microsoft tells Mashable that it is working hard on getting extra features and bonus experiences integrated alongside content . HBO Go has a great second-screen experience for Game of Thrones on the iPad that lets users browse maps and explore the series ' universe and characters , while watching the show ; HBO Go will be bringing this experience to Xbox SmartGlass . So , if you 're watching Game of Thrones via HBO Go on your Xbox , you can use SmartGlass to get that second-screen experience .
Music
As with video , users can control the Xbox Music service from their SmartGlass phone or tablet . Plus , if you want to play content on the Xbox , the tablet or phone becomes a screen you can browse for recommended artists , new releases , playlists and more .
The second screen opens up a much more group-oriented experience , especially if you want to have music blasting out of the speakers connected to the TV , while giving others the chance to choose songs . And since it works over Wi-Fi , you could have the tablet in your kitchen , while controlling the TV in your living room .
Sports
Microsoft is investing heavily into sports with SmartGlass . The goal is to bring more real-time sports programming to Xbox , and then augment that experience with on-screen highlights and second-screen controls . This will kick off with NBA Game Time for Xbox , and will expand to more sports in the coming months . The NBA Game Time app is now available for Xbox , and the SmartGlass enhancements will be ready on Oct. 26 .
Games
The Xbox is still about gaming , and Microsoft is hoping to deliver a more unique gaming experience using SmartGlass .
In supported games , users can get more views or have additional experiences on the phone or tablet . In Fozra : Horizon , for example , the phone or tablet becomes a virtual GPS ; that means I can glance down at my phone or tablet to see where I am on the track ( or even better , let my husband direct me as I 'm driving ) .
With Dance Central 3 , players can queue up the next song from SmartGlass , rather than having to wait for the end of a song . When Halo 4 launches , SmartGlass will act as a progress guide for the game .
How Does it Compare With the Wii U
Microsoft is n't the only company actively courting the second-screen space . Nintendo is making it a fundamental part of its upcoming console , the Wii U . The Wii U controller includes a tablet built into the device ; this allows Nintendo and its partners to create games that take advantage of that second screen ( similar to what Microsoft is doing for some of its SmartGlass-enhanced titles ) , but it 's also letting users control the game itself on the screen .
When it comes to entertainment content , the Nintendo TVii is focused on creating a personalized way to access content from a number of digital services , as well as controlling the cable or satellite box .
I 've only spent a few minutes with both systems , but feel like both companies are approaching the same idea from different directions . Nintendo is focusing first and foremost on crafting game experiences or additional game-play modes within the second screen itself . Microsoft is also certainly interested in achieving that , but its game integration is more about using a phone or tablet as a way to view additional information ( such as a map in a car game ) or to perform simple tasks .
That said , Microsoft seems to be further along at crafting second-screen experiences around video and music content . Nintendo has recommendations nailed with Nintendo TVii , but Microsoft has a more complete ecosystem for video and music .
This is the Future
Many companies are trying to capture momentum around the second screen . What makes Microsoft 's gambit unique is that they already have 70 million consoles around the world ; that helps solve a big barrier already — targeting people with compatible set-top boxes .
The biggest game changer , however , is the fact that SmartGlass is device agnostic . It 's beyond cool that the controls and second-screen options will be available on iOS and Android . It also helps position Xbox 360 as a continually valuable device for the home-entertainment space .
Microsoft is serious about extending the Xbox brand the same way it did with Windows . An added benefit ? The user interface on SmartGlass is so similar to Windows 8 , it might just convince a few skeptics to give the Surface or another Windows 8 tablet a second look .
Technology and entertainment are only going to continue to converge as the years go on . For now , SmartGlass is one of the first products on the market that offers a glimpse at that larger future .

* Erdoğan says Gulen is plotting with opposition CHP
* Prime minister says audio recordings are a `` montage ''
* Policeman alleged to have bugged office is identified ( Recasts with Erdoğan comments )
By Humeyra Pamuk
ANKARA , Feb 27 ( Reuters ) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan on Thursday accused a U.S.-based cleric of conspiring against him with the opposition by faking recordings , and dared him to `` stand up in the squares '' and do his politics in Turkey .
An audio track purporting to be of Erdoğan giving his son business advice was posted anonymously on YouTube on Wednesday , following one earlier in the week that fuelled a simmering government corruption scandal and unnerved markets .
Addressing his first campaign rally for March 's local elections since the recordings appeared , a combative Erdoğan said Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen had collaborated with the secularist Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) to spread the fabricated `` montage '' .
`` Hodja ( scholar ) , if you have not done anything wrong , then do n't live in Pennsylvania . If your country is Turkey , then come back to your country , '' Erdoğan told thousands of supporters in the southern town of Burdur , using Gulen 's honorific title .
`` If you want to go into politics , then stand up in the squares and do politics , '' he said to cheers , throwing down the gauntlet to a cleric widely held to have considerable sway over parts of the state bureaucracy but less influence at the ballot box .
Gulen , whose followers say they number in the millions , is believed to have built up influence in the police and judiciary over decades and leads a powerful worldwide Islamic movement from a forested compound in Pennsylvania 's Pocono mountains .
Erdoğan 's supporters accuse the cleric of orchestrating the corruption investigation , which erupted in mid-December with the arrest of businessmen closes to him and of three ministers ' sons , in a bid to unseat him .
POPULARITY LITTLE CHANGED
Opinion polls taken before Monday 's posting showed Erdoğan 's popularity little affected by the corruption scandal . Political analysts suggest followers of Gulen 's Hizmet ( Service ) movement account for around 3-5 percent of voters .
Through his lawyer , Gulen has described the accusation of complicity in the tapes as unjust and contributing to an atmosphere of `` hatred and enmity '' in Turkish society .
Erdoğan 's rift with a man who long supported the rise of his Islamist-rooted AK Party has grown into one of the greatest challenges of his 11 years in power . CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu played the first recording during his weekly group meeting at parliament on Tuesday .
`` CHP 's Hodja from overseas has handed a montage to the general manager of CHP and assigned this mission to him , '' Erdoğan said . `` He told him ... we will prepare montages from here and you will talk about our montages in your group meetings . ''
Erdoğan has said the recording posted on Monday , in which he allegedly tells his son Bilal to dispose of large sums of cash as the corruption detentions begin , was faked by his political enemies .
The audio track posted on Wednesday under the pseudonym `` Haramzadeler '' purported to be of Erdoğan advising Bilal to hold out for a better offer in an unspecified business deal .
`` The others are bringing . Why ca n't he bring ? What do they think this business is ? ... But do n't worry , they will fall into our lap , '' says the voice on the recording .
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of either recording and one of Erdoğan 's four deputy prime ministers told reporters that Wednesday 's recordings were also fabricated .
`` On yesterday 's developments , almost everyone agrees that they are a montage , '' Emrullah Isler said at a ceremony in Sudan , describing those responsible as an `` illegitimate gang '' .
`` A sort of political engineering is planned in Turkey through blackmail and tapes , '' he said .
POLICE OFFICER IDENTIFIED
Government officials say the Hizmet network has been illegally tapping thousands of telephones in Turkey for years to concoct criminal cases against its enemies and try to influence government affairs .
`` Can you imagine this ? The police officer who works for me ... places a bug in the most private part of my office , '' Erdoğan said , adding that the officer in question had been identified and legal proceedings started .
The latest political tensions briefly unnerved the markets . The lira fell to a three-week low of 2.2525 to the dollar overnight , with nervousness over the graft scandal compounded by worries over mounting tension in Ukraine , but bounced back to 2.2255 by 1535 GMT .
No company names are mentioned in Wednesday 's audio recording but the voice purported to be Bilal Erdoğan refers to a `` Mr. Sitki '' , saying he could not carry out a transaction .
An accompanying text within the YouTube clip says the reference is to Sitki Ayan , the chairman of Istanbul-based company Turang Transit Tasimacilik . The basis for that conclusion was not clear .
It could not immediately be determined what ties , if any , Turang or its chairman have to the Erdoğan family .
Representatives of Turang were not immediately available to comment on Thursday .
Turang received a licence in 2010 to build part of a pipeline intended to carry Iranian and Turkmen gas to Europe through Turkey , according to its website .
It was granted government incentives including tax exemptions on investments of up to 11.5 billion lira ( $ 5.2 bln ) in December , according to the Economy Ministry 's website .

Inside atomic nuclei , protons and neutrons fill space with a packing density of 0.74 , meaning that only 26 percent of the volume of the nucleus in is empty .
That 's pretty efficient packing . Neutrons achieve a similar density inside neutron stars , where the force holding neutrons together is the only thing that prevents gravity from crushing the star into a black hole .
Today , Felipe Llanes-Estrada at the Technical University of Munich in Germany and Gaspar Moreno Navarro at Complutense University in Madrid , Spain , say neutrons can do even better .
These guys have calculated that under intense pressure , neutrons can switch from a spherical symmetry to a cubic one . And when that happens , neutrons pack like cubes into crystals with a packing density that approaches 100 % .
Anyone wondering where such a form of matter might exist would naturally think if the centre of neutron stars . But there 's a problem .
On the one hand , most neutron stars have a mass about 1.4 times that of the Sun , which is too small to generate the required pressures for cubic neutrons . On the other , stars much bigger than two solar masses collapse to form black holes .
That does n't leave much of a mass range in which cubic neutrons can form .
As luck would have it , however , last year astronomers discovered in the constellation of Scorpius the most massive neutron star ever seen . This object , called PSR J1614-2230 , has a mass 1.97 times that of the Sun .
That 's about as large as theory allows ( in fact its mere existence rules out various theories about the behaviour of mass at high densities ) . But PSR J1614-2230 is massive enough to allow the existence of cubic neutrons .
Astrophysicists will be rubbing their hands at the prospect . The change from spherical to cubic neutrons should have a big influence on the behaviour a neutron star . It would change the star 's density , it 's stiffness and its rate of rotation , among other things .
So astronomers will be getting their lens cloths out and polishing furiously in the hope of observing this entirely new form of matter in the distant reaches of the galaxy .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has pulled into a virtual tie with President Barack Obama in the crucial swing states of Ohio and Florida , but Obama retains a solid lead in Pennsylvania , according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday .

Romney gained ground on Obama over the last month in Ohio and Florida , fiercely contested battleground states that will be critical to deciding the winner of the November 6 presidential election .
The new poll found Romney with 44 percent to Obama 's 43 percent in Florida , where Obama led by 7 percentage points in late March . In Ohio , where Obama led by 6 points in late March , Obama had 44 percent to Romney 's 42 percent . Both leads were well within the poll 's 2.9 percent margin of error .
Obama slightly expanded his lead in Pennsylvania , registering 47 percent to Romney 's 39 percent . He led by 3 points in March in Pennsylvania , which has trended toward Democrats in recent presidential elections .
Pollster Peter Brown attributed Romney 's improved showing in Ohio and Florida to his triumph in the Republican nominating race and to continued public worries about the pace of the economic recovery .
“ First , since he is now the de facto nominee , Romney is no longer being attacked by his fellow Republicans , who are closing ranks behind him , ” Brown said . “ Second , voter optimism about the economy has leveled off , reflecting economic statistics over the past month and the public reaction to them . ”
Romney , a former governor of Massachusetts , has touted his experience as the head of a private equity firm as evidence that he could do the best job healing the economy .
“ What appears to be keeping Romney in the ball game , at least in Florida and Ohio , is the perception he can better fix the economy , ” Brown said .
Most national polls show a tight race between Romney and Obama in the state-by-state battle for the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House . Ohio , with 18 electoral votes , and Florida , with 29 , have helped decide close recent presidential elections .
The poll of 1,169 voters in Florida , 1,130 voters in Ohio and 1,168 voters in Pennsylvania was conducted by telephone land and cell lines from April 25 to May 1 .
Ethereum , the barely two years old digital currency , now processes more transactions than all other digital currencies combined , including bitcoin .
Ethereum currently processes 52.3 % of all cryptocurrency transactions , followed by bitcoin at 33 % , while Bitcoin Cash , currently third in market cap , is handling only 1.8 % as pictured above .
More than half a million transactions were processed yesterday by ethereum , a level that is now becoming common for the platform , rising considerably since early last year when it stood at just 10,000 .
While bitcoin is currently processing around 330,000 transactions , with no change in volumes for an entire year despite considerable growth and a claimed increase in capacity .
Bitcoin 's transaction levels have been moving very much in a straight line due to a limited 1MB capacity . Although segregated witnesses ( segwit ) claimed to double it , in effect it has added as good as no capacity since its activation in August 2017 .
In contrast , ethereum 's transaction levels have continued to grow with the network able to handle probably double the current amount of demand without any congestion and at sub-penny fees .
Some suggest that much of this demand is due to dapps and tokens built on top of ethereum , but that may make the network itself more appealing due to increased network effects .
Especially at a time when bitcoin transactions are very difficult and quite painful to make due to considerable delays and occasional fees of as high as $ 10 .
Ethereum hopes to avoid that completely with fees kept below 20 cent through two major network upgrades that are on the roadmap .
Firstly , a hybrid Proof of Stake ( PoS ) and Proof of Work ( PoW ) upgrade might be implemented as early as next year .
That might reduce transaction times below the current 15 seconds which in itself would increase capacity accordingly , but it may further increase capacity due to incentivizing nodes through staking , which can in a way be seen as earning interest for running a network node and for increasing decentralization .
Eventually the network will upgrade to fully PoS , when confirmation times might be brought down to as low as 2 seconds , increasing capacity by orders of magnitude .
Then , a more long term plan is sharding , which remains in conceptual development and may not be ready until after 2020 . That aims to increase on-chain capacity to as good as unlimited .
For now , ethereum can still comfortably handle 1 million to 2 million daily transactions , but thereafter it may start struggling . Demand , however , is not at those levels yet . Once it rises there , the capacity upgrades might be ready , which may further be complemented with Raiden , Plasma and other second layer protocols .
District leaders are the subject of a mysterious new attack along a chic D.C. street .
About a half dozen posters now line U Street Northwest . The word “ gentrify ” is front and center , blaming “ displacement ” on city government . Mayor Muriel Bowser 's photo is the largest .
“ I do n't usually respond to anonymous posters , ” Bowser told WUSA9 . “ Especially when they 're littering illegally . ”
The posters advertise a website , www.dcaffordability.com , which redirects users to a city government webpage on affordable housing . A WHOIS lookup of the domain name provides a fake address . Our calls to the listed phone number were not returned .
Have you seen these signs ? A new attack on gentrification in The District . Who 's behind it ? @ wusa9 at 11. pic.twitter.com/p35hQnzEtJ — Pete Muntean ( @ petemuntean ) May 30 , 2017
“ I 'm not sure this is going to bring a discussion , ” said Primus Tomlinson , who has lived nearby for almost 20 years . He noticed the posters as soon as they went up , but says the mystery person behind them will not bring change as fast . “ I 've seen a lot of changes . It 's going to take a bonding moment . ”

Recently I replaced my wireless router , an Asus RT-AC66U , with an Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X router and Ubiquiti UAP-AC-LR access point . Both of which are a HUGE step up over traditional consumer wireless routers .
The Ubiquiti access points use software called the Ubiquiti UniFi controller to configure and control the access points which can be installed locally or in the cloud – allowing you to manage the access points no matter where they are located .
To automate the installation process , I created a simple script to deploy the Ubiquiti UniFi Controller in the cloud on a Ubuntu server , and have also tested the script on three popular VPS providers : Linode , Vultr , and DigitalOcean – all three worked perfectly !
Linode would be my first choice as they offer the best performance and with 1CPU and 2GB RAM you 'll have more than plenty of resources to run Ubiquiti UniFi Controller and manage many sites and access points .
If you have a small deployment , Vultr would easily be my choice with 1CPU and 768MB RAM ! All three providers also cost less than AWS and Azure .
UPDATE : Linode now offers a 1GB VPS with 1CPU for $ 5/month which makes it a slightly better choice than Vultr
For my deployment I went with Linode as I plan on using it to control not only my home access points but to control the access points of customers and family as well .
Lets begin…
Create a cloud server for the UniFi Controller
First step is to create your Linode node and to do so simply select your node size and location and click on “ Add this Linode ! “ .
Next click on “ Dashboard “ .
We need to deploy an operating system on our new node so click on “ Deploy an Image “ .
For image type select “ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ” and set your root password then click on “ Deploy “ .
Wait until the three Host Job Queues are complete ( initial config , disk create , and file system create ) and then click on “ Boot “ .
Your new node is now built and ready to have the Ubiquiti UniFi controller installed onto it .
Install Ubiquiti UniFi Controller on Ubuntu
While the Ubiquiti UniFi controller install process is pretty easy , I 've tried to make the process even easier by scripting it . It 's now as simple as running one single command .
The script is hosted on GitHub ( unifi-autoinstall ) and I strongly urge everyone to view the source and inspect it before running it as it 's never good practice to blindly run scripts . So with that lets get started…
Note : The script has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 LTS . It should also work on Debian but you will need to install SUDO and UFW before running the script .
SSH into your new Linode node using PuTTy or Terminal and type the following command and press Enter to download the script to your server . wget https : //raw.githubusercontent.com/miketabor/unifi-autoinstall/master/install.sh Next lets view the script to see what it does by typing the following : less install.sh You can now view the contents of the UniFi autoinstall script , install.sh . Once you 've viewed it you can press q to exit and continue on .
Now lets actually run the script . Type the following to start the script to auto configure the firewall , Fail2ban and install the Ubiquiti UniFi Controller . sudo bash install.sh When the script finishes , typically less than 1 minute , you 'll see a message letting you know it 's finished and to log into your new UniFi controller by going to : https : // < SERVER_IP > :8443
That 's it ! The Ubiquiti UniFi Controller is now ready to for use . Now go ahead and go to https : // < SERVER_IP > :8443 and finish the UniFi Controller wizard . Finally , beefore we move on to far I wanted to quickly explain what exactly the script is doing .
First it updates all the packages on Ubuntu .
Configures UFW to allow only SSH and the needed Ubiquiti UniFi ports ( per ubiquiti documentation
to allow only SSH and the needed Ubiquiti UniFi ports Installs the latest version 5 UniFi controller and its dependencies .
Finally installs Fail2Ban and configures it to protect SSH ( default ) as well as the UniFi login page !
Now lets discover and register the new access points to the UniFi controller .
How to register access points to UniFi controller in the cloud
The last step is to register the access point ( s ) with the UniFi Controller on the cloud , in this case Linode .
Open the Ubiquiti Discovery Tool or use the Ubiquiti Chrome extension . Typically right away the discovery tool will find all the access points on your local network . Next to the one you want to register with the UniFi controller click on “ Action “ .
In the Actions drop down set to “ Set Inform ” and change the Inform URL to : https : // < UniFi_Server_IP–OR–FQDN > :8080/inform
Now go to your UniFi Controller and the Ubiquiti access point should be listed and awaiting your action . Click on Adopt .
That 's it ! That completes setting up a Ubiquiti UniFi controller in the cloud and registering your access point with the new UniFi controller . The only steps left would be to setup your SSID , policies , additional sites , and so on .
Hope this helps and enjoy !

Got an idea how to make this process even better , share your thoughts below in the comments !
The New Yorker 's Rivka Galchen this week takes a deep dive into Oklahoma 's `` frackquakes , '' the seismic activity linked to new methods of gas and oil extraction -- mostly , the injection wells used to dispose of fracking wastewater -- that by last year was occurring at triple the rate of California 's quakes .
Her piece depicts a state struggling to come to terms with its new designation as the reigning earthquake capital of the U.S. , and of state legislators and regulators who really , really do n't want to be talking about this .
Advertisement :
Take , for example , a series of earthquakes in the town of Prague , which destroyed at least sixteen houses and five million dollars in damages to a building at nearby St. Gregory 's University . The official position of the Oklahoma Geological Survey ( `` charged with investigating the state 's land , water , mineral , and energy resources and disseminating the results of those investigations to promote the wise use of Oklahoma 's natural resources consistent with sound environmental practices '' ) , is that the tremors were likely naturally occurring , and that there 's `` insufficient evidence '' to suggest that most of Oklahoma 's earthquakes are caused by disposal wells .
That position , writes Galchen , `` has no published research to support it , and there are at least twenty-three peer-reviewed , published papers that conclude otherwise . ''
Between 2009 , when the increase in seismic activity first began , and 2014 , meanwhile , the state legislature failed to even propose any legislation related to the quakes . And leaders appear unwilling to consider the facts :
In September , 2014 , at the request of two state representatives , the Oklahoma legislature conducted an official interim study on induced seismicity . In subsequent hearings , more than five hours of testimony were presented to a committee of legislators . Holland , Dana Murphy , of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission , and Todd Halihan , the professor of geology at Oklahoma State University , all spoke about the link between disposal wells and earthquakes . Tim Baker , of the O.C.C. , spoke about the link between drilling into basement rock and earthquakes . After the hearings , Mark McBride , the committee chair , issued a press release . It denied “ a correlation between the injection wells and seismic activity , ” and quoted a legislator 's speculation that perhaps the quakes were caused by “ the current drought. ” None of the scientists who had been present were quoted . I called McBride , who at first had no memory of the study—nor did his secretary . Then McBride remembered it . I asked what he had learned from it , and he said , “ Well , one question I had for them was about the drought . That maybe the drought is causing these problems . And I seem to remember that sometimes there 's a problem , if they drill down too far . But that 's about it , really . ”
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission , charged with regulating oil and gas exploration and , according to Galchen , much more empowered to do something about the earthquakes than state officials , is slowly getting there -- a spokesman said quakes are `` our No . 1 priority , ” but added that “ rules take time , and are difficult to change '' -- but Galchen reserves more sympathy for locals speaking out against the industry : `` The activists ' fluent knowledge and ready evidence can , perversely , make them sound crazy—so much data ! —if one forgets that they are being continually , from all corners , gaslit . ''
The whole saga brings to mind Florida 's ban on the term `` climate change '' and other institutional attempts to ignore a man-made problem in hopes it 'll go away , right down to the scientists unhappily resigned to the politicization of their research . And it 's made all the more strange by Galchen 's assertion that most of the scientists she spoke with do n't think the state should ban fracking or the use of disposal wells -- they 're calling merely for `` open discussion , and a rational plan to avoid triggering the earthquakes that are felt ... almost daily . ''
Many Oklahomans , it seems , are unwilling to speak out against the oil industry forming the backbone of their state ; it 's that same loyalty , Galchen suggests , preventing stronger legislation -- the state 's anti-regulation fervor , she points out , did n't stop it from levying a new tax on rooftop solar panels . Oklahoma , it follows , may be inclined just to think of its quakes as an unavoidable downside of the oil boom -- worth enduring instead of working to prevent .

INDIANAPOLIS , Ind.- On Thursday , investigators say they had recovered DNA evidence from the Delphi crime scene where two girls , 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German , were found murdered .
That evidence now has top priority for processing by investigators . It 's a strong lead , in a case where authorities have been clamoring for any clue about the murderer . But just how important could is this DNA evidence be ?
It is now the third piece of evidence investigators have said publicly they have : the grainy suspect photo , that chilling audio of a man 's voice saying “ down the hill , ” and now some kind of DNA sample .
“ We asked for a fast-track as far as that piece information , ” said Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby . `` So I ca n't go into specifics because of the ongoing [ investigation ] . ”
Police have n't said specifically what kind of evidence they recovered , but DNA forensics expert Dr . Gay Bush says that evidence could be anything .
“ It can be items found at the crime scene such as a cigarette butt , or a bottle , or a cup or a straw , ” said Dr. Bush . “ Or it can be bodily fluids if there 's some kind of assault . ”
Please enable Javascript to watch this video
Dr. Bush is the laboratory director for Strand Diagnostics , an FBI-accredited facility that often assists law enforcement , although they 're not working on the Delphi case .
“ You can generally get a good profile if you 've got at least 30-35 human cells , ” said Bush .
It can sometimes take two days to a week to generate a DNA profile from evidence , if not longer .
“ But if you are fast-tracking it…if it 's a case that 's got some urgency to it , it can be done in a couple of days , ” said Bush .
Which is what Sheriff Leazenby said is happening . But while DNA can bolster a case , Dr. Bush says it 's not always a slam dunk on its own .
“ It 's good , ” said Bush , “ the science is excellent , it 's very trustworthy , and there are very strong standards in DNA processing , but…when all is said and done , [ it 's ] just one piece of evidence for the process . ”
Once a DNA profile is generated , it 's compared to a national database of DNA profiles . A best-case scenario would be if the profile from the crime scene matches with a suspect who 's profile is already on record . It could also match with an unknown profile , which is DNA that has been collected and documented , but never connected to a specific person .
It started with a suggestion that white students and professors leave campus for a day , a twist on a tradition of black students voluntarily doing the same .
A professor objected , and his argument with a loud and profane group of protesters outside his classroom soon rocketed across the internet .
On Friday , more than three weeks later , Evergreen State College had to hold its commencement 30 miles from campus , at a rented baseball stadium where everyone had to pass through metal detectors .
{ snip }
After the dispute gained national exposure — amplified by the professor 's appearance on Fox News , his op-ed in The Wall Street Journal , and right-leaning websites ' heaping derision on their newest college target — the professor , Bret Weinstein , said he had to stay away from campus for his own safety and move his family into hiding .
Student protesters briefly occupied the president 's office to press their complaints of racism on campus . In one encounter , the president , George Bridges , was recorded meekly complying with a demand not to use hand gestures when he spoke because they were threatening .
{ snip }
What also sets the Evergreen turmoil apart is that it began not with a controversy-courting guest speaker like Ann Coulter or Milo Yiannopoulos , but a Bernie Sanders-backing biology professor who has been a fixture at the college for 15 years .
The conflict stems from the college 's Day of Absence , a tradition in which black people leave the campus to show what the place would be like without them . This year , organizers suggested the reverse : that white people who wanted to participate would leave while nonwhites stayed , and both groups would attend workshops to , as the email announcement put it , “ explore issues of race , equity , allyship , inclusion and privilege . ”
In an email to his colleagues , Professor Weinstein , who is white , said that when black people decided to leave , it made sense as “ a forceful call to consciousness. ” But to ask white people to leave , he wrote , “ is a show of force , and an act of oppression in and of itself . ”
{ snip }
What followed can be viewed by anyone with a smartphone : a protest outside his classroom in which students derided his “ racist ” opinions and called him “ useless , ” preceded by an expletive ; his appearance on Tucker Carlson 's Fox News show ; and scenes of students and professors arguing with other professors and their college president .
{ snip }
Professor Weinstein , who declined to be interviewed , has been lying low . But he is quite visible online , with a growing Twitter audience and a new blog offering his subscribers insights into “ evolution , civilization and intolerance ” for a nominal monthly fee .
{ snip }
There is a bigger context to the dispute , faculty members say . Overall enrollment at Evergreen has been declining since 2009 , while minority enrollment , which now stands around 29 percent , is rising .
Some faculty members have said the college has not been adequately serving minority students , and an “ equity council ” developed a plan to address those issues .
{ snip }
But the time for academic word-parsing has passed ; the final days of the term were marked by riot police officers , barricades and metal detectors .
{ snip }
On Thursday , a group calling itself Patriot Prayer , a right-leaning band of 60 or 70 people from off campus waving American flags and one showing Pepe the Frog , a symbol of the alt-right movement .
{ snip }
The group marched onto campus , where about 200 people awaited them : anarchists and “ anti-fascists ” looking like graphic-novel ninjas , with black scarves hiding their faces and hoods covering their hair , flanked by aging professors in rumpled rain slickers .
The Patriots ' leader , Joey Gibson , strolled into the crowd of ninjas , where he was sprayed with Silly String , hit in the head with a can of it and then attacked with what may have been pepper spray before state police officers in riot gear restored order .
The college spent $ 100,000 to rent the minor-league stadium in Tacoma for the commencement on Friday . “ I 'm very glad we 're all here together , ” Mr. Bridges said in his address , acknowledging the “ fierce and disturbing ” events of recent weeks .

Conspiracy theorists say power source could be behind U.S. spy plane
Now an expert says the noises sound like a 'pulse detonation engine '
An expert claims the loud bangs which baffled Britons last night sounded like a type of experimental jet engine - which conspiracy theorists enjoy linking to a rumoured spy plane .
Dr Bhupendra Khandelwal added his comparison to a debate which began when hundreds of Twitter users from Aberdeen to Devon - and even New York - reported 'explosions ' which shook windows and disturbed sleeping children at around 10pm .
One resident in Croydon , South London , recorded the sounds on her phone in a mystery that has left Britons blaming meteors , an 'alien invasion ' , 'the end of the world ' ... or just fireworks .
Could it be ? An artist 's image of the so-called Aurora project . Enthusiasts say one possible power source is a 'pulse detonation engine ' , whose sound is said to resemble that caught on an audio clip last night ( below )
Dr Khandelwal , an engineering research associate from Sheffield , is among a team of scientists working on the technology behind types of 'pulse detonation engine ' .
'It makes the same kind of pulsing sound as the one on this audio , ' he told MailOnline .
‘ When we run a test engine it 's a real industrial noise and you can hear it for miles . We have people coming to us asking to make less noise or keep it to the daytime . '
The engine works by using the force from a series of explosions , caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake , to thrust itself forward . It can theoretically power planes at five times the speed of sound .
The technology builds upon 'pulsejet ' principles which first emerged in the early 1900s and were used in German V-1 flying bombs .
Test flights using the most recent forms of the technology have lasted only a few seconds , but it is still listed by conspiracy theorists as a possible way of powering the so-called Aurora spy jet .
The theorists have cited 'Aurora ' – a name which appeared in a Pentagon budget report in the 1980s – as an ongoing spy plane project for several years .
Officials routinely deny it exists . Of course , that has not dampened the spirits of the theorists , who point to a sighting of a mysterious triangular object by a North Sea oil engineer in August 1989 .
Last year Lockheed Martin also unveiled plans for a spy plane that could fly at Mach 6 , twice as fast as its famed SR-71 Blackbird , and said a missile demonstrating the new technology could fly as early as 2018 .
Dr Khandelwal was keen to distance himself from the world of conspiracy theories , though he conceded there could always some things unknown to the public .
‘ Of course we ca n't know for sure if someone else could have the technology already , ' he said .
Loud noises : People from Croydon ( left ) to Glasgow ( right ) were left baffled by a string of bangs last night
One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere , which would result in a sonic boom - but this was dismissed by another expert
‘ We ca n't say for sure what this sound was , ' he added . 'It 's possible , but even if it was a PDE , I think half an hour would be a bit too long ! '
Steven Aftergood , a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists , said : 'If an aircraft is responsible , then it 's worth noting that it may not be local at all .
'Because the sound wave that causes the boom can be reflected by the stratosphere , the source of the event could conceivably be hundreds or thousands of miles away from the place where it is heard on the ground . '
But Dr Andrew Taylor , a senior lecturer in aviation at Buckinghamshire New University , said the noises did not sound like a normal sonic boom .
If an aircraft is responsible , then it 's worth noting that it may not be local at all ... The source of the event could conceivably be hundreds or thousands of miles away Steven Aftergood , Federation of American Scientists
'With smaller fighter jets just a single boom would be heard , or , as with Concorde , a `` double boom '' might be heard from larger aircraft as both the nose and tail cause shock waves , ' he said .
'It sounds like gunfire or other ammunition , similar to what I used to hear as a child growing up in Lincolnshire when the RAF & USAF aircraft used to do bombing runs on the east coast bombing ranges .
'It could be geological or meteorological , but certainly not aeronautical in my opinion . '
Many Twitter users suspected sonic booms , similar to ones which shook Kent last month when two RAF jets intercepted a Latvian cargo plane in British airspace .
But a Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline last night she had no records of any jets being scrambled .
Some suggested unusual weather conditions might be the source , but the Met Office dismissed those claims and said there was nothing out of the ordinary .
A spokesman told MailOnline : 'It definitely was n't meteorological ' .
The Metropolitan Police said there had been a fireworks display in Croydon , but Twitter users insisted that could not explain sounds in Bedfordshire , Glasgow , North Devon , Leicestershire and West Sussex .
At around the same time , a loud boom was reported by a number of people in the upstate New York areas of Buffalo , Cheektowaga and Clarence more than 3,000 miles away .
People described it as loud enough to shake their homes and rattle windows .
Theories : There was no shortage of ideas when it came to the possible source of the noises
Claudia Angiletta , who recorded the sounds in Croydon , south London , said she was watching TV at home when the unexplained sounds started .
She told MailOnline : ' I was just at home watching TV when I could n't hear the program due to the loud noises . It was very distracting as it went on for ages .
' I went out to look for fireworks but I could n't see anything in the sky . That 's when I recorded the clip to send to my family to see if they could hear the same thing . '
The 27-year-old said that her family , who live roughly seven miles away in Norbury , south London , could also hear the sounds , which lasted for about 30 minutes . She then turned to Twitter to see if anyone could explain what they were .
Within minutes Twitter users had started spreading hashtags from the straightforward ( # loudbangs ) to the slightly melodramatic ( # omgwereallgoingtodie ) .
Reaction : There was an explosion of activity on Twitter , where some users came up with their own theories
Many of the reports were picked up by Twitter user Virtual Astronomer , who said space debris re-entering the earth 's atmosphere could have been responsible .
'Space debris such as old satellites and things can cause sonic booms heard over very large areas , ' he told MailOnline . 'It 's the same for big meteors or rocks that come in .
'There was very little wind last night so conditions were perfect for sound to travel very long distances . '
Science writer David Dickinson was among the experts who dismissed the meteor theory .
He told MailOnline that there was one piece of debris from Russian satellite Kosmos 2251 scheduled for re-entry , but said that the timing was 'not a good fit ' for it to have been over the UK .
He added : ' I do not think it was a meteor or a piece of space-junk , as the noises mentioned spanned a large segment of time . Plus , unless it was cloudy over the U.K. , there would 've been visual sightings .
# Spooked : Was it an alien invasion , a meteor , the Third World War - or simply a few stray fireworks ?
Dave Reed , who lives in Fareham , Hampshire , said his dogs 'went crazy for a couple of minutes ' after hearing what he had assumed were fireworks .
The noises prompted conspiracy theories and immediate claims of a 'media blackout ' .
Twitter user Carrie Proctor wrote : 'This is how we 'll find our that WW3 has begun . It 'll be a Twitter hashtag long before any official announcement ! '
One MailOnline reader heard similar noises in Belgium .
Hyacinth Fahsi , who lives in Grimbergen , near Brussels , said the sound at 11pm local time - the same time as it was heard in Britain - woke his daughter and matched the recording in Croydon .
Describing the sound as 'repetitive explosions ' , he said : ' I first thought it was firework but it was different . Maybe thunder , but the sky was clear and I did n't see lightning , even far away .
' I was n't thinking about it until my wife read your article . '

Two weeks after she was released on probation , a woman is back in an Alabama jail after she was arrested while trying to break in to it , sheriff 's officials said Thursday .
Talisha Gwen McCann , 42 , of Russellville in Franklin County , was held on multiple criminal counts , including possession of burglar 's tools and possession of a controlled substance , after she was spotted on surveillance video using bolt cutters to try to slice through a fence at the jail late Tuesday night , the Franklin County Sheriff 's Office said .
Sheriff Shannon Oliver told NBC station WAFF of Huntsville that McCann was on a mission to deliver prescription drugs and other contraband to other inmates . When she was arrested , she was carrying two gallon-size bags of tobacco , a cellphone and `` a small amount of suboxone strips , '' Oliver said .
The so-called Internet Wrestling Community ( IWC ) — a global cadre of die-hard fans who endlessly debate the merits and shortcoming of professional wrestling in countless online forums — has lost another member to dating .
Members of the forum on TurnbuckleTalk.com were saddened yesterday when it was revealed that longtime contributor Braden Peterson , who went by the handle NaitchWOO_81 , had disabled his own account after going to the movies with a girl .
More from Kayfabe News
It was the latest in many similar blows to the Internet Wrestling Community , whose vastly male membership engages in long , late-night debates over whether Kenta will get a main-roster push , how Dolph Ziggler should be repackaged , and the innumerable ways in which John Cena sucks .
The cohesiveness and continuity of the Internet Wrestling Community relies almost entirely on its members not spending time with girls . Several wrestling forums have revised their “ Terms & Conditions ” page , requiring new users to click “ agree ” to a clause forbidding them from engaging in conversations with members of the opposite sex .
At least one forum , however , has a caveat : “ If you meet a girl who likes wrestling , go for it . If she can name at least eight former Intercontinental Champions , propose marriage immediately . ”
On the last day of Cleveland Browns training camp , cornerback Joe Haden got a little too rough with his teammates in the opinion of head coach Pat Shurmur . After taking down wide receiver Travis Benjamin from behind in the end zone during 7-on-7 drills , Shurmur demanded that Haden leave the practice field , an order that apparently frustrated the cornerback .
On the play , Haden comes from behind and grabs Benjamin 's jersey after the rookie makes the catch , dragging him to the ground in what could be considered awkward fashion . The wide receiver has already dealt with injuries during training camp this year , making the questionable hit a particularly concerning play for Cleveland 's coaching staff .
Later on Wednesday , Browns president Mike Holmgren told Mary Kay Cabot of The Plain Dealer that Haden was asked to leave practice after getting too rough on a play . Here 's the evidence :

AMSTERDAM — Birmingham City have finally completed the acquisition of free agent US international Jonathan Spector , inking the defensive handyman to a two-year deal on Tuesday .
The erstwhile West Ham United man had been chased since spring by the Brums , as previously reported by MLSsoccer.com . The relegated Europa League entrants had to fend off a challenge from Leeds United right up to the end in order to get their man .
`` Jonathan is a player who has experience playing in the Premier League and as an international for America so he has good credentials , '' Birmingham manager Chris Hughton told the official club website . `` He is versatile and can play in a few positions . I think he will be a big asset for this club . ''
Spector becomes the club 's seventh signing of the summer , closely following the arrival of California-born and Wales goaltender Boaz Myhill to the grounds of St. Andrews .
Where on the pitch Hughton plans to station the 25-year-old is still up in the air . His squad is currently thin in central midfield , where Spector often shined for West Ham in the EPL last season , but key defenders Scott Dann and Liam Ridgewell remain hot transfer topics .
Spector 's first shot at a Blues debut will come when they open the new Championship season with a trip to Derby County on Saturday .
Birmingham City will learn their Europa League playoff round opponent the day prior , and will begin that two-game set on August 18 . For Spector , it will represent his first chance to appear in a UEFA tournament match since 2006 .
Tamar Manasseh formed Mothers Against Senseless Killings and said she is looking for more volunteers . View Full Caption DNAinfo/Andrea V. Watson
ENGLEWOOD — When Tamar Manasseh formed Mothers Against Senseless Killings to patrol the neighborhood after a murder in the 7500 block of South Stewart last month , she hoped to stop any retaliatory violence .
So far , in the five weeks since a man opened fire on three women on June 23 , killing 34-year-old Lucille Barnes , there have been no shootings on the block or on the 7500 block of South Harvard where the patrols have also been set up , according to a DNAinfo Chicago map of shootings in the city .
`` When you have sisters like sister Manasseh and others out here just participating , it makes a big difference , ” said Johnny Banks , the executive director of the community organization A Knock at Midnight .

But Manasseh , who makes the trek daily from her home in Bronzeville to the neighborhood , said her group really needs more people in the area to join the effort , and that recruitment has been difficult .
“ Recruiting and getting more volunteers has been quite the challenge , ” Manasseh said as she sat on her folding chair on 75th Street and Stewart Avenue , watching over the block , not far from where she used to live at 55th Street and Bishop Avenue .
Right now there are about 15 adult volunteers who have pledged to be out there every day until Labor Day . That 's about the same number the group had when it started a few days after the June shooting .
Manasseh said she did n't think it would be this difficult to bring in more concerned residents .
“ What we 've learned since we 've been out here is that people 's attention spans are short , '' she said . `` It 's hard to keep their interests between tragedies . ”
Andrea Watson says organizers want moms to remain active :
The block and surrounding area where the `` army of mothers , '' as she refers to it , have set up have been peaceful since the group formed , she said , but the lack of adult volunteers surprised her .
“ It 's like some people want to put their children in a bubble because they have good kids , ” she said . “ They want to separate their good kids from all of these bad kids , but your kids are going to grow up in the world alongside those very kids that you tried to shield them from . So would n't it be better if you tried to save them all instead of just yours ? ”
She said she had higher expectations for the adults , but underestimated the teens from the neighborhood . At least two dozen teens have taken an interest in keeping their community safe and have taken part in the patrols , Manasseh said .
The ultimate goal is to get people on other blocks to follow her and start their own neighborhood patrols . She said she wants to hold an orientation in the near future to teach them conflict resolution and strategic placement .
Community policing in Englewood and on the South Side is important to Manasseh , she said , because she wants to help save her own children from becoming victims of the violence .
Chicago Police did not respond to a request for comment .
Banks ' group , which provides direct services such as workforce development , family advocacy and more to Englewood residents , encourages more adults to volunteer , but he said he understands why some might be hesitant .
“ It 's not easy , ” he said . “ Our people are afraid so they do n't participate . ''
He said that 's all the more reason the group of moms and others should be praised for their courage and determination .
Manasseh said although the neighborhood has changed since she was a child , she is holding on to one day seeing a better , safer community .
“ It 's like Englewood is the land that time forgot , ” she said . “ It 's the land that has been forgotten , but I have hope , I see hope here . ”
In addition to seeking more volunteers , she 's asking for water and any other donations , which can be dropped off daily between 4-8 p.m. at 75th and Stewart .

When it came to light that law enforcement has issued millions of annual requests/demands to the wireless carriers ( AT & T , Verizon , etc ) to hand over user data , we all got a little concerned . Our carriers know everything about us , and according to findings by Rep. Markey ( D-MA ) , `` Information shared with law enforcement includes data such as geolocation information , content of text messages , wiretaps , among others . ''
But ! We have weapons . Here are some tricks to help protect your privacy .
THEY CAN SUBPOENA YOUR TEXT MESSAGES
The basic idea : you can encrypt your text messages so even if they 're handed over to , you know , whoever , they wo n't be readable . It 's password protection , really .
iOS : Your friends will hate you , but Encrypt SMS is a good tool for iOS . It costs a buck , and will encrypt your text message with AES-256 security , the same basically unbreakable encryption used by Julian Assange to protect his `` thermonuclear '' insurance file . Both you and the recipient have to have this app installed , and the messages themselves are password-protected . This should protect you from unwanted spying from your carrier .
Android : Android is easier , or more paranoid , maybe . WhisperSys makes an app called TextSecure that 'll lock your texts right up , caching them only locally on your phone .
THEY CAN TAP YOUR PHONE CALLS
Law enforcement has also been after the content of phone calls . Turns out you can encrypt those too , though not quite as easily .
iOS : The big player here is CellCrypt , which is really designed for government use more than consumer use ( they have a hefty yearly fee , for example ) . Also , if you are paranoid , you might note that CellCrypt is cuddly with Verizon . You could try Kryptos instead , which also has AES-256 encryption and costs only $ 10 per month extra .
Android : WhisperSys also makes an app called RedPhone , which encrypts your phone calls end-to-end . Pretty sweet !
THEY CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON THE NETWORK
... So do n't use the network ! You can use Wi-Fi for most communications , especially if you live in a city with lots of hotspots . Of course , that comes with its own headaches -- Wi-Fi hotspots are very easily hacked -- but at least you wo n't be dealing with the carriers . And given that the carriers seem okay with giving `` tower dumps '' -- basically , all of the info from one tower , which could mean the data from thousands of users -- it could only help your privacy to stay away from those towers .
Apple 's iMessage , which communicates between Apple devices , uses a data connection that is not routed through your carrier 's servers the way SMS texting is . It 'll take advantage of Wi-Fi if you 're on a Wi-Fi network , which is a good thing to do whenever it 's available -- it 's much harder for your wireless carrier to monitor ( or , less scarily but more annoyingly , to wildly overcharge for ) Wi-Fi use . BlackBerry Messenger , which has its own encryption , is similar -- although its encryption does n't work when the police seize your phone .
You could try a VoIP option to replace your carrier-monitored phone calls , but those are not always more secure . TextPlus and Talkatone , for iOS , Android , and Windows Phone , all set you up with a new number/address and allow you to make phone calls and send text messages over a data network like Wi-Fi . But ! According to their privacy policies , they also store your messages and usage history , and will hand over that data if needed -- just like the carriers . So encryption is really more important here than which service you use . CSipSimple is a VoIP app with much more intense security -- it sets up its own container for the call , while apparently not interfering with the actual content of the call at all .
THEY CAN TELL WHERE YOU ARE
One of the scariest bits of information carriers ( and thus law enforcement ) has access to is your precise location , which can be gotten both from precise GPS coordinates and from tower triangulation -- figuring out where you are based on how strong your signal is from each of several towers . This causes well-deserved freakouts every once in awhile . There are ways to keep your phone from knowing where you are , though . Both iOS and Android have fairly simple ways to opt out of location tracking in the settings .
Android : Go to Settings , then Location Services . Uncheck all of the boxes .
iOS : Go to Settings , then Privacy , then Location Services . Unswitch all of the switches .
The problem is that both Android and iOS keep your location cached on your device , which could be bad if anyone every confiscates it . If you root your Android device or jailbreak your iOS device , you can find apps to get rid of all that data . Lifehacker recommends Location Cache for Android and Untrackerd for iOS .
Once that 's all taken care of , perhaps you 'd like to go old-school with an offline map ? Galileo is a decent one for iOS , and Android users can just use the offline version of the built-in Google Maps . Or they can try one of several others , like MapDroyd .
And , of course , you can just throw your phone into airplane mode when you 're not using it to prevent it from gathering any data .
THE FAIL-SAFE
Drive over the Manhattan Bridge at night on a weekday . Heave your phone into the East River . Buy a beeper , and only use pay phones . Never use the same pay phone twice . Congratulations , you are safe .
“ There is no analogous election in the modern era where the two top candidates for the nomination are as divisive and weak , ” said Steve Schmidt , a top campaign adviser to George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008 . “ There is no precedent for it . ”
Mrs. Clinton 's commanding wins in the swing states of Ohio , North Carolina and Florida seemed to hobble the once robust challenge of Senator Bernie Sanders . And Mr. Trump 's dominance in Florida , North Carolina and Illinois knocked out Senator Marco Rubio and propelled Mr. Trump even closer to the Republican nomination .
This would be the moment , under normal circumstances , when the de facto nominees , emerging victorious from the intramural skirmishes of their parties ' nominating contests , would invite an eager national electorate to take their measure . And in their victory speeches , both tried their best , issuing broad appeals for Americans to unite behind them .
But Mr. Trump has unnerved many Americans with his inflammatory oratory and radical-sounding proposals . And Mrs. Clinton , while viewed as a more seasoned and serious political figure , has struggled in her campaign to win the trust of the American electorate . And it is all but impossible for the country to take a fresh look at them .

They 're called the quarterbacks of the defense and for good reason . Here are the top-rated middle linebackers in Madden NFL 17 .
Kuechly is the stereotypical linebacker and the leagues premiere defender in the box . He excels in every aspect of the game . His 86 speed ranks him near the tops in the league , while his coverage skills are n't even close to being matched by another linebacker in the game .
Marshall came onto the scene last season for the Super Bowl winning Broncos as a defender that can play sideline to sideline in coverage . His 85 speed allows him to matchup against most tight ends and half backs in the game .
Johnson rounds out the Chiefs trio of all-pro linebackers . He plays more of a coverage roll and will be called upon to defend tight ends in the seam .
Wagner ranks among the fastest linebackers in the game . His 88 speed is faster than most tight ends on the field and occasionally opposing half backs . Utilize his speed by matching him up in man to man situations and let his athleticism do the rest .
Collins is one of the league 's best in terms of pure coverage ability . His 6 ' 3 ” frame and 85 speed allow him to match up in man to man situations against opposing tight ends and half backs out of the backfield . He also has the rare ability to rush the passer with 93 power moves .
The announcement that the doctoral title of German Education Minister Annette Shavan would be revoked came as no great surprise to the German public . Schavan , a close confidant of Chancellor Angela Merkel , has long dodged accusations that she plagiarized parts of her doctoral thesis , which she submitted in 1980 . Based on an internal analysis of the thesis -- as well as on her own statement regarding her work -- a committee at the University of Düsseldorf voted 12 to 2 to invalidate her academic title .
Bruno Bleckmann , a professor of ancient history at the university , announced the decision at a press conference on Tuesday evening . `` As a doctoral candidate , she systematically and deliberately presented intellectual efforts throughout her entire dissertation that were not her own , '' he said .
It was a matter of hours before the first calls for her resignation were ringing out from opposition political camps , including the Social Democrats ( SPD ) , the Greens , the Left Party and the Pirates . The unanimous consensus was that the politician , a member of Merkel 's cabinet and her conservative Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) party , is no longer acceptable as the figurehead of Germany 's academic community . Shavan must `` face her consequences , '' SPD General Secretary Andrea Nahles told the conservative daily Die Welt . A minister of the sciences , `` who demonstrates a gross disrespect for scientific rules , is no longer sustainable , '' said senior Green Party leader Renate Kunäst .
Suspicions about the academic integrity of Shavan 's doctoral work were first raised last spring and intensified in October when a blogger released detailed findings of citation shortcomings he had found in the education minister 's dissertation . She has consistently denied the charges , admitting merely to `` oversights . ''
Merkel Has 'Full Confidence ' in Minister
Schavan appears prepared to put up a strong fight to defend her Ph.D. `` I will not accept the decision by the University of Düsseldorf and I will sue , '' the education minister said on Wednesday in Johannesburg , South Africa , where she is currently traveling for five days . `` With regard to the legal dispute , please understand that I will not be providing any additional statements today . ''
One day earlier , Schavan 's lawyer Bleckmann released a statement saying , `` There was no cheating involved . ''
Several members of the CDU and their coalition partner , the FDP , came forward to defend her , with CDU Deputy Floor Leader Michael Kretschmer calling the process a `` politically motivated campaign '' against the minister .
Through her spokesman , Merkel expressed her `` full confidence '' in Schavan on Wednesday , saying the two would have the opportunity to `` speak in peace with each other '' when Schavan returns from South Africa . The chancellor added that she valued Schavan 's work as a minister extraordinarily . But many are questioning how long that support will last as the chancellor heads into what could be a tough re-election battle .
The chancellor already lost one minister to a plagiarism scandal : Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg stepped down in the spring of 2011 after it was determined that he had plagiarized large sections of his Ph.D. thesis .
And statements made by Schavan at the time of the Guttenberg scandal will in no way strengthen her case , as some detractors have already pointed out . `` As someone who wrote a doctorate myself 31 years ago and has worked in a professional capacity with many Ph.D. candidates , '' she said at the time , `` I am ashamed , not only privately . ''
Some are now asking if Schavan is applying double standards between her work and that of Guttenberg . Still , German news agency DPA is reporting sources stating she does n't plan to resign , although , some members of her party are questioning whether the minister can survive the political pressure in the long term .
The German press report the story widely on Wednesday . Though commentators across the political spectrum express the sentiment that the revocation seems unfair , there is also widespread consensus that , given the ruling , Schavan may have no choice but to step down .
The center-left Süddeutsche Zeitung writes :
`` With Guttenberg and Schavan , the government has a plagiarizer rate of 12.5 percent . That 's almost as much as the percentage of flawed pages in Schavan 's doctoral thesis . This is harming the conservative coalition government , of all times in an election year , and the civic virtues it holds so high : motivation and abiding by the rules . Plagiarizers disregard both of those . ''
`` The Faculty of Philosophy in Düsseldorf revoked the education minister 's doctoral degree with cool severity . The investigating committee could have come to a totally different decision , but in the end the vote was clear : revocation of the Ph.D. , and thus the highest academic penalty for Professor Schavan . The decision is legally justifiable , however it was n't right . First of all , Shavan 's case was a toss-up -- that much was made clear by the long deliberation of the university . Secondly , the mistakes were made 30 years in the past . They could have taken all that into account and issued a reprimand -- then let it be . ''
`` The decision against Schavan sets a strict benchmark for the review of dissertations that have long been yellowing in the libraries . One can be anxious to see how many more degrees are yet to fall victim . ''
The mass-circulation daily Bild writes :
`` With the revocation of her Ph.D. title , the life 's work of Annette Schavan has been destroyed . As German education minister , she is the leading figure for professors , postgraduates and students . She has been education minister for more than seven years -- education and research are her core values , the basis of her political actions . When now , of all things , it comes to light that the education minister has cheated on her doctoral thesis , it 's as if the finance minister were caught hiding his money in Switzerland or the transportation minister were driving drunk . ''
`` Schavan has dedicated her life to politics . She is one of Merkel 's closest confidants . Until now , the chancellor has adamantly stuck by her . But this may have crossed a line for her as well . Schavan is clever enough to recognize that and accept the consequence -- resignation . For her , there is no alternative . ''
The conservative Die Welt writes :
`` The revocation of Schavan 's Ph.D. title is legally tricky . Nevertheless , the education minister will not get around facing the consequences . During the debate about Guttenberg , Schavan praised the University of Bayreuth 's examination procedure . Schavan 's argument was that the sciences must be independent and credible . ''
`` Back in 1980 , it was the matter of a small college and a young woman who , because of a good job offer , was in a hurry to finish her doctorate . The questionable passages of her work are not mere slips of the pen , but they are open to interpretation . What is expressed scientifically was clear even in Einstein 's time . But Schavan 's case is not a prime example of deliberate deception . The passages usually contain the name of the authors who are quoted -- it 's just that not all the adopted ideas are properly attributed to them . This can be interpreted as the insertion of unedited notes in an effort to represent the state of research with the highest possible accuracy -- or , of course , as plagiarism . Multiple possibilities of interpretation are a cause for caution before judgment . ''
`` The passages in the thesis are not new . They have existed since 1980 , the cited works even longer . Schavan will be handled more severely than tax dodgers who hide their assets deliberately for years . Such sinners enjoy immunity after 13 years . Schavan is denied the same after 33 -- in a case that is morally light years away from tax evasion , and is by nature very open to interpretation . That 's not right . Nevertheless , she now has little choice . According to her own standard , she would for the time being had to leave her office . ''
The left-leaning Berliner Zeitung writes :
`` It was meant to be an unbiased review with no regard to the person or her position . But it 's clear now that the university 's decision concerned more than just the academic reputation of Schavan . An education minister convicted of having plagiarized portions of her dissertation can hardly remain in office . ''
`` The scholars in Düsseldorf declined to call in reviewers outside the university . They seemed to be absolutely sure of themselves . Yet their roll as diligent inspectors will become a matter for political discussion in the coming weeks . The fact that Schavan 's work has enormous academic shortcomings is indisputable . But whether she should undergo a re-evaluation with massive consequences for her career , 30 years after the fact , is at the very least questionable . If this were a matter of criminal law , the statute of limitations would have long expired . ''
`` Düsseldorf University was not able to take up an objective standpoint because its own reputation was at risk , too . Schavan may lose her degree , but the losses to academia have yet to be calculated . ''
The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes :
`` The university 's discretionary powers were limited . They were first and foremost concerned with their own reputation -- and that has without a doubt taken a hit . The university has done little to back up the legitimacy of their decision , but instead has settled for only what was absolutely necessary from an administrative law perspective . They did n't hire an outside review specialist , nor did they listen to the dissertation adviser . It 's also incomprehensible why they needed a good 10 months to come to a decision when other universities in similar situations have done so within three months . ''
`` Schavan will take the decision to court . That path is available to her , but it wo n't protect her from the question of whether she can keep her position in the cabinet . A federal education minister who disregarded the ground rules of academia in her research would stand under constant pressure to justify herself . The question is just how many others will have to have their doctoral degrees revoked when their dissertations are reviewed . Therein lies the unfairness of plagiarism reviews of politicians ' theses . Sooner or later the chancellor -- especially in an election year -- will have to rebuild her cabinet . ''
Hundreds Dead , Hundreds Missing After Typhoon Slams Philippines

`` The death toll from a typhoon that ravaged the Philippines jumped to 238 Wednesday with hundreds missing , as rescuers battled to reach areas cut off by floods and mudslides , '' The Manila Times writes .
It adds that `` Typhoon Pablo ( international codename : Bopha ) slammed into the southern island of Mindanao Tuesday , toppling trees and blowing away homes with 210-kilometre ( 130-mile ) per hour gusts before easing overnight as it headed towards the South China Sea . ''
As often happens during disasters , as information comes in the details are changing — unfortunately , for the worse . The latest update from the Philippines ' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council says there have been at least 274 deaths .
From Manila , The Wall Street Journal reports that `` Philippine disaster authorities struggled Wednesday to cope with the devastation wrought by Typhoon Bopha . ... Rescue teams tried to reach isolated residents in places that the storm churned into a sea of mud , upended trees , toppled electrical poles and flattened buildings or tore off their roofs . Wide areas were without electricity for the second day . The government used trucks and boats to bring supplies of food , blankets , medicines and cadaver bags to stricken areas . ''
Not long before iconic 1970s and '80s wrestler Bruiser Brody was killed by a colleague in 1989 , he gave a no-holds-barred interview on the state of wrestling and what goes on behind the scenes . He talked at length about his days producing the WCCW telecast . After the interviewer asked if anybody — outside of the business — knew about that , Brody paused , mild consternation creasing his scarred forehead . “ I do n't think it 's good that anybody knows that I produced that show , ” he said . And then , referring to having stated his real name earlier in the conversation : “ I do n't think it 's good that anybody knows I 'm Frank Goodish . ”
I have no idea who the interviewer was , or why he recorded it . But three years ago , somebody uploaded the video to YouTube , and Internet apocrypha was born : This was the first shoot interview , the Dead Sea Scrolls of pro-wrestling postmodernism .
To many in-the-know wrestling fans , shoot interviews inhabit a place of great significance in the appreciation of the sport . While a worked shoot , like CM Punk 's tirade from last summer , is the staged manipulation of reality within wrestling 's peculiar unreality , a plain shoot is the real thing , raw and divorced from any narrative manipulations . Sometimes these shoots occur during a wrestling event , as in the dying days of Power Pro Wrestling , when Doug Gilbert mentioned that his rival , Brian Christopher , was only champion because his father was regional honcho Jerry Lawler . He also repeated allegations that Lawler raped a 13-year-old girl ( the victim recanted ) and said that the company 's owner smoked crack . It 's unclear whether Gilbert was told to shoot and just went too far , or whether he went off-script unilaterally . More often than not , however , shoots are conducted away from the wrestling world .
These shoot interviews , hundreds of which populate YouTube , are generally conducted by enterprising wrestling websites , and always feature an unemployed wrestler of some former eminence . They 're usually shot backstage at a convention , in an office or back room , with a camcorder trained on the subject while an interviewer asks questions about the backstage dealings during their time in WWE or WCW . Just about everybody who has ever left WWE with an ax to grind — or anyone who 's too old to care about future employment — seems to have recorded a shoot interview . It 's so common that some of them have even been rehired by WWE , despite the fact that such interviews break kayfabe , the collective suspension of disbelief on which pro wrestling relies and the industry 's most sacred tenet . These are modern times , after all . In the Reality Era , even the rules of kayfabe are made to be broken .
In the early days of the Internet , you defined yourself as a superfan if you were a tape-trader , somebody who would mail dubbed VHS cassettes of great matches , often from faraway regional federations or even foreign countries , in promise of receiving similar tapes from a message-board pen pal . These were fans so zealous that even horizontal static and Japanese announcers could n't dissuade them . In the days of YouTube , though , superfans prefer the shoot interview — the extreme of knowledge , if not experience . It 's a weird effect of the Internet age that extends beyond wrestling — we care more about inside dirt than actual knowledge .
Shoots like Brody 's and Gilbert 's used to be shocking and rare . Nowadays , they take up more airtime than actual wrestling . Just look at the past month or so . Heading into WrestleMania on April 1 , WWE has sent its storylines into a spiral of reality-based monologue .
Monday , March 12 's episode of Raw opened with a John Cena “ rap ” — technically , it was more like a freestyle poetry slam — and ended with a “ rock concert ” by The Rock . The latter performance amounted to 10 minutes of The Rock parodying Cena to the rough tune of “ Heartbreak Hotel ” “ Jailhouse Rock ” and then mangling a cover of “ We Will Rock You. ” It was n't exactly a stirring prelude to their upcoming WrestleMania meeting . For two guys — two wrestlers — who profess to hate each other , they seem oddly content to do little more than talk trash , but at least their musical showdown was n't just talk . Talk seems to be the guiding principle in their feud — they 're amped up and pissed off , but they wo n't get in the ring with each other . It 's all Mania , no Wrestle .
The Rock-John Cena rivalry stretches back to before last year 's WrestleMania , when Rocky hosted ‘ Mania and interfered in Cena 's bout with The Miz . The next night , they agreed to a fight at WrestleMania 28 . Presumably , WWE thought that a match so big — the biggest star of this era versus the biggest star of the previous one — deserved a full year of hype . If that seems like too much buildup , well , it was n't — their interaction in the meantime has amounted only to one reluctant team-up at Survivor Series and a few in-ring insult contests . And even with a year to manufacture some beef , the roots of their animus exist only in broad strokes — Cena thinks Rock is a sellout and Rock thinks Cena is lame . Ever since The Rock returned to WWE in a “ full-time ” on-screen role several weeks ago , he and Cena have spent most of their screen time badmouthing one another to the fans ; on the few occasions when they 've shared the ring , they both seemed ill at ease . It 's easier to talk trash when you 're not facing your adversary . And it 's easier to sing a song , apparently , than to throw a punch .
The CM Punk-Chris Jericho feud , which many have seen as the “ real fan ” respite to the Rock-Cena hype show — is nominally about which of them is the “ best in the world , ” a mantle Punk has claimed recently but that Jericho has insisted upon in many of his previous incarnations . Despite the physical interaction they 've had in the run-up to WrestleMania , they both seem oddly content to defer to verbal sparring , which is odd for two guys so confident of their preeminence . In the past two weeks , Jericho has , for no apparent reason , turned to bringing up Punk 's family history of substance abuse ( Punk himself is straight-edge ) to needle his adversary . The net value of alcoholism storylines in WWE over the years — Road Warrior Hawk , Jake “ The Snake ” Roberts — has n't come out positive , unless you count “ Stone Cold ” Steve Austin 's six-year run at the top , but regardless , it all seems wholly unnecessary .
The six-on-six match between the proxies of Raw GM John Laurinaitis and Smackdown GM Teddy Long is built on the power struggle between Laurinaitis , a hilariously booable wrestler turned WWE talent wrangler whose recent turn playing himself on TV has been mostly revelatory , and Long , an ineffectual on-screen personality whose chief attributes are his wrestling-world tenure and familiarity . Not only are these men not wrestlers — not that that has ever been a disqualifier for entry into WrestleMania — there is no chance that they 'll ever come to blows . Sure , they toss off their sport coats and act really mad , but Long never engages in physicality , to the point that we can assume he 's medically unable to do so . Which is to say that when the fighting finally starts in this one , it 'll be a sidebar to an imaginary front-office argument .
I guess I should give credit to the Kane-Randy Orton feud for its consistent brawling , but the action has been so slapdash and so obviously aimed at Mania that on Friday night , Orton came to the ring and straightforwardly asked Kane why they 're feuding , and Kane explained in his usual demonic , long-winded way . “ That was very enlightening , ” Orton said , and he challenged Kane to a fight . Kane politely demurred . He wanted to save it for WrestleMania . If a maniacal monster can be patient , I guess us fans should also wait , right ?
Perhaps the most representative feud heading into WrestleMania has been the Hell in a Cell cage match between Triple H and the Undertaker . It 's an unabashedly meta storyline , a grudge based on whether a match will take place . Undertaker appeared a few weeks ago — for the first time since last year 's Mania — and , in a reference to the setup of their match last year , challenged Triple H to a staredown . Triple H declined because , as CFO COO of the WWE , he has to put away childish things like physical grievance and be more concerned about the Undertaker “ franchise. ” After Taker and Trips debated this point , Shawn Michaels — Triple H 's buddy and Taker 's opponent in WrestleManias 25 and 26 — showed up to discuss the potential match . Last Monday , the three of them got in the ring together and talked it over again . This all amounts to five separate conversations , and despite Triple H 's protestations about ending Undertaker 's career , there seems to be little ill will between Undertaker and Triple H. Two giants of wrestling 's last decade in a dangerous , high-profile match will always drum up some interest , but as high as the stakes are , this bout seems more like a “ Reality Era ” storyline than anything Triple H did with Punk last year . It 's a feud based on whether or not to have a match , and whether business is more important than “ the business. ” They 're giving us backstage dialogue and expecting it to add up to a brawl . When Taker and Triple H start bloodying each other , one will be bound to wonder what they 're both so pissed off about .
This all suggests that WWE has finally heard the call of fans who care more about talk than , you know , wrestling . People like to say that wrestling is “ a soap opera for men , ” but as someone who 's watched more than a few episodes of Days of Our Lives , I can say that soap operas have more fistfights than Monday Night Raw these days . Maybe it 's just a byproduct of the level of planning that goes into the WrestleMania card , that WWE planned all these matches weeks and months ago and they 're just treading water in the interim . In many ways , it 's the direct opposite of the summer season that saw CM Punk catch lightning in a bottle last year ; that period in the wrestling calendar is always more fluid , more open to sublime happenstance . The road to WrestleMania is pure , choreographed capitalism .
One can not listen to all the talk between Cena and the Rock , Punk and Jericho , and ‘ Trips and ‘ Taker without hearing echoes of the Summer of Punk — the Undertaker 's corporate value , Punk 's alcoholic dad , Cena 's barbs about Rock 's writing team and Rock 's barbs about Cena having a wife . If this is the fruit of the Reality Era , a wrestling world in which “ real talk ” is interchangeable with violence and where fans have chosen shoot interviews over wrestling tapes , if we 're bound to a “ reality ” where feuds are n't fights but discussions , then it 's just rotten fruit .
Over the years , WWE has scrubbed the word “ wrestling ” from their glossary as best they could . Wrestlers are “ superstars ” or , more casually , “ competitors , ” and WWE no longer stands for “ World Wrestling Entertainment ” — it 's just plain WWE . I guess it should n't be surprising that they 're pulling the wrestling out of the product so cavalierly . It 's like Coca-Cola changing its name to “ Coke ” and messing with the recipe . Just because they suddenly say wrestling no longer exists does n't mean we wo n't remember it .
Despite the monotony of the buildup , however , I 'm sure WrestleMania will be good . I mean , it wo n't be a four-hour monologue — it ca n't possibly be , right ? When Rock and Cena or Punk and Jericho or Triple H and the Undertaker are going at it in the ring , we probably wo n't even remember all the conversation that went into the buildup . We 'll just be thinking , Now this is wrestling . Regardless of what they want to call it .
According to scientists monitoring solar activity , a mass ejection of particles from the sun two days ago means that the light displays tonight could be of unusual intensity – and that they should be visible from much further south than normal .
Scientists from the Space Weather Prediction Centre in Boulder , Colorado , have predicted that the solar storm that is heading this way could mean that displays of the lights measured on what is called the KP Index could rise from a reading of one ( visible in northern Scandinavia ) to a reading of seven ( visible in southern Wales and parts of southern England ) .
“ This is not an exact science but the likelihood is that tonight could provide people in southern parts of Britain a rare opportunity , ” said Mark Haywood on behalf of Off the Map Travel , a soft adventure travel company that specialises in the Northern Lights . “ I for one will be heading up to the clear skies of the Lake District and hoping for the best . ”
The impact of the solar storm was expected to be felt by early evening with readings of the KP Index reaching 7 by midnight . Experts suggested that between midnight and 3am would be the optimum time for views of the lights – also known as the aurora borealis .
Specialists working on AuroraWatch UK – a research programme operated at Lancaster University – confirmed that the solar storm was heading this way , but urged people not to be overly confident of viewings .
“ We do not want to get too many people 's hopes up only to see them dashed , but are observing closely and the conditions do look promising , ” said Steve Marple , a member of the AuroraWatch UK research team . “ We expect the solar storm to have arrived by the evening – and then just hope that the orientation of the magnetic field will be in the right direction . ''
Another key factor in lights viewings is the weather . Earlier forecasts today suggested that most of Britain would be clear this evening and into the night .
Marple advised all those wanting to try their luck at a viewing to follow the following guidelines :
* keep away from urban light pollution
* find spots with good views of the horizon in the north
* try to get onto higher ground
AuroraWatch UK offers a light alerts service via email , Twitter and Facebook ( see aurorawatch.lancs.ac.uk/alerts ) . On its site it also provides a detailed map of some of the best places in Britain from which to photograph the lights ( aurorawatch.lancs.ac.uk/photo_sites ) . Most of the sites listed are unsurprisingly in Scotland and northern England . What could be different tonight is that the borealis could be seen from as far south as Birmingham .
Should the sight of the lights whet the appetitite , most companies specialising in trips to northern Scandinavia , from which the lights are more commonly sighted , have laid on extra itineraries to cater for demand from people wanting to take advantage of the current “ solar maximum ” – a high in the 11-year cycle that governs auroral activity .
According to Jonny Cooper , managing director of Off the Map Travel : “ The solar maximum has already thrown up some incredible northern lights displays in destinations such as Bjorkliden in Northern Sweden , one of the best places in the world to see the lights . ”
What are the Northern Lights ?
Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth 's atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce different coloured lights ( oxygen produces green and yellow ; nitrogen blue ) . The scientific term for the lights is the aurora borealis ( named after the Roman goddess of the dawn ) . A similar spectacle in the southern hemisphere is known as the aurora australis .
Where can you see them ?
The aurora borealis occurs in an oval doughnut-shaped area located above the magnetic pole . The best sightings are within the “ doughnut ” ( rather than at the pole itself ) , and away from artificial light and moonlight .
The oval rotates with the sun , and it may grow and shrink in size considerably in only a matter of hours . The most spectacular displays occur in the northern parts of the following areas : the Nordic countries of Sweden , Norway , Finland ( including all of Greenland and Svalbard ) , Alaska , Canada and Russia .
Closer to home , fainter displays of the lights can regularly be seen from Scotland . During periods of “ solar maximum ” , as now , they have been viewed from southern England .
When to go
Displays of the lights are notoriously unpredictable and can not be forecast in advance . In the northern hemisphere , the aurora season runs from late September or early October to late March . The lights may be seen at any time during this period , but late October , November , February and March are the best bets .

The lights may be seen at any time during this period , but late October , November , February and March are the best bets .
Displays are governed by an 11-year cycle and are at their most dramatic during times of high solar activity , such as now , but sightings can be recorded at any time . It is impossible to guarantee a viewing even during a period of “ solar maximum ” ; if the sky is cloudy , the lights will be concealed .

About
Maker Pipe
Maker Pipe is a simple , affordable , easy-to use system of connectors that pairs with inexpensive electrical conduit you can find at any hardware store . The result is a building platform with endless possibilities .
Electrical Metal Conduit
The Maker Pipe building platform uses electrical metal conduit or electrical metal tubing ( `` EMT '' ) . EMT is can be found at just about any local or big box hardware store , making it extremely accessible . The traditional use of EMT is to house electrical wires in construction , but it is perfect for making . What makes electrical conduit so awesome is its low cost , durability , and strength . It typically comes in 10 or 5 foot lengths .
Electrical conduit and Maker Pipe connectors are strong ! Yep , THAT strong .
Another great thing about EMT is it can be bent with a typical pipe bender ( costs around $ 40.00 ) to customize and add some personality to your construction .
The Maker Pipe Building System
The Maker Pipe connectors are steel and have an industrial strength coating for appearance and protection from the elements .
The Standard Connector ( will be black in production )
Here is what you get with each Standard Connector :
The 90 degree Connector
Here is what you get with each 90 degree Connector :
The 180 degree Connector
Here is what you get with each 180 degree Connector :
The 3 Way Connector
Here is what you get with each 3 Way Connector :
Connection Caps/Sleeves are critical to the Maker Pipe system . They provide the grip needed by the connectors to do such a tremendous job ! There are two versions , the Connection Cap is used for a pipe end and the Connection Sleeve is used for anywhere in between . These parts come ready to go and just need to be slipped on .
You have the option to upgrade your pipe to a full wrap . Maker Pipe Wrap is available in 10 foot lengths that will completely cover a 10 foot section of conduit . It gives you the flexibility to put connectors anywhere along the pipe and adds some of your personal style . The wrap is UV stable and is approved for outdoor use .
Maker Pipe Wrap is available in a variety of colors .
After heat application , it looks sharp !
All you need is a Pipe Cutter , 5mm Allen Wrench , Marker , and Tape Measure . This makes Maker Pipe extremely approachable and portable . You are no longer bound by the need for electricity or battery life !
How to Build
First things first , come up with a plan as to what you are looking to build . Then decide on your measurements and mark the pipe accordingly .
Next , use your hand held pipe cutter to cut the pipe to the desired lengths .
Now , place your connector caps/sleeves in the desired locations . These locations would be anywhere you are planning on placing your connectors . The caps are for the ends of the pipe and the sleeves are for placement in the middle .
Next , attach your connector over the connector cap/sleeve .
Fasten with your nut & bolt and tighten with your Allen/hex wrench .
Continue building using these same steps until you have completed your construction . Be sure to tighten all connectors when building is complete .
Extra : As an option to the Connection Caps/Sleeves , Maker Pipe can be easily customized with our colorful wrap . Not only does this add style , but it also gives the pipe a `` finished '' look . If you choose to personalize your build with our colorful wrap , all you will need to do is cut the wrap to match the lengths of your pipe . Be sure to leave about ¾ inch extra on each end , so that you can fold the wrap in after it has been heated . This gives the pipe a great look and also protects surfaces from the metal conduit ends . Use a standard heat gun ( costs around $ 30.00 ) and work from one end to the other , turning the pipe as you go . When using a full length of wrap there is no need to use the connector sleeves .
Build Anything !
These are just some of the items we decided to build with the first prototypes . We ca n't wait to see what you build with Maker Pipe !
Portable Bike Stand
Glass Top Desk
Garage Shelving & Tool Rack
Chairs , Table & Patio Canopy
How we got here
Maker Pipe was born out of the need to make custom items for our homes and workplaces . Many prototypes and revisions later , we are proud to offer it up to the Kickstarter community . Here are some photos of our prototypes to date :
We are at a point now where we can not go any further without your help . Maker Pipe connectors will be steel and stamped from thick sheet metal . It 's really the only way to have the strength and rigidity required , while making the price affordable for everyone . This can not happen without the creation of sheet metal stamping dies , which can be very expensive . For example , the investment in production tooling for our four connectors is well over $ 60,000 . BUT , with your backing and support , we will be able to pay for the initial material and labor costs of production , plus have a little leftover to cover a portion of the initial tooling investment . It will get us us started , and allow everyone to have a better way to build !
Rewards
We ca n't do this without you and truly appreciate your support at any level . We love the $ 1 donations and are thrilled that you care enough to support . If you can do something more , great ! We ca n't wait to get Maker Pipe into your hands and see what you will build . Our rewards are made up of the same four connectors and accessories , just in different quantities . Check out the early bird discount while they last , we discounted them 15-25 % over our already discounted campaign pricing to get this thing rolling !
Maker Pipe Vision
Have you had ever built something custom , that truly meets your needs or has allowed you to express your creativity ? It 's an awesome accomplishment and whether you did that yesterday or a while back , that feeling is hard to forget . Maybe you even shared that special moment with someone you care about ... those memories endure . That 's why we are so passionate about putting Maker Pipe in everyone 's hands . We want more people to feel that sense of accomplishment and experience those special moments with others . It can be life changing at the individual level , maybe even a movement if more of us are enabled to make .
We would love to see Maker Pipe fulfill that dream and grow into an expansive building system with an enthusiastic community . We are passionate about making the connectors available so that everyone has a better way to build , create , and see their dreams become reality . We love the creativity and passion that the Maker community has and would be honored to see Maker Pipe be a part of that . In addition to the connectors we plan to produce all kinds of additional goodies to help people be creative with conduit . We see the need for many different connectors and accessories to really unleash the power of Maker Pipe . We can also see a day where we create connectors for different size conduit and pipe . Back us today so we can make our first production connectors and you can make whatever you want !
Scientists are warning that global warming will continue to shrink the size of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago so that it will threaten multiple polar bear populations with extinction . This is because the loss of area upon which to hunt will greatly shorten the hunting season for the bears . It is during this time that they traditionally load up on seal fat to make it through the harsh winter . As the ice area reduces in size , populations of polar bears will have to migrate further away in search of food leaving them less prepared to face the elements .
Thus far , the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has been considered the sole remaining safe “ ice area ” for the polar bears . Dr. Andrew Derocher of the University of Alberta explained that their computer sea ice projections do not paint a hopeful picture for how well the ice area will fare . Interestingly enough , the arctic ice cap on the South Pole has increased by a whopping 29 % over the past year despite global warming . That figure was validated by satellite imagery and not by any model of projected growth or contraction . Still , Dr. Derocher believes that polar bears will be encountering the same types of population declines that he and his colleagues “ know ” will happen to other species further south in the coming years .
It is Dr. Derocher 's professional opinion that polar bears will face a brisk population decline of 25 % . Such a decline would have the effect of wiping out populations of the bear across the region . His computer model suggests that by 2050 , the polar bear population will have been greatly reduced in size . For what it 's worth , conservation efforts since the 1970s have succeeded at steadily increasing the polar bear population . Dr. Derocher says that global warming has now become the new threat for the bears .

Chelsea have been told they will have to pay £42million for midfielder Andre Gomes after making an approach for Valencia star .
Gomes , 22 , impressed for Portugal in their 1-1 draw with Iceland on Tuesday night .
Chelsea have turned their attentions to him with Roma determined to keep another of the Blues ' targets , Radja Nainggolan . Chelsea have had a £27million offer rejected and Roma will now offer Nainggolan a new deal .
But Valencia has slapped a massive price tag on Gomes because his former club Benfica have a 25percent sell-on clause .
In pictures - Portugal 1-1 Iceland :
Valencia also want to claw back cash for their coach , Pako Ayestaran , to strengthen their squad .
Chelsea have stepped up their transfer activity with the club keen to make progress in time for the arrival of new coach Antonio Conte .
The Italian will join after his country 's involvement at the Euros . Everton will make a last-ditch to prevent Romelu Lukaku joining him at Stamford Bridge this summer by offering the striker a lucrative new deal .
Mirror Sport revealed earlier this year that 23-year-old Lukaku is up for a return to Chelsea , two years after being sold by the Blues for £28million .

Lukaku is understood to have “ unfinished business ” in London while Chelsea regret not being more patient with him .
New Everton boss Ronald Koeman has the backing of owner Farhad Moshiri in his battle to hold on to the striker but Chelsea are confident that he still wants to join them .
The deposed champions also expect to land Juventus and Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci after the Euros .
Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has emerged as a serious rival for the 29-year-old following Aymeric Laporte 's decision to sign a new deal with Athletic Bilbao .
But Bonucci has a good working relationship with Conte , for whom he has already impressed at Euro2016 .
The Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday was caught in a crossfire by three of its executives who said the agency 's managers punish employees when they point out security lapses at the nation 's airports .
“ These leaders are some of the biggest bullies in government , ” Jay Brainard , a TSA security director in Kansas , told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform . “ While the new administrator of TSA has made security a much-needed priority once again , make no mistake about it , we remain an agency in crisis . ”
As airports anticipate what may be a record crush of passengers this summer , the three men testified that morale was near rock bottom among TSA security workers .
“ Many airports are complaining that TSA is getting worse , not better , ” said Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz ( R-Utah ) . He said that 103 of the TSA 's 48,000 airport screeners quit each week .
“ They really do n't like working there , ” Chaffetz said . “ That 's a management problem there . ”
Chaffetz set the stage for Wednesday 's hearing in a series of letters sent in February and March to TSA Administrator Peter V. Neffenger . They demanded to know all disciplinary actions taken against TSA employees , bonus payments made to TSA staff and an explanation for a policy under which workers can be forced to relocate .
Since his Senate confirmation in June 2015 , Neffenger has centralized training of TSA employees in Georgia , restricted executive bonuses , ended forced relocations and taken steps to increase airport security .
[ Brussels airport bombings bring new security measures in U.S . ]
Brainard told the committee that Neffenger had “ done his best to get his arms around the situation , but he has n't resolved it. ” He said a group of about 20 senior supervisors whom he blames for the TSA 's mismanagement were “ waiting [ Neffenger ] out . ”
“ The refusal to address or to hold senior leaders accountable is paralyzing this agency , ” Mark Livingston , a program manager in the TSA 's Office of the Chief Risk Officer , testified . “ TSA employees are less likely to report operational security or threat- relevant issues out of fear of retaliation from supervisors who fear further retaliation from their chain of command . No one who reports issues is safe at TSA . ”
When he raised concerns , Livingston said , his supervisors ignored them and punished him instead .
“ They reduced me two pay grades , ” he said . “ This action was intended to publicly humiliate me . They sought to make an example of me . ”
The men have caught attention of their supervisors . Livingston has filed a discrimination lawsuit against the agency . The complaints of Brainard and Andrew Rhoades , an assistant director in the Office of Security Operations , reportedly are under internal review by the TSA .
Rhoades said he was asked to run the names of Somali Americans with whom he met in Minneapolis through a terrorist database , a directive he considered to be racial profiling .
“ The Transportation Security Administration takes seriously all allegations of inappropriate behavior by its employees at all levels and does not tolerate illegal , unethical or immoral conduct , ” the TSA said in a statement after the hearing . “ Due to ongoing litigation and open investigations , we are unable to comment on many of the specific allegations brought up during today 's hearing . ”
The hearing came 10 months after an inspector general 's report that said his undercover operatives were able to slip through airport security with weapons and phony bombs more than 95 percent of the time . They were able to carry weapons or bomb-like material through air­port-security checkpoints in 67 of 70 attempts last year .
[ Why the TSA catches your water bottle , but guns and bombs get through ]
Then-acting TSA administrator Melvin Carraway was forced from the job in May 2015 after reports of the airport-security issues became public .
“ I appreciate that the TSA has taken steps to address the inspector general 's concerns , ” Chaffetz said .
Rhoades 's trouble with the TSA dates to autumn 2014 , when a local TV news station began reporting on security lapses at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport .
Rhoades already was on record with his supervisors for objecting to the way TSA screeners were handling confiscated weapons and a failure to put stickers on some checked bags that had been cleared by the agency . He said he played no role in the leaks .
In the aftermath of the news reports , one of Rhoades 's supervisors set out to determine whether TSA employees provided information to reporters , according to an investigation by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel ( OSC ) . Early last year , the OSC said , the same supervisor issued Rhoades a forced transfer to Florida .
The OSC stepped in to investigate whether it was a retaliatory move against a whistleblower , and the TSA later rescinded the transfer .
Although TSA employees agree to accept involuntary reassignments , Chaffetz , in one letter to the TSA in March , raised “ concerns about whether the practice was used for inappropriate reasons , including as a means of retaliation against certain employees . ”
A Japanese man in his 60s who recently arrived in Tokyo from Liberia will be tested for Ebola after he developed a fever and reported to a medical institution in the capital on Friday , a government official said .
The man was taken to a designated holding center for suspected Ebola cases , the official said . The tests will be conducted at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases .
There is no confirmation that the man came into contact with Ebola sufferers in Liberia , the official added .
Later Friday , Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press conference it is unlikely the man is carrying Ebola , given that he cleared quarantine checks upon arrival on Tuesday . The man departed Liberia on Oct. 26 .
Earlier , a Canadian man in his 40s reported ill health after arriving at Tokyo 's Haneda airport from Liberia via London on Oct. 27 . But he tested negative twice and was released from hospital a few days later .
On Friday the Japanese government said it will provide up to $ 100 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Ebola-hit West Africa .
The promised aid is in addition to the $ 40 million that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged at the U.N. General Assembly in September .
Abe will talk about Japan 's efforts against the deadly virus during a series of upcoming international conferences , Suga said .
Abe is scheduled to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Group of 20 this month .
“ The spread of Ebola has been a threat to international peace and security , ” Suga said . “ The situation remains severe , so we have made the decision to accelerate assistance . ”
Pope Francis has created political controversy , both inside and outside the Catholic Church , by blaming capitalism for many of the problems of the poor . We can no doubt expect more of the same during his visit to the United States .
Pope Francis is part of a larger trend of the rise of the political left among Catholic intellectuals . He is , in a sense , the culmination of that trend .
There has long been a political left among Catholics , as among other Americans . Often they were part of the pragmatic left , as in the many old Irish-run , big city political machines that dispensed benefits to the poor in exchange for their votes , as somewhat romantically depicted in the movie classic , “ The Last Hurrah . ”
But there has also been a more ideological left . Where the Communists had their official newspaper , “ The Daily Worker , ” there was also “ The Catholic Worker ” published by Dorothy Day .
A landmark in the evolution of the ideological left among Catholics was a publication in the 1980s , by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , titled “ Pastoral Letter on Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy . ”
Although this publication was said to be based on Catholic teachings , one of its principal contributors , Archbishop Rembert Weakland , said : “ I think we should be up front and say that really we took this from the Enlightenment era . ”
The specifics of the bishops ' Pastoral Letter reflect far more of the secular Enlightenment of the 18th century than of Catholic traditions . Archbishop Weakland admitted that such an Enlightenment figure as Thomas Paine “ is now coming back through a strange channel . ”

Strange indeed . Paine rejected the teachings of “ any church that I know of , ” including “ the Roman church. ” He said : “ My own mind is my own church. ” Nor was Paine unusual among the leading figures of the 18th century Enlightenment .
To base social or moral principles on the philosophy of the 18th century Enlightenment and then call the result “ Catholic teachings ” suggests something like bait-and-switch advertising .
But , putting aside religious or philosophical questions , we have more than two centuries of historical evidence of what has actually happened as the ideas of people like those Enlightenment figures were put into practice in the real world – beginning with the French Revolution and its disastrous aftermath .
Both the authors of the bishops ' Pastoral Letter in the 1980s and Pope Francis today blithely throw around the phrase “ the poor , ” and blame poverty on what other people are doing or not doing to or for “ the poor . ”
Any serious look at the history of human beings over the millennia shows that the species began in poverty . It is not poverty , but prosperity , that needs explaining . Poverty is automatic , but prosperity requires many things – none of which is equally distributed around the world or even within a given society .
Geographic settings are radically different , both among nations and within nations . So are demographic differences , with some nations and groups having a median age over 40 and others having a median age under 20 . This means that some groups have several times as much adult work experience as others . Cultures are also radically different in many ways .
As distinguished economic historian David S. Landes put it , “ The world has never been a level playing field. ” But which has a better track record of helping the less fortunate – fighting for a bigger slice of the economic pie , or producing a bigger pie ?
In 1900 , only 3 percent of American homes had electric lights but more than 99 percent had them before the end of the century . Infant mortality rates were 165 per thousand in 1900 and 7 per thousand by 1997 . By 2001 , most Americans living below the official poverty line had central air conditioning , a motor vehicle , cable television with multiple TV sets and other amenities .
A scholar specializing in the study of Latin America said that the official poverty level in the United States is the upper middle class in Mexico . The much criticized market economy of the United States has done far more for the poor than the ideology of the left .
Pope Francis ' own native Argentina was once among the leading economies of the world , before it was ruined by the kind of ideological notions he is now promoting around the world .
Celebrity Big Brother 2018 will see an all women cast kick off the series , it 's been confirmed .
In January 2018 , the nation marks 100 years since women won the right to vote for the very first time .
To celebrate , Celebrity Big Brother will launch the series with an all-female cast of celebrity housemates in a salute to a centenary of women 's suffrage on Channel 5 .
Presented by Emma Willis , Celebrity Big Brother will initially explore how the all-female housemates interact , from politicians to performing artists , as they enter the house together .
But there will be some male celebrities taking part , who will enter at a later date .
Here 's what Channel 5 had to say on the twist : `` Over the course of the series , as the male counterparts enter the house , the housemates will take part in a series of entertaining tasks and hidden experiments .
`` These will test their - and our - assumptions , challenge gender stereotypes and reveal fascinating truths about what it is to be a woman - and man - in the 21st century .
`` See what happens when women hold the power , as Celebrity Big Brother January 2018 is set to be celebratory , surprising and insightful . ''
Celebrity Big Brother host Emma previously gave her backing to the all women cast twist .
She said : `` I think it would be an amazing thing to do . It 's going to have been 100 years since women got the right to vote around that time and we now live in a world that is pro-feminism , finally ! We deserve to be equal . ''
Speaking about the rumours earlier this month , Emma added : `` Personally , I think it would be amazing to have all women in the house ... It 's very interesting when it 's just women .
`` I think it would be great for the series to be celebratory of women rather than what people are assuming [ you put a group of women together and they 'll all argue ] . ''
Alongside the main show , Celebrity Big Brother 's Bit On the Side will return weeknights with Rylan Clark-Neal .
Celebrity Big Brother 2018 will air on Channel 5 in January , with an exact start date to be confirmed .

Pro-life activists outside the Supreme Court , October 2016 ( Reuters photo : Yuri Gripas )
The Courts are important , but cultural arguments have a larger impact .
Late last week Alabama governor Kay Ivey said out loud what I 've been hearing from friends and acquaintances across the conservative movement . Even if Roy Moore 's accusers are telling the truth , they 'll vote for Moore . Why ? The Supreme Court . Here 's Governor Ivey :
I believe in the Republican party , what we stand for , and most important , we need to have a Republican in the United States Senate to vote on things like Supreme Court justices , other appointments the Senate has to confirm , and make major decisions

She made this statement even though she also said that she had no reason not to believe Moore 's accusers . She would put a man who abused children in the Senate because his votes on court appointees are that important .

This is not a fringe view . It 's held with fierce conviction across Red America , and it was one of the prime reasons millions of people cast votes for Donald Trump even when they believed all or some of the more than a dozen sexual misconduct complaints against him . To put it plainly , millions of American voters will willingly put in high office a man they would n't hire serving as an accountant in their local insurance agency — all because of the Supreme Court .
How did we get here ?
One is tempted to offer a short answer to the question , to cite Roe v. Wade and just be done with it . But the reasons are actually deeper , more complicated , and more intractable than one might think . It 's a tale of judicial supremacy and leftist overreach , yes , but it 's also a tale of a movement that too often forgets that politics and culture still can and do trump courts and cases .
Advertisement
But let 's start with judicial supremacy . Any decent conservative lawyer can cite chapter and verse on case after case where the Supreme Court departed from conventional rules of constitutional interpretation to not just discover a right to abortion in the Constitution but also to specifically and repeatedly target Christian expression in the public square .
Roe is of course the most egregious example . The case itself was so poorly reasoned and written that even liberal scholars expressed reservations . Harvard Law School 's Laurence Tribe said , “ Behind [ Roe 's ] own verbal smokescreen , the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found. ” Even Ruth Bader Ginsburg expressed concerns , calling Roe an example of “ heavy-handed judicial intervention [ that ] was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked , not resolved , conflict . ”
But it 's not just Roe . In Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the court decision that reaffirmed Roe , Justices O'Connor , Kennedy , and Souter ( all GOP appointees , but we 'll get to that ) articulated a view of liberty that 's nowhere in the Constitution , actively conflicts with orthodox Christian theology , and would surprise many of the Founders . The justices declared that “ at the heart of liberty is the right to define one 's own concept of existence , of meaning , of the universe , and of the mystery of human life . ”
Advertisement
As a philosophical statement , this now famous “ mystery of life ” passage is incoherent . As a constitutional philosophy , it 's indefensible . It 's sappy nonsense , and so is the Court 's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges , a case that actually includes this line : “ Marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there. ” On a Hallmark card , that 's sweet . As a statement of constitutional reasoning , it 's ridiculous .
I could go on . This type of fuzzy reasoning has often been deployed in cases that depart from originalism or textualism to directly target public expressions of Christianity . To rid this nation of school prayer and things like public displays of the Ten Commandments — or to drain public memorials of religious content — the Court invented entirely new standing rules that grant anti-religious litigants special status in federal courts .
And the threats continue . The Court will soon hear cases that will determine whether a state can actually compel pro-life citizens to advertise for free abortions and whether a state can compel a Christian baker to design a cake to celebrate an event he finds offensive . The barriers against compelled speech are among our most sacred constitutional doctrines . Now they may fall in the face of a relentless sexual revolution .
Advertisement
In short , the Court has often diminished individual liberties that are unmistakably and plainly in the Constitution for the sake of protecting rights it concocted out of thin air , such as the right to an abortion or the right to gay marriage . Is it any wonder that conservatives are alarmed ?
Moreover , that alarm is only magnified by decades of bad judicial choices . Conservative activists have labored since Roe to put originalist majorities on the Court , yet while Democratic presidents appoint faithful liberals , Republican presidents often swing and miss . For every Scalia and Thomas there 's an O'Connor and Souter . For every Alito , there 's a Kennedy , the swing vote of the sexual revolution . So now the priority is n't just electing a Republican . He has to prove he 'll be just as committed to making good judicial nominations as the average Democrat .
Advertisement
That 's why Donald Trump was smart to release his list of proposed Supreme Court nominees . Though many things could have swung the election , given the closeness of the race , I 'm confident about this : no list , no President Trump .

Having just described why it 's entirely right to be alarmed by judicial supremacy and why conservatives are right to be angry , it 's time to shift gears — to describe how the conservative reaction has sometimes morphed into a self-defeating overreaction , one that will do damage to the very causes conservatives , especially Christian conservatives , seek to advance .
Proper constitutional doctrine is vital . The Supreme Court can not act as a black-robed legislature , dispensing social justice as it sees fit . But proper constitutional doctrine rarely dictates specific cultural or political outcomes . Let 's take abortion , for example . The goal of the pro-life movement is n't to restore originalist jurisprudence but rather to protect human life from conception to natural death .
Many Americans believe that reversing Roe would ban abortion . This is wrong . The Court could vote to overturn Roe , and abortion would still be legal across the length and breadth of the United States . After all , overturning Roe would return the abortion question to the political process , where different states would enact different laws . For example , only four states have passed post-Roe statutes indicating that they 'd ban abortion if Roe is overturned . ( A number of other states have pre-Roe abortion bans , but several are in blue states that would immediately protect abortion rights in the event of an adverse SCOTUS ruling . )

Thus , the fight for life transcends Roe . Decisive cultural change can diminish abortion dramatically even if Roe remains intact . At the same time , cultural permissiveness can enshrine abortion not just as a legal right but a noble act ( remember “ shout your abortion ? ” ) independent of any court ruling . Given this reality , “ child-abusing senators against Roe ” strikes me as perhaps the worst possible message to a culture in desperate need of persuasion .
In fact , the political process can protect individual liberty even when the Supreme Court fails . Think of gun rights . Cultural and political change meant the loosening of gun laws across the United States before the Court 's landmark decision in District of Columbia v. Heller recognizing the obvious truth that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms . And while Heller is important , overturning the case would n't change a single state or federal law protecting gun rights — including the many laws that go far beyond Heller in protecting the right to self-defense .
The list of political remedies for the worst judicial decisions goes on and on . Statutes and regulations can protect religious liberty and free speech . State constitutions can play a vital role . Protest and activism can render illiberal changes too costly even for hostile lawmakers . Conservatives too often act as if a Supreme Court decision is the end of an argument . In truth , it 's often just the beginning .
Let 's take an issue near and dear to my heart — freedom of association . In 2010 the Supreme Court reached one of the most dreadful First Amendment decisions of the last 20 years . In a case called Christian Legal Society v. Martinez , it determined that — under certain circumstances — a public university can actually force Christian campus organizations to open themselves up to non-Christian , even atheist leadership . Freedom of association is a dead letter if you ca n't even require your leaders to support and uphold the mission , values , and beliefs of an organization . Many of us feared that religious student groups teetered on the brink of a campus crisis .
Yet far from heralding disaster for religious freedom on campus , the decision barely rippled the waters . It turns out that not even deep-blue universities in deep-blue states have been able to sustain meaningful , active opposition to freedom of association . Christian student groups did n't give up . They made arguments in the court of public opinion . They appealed to legislatures . They had dialogues with administrators . And they almost always won . Christian ministries are vibrant , active , and actually growing on college campuses from coast to coast .
If you make vile people your champions , you ca n't be surprised if Americans begin to associate the cause with its advocates .

Here 's the problem : Politics and activism take long , hard work . They require patience , persistence , and persuasion . But , ultimately , that process often results not just in political change but also in enduring cultural transformations . Given the constitutional atrocity of Roe , it 's easy to forget that it was connected to a potent cultural and political movement — one that still sways the hearts of tens of millions of Americans . The laughable reasoning of Obergefell should n't distract from the fact that the argument for gay marriage had gained astounding cultural force in a remarkably short period of time .
Conservatives who want to protect life and preserve liberty must do much , much more than select the right judges , and they ca n't sacrifice the larger cultural argument for the sake of any single nomination or series of nominations . “ Sexual harassers for the Second Amendment ” is n't a compelling cultural message . If you make vile people your champions , you ca n't be surprised if Americans begin to associate the cause with its advocates .
The pro-life movement is among the most successful cultural and religious movements of the last 50 years . In the face of unified opposition from the key elite institutions in the United States — the academy , pop culture , and the courts — it has not only survived , it has thrived . By some measures , the current generation is more pro-life than their parents , and the number of abortions has declined even as the American population has grown , saving millions of lives .
It did n't make this headway by wrapping its arms around credibly accused sexual predators . Its leaders and volunteers understood that regardless of the state of the law , they could save lives . And so they set about doing just that . Through their grace , their patience , and — most significantly — their love for women and children , they are helping change this nation . Any “ ambassador ” who is inconsistent with that ethos is a risk . An angry , defiant , and dishonest credibly accused child abuser is a disaster , a walking commercial for the other side . His one vote out of 100 simply is n't worth the cost .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico announced on Thursday a $ 2.5 billion investment in new wind farms to generate more than 300 MW of electricity across the country , part of the government 's push to expand renewable energy .
San Diego-based Cannon Power Group , which already works in the Baja California peninsula , will build another project there along with a plant in the central state of Zacatecas and in southern Quintana Roo , home to popular tourist resort Cancun .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon said new investments would help Mexico reach 2000 MW of wind capacity by the end of his term next year .
He said Mexico generates around 500 MW now as the country tries to reduce its emissions of polluting greenhouse gases .
“ We need to ... reduce the use of fossil fuels and this is the way , projects that generate electricity without burning anything , without burning gas , without burning oil , ” Calderon said at an event with governors and company representatives .
Mexico , a top oil exporter to the United States , has seen oil output fall in recent years as production declines at its largest , aging fields .
The country now produces around 2.6 million barrels of oil per day , down from a peak in 2004 of 3.4 million bpd and has to import 40 percent of its gasoline needs due to a lack of in-country refining capacity .
Calderon wants to expand the use of wind , hydro , solar and other green energy sources to reach 26 percent of national demand by 2012 , up slightly from the 23 percent used in Mexico when he took office in 2006 .
With Canon Power Group 's investment , Calderon said Mexico would reach $ 100 billion in foreign investment by the end of his administration , with companies continuing to pour money into the U.S. neighbor despite problems like rising drug violence .

A woman who was plagued by eczema for more than 30 years has clear skin for the first time after quitting her lifelong steroid cream addiction .
But today mum-of-two Melanie Lynch revealed the `` living hell '' she went through going cold turkey with the treatment - including horrific reactions that made her skin `` burn '' and `` oooze '' .
The 37-year-old first received topical steroid creams as a toddler when she started to suffer eczema on the backs of her knees and elbows .

Over the next three decades the eczema worsened , and she was prescribed higher dosage treatment that she would eventually use to cover her entire body .
But her skin did n't seem to be recovering and the mum-of-two , from Birmingham decided to quit steroid treatment all together in 2013 .
The sudden withdrawal had shocking consequences .
Melanie suffered horrific reactions where all her skin burned , oozed and turned into dry flaking skin that peeled off .
She said she looked like a `` monster '' after the reaction also caused her face , eyes and lips to swell and turn bright red .

Her hair and eyebrows fall out .
But after three years battling her horrific symptoms caused by topical steroid withdrawal , Melanie now has clear skin .
The mum , a primary school teacher , said : `` The whole thing was a living hell and the worst thing I 've ever had to do .
`` It was just horrendous , I looked like a monster , my hair and eyebrows fell out , my skin was oozing and fell off everywhere .
`` I had to sweep around me where I went like it was dust , I would change my bedsheets and pyjamas multiple times a day .
`` Everything was swollen even my eyes . My skin was bright red , wet from oozing and was gross .

`` About 95 % of my skin looked like it had been burned , I could n't put clothes or even a blanket because it was so sore .
`` After that it would go very dry and flake everywhere , then it would repeat that cycle over and over for three years .
`` It 's definitely a terrible time but worth it now . My skin is stronger , it feels healthier and it 's not damaged like it was before .
`` My skin finally feels smooth , like it never has felt before and is definitely healing . ''
At her worst , Melanie was using a 100g tube of steroid cream every week on top of oral steroids , but nothing seemed to relieve her dry skin and reddened face .
After ceasing the treatment that she had used for her entire life , she suffered horrific side-effects associated to her skin being overly dependent topical steroids .

Melanie added : `` Over the decades using steroids , my skin needed stronger and stronger creams , then I was using oral steroids as well and nothing calmed my skin - it was awful .
`` I used them for more than 30 years and it did n't make me any better , I 'm not convinced it healed me , if anything it only made my eczema worse .
`` I watched a video about topical steroid addiction and had a lightbulb moment , it made me realise that steroids were the reason why my skin was getting worse . ''
Melanie was signed off from work for six months and remained housebound for a total of ten months during her agonising battle with the withdrawal process that left her unable to sleep and in constant pain .
She said : `` There were times where I spent all day and night in the bath , it was my only relief from the agony I was suffering .
`` It got so bad that I had to be signed off from work with disability benefits .
`` I would go months without leaving the house and unable to move or function , it was horrible .
( Image : CATERS )
`` The symptoms were like drug withdrawal , my nerves were shocked , I was fidgety , flinching and I was either too hot or too cold , there was very little rest from it . ''
More so , Melanie was devastated when over a year into her topical steroid withdrawal her hair began to fell out .
She added : `` My hair was falling out in clumps and eventually I had to get a wig to try to keep some normality .
`` I held onto my hair for as long as I could , but I lost my whole hairline , I wore a clip in fringe with a hairband to try and hide the loss , but it did n't work . Eventually it all had to come off . ''
But last year , she noticed her horrifying reactions start to recede and since then her skin vastly began to improve , her hair is grown back and she 's slowly returning to normal life .
Melanie said : `` In the beginning , I only thought it would take a year for me to overcome this , I never imagined three years later I 'd still be battling it .
`` Thankfully this year has been a lot better , my skin is so much better than it was , I 'm finally able to start living a normal life again .
`` There were times I did n't think I could go through it all but thankfully the worst is over now . ''
A survey by the International Steroid Addiction Network ( ITSAN ) found that 5,288 people suffered from Topical Steroid Withdrawal also known as Red Skin Syndrome within the last two years .

Joey VanDyke , president of ITSAN , said : `` Dr Fukaya suggests avoiding continuous use of topical steroid creams for longer than two weeks .
`` In the cases of those who become dependent , it breaks down the skin barrier and causes a host of symptoms .
`` The most common sign of Red Skin Syndrome is the inflamed , hot skin .
`` A possible lengthy time of the symptoms can affect your ability to function normally in daily life , work or go to school . ''
She added : `` We never advise anyone to stop using topical steroids as that is not the role of ITSAN .
`` We share the truth of cited medical studies about the potential , known risk factors of topical steroids , stories of people enduring and overcoming red skin syndrome , and we offer caring support to anyone suffering red skin syndrome . ''
Reuters The unemployment rate ( red line ) fell to its lowest level since January 2009 , when President Barack Obama took office .
UPDATED 9:50 a.m. EDT : The nation 's unemployment rate dropped to the lowest it has been in almost four years in September , giving President Barack Obama a potential upbeat talking point as the presidential race heads into the final innings .
The Labor Department reported Friday that the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent in September , a decline of 0.3 percentage point and the lowest since January 2009 . The government said the economy created 114,000 jobs , about as expected , and generated 86,000 more jobs in July and August than first estimated .
A survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived showed 873,000 job gains last month , the most since June 1983 . The drop in unemployment came even as Americans come back into the labor force to resume the hunt for work . The workforce had shrunk in the prior two months . The household survey is volatile , however .
It was the second last report before the November 6 election that pits Obama against Republican Mitt Romney .
Unemployment rate drop could have an impact on the campaign
`` It 's a little confusing , to be honest with you . The number of jobs created was n't that high but the unemployment rate came down and the participation rate went up a little bit , so it 's confusing . All in all , it does n't change the trajectory of what the jobs environment has been really for the last year , '' said Ron Florance , managing director for investment strategy for Wells Fargo Private Bank .
The two numbers – the unemployment rate and the non-farm payrolls number – come from two separate reports done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The unemployment report is based on the so-called Household Survey and it measures the number of unemployed as a percentage of the labor force . It is notoriously volatile and economists do n't put much stock in it , even though it often becomes the talking point for non-economists , politicians and pundits . It includes the unemployed who are out there actively seeking work and it excludes people who have left the work force and are not applying for jobs .
The non-farm payrolls number comes from the establishment survey and is considered more accurate .
“ The rule of thumb when the two surveys tell different stories is to go with what the establishment survey says . However , the household survey provides reasons to be somewhat more optimistic about job opportunities for American workers , ” said Heidi Shierholz , an economist for the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute .
'Discouraged ' workers face tough road back to employment
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday after Wednesday 's first presidential debate showed Romney gained ground and is now viewed positively by 51 percent of voters . Obama 's favorability rating remained unchanged at 56 percent .
Economists blame the so-called fiscal cliff for the slowdown in business hiring , which has left millions of Americans working either part-time or unemployed and too discouraged to look for jobs .
The Congressional Budget Office has warned that a failure by Congress to avoid the automatic tax hikes and government spending cuts that will suck about $ 600 billion out of the economy next year would knock the economy back into recession .
`` Businesses are not hiring people , they want to wait and see how the election evolves and how the political landscape shapes up , '' said Sung Won Sohn , an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo , California .
`` Everyone has kind of battened down the hatches , '' Sohn said before the release of the report .
Persistently poor labor market conditions led the Federal Reserve in September to announce a plan to buy $ 40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities each month until it sees a sustained turnaround in employment .
The central bank , which also pledged to keep overnight lending rates near zero until at least mid-2015 , hopes the purchases drive down long-term borrowing costs and spur the recovery .
The Fed 's ultra-easy stance has started to free up credit , giving a lift to consumers , economists said . That , in turn , helped lift retail hiring in September .
Temporary help jobs , which are often seen as a harbinger for permanent hiring , fell 2,000 after being almost flat in August .
Manufacturing payrolls fell for a second straight month .
Construction employment rose 5,000 , benefiting from the rise in home construction , as demand for housing rises against the backdrop of record low mortgage rates
Government payrolls rose 10,000 after increasing 45,000 in August . Average hourly earnings rose 7 cents last month , which could support spending .

KINGMAN – At least two county residents are aware of what they call a massacre of Joshua Trees north of Kingman .
Pete Golden posted numerous photos of downed plants on the Things Meadview Facebook page . His caption read :
“ Recently … In the last couple of years or so , just miles South of the Grand Canyon Nat . Park , 6000 acres of picturesque old undisturbed ranch land , with ancient water rich aquifers beneath them , was purchased by a ( n ) out of state large and powerful agricultural consortium . Residing on portions of this land , along with other fascinating forms of flora , fauna and geology , are ancient and critically endangered stands of Joshua Trees . As one can see in these photos , the ag [ sic ] cartel has no intention of preserving these wonders . The land is to be scraped clean . ”
More new pictures of the Joshua Tree massacre were on the web blog www.highdesertdirt.com .
“ Here are some new pictures of the Joshua Tree massacre on Pierce Ferry and Greggs Hideout ( Antares on the other side of Pierce Ferry . ) They 're done drilling the new well , ” the site reads .
Yucca resident Jan ( Yohn ) Emming , came across Golden 's pictures of the devastation when he saw them on the Mohave County Arizona 's Water Crisis Facebook page .
He said the 200-300 acre clearance is on the north side of Pierce Ferry Road at Greggs Hideout Road and restricted to that parcel of land . He 's talked to other environmental activists and feels that there 's something fishy in the air . He 's trying to find a way to help stop the clearing .
He said the first clearing was done in October and this latest one was last week , and that there is heavy construction equipment at the site . He does n't know who owns the parcel but feels the farms need to find another place to do agriculture .
“ I just happen to care about the forest , ” he said . “ I decided I had to start doing something . ”

Zombie ideas are much scarier than actual zombies . For one , zombie ideas are real . For another , nothing can kill them . Not even a bullet to the intellectual head .
Just look at the austerians .
ur-text , It was only a week ago that the cult of deficit-cutting was in quick retreat . Harvard professors Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff , the authors of the austerity admitted to making a number of errors , including one with a spreadsheet formula , that made their seemingly dramatic results much less so . As Owen Zidar points out , growth does n't hit some kind of tipping point when public debt hits 90 percent of GDP , as Reinhart and Rogoff claimed , but rather falls at a steady rate between debt levels of 50 and 200 percent of GDP . A bit of simple math , which Brad DeLong goes through , shows that this relationship between higher debt and lower growth is n't anything approximating an argument against more stimulus . As long as interest rates are zero and unemployment is high , there 's a strong case for doing more .
And it is widely acknowledged , based on serious research , that when public debt levels rise about 90 percent they tend to have a negative economic dynamism , which translates into low growth for many years .
And here 's what Rehn said about it last week
The precise causal relationship between debt levels and growth is a complex one . There is no hard-and-fast rule ; it is affected also by many country-specific factors .
real high priests of austerity have not given up on fiscal rectitude as the one true path to economic salvation . Those are the austerians at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) . As The Economist points out , euro-debtor countries can only spend as much as the ECB lets them . The ECB pushed down their borrowing costs last year by explicitly backstopping them , but it can just as easily push them back up by removing the backstop -- which it will do if they backslide on deficit-cutting . Indeed , ECB Executive Board member Latvia as a shining example just last week : But this ray of realism aside , thehigh priests of austerity have not given up on fiscal rectitude as the one true path to economic salvation . Those are the austerians at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) . As Ryan Avent ofpoints out , euro-debtor countries can only spend as much as the ECB lets them . The ECB pushed down their borrowing costs last year by explicitly backstopping them , but it can just as easily push them back up by removing the backstop -- which it will do if they backslide on deficit-cutting . Indeed , ECB Executive Board member Jörg Asmussen was back to touting ... as a shining example just last week :
Latvia is the leading example of how to adjust through internal devaluation , and it is a model for others in the euro area . Its `` V-shaped '' economic recovery illustrates what can be done with a strong consensus to undo the excesses of the past . After an initial fall in GDP of almost 18 % in 2009 , GDP increased by more than 11 % from 2010 to 2012 , and unemployment has fallen by almost 7 percentage points from its peak .
22 percent of its GDP from abroad -- a private-sector binge that fueled a massive housing bubble . When the money music suddenly stopped after Lehmangeddon , this fragile web of debt imploded , and with it , the entire economy . Latvia only managed to avoid national bankruptcy by going to the Latvia followed a familiar script : boom , bust , and bailout . At its peak in both 2006 and 2007 , Latvia was borrowing overof its GDP from abroad -- a private-sector binge that fueled a massive housing bubble . When the money music suddenly stopped after Lehmangeddon , this fragile web of debt imploded , and with it , the entire economy . Latvia only managed to avoid national bankruptcy by going to the EU and IMF for a bailout , which allowed it to keep its currency pegged to the euro -- but at the cost of promising deep austerity . This combination of tight money and tight budgets sent Latvia into a historic slump : GDP fell over 25 percent , and unemployment hit 20.7 percent .
does have much lower unemployment than Greece and how many people have left Latvia . As you can see below , Latvia only recently passed Greece and Spain in total jobs relative to their peaks . * But Latvia 's depression is n't quite so great anymore . Its economy has grown 5.5 percent each of the past two years , and unemployment is just under 14 percent . Is this proof that there can be gain after pain ? Yes . Is it vindication ? No . Economically , it never made sense for Latvia to keep its currency peg ( though it did politically due to Russophobia ) or to cut spending amidst a slump . As Paul Krugman point out , Latvia 's GDP is still far below its pre-crisis peak , and even more so than exemplars like Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Spain are below theirs . It 's not that much better on the jobs front . Now , Latviahave much lower unemployment than Greece and Spain , but that 's in part due to . As you can see below , Latvia only recently passed Greece and Spain in total jobs relative to their peaks . *
Some model .
Note : Latvia rebenchmarked its data in 2011 , so I had to adjust the numbers for 2012 . I took the numbers from Latvia 's Central Statistical Bureau , calculated the quarterly percent changes in 2012 , and used those to project what the 2012 numbers would have been under the old system . All other data is from Eurostat and St. Louis FRED ) .
There was never much to learn from Latvia . As Martin Wolf points out , it 's a small , open economy of two million people with lots of foreign-owned banks it never has to bail out . In other words , it 's not exactly replicable . But why would we want to replicate it ? Deep cuts to public sector wages and spending in Latvia turned a severe recession into a deep depression . Its `` successes '' today only highlight how far it fell . GDP is growing quickly , in part , because of how low its base was after the slump ; and unemployment is falling quickly , in part , because of how many people emigrated during the slump . Meanwhile , the U.S. , which did do countercyclical fiscal and monetary stimulus , did n't fall nearly as far , and has just as much , relative to the trough .
But zombie ideas do not die , especially in the euro zone . Nothing will convince the ECB that Latvia is n't a success story -- unless it 's more convenient to claim Estonia is instead . Regardless of the fact , the ECB will keep pushing southern Europe into perma-slump as the path to prosperity .
Now that 's scary .
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
* The original version of this story mistakenly used the re-benchmarched data for Latvia from Eurostat , instead of the original 2011 numbers and adjusted 2012 numbers . I got the new , unbenchmarked numbers from Latvia 's Central Statistical Bureau , but they only go back to 2002 , instead of 2000 , so I cut back my sample by two years . I also removed Lithuania from the sample , because I was worried about the possibility of a similar benchmarking issue .

FamilySecurityMatters : [ Star Parker ] The Department of Education was created under President Carter in 1979 under the same misguided pretense that has driven much of the growth of our massively bloated federal government – that if there is something we really care about , we should give more money and power to Washington bureaucrats .
It would be good news if the Department of Education just wasted the money it gets from our hard-earned taxes . But it uses the money to do real damage .
Nothing could provide a better example than the newly issued guidance letter that the Department of Education , jointly with the Justice Department , just sent to public school districts across the country , threatening to cut of federal funds if public schools do not comply with guidelines for treatment of so-called transgender students .
The first paragraph of the directive provides a toll-free phone number to call if you do n't know the English language well enough to read the letter and then serves up this same paragraph in six different languages . Our own Department of Education is apparently of the view that familiarity with the English language is not among the responsibilities of American citizens .

What we 're watching :
Today : Compromise and single-payer , the emerging narratives around health care .
More : The Russia story was front and center this weekend .
Yes , more : Iraqi forces have nearly retaken Mosul from the Islamic State .
Trump 's agenda today : No public events .
Here 's where the health care debate seems to be heading on both sides
After a week off , the message is no different : The Senate plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is , to quote two prominent Republican senators , “ dead. ” Republican senators like Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia are not shying away from responsibility for potentially killing the Senate health care proposal . Sen. Bill Cassidy ( R-La . ) , a Republican pushing a moderate plan that conservatives like Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) will reject , expressed little optimism on Sunday that there is a path forward .
With Republicans waiting to consider a new health care bill , here are two ideas that have gained traction in the past week :
Compromise : Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) said Sunday the GOP might have to work with Democrats to pass a health care bill . For weeks , senators like Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) and Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) have called for a bipartisan approach . Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) suggested last week a possible need to work with Democrats . On the Democratic side , senators have long expressed a willingness to work with the GOP . If the current Republican effort fails , there could be an opening for bipartisanship .
Single-payer : This is a nonstarter for Republicans . But that wo n't keep Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) and a growing stable of Democrats from pushing the plan . As polls have shown the GOP bill is among the least popular in decades , liberals have found an opening to promote an idea that died in the 2009 health care debate : government-provided health care . More Americans than at any point in the last decade believe the federal government must ensure coverage for everyone . Groups protesting Trumpcare used sit-ins last week to highlight their support of single-payer .
The opposition is unrelenting : Axios reported Save My Care is pressuring four Republican senators to vote against the Senate bill with home-state ads . They 're targeting Sen. Dean Heller ( R-Nev. ) , Collins , Capito and Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-Ala. ) .

The latest on Russia
If you have n't read it yet , the New York Times story about Donald Trump Jr. is a bombshell for three reasons .
It demonstrates the president 's son was willing to meet , during the election , with Russians to seek dirt on Hillary Clinton . The meeting included Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort .
Trump Jr. may have lied about the meeting , initially saying the meeting “ with a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin ” was about adoption policy . A subsequent statement from Trump Jr. confirmed the nature of the meeting , claiming it produced nothing consequential .
This is the first hard evidence that Trump 's campaign may have sought to work with Russia to fight Clinton .
Stay tuned : The motivation for the meeting matters , but it 's still nowhere near enough to peg collusion on Trump .
Be careful what you say : White House adviser Kellyanne Conway was shown a clip of herself Monday saying in December that no one from the Trump campaign ever met with Russians .
Trump is not keeping quiet . After facing mockery for suggesting he would create a “ cybersecurity unit ” with Russian President Vladimir Putin , Trump dialed back that plan on Sunday .
Then , with the news of his son 's meeting leading the news Monday morning , Trump pushed a report Monday morning that former FBI Director James Comey leaked classified information . ( Read the Hill report Trump is citing . )
Do n't miss this : Republicans , particularly senators , were critical of Trump after his calls to work with Putin . That 's bad timing , not only for health care , but also because the White House wants to neuter a stern Russia sanctions bill passed 97-2 in the Senate . If the House passed that bill as-is , Trump 's first veto could be to protect Russia .
News and insight you can not miss :
One day into a Syrian cease-fire brokered by Trump and Putin , fighting has largely subsided .
The prime minister of Iraq is expected to declare victory over ISIS in Mosul , the country 's second-largest city that was the Islamic State 's capital since 2014 .
Trump 's attorney is trying to dismiss the defamation lawsuit by a woman who accused Trump of sexual assault .
Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has revealed that `` when the Neymar case is over '' the club will look into filing a lawsuit against the person who leaked the Brazilian 's contracts , and possibly against the media outlet which published them as well .
Bartomeu said that the club has ruled out suing Jordi Cases `` for damages '' after his complaint led to Sandro Rosell 's resignation , and he assured that the club has already spoken to him .
`` We have evidence that [ Cases ] did not leak the contracts . When the trial ends , we will take the initiative . We know who did it , '' said Bartomeu , who believes that Real Madrid has been trying to draw attention to the issue because `` it finds it hard to accept that [ Barça ] has dominated in recent years '' .
He does not know whether the company MCM – which has a financial dispute with the club over another issue , as announced on Twitter on Sunday – will join the lawsuit which Cases now intends to drop .
`` We do n't know , but it would n't surprise me . I 'm seeing a certain animosity ( from Madrid ) towards Barça . It is hard for them to accept that we have two such dominant players as Messi and Neymar , '' he said .
He assured that the sums involved in the transaction were not released earlier for questions of safety . `` The Neymar family asked us to keep it confidential , but for questions of their safety . The family is extensive and they live in a country ( Brazil ) with high levels of crime . That was the reason , '' he insisted .
Image caption Robert Mugabe clearly enjoyed the celebrations in Bindura
Thousands of people have attended a lavish party to celebrate Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe 's 89th birthday in the mining town of Bindura .
Mr Mugabe was presented with a cake said to weigh 89kg ( 196lb ) , and gold coins were minted to mark the occasion .
The celebrations cost about $ 600,000 ( £400,000 ) , reports say .
In his speech , Mr Mugabe - who has ruled since 1980 - denied claims that he was trying to intimidate political rivals ahead of a new election .
Mr Mugabe will be contesting the election later this year , hoping to secure another five-year term in office .
'Down with imperialism '
The day before the celebrations in Bindura , residents were given an hour off work to clean the town 's streets .
Wearing an elegant suit and a red cap with his year of birth , Mr Mugabe waved to the crowds , flanked by his wife and two children .
He later cut the birthday cake and released 89 balloons into the sky .
In his speech , Mr Mugabe urged his supporters to go `` forward with winning elections , down with imperialism '' .
Mr Mugabe 's actual birthday was nine days ago , but this weekend was the chance for his supporters to celebrate .
Zimbabwe is now moving towards a crucial period of political transition , the BBC 's Peter Biles in Johannesburg reports .
He adds that a referendum on a new constitution will precede the presidential elections .
The polls would herald the end of a shaky government coalition between Mr Mugabe and his rival Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai .
The coalition between Mr Mugabe 's Zanu-PF party and Mr Tsvangirai 's MDC party was formed under pressure from regional leaders after the disputed 2008 election .
Baltimore Woman Who Collapsed In Police Custody Has Died
A Baltimore woman who collapsed on April 9 while in police custody has died , police said .
Kim Doreen Chase , 52 , of Baltimore , died Thursday morning at St. Agnes Hospital . An autopsy will determine a cause and manner of death .
Police said they continue to investigate the circumstances involving Chase 's case , but do not believe that she was abused by the officers .
Police said Chase was arrested on a warrant for failure to appear in court .
Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said last week that while Chase and officers waited for a police transport van , she was allowed to go to her home in the 100 block of South Calverton Road to gather personal items . While she was there , a family member braided Chase 's hair , police said . That development was first reported by the 11 News I-Team .
Police said two officers are on administrative duty and a lieutenant has been suspended as a result of the incident .

It 's the one we probably moan about the most , thanks to part suspensions and severe delays , but what would life in the capital be without the District Line ?
Coloured dark green on the map and running from Upminster to Ealing Broadway , Richmond and Wimbledon , the District line has been an inherent part of London life since its opening in 1868 - when it was served by steam locomotives and ran from West Brompton to Mansion House .
At the start of the 20th century the District saw increased competition from the new electric underground tube lines and trams , and the use of steam locomotives underground led to unpopular smoke-filled stations and carriages .
The railway was financed privately for electrification , and the first electric services ran from Ealing to South Harrow in 1903 .
Since then , the route has expanded to reach farther flung areas of London , and has since earned the title of the line with the most stations , serving sixty in total .
But that is n't the only interesting thing to note about this historic line .
If you live in London , you probably use this line to get to go shopping on the King 's Road , go sightseeing in Westminster and go drinking in Brick Lane . But how much do you really know the network that ferries millions of people around the capital ?

( Reuters ) - Finance leaders of the G20 economies on Friday edged away from a long-running drive toward government austerity in rich nations , rejecting the idea of setting hard targets for reducing national debt in a sign of worries over a sluggish global recovery .
The G20 club of advanced and emerging economies also said it would be watching for negative effects from massive monetary stimulus , such as Japan 's - a nod to concerns of developing nations that those policies risk flooding their economies with hot capital and driving up their currencies .
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said at a news conference that officials from the Group of 20 nations believed overall debt reduction was more important than specific figures .
“ We agreed that these would be soft parameters , these would be some kind of strategic objectives and goals which might be amended or adjusted , depending on the specific situations in the national economies , ” he said .
Russia - this year 's G20 chair - had hoped to secure an agreement on setting fixed targets for reducing debt by the time G20 leaders meet in St. Petersburg in September .
But the United States and Japan have firmly opposed the idea of committing to fixed debt-to-GDP targets , with Washington trying to keep the focus of the G20 on growth .
“ Quite frankly , the language could have been stronger but it 's sufficient to move this forward , ” said Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty .

WATCHING JAPAN
In a communiqué after a two-day meeting , the G20 said it would be “ mindful ” of possible side effects from extended periods of monetary stimulus , a phrase added the insistence of South Korea to take into account the concerns of emerging markets .
“ Monetary policy should be directed toward domestic price stability and continuing to support economic recovery , ” the statement said .
The economic policies of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have weakened the yen , but only as a by-product of stimulus geared at pulling the country out of deflation , the country 's finance minister said .
“ To say that a cheap yen is our goal will grossly miss the point , ” Taro Aso told the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
“ The big D - deflation - is too difficult and too persistent to get rid of . At the end of the day , a shrinking Japan can only do harm to the world . ”
The BOJ is not alone in flooding its economy with cheap funds to try to boost borrowing and spending . The U.S. Federal Reserve , the Bank of England and , to some extent , the European Central Bank have as well .
“ Japan 's growth is good for India . Stagnation in Japan is not good for India . We want Japan to grow , ” said Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram , who spoke at the Peterson Institute in Washington on Friday .
Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said that because of Japan 's long history of deflation , its stimulus efforts were “ understandable , ” but he added that the G20 must remain vigilant on exchange rates .

The G20 leaders urged the euro zone to quickly move toward a banking union in order to help revive the region 's economy . However , Germany repeated its earlier position that European Union laws needed to be changed before one of the elements of the banking union , a scheme for winding down failing banks , can be introduced - which is likely to delay the process .
The struggles of the euro zone dominated G20 discussions , delegates said , as harsh austerity measures have failed to lift the region out of its economic slumber . The United States has been pressing Europe to ease up on its budget cutting .
A senior U.S. Treasury official , speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity , said that Cyprus 's bailout showed Europe needs to do more to move towards banking union .
Discussions of the euro zone will likely remain prominent on Saturday as global finance officials gather again for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund 's governing committee .
“ Stronger demand in Europe is critical to global growth . Weak domestic demand has undercut euro area growth for six consecutive quarters and output continues to contract , ” U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in a statement prepared for delivery to the IMF committee .
SOFT DEBT TARGETS
The drive toward government austerity has been undercut by weakness in economies that took severe measures to cut deficits , including Britain , which is headed into its third recession in the last five years . The U.S. economy also shows some signs of strain that economists pin on belt-tightening in Washington .
Earlier this week , the IMF reduced its forecast for global growth and reiterated its call for some European countries to throttle back their austerity drives .
Fitch cut its credit rating on Britain on Friday to double-A-plus , citing expectations that general government debt will rise to 101 percent of GDP by 2015-2016 due to weak growth .

In an interview with BBC television , IMF chief Christine Lagarde said now might be time for Britain to consider relaxing its focus on austerity given the recent weakness in its economy .
Russia 's Siluanov also said a greater amount of coordination was needed with the IMF on global liquidity , with recommendations expected by next July .
G20 ministers called on the Financial Stability Board to oversee work on reforms for short-term interest rate benchmarks such as Libor in the aftermath of a global rate-rigging scandal . FSB was asked to report back in July on its progress .
Following a years-long battle with pancreatic cancer , soul and funk singer Sharon Jones has died at age 60 . The news was announced on Jones ' website and social media late Friday :
We are deeply saddened to announce that Sharon Jones has passed away after a heroic battle against pancreatic cancer . She was surrounded by her loved ones , including the Dap-Kings . Thank you for your prayers and thoughts during this difficult time . In lieu of flowers , donations may be made to the following organizations :
Additional memorial details will follow soon .
The Grammy-nominated powerhouse vocalist and leader of her band the Dap-Kings spent decades performing in wedding bands and as a back-up singer before her early 00s ascent to stardom . She released seven albums alongside the Dap-Kings , most recently 2015 's It 's a Holiday Soul Party .
Jones was as celebrated for her recordings as for the warmth , dynamism , and ferocity she brought to the stage , her performances earning her both massive crowds and a reputation as one of today 's most magnetic live acts .
Jones was diagnosed with stage two pancreatic cancer in 2013—just three years after losing her mother to cancer—but went into remission nine months later . The cancer returned in 2015 , spreading to her liver , lungs , and lymph nodes .
`` No matter where I get to and stop at , I 'm still going to be Sharon . And that 's why I share with my fans . And I want them to see what I 'm going through , '' Jones told Noisey in 2014 as she prepared to return to the stage after successfully completing treament . `` Happiness is the most important . I 've been out here . I 've gone through things . You have to be happy . You have to feel that you 've done something in life . And I think over the years , that 's what we 've accomplished . ''

Whatever others may say on the subject , I ca n't understand how anyone might admire the Confederacy and also call themselves a libertarian . Any affinity for the Confederacy marks one very clearly as an enemy of liberty .
The Confederate Constitution says all that needs to be said on the subject , and it answers all possible arguments to the contrary . Yes , the antebellum U.S. Constitution was clearly quite soft on slavery , and this is not at all to its credit . The best that can be said for it was that it was embarrassed about being quite soft on slavery—amid all the other liberties it granted and all the other progress it made . Products of committees , do note , can be as schizophrenic as the committees that draft them . Our first attempt at a constitutional order was one such schizophrenic product , and in this respect , the antebellum U.S. Constitution was terrible .
But the Confederate Constitution was vastly worse . What it lacked in schizophrenia , it more than made up for in pure , unadulterated , wholly consistent evil . Consider the following passages :
No law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed . The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States ; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy , with their slaves and other property ; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired . No slave or other person held to service or labor in any State or Territory of the Confederate States , under the laws thereof , escaping or lawfully carried into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor ; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such slave belongs , or to whom such service or labor may be due . The Confederate States may acquire new territory… In all such territory the institution of negro slavery , as it now exists in the Confederate States , shall be recognized and protected be Congress and by the Territorial government ; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States .
A few years ago libertarian lawyer and Cato adjunct Timothy Sandefur wrote an excellent article on secessionism , slavery , and the U.S. Civil War that I would urge you all to read . He covers the legal points far better than I ever could . But it would be a sick joke to stop merely at calling these provisions unlibertarian—as if all but the exceptionally punctilious members of our little tribe might maybe tolerate them after all .
These provisions are unlibertarian , but they are far worse than that . There is only one legal term that seems quite to do them justice . That term is hostis humani generis : The founders of Confederacy were the enemies of all mankind , as admiralty law holds slave-takers to be . War against slave-takers is always permitted , by anyone , without pretext or need for justification . The practice of slavery is to be crushed , so that mere humanity might live .
Anyone who cares about human liberty—to whatever degree—ought to despise the Confederacy , ought to mock and desecrate its symbols , and ought never to let Confederate apologists pass unchallenged .
Those who make excuses for the Confederacy are at best ignorant , and even that ignorance is hard to fathom . Those who wave the Confederate flag just to make other people angry ? Well , I get angry at them . It works every time , and I 'm not even a little ashamed of it .
All friends of the Confederacy are my enemies . Wherever they appear . They 're your enemies too—they are the enemies of the entire human race—and the only remaining question is whether you face up to your responsibility as a human being and disown them .
My views here wo n't pass without controversy , I know . I would implore all of you on the other side to consider that your sympathies have been badly misspent on the Confederacy . No , you do n't have to start loving everything Lincoln ever did , including all of his civil liberties violations , and you do n't have to ignore the growth of federal power following the Civil War . You should do no such thing . But it 's not as if , when faced with a choice of two wrongs , you would do better to pick the greater one .

In a business where size matters more than ever , two of the smaller owners of cable TV channels are getting bigger together .
Discovery Communications , which owns TLC and Animal Planet , is acquiring Scripps Networks , which owns Food Network and HGTV , in an $ 11.9 billion deal .
`` Together , we 're about 20 % of the viewership on cable , and we 're at the very top of the list in quality , '' Discovery CEO David Zaslav told CNNMoney in a phone interview Monday morning .
The deal is predicated on a belief that channel owners like Discovery need more muscle in negotiations with TV distributors in the United States .
Zaslav also said the deal will benefit Discovery 's growing international businesses . Food Network and HGTV shows like `` Chopped '' and `` Fixer Upper '' have audiences that skew toward women , and Discovery operates channels in dozens of countries where some of the shows would fit .
`` We think we can take that content to our female platforms around the world , '' Zaslav said .
The deal has been in the works for several weeks . Viacom also pursued Scripps but backed out of the bidding war last week .
Zaslav and Scripps Networks CEO Ken Lowe grew up in the cable business together and have been friends for three decades . They last talked about a deal in 2013 .
In the years since , the cable business has come under increased pressure from online players like Netflix and YouTube . Channel owners have been challenged to prove that they have must-see , must-carry programming , lest they risk losing distribution .
Those channel owners do n't want mere viewers , they want `` super-fans '' -- `` people who are n't tuning in because they like you , but are tuning in because they LOVE you , '' as Zaslav put it on Monday morning .
He added : `` One of the questions we ask ourselves is , 'What kind of content do we have that people will watch when they can watch anything , or pay for before they pay for dinner ? ' ''
Discovery and Scripps ( SNI ) have pursued a similar strategy of owning , not just licensing , the shows on their channels . This could give the combined company a leg up .
When the talks were reported earlier this month , some prominent Wall Street analysts said they were skeptical of the benefits of a Discovery-Scripps deal .
It remains unclear whether the combination will help Discovery get more of its shows in programming packages being sold by YouTube , Hulu and other online distributors .
Related : This is the 'war for the bundle '
But that 's part of the goal . In a statement , Lowe cited opportunities with `` new and emerging channels including short-form , direct-to-consumer and streaming platforms . ''
Along with HGTV and Food Network , Scripps operates DIY and the Cooking Channel . Both Scripps and Discovery have growing web video businesses , but television remains the dominant profit driver .
Monday morning 's deal is valued at $ 14.6 billion , or $ 90 per share , counting Discovery 's assumption of Scripps ' debt .
Scripps stock was trading at about $ 67 per share before the deal talks were reported in the press . It closed Friday at $ 86.91 .
The combination will be reviewed by regulators . Discovery and Scripps said it is `` expected to close by early 2018 . '' At that time , Lowe will join Discovery 's board of directors .

LOS ANGELES -- NASA has tested new technology designed to bring spacecraft -- and one day even astronauts -- safely down to Mars , with the agency declaring the experiment a qualified success even though a giant parachute got tangled on the way down .
Saturday 's $ 150 million experiment is the first of three involving the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator vehicle . Tests are being conducted at high altitude on Earth to mimic descent through the thin atmosphere of the Red Planet .
A balloon hauled the saucer-shaped craft 36,575 metres into the sky from a Navy missile range on the Hawaiian island of Kauai . Then , the craft 's own rocket boosted it to more than 45 kilometres high at supersonic speeds .
As the craft prepared to fall back to earth , a doughnut-shaped tube around it expanded like a Hawaiian puffer fish , creating atmospheric drag to dramatically slow it down from Mach 4 , or four times the speed of sound .
Then the parachute unfurled -- but only partially . The vehicle made a hard landing in the Pacific Ocean .
Engineers wo n't look at the parachute problem as a failure but as a way to learn more and apply that knowledge during future tests , said NASA engineer Dan Coatta with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
`` In a way , that 's a more valuable experience for us than if everything had gone exactly according to plan , '' he said .
A ship was sent to recover a `` black box '' designed to separate from the vehicle and float . Outfitted with a GPS beacon , the box contains the crucial flight data that scientists are eager to analyze .
NASA planned to hold a news teleconference on the flight Sunday .
Since the twin Viking spacecraft landed on the red planet in 1976 , NASA has relied on a parachute to slow landers and rovers .
But the latest experiment involved both the drag-inducing device and a parachute that was 33 metres in diameter -- twice as large as the one that carried the 1-ton Curiosity rover in 2011 .
Cutting-edge technologies are needed to safely land larger payloads on Mars , enabling delivery of supplies and materials `` and to pave the way for future human explorers , '' a NASA statement said .
Technology development `` is the surest path to Mars , '' said Michael Gazarik , head of space technology at NASA headquarters .
William McConagha , the agency 's assistant commissioner for integrity and accountability , said he was continuing to investigate the scientists ' claims . Mr. McConagha said that Dr. von Eschenbach had offered to meet with the nine scientists before Friday , his last day in office .
“ We in the Office of Commissioner are extremely concerned about allegations like this , ” Mr. McConagha said .
In the documents , Representative Christopher Shays , a Connecticut Republican who lost re-election in November , is described as having called an agency supervisor a year ago to express concern about the fate of a computer device that is supposed to help radiologists detect breast tumors .
The device , the iCAD SecondLook Digital Computer-Aided Detection System for Mammography , is used with screening equipment made by Fujifilm Medical Systems .
Fujifilm Medical is based in Stamford , Conn. , the heart of Mr. Shays 's former district . In the documents , Mr. Shays is referred to as “ Congressman Fuji . ”
“ I am the Fuji congressman because I represented that district , ” Mr. Shays said in an interview Friday .
Mr. Shays said he had called the agency supervisor only to demand that the agency make a final decision , not that it approve the product .

He scoffed at suggestions in the documents that his call led the supervisor to overrule scientists and approve the device . “ That would be idiotic for someone to approve something they do n't think should be approved , ” he said .
A spokeswoman for Fujifilm Medical , Courtney A. Kraemer , said the company had called its “ local Congressional offices to ask them to help us get clarification on the F.D.A . process . ”

The dissenting scientists protested , according to the internal documents , that “ iCAD never tested the device by the intended users ( i.e . radiologists ) under the intended conditions of use . This is the most basic and fundamental requirement of all F.D.A . submissions . ”
An internal review said the risks of the iCAD device include missed cancers , “ unnecessary biopsy or even surgery ( by placing false positive marks ) and unnecessary additional radiation . ”
Ken Ferry , iCAD 's chief executive , said , “ We have done all the appropriate testing to get the product approved . ”
Mr . Ferry said that F.D.A . scientists were increasingly asking for more rigorous testing of devices , and that his company complied with those demands .
Diana Zuckerman , president of the National Research Center for Women and Families , said the Bush administration had “ finally made the device approval process so meaningless that it 's intolerable to the scientists who work there. ” Ms. Zuckerman , a longtime critic of the agency 's device approval process , particularly as it relates to breast implants , added , “ Virtually everything gets approved , no matter what . ”
The F.D.A . has a three-tiered approval process for medical devices that , depending on their newness or complexity , requires varying amounts of proof .
A growing chorus of critics contends that the agency requires few devices to complete the most rigorous of these reviews and instead allows most devices to be cleared with minimal oversight . In 2007 , 41 devices went through the most rigorous process , compared with 3,052 that had abbreviated reviews .

According to internal documents , some scientists in the agency 's device division seem to agree with these critics . One extensive memorandum argued that F.D.A . managers had encouraged agency reviewers to use the abbreviated process even to approve devices that are so complex or novel that extensive clinical trials should be required .
For instance , Shina Systems , an Israeli company , applied for approval for AngioCt , a device that combines CT images with X-rays to help guide cardiac surgeons during angioplasty and stenting procedures . The company sought an abbreviated review , according to the documents .
An F.D.A . reviewer said the company should conduct a clinical trial to prove that the device works since it is novel and risky .
“ Should the images be misleading , ” Dr. Brian Lewis , an agency cardiologist , wrote in a memorandum , “ F.D.A . could expect immediate misguidance of catheters and possibly puncture of coronary vessels or overaggressive , inappropriate or inadequate stent or balloon use . ”
Nonetheless , an F.D.A . supervisor — after meeting with Shina representatives — pressed scientists to consider allowing an abbreviated review , according to the documents . The agency 's decision on the device is pending , according to the documents .
Dr. John Smith , a lawyer for Shina , wrote in an e-mail message that he would not comment on “ ongoing regulatory matters . ”
Why do we care ? Why do we care when Japanese megastar Kazuchika Okada and Canadian savant Kenny Omega pretend to fight each other for 60 electrifying minutes in the Tokyo Dome ? Why do we care about AJ Styles , with his luscious hair and shiny blue gloves , making his surprise WWE debut at last year 's Royal Rumble as his opponent Roman Reigns looks on shocked - despite the reality of the two probably sitting down to lunch together earlier that day ?
Why do we care , when none of it is real ? Because it does n't matter . The drama . The danger . The glory and the tragedy . The preposterousness and pomposity and madness and athletic wonder ; the moments that tread the lines between real and fake , the backstage politics and the stage-front fallout .
We all know professional wrestling is a fundamentally daft endeavour - especially when Mixed Martial Arts exists . But we now live in a world where no one is really pretending to wrestle is real any more , and oddly that actually frees the performers up to act like it is real . Like any other TV show , the fans do n't need to believe , they just want to suspend their disbelief .
The Japanese have known this for a long time , and their wrestling video games have reflected this innate understanding of the actual essence of puroresu . You may hear people raving still about AKI 's Nintendo 64 wrestling sims . 20 years on , despite blocky character models and midi-synth looped guitar music , they 're still a far better representation of wrestling than the shiny , lavish WWE 2K series . And that 's because they understood one crucial thing - they 're not supposed to be fighting games . They 're supposed to be wrestling games , where mechanics and scripting fold into one another to create the only thing that truly matters in wrestling : drama .
There 's another series that captures this extremely tricky balance - one that has gathered a kind of cult around it for over two decades . Fire Pro Wrestling , with its staunchly old-school 2D visuals and sparse Western releases , has long been seen by its cultish fanbase as the pinnacle of the genre , but most people in the West have no real idea why . The Fire Pro games lack the licenses that brought the AKI games mainstream attention ; they 're quite impenetrable if you 're not schooled in their odd mechanics ; and , typically , they 've been very hard to get hold of .
Cage matches , Battle Royales and even MMA-rules matches are available in Fire Pro Wrestling World .
Until now , that is . Fire Pro Wrestling World quietly entered Early Access on Steam a few weeks ago , and has already created quite a storm - especially as the last Fire Pro-branded game to make it to our shores was a godawful avatar-fuelled mess that appeared on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012 . ( That game should have been kept as far away from the Fire Pro name as Hulk Hogan from hidden dictaphones . ) The world has changed since Fire Pro 's 90s heyday , and those unexplained mechanics are now easily digestible with just a couple of Google searches - or , alternatively , in Fire Pro Wrestling World 's demanding tutorial , which is confusingly entitled 'mission mode ' .
It 's a curious game , this , especially when placed side-by-side with the grappling sims most people are used to . Strikes often seem to clip straight through opponents , moves regularly do n't work at all , and the wrestlers are constantly 'locking up ' ( where they both enter a classical collar-and-elbow tie-up ) .
And yet , despite these oddities , Fire Pro Wrestling World and its ancestors are deceptively simple tests of timing . Those constant lock-ups are key ; you ca n't initiate a grapple on an opponent yourself , just walk close enough and both fighters will elaborately connect to one another . The trick is to watch for their feet to hit the mat , and listen carefully for that familiar reverberating stomp sound . All you then need to do is execute an input ( the appropriate button for small , medium or 'big ' , and a d-pad direction ) and if you win the timing battle , your fighter will execute a move .
Why , then , does your opponent sometimes reverse everything you try , or you do the same to them ? Well , hidden behind the curtain are Fire Pro 's stamina and damage systems . There are no meters , just animation cues and an expectation that the player understands some of the basic tenets of wrestling .
There are some polygonal elements to the visuals , and the characters look unusually like Mount Your Friends protagonists . It works , though .
You 're probably not going to be able to pull off a giant powerbomb or tiger driver at the start of a match when both fighters are fresh - it will get reversed . Best sticking with small attacks until you can see your opponent wearing down . Even if you 're constantly on the offensive , though , you 'll have to make judicious use of 'have a breather ' to manage your own stamina . As I said , there are no meters to guide you here , just intuition and animation .
These are dynamics stripped not from fighting but from the manufactured drama of pro wrestling , and they work in tandem with the demanding timing mechanics to create long , drawn-out spectacles where the advantage swings wildly in either wrestler 's favour throughout the bout , and where the bad guy ( the 'heel ' ) can suddenly introduce a weapon to completely change the complexion of a match .
Perhaps the strangest thing about Fire Pro , though , is how little its rabid fan base actually seems to care about winning . Rankings , leaderboards , winstreaks ... these are nowhere near as important as a Fire Pro bout 's most crucial number : the match rating .
High scores are given if a match is full of incident , of varied moves , of pacing and of what wrestling fans and practitioners call psychology ( essentially , making the unbelievable believable through a commitment to character and storytelling ) . It 's why you 'll see Fire Pro players deliberately taking a rest and inviting their opponent to capitalise with a big move . It 's why the fervently popular subreddit r/FirePro is filled with 'five-star ' matches whose thread titles wo n't even mention the winner . It 's why there 's a whole community within Fire Pro who do n't even play , they just sim matches with AI . Fire Pro World is already shaping up to be the ultimate version of what is , essentially , a digital wrestling playset .
It 's a weird game at first , but when it gets its hooks in , it 'll grab you tighter than a Samoa Joe Coquina Clutch .
This commitment to representing the reality of pro wrestling has been woven into the series ' DNA for a long time , and we have a familiar name to thank for much of that . The one and only Goichi Suda , aka Suda 51 , cut his teeth directing Fire Pro games in the 90s , even penning a story mode that saw the main character killing himself at the end . Very Suda , then , but quite a bold move for a mid-90s 16-bit wrestling game .
Speaking to Retro Gamer , Suda explained the mindset behind such a brave storytelling choice . `` The final boss is a guy named Dick Slender , which is a parody of Ric Flair , and so originally I thought , we can have two endings here - one , you beat the guy and you get the happy ending , the other , you lose and get the bad ending . In the end , I did n't decide to go with the two endings - instead , you go on and beat the last boss , he gets all the acclaim from the crowd , from the people , and the screen gradually goes from white , to black . It shows his house , and he 's committed suicide .
`` For me , it was like an apotheosis - he had become a God . '' Suda tells us , pointedly . `` It turned into a shitstorm , '' he laughs . Wrestling . It 's a serious business .
Currently , Fire Pro Wrestling World lacks any kind of story mode . In fact , its whole UI still needs a lot of work . There are laggy character select menus , endlessly looping guitar riffs and a player select screen so confusing that there are multiple threads on reddit and GameFAQs asking how to actually start a match where you control one of the wrestlers . ( The game defaults , somewhat tellingly , to CPU v CPU , with no obvious way to change it ! )
However , where it earns that 'World ' moniker is in its connectivity . The online lobbies need work , but they do offer connected play , leagues , tournaments and more - and for the true wrestling nerds out there , it 's the Steam Workshop support that has them shining up their spandex .
EG community stalwart Mr Tom FTW made avatars of our video team in Fire Pro Wrestling World and made them fight each other , which is n't weird or stalkery at all .
It 's already possible to download , near instantly , brilliantly realised versions of the entire WWE roster , NJPW stars , wrestling legends , fighting game characters and anyone else you can think of , complete with comprehensive move sets and even alternate outfits . This really hammers home Fire Pro World 's status as the ultimate toolkit for wrestling fans , letting us recreate classic matches or conjure up dream bouts ad infinitum . And of course , if you 're feeling creative , the same edit suite used to build out the roster is free for you to use too , and to share your creation with the globe .
( If you are playing , by the way , and wondering where the hell all those wrestlers you downloaded have gone : you have to enter the 'team ' section of the edit mode and take all your new warriors out of the 'retired ' pool , which makes about as much sense as an Ultimate Warrior promo . But I guess them 's the breaks when you 're playing a small-budget Japanese early-access retro wrestling game . )
Notwithstanding the rough edges , Fire Pro Wrestling World is a very fine game . It 's quite obviously the type of fan service the series ' cult following would lose their mind over ( and they duly have ) . But it 's also a great and , finally , easily accessible point of entry to Fire Pro for fans of digital wrestling the world over - and a release that gets closer to the heart of pro wrestling than just about any other video game you can name .

For years now , we at TFTP have been praising the benefits of cannabis and it 's ability to heal . We 've even brought you stories of medical doctors using cannabis to help opiate addicts kick their addiction to powerful narcotics . But now , a world renowned doctor , “ Doctor Oz ” ( Mehmet Oz ) has joined us and has officially come out in favor of medical marijuana , debunking it as a “ gateway drug ” and claiming it may be the “ exit drug ” to help our nation 's addicted get off heroin and opiates .
Dr. Oz was a guest on Fox News ' Fox and Friends on Tuesday . As the segment with the physician and television host was coming to a close , Oz seized the opportunity to say a few things about medical marijuana . He said :
The real story is the hypocrisy around medical marijuana . People think it 's a gateway drug to narcotics . It may be the exit drug to get us out of the narcotic epidemic .
Oz criticized the government 's long-standing position on marijuana and said it should no longer be classified as a Schedule I narcotic , precisely the stance TFTP has taken for so many years . Oz stated :
We 're not allowed to study it because it 's a Schedule I drug , and I personally believe it could help .
Fox and Friends anchor Steve Doocy could only respond by saying , “ Wow , I have n't heard that one before ” and cut to a commercial break . But the public announcement was quickly noticed by several media outlets who ran the story . Forbes was one such publication which ran a similar story to ours .
For many years , marijuana advocates have been stereotyped as hippies like Willie Nelson , dreadlock wearing rappers like Snoop Dog , and shamed athletes such as swimmer Michael Phelps . But now , one of the world 's most recognizable doctors has taken his stand with cannabis , and it 's no longer the fringe elements of society saying the same thing . It 's mainstream , it 's medical , it 's Dr. Oz .
However , Oz is not the first , to come out in support of not only cannabis research , declassification as a Schedule I narcotic by the DEA , and an herb to be used to help people overcome addiction .
In 2015 , U.S . Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy made an appearance on CBS News and was asked about his own personal feelings about medical marijuana . In the interview he declared marijuana “ can be helpful . ”
Also , in 2013 , CNN 's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta had to apologize to his viewers for critical comments he 'd made about cannabis . In what appeared to be a very sincere apology , Gupta declared he was wrong about cannabis .
I apologize because I did n't look hard enough , until now . I did n't look far enough . I did n't review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research , and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis .
Instead , I lumped them with the high-visibility malingerers , just looking to get high . I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof . Surely , they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have ‘ no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse . '
Gupta declared that the U.S. government and other entities have been systematically lying to the American people about cannabis and as a result , the people , including himself at one time , had been duped .
What about you ? Are you still holding on the the propaganda that weed is somehow bad for you as if your brain is frying like an egg ? Please share your comments below . What does it mean for Dr. Oz to come out in favor of cannabis ?

It 's already a home from home for the Liberty Stadium faithful , but now away fans have given Swansea City 's hallowed turf a resounding thumbs up .
The venue has come out top in a number of categories in a survey of away fans for the 2016-17
season run by The Football Supporters ' Federation .
The survey asked visiting fans to rate both outside and inside the ground , on a scale from one , representing very poor , to five , for excellent .
The Liberty Stadium ranked first of the 20 Premier League clubs for entering the stadium , with a score of 4.43 — the league average was 3.65 .
And it ranked fifth for price of refreshments , first for choice of refreshments and first for quality and comfort of the away sector , with a score of 4.18 .

Now that might on the surface appear as negative criticism of the latest work by the renowned eccentric director Quentin Tarantino , but that could n't be further from the truth . It is a bit true , obviously . This is not a film to watch if you wish to be presented with an accurate and damming depiction of the American slave trade . Do you want to watch a film with Jamie Foxx naked and people who lose inordinate amounts of grenadine and Christoph Waltz as the man with the exceptional beard ? Well sir , tie your horse up outside , place your sixshooter down on the table , have a whisky and sit back , for Django is all of this and lot more .
Like all of the most recent Tarantino exploitation style films , there is a gossamer thin veil of attempted seriousness to this film which fools no one after the first thirty seconds . When I first watched this film , I was sat there thinking to myself , okay Myles , this is long and remember what happened during Inglorious Bastards ? Yes , you fell asleep . No , I know , there is a lot of talking and I do n't blame you , but it reflects badly on both of us when you squirm around it your sleep talking . I soon as I saw that the absolutely sublime Christoph Waltz was on-board , I made sure that I would watch this as well , as his portrayal of the SS Officer Hans Lander was the best Nazi ( should I say that ? ) I 've seen on the silver screen since Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth in Schindler 's List . The rest of the cast , prior to viewing , did n't matter to me . However , as soon as Leonardo DiCaprio flamboyantly introduced in possibly the greatest nod of the head committed to film and then slowly reveals the dark and abhorrent nature of his being , you can only sit back and watch in repulsed fascination . I chose chocolate as my snack of choice and soon decided I did n't want to eat anymore . Afterwards the days it goes on for I thankfully had that cache of uneaten treats to gorge on . That was good .
The plot essentially revolves around Schultz rescuing Django from some slave traders , in which a horse 's head inexplicably blows up , and together , like the odd couple , they go on a joint business venture killing bad people . As Django states , there ai n't nothing better than killing white folk and being paid for it . At this point I questioned where he had ever seriously looked at the potential job market . Relatively soon , about a day into the films running length , Schultz realises that Django 's wife , Broomhilda , has been taken into slavery ( took me by surprise , that ) by the owner of the infamous plantation ‘ Candyland ' run by the evilly unsweet Calvin Candy . The film does become a long rollercoaster ride of twists and turns and genuinely does have a lot of ideas which keep it chugging along at a nice pace . At points I was there thinking , okay the resolution must be coming up soon , then sitting back in my chair as it all goes tits up for Django and he now had more to do . There are pieces that , for myself anyway , felt like they did n't go anywhere or add anything to the overall plot . Jonah Hill , despite touring with the crew , really did not do anything . It was more as if his character appeared for several minutes in a scene which had no impact or overall addition to anything . It was amusing , but just felt like filler or an excuse for Quentin to write amusing dialogue for the sake of it .
One of the main controversies of this film was the use of racial slurs , which to be honest ; the amount of complaining was more excessive than the use of the term itself . Not being around in the 1800 's I am unaware how integral it would have been to their vocabulary , but I imagine they would have used it a fair amount . And really , it 's said by nearly every single character in nearly every sentence nearly every minute , I became desensitised rather quickly . I nearly did n't notice when it was uttered or spoken or shouted and after the film finished would go around using the term without realising . It 's fine when I call the ginger tabby cat it , but as soon as I mention the black cat it 's considered racist . Another one of the factors of the film which is frequently brought up is the violence . Do you like over the top violence and people basically exploding into gallons of grenadine ? Yeah whatever ! It 's so comic book and , as previously mentioned , bombastic in its nature you ca n't really be offended or sickened by it . The gore becomes a gag almost in itself with people bleeding and exploding left , right and centre with the music of Tupac Shakur running underneath . What would make it even more of a spaghetti western ? Hip Hop of course .
All in all , did I enjoy Django and recommend it ? Most certainly . The opening which harped back almost perfectly to the spaghetti westerns of old was perfect , the acting especially by Waltz and DiCaprio was some of the best of the year and more importantly , it was fun . It 's a fun film to sit back , relax , hold your bladder and just enjoy the spectacle which is put before you . This is the second in Tarantino 's planned alternative history revenge trilogy , so I can only imagine what the third will be . We 've had Nazi 's , slave owners so now we are left with the evilest people in history ; those who did n't rewind their videos when returning them to Blockbusters .

BILL Clinton made a sig nificant admission in Corpus Christi , Texas this month – saying he had decided to pardon Puerto Rican terrorists back in 1999 “ based on the stuff I was given by the staff . ”
But Ron Kolb , the citizen whose questioning prompted the ex-president 's comment , rightly pointed out that the FBI and Justice Department had opposed the pardons . The clear conclusion is that it was Clinton 's political staff who pushed for clemency – with the obvious goal of helping Hillary Clinton ‘ s bid to become a New York senator .
Bill still denies that was his motive , of course – but no one believes it . The lobbying by Hispanic politicians from New York on the issue had been years-long ; the culmination was noted by the New Republic noted back in '99 : “ Two days before the president announced the clemency deal , New York City Councilman Jose Rivera personally presented Hillary with a packet on clemency , including a letter asking her to ‘ speak to the president and ask him to consider granting executive clemency ' to the prisoners . ”
The FALN , a terrorist group devoted to independence for Puerto Rico , bombed the Fraunces Tavern here in New York City in 1975 , killing four and injuring 54 others .
It also :
* Bombed five other downtown New York buildings in 1974 .
* Booby trapped a building in Manhattan and then called the police , seriously injuring and partially blinding an officer .
* Exploded two bombs in Chicago 's Loop in 1975 .
* Bombed the Merchandise Mart in Chicago in 1977 .
* Bombed a Mobil Oil office in New York , killing one person , in 1977 .
* Bombed two Chicago military recruiting offices in 1979 .
* Injured three police officers in New York bombings in 1982 .
Even in those pre-9/11 days , pardoning terrorists who were n't even remorseful drew public outrage ; candidate Hillary soon wound up condemning Bill 's decision .
But when it comes to politics , they really are a team – Hillary 's administration would be staffed from the same pool that Bill drew upon .
The same team that freed hardened terrorists to win political markers for Hillary – the same team that 's now willing to tear the Democratic Party apart in its desperate bid to steal the nomination for Hillary – would once again be empowered to free the guilty and endanger the innocent , whenever it suited their political needs .
Why does Hillary think America will trust her enough to make her president ?
The Catholic Church 's past refusal to bury stillborn babies on holy ground , including a report on Milltown Cemetery in Belfast , where land containing unmarked graves was sold .
Across Britain and Ireland lie thousands of unmarked mass graves . People drive past them every day , not knowing that in them are buried tens of thousands of tiny stillborn babies . Hidden and secret , it is as though they never existed .
The babies ended up buried in these graves because of a piece of Catholic theology according to which babies who were stillborn or who died shortly after birth and that had not been baptised could be denied a cemetery burial . Their souls could not go to heaven but would remain in a place called Limbo . These are the so-called 'Limbo babies ' , stillborn babies born to Roman Catholic families who could not be buried in consecrated ground .
In a rare personal testimony , mums , dads and families describe the harsh effects of this centuries-old practice on their lives . Many of them secretly buried their children as close as they could to consecrated ground , or in desolate , beautiful locations they felt had been touched by God .
The film documents pioneering work by communities , clergy and people seeking change , such as at Milltown , Belfast 's biggest Roman Catholic Cemetery . In Milltown , families made the shock discovery that their loved ones , some of them 'Limbo babies ' , were now buried in a wildlife reserve . Their mass unmarked graves had been sold through error by the cemetery . The film follows events as relatives of the Milltown babies began a weekly protest , the Catholic Church tried to seek resolution , and people began to arrive at the cemetery gates with stories of unresolved grief .
Finally , Fr Thomas Norris , from the powerful International Theological Commission which advises the Pope , describes the current Limbo situation . Does it still exist ?
Walmart 's ( WMT ) the latest plan for world domination is called `` marketside '' .
It 's everything Walmart is n't . A chain of smaller , friendlier stores with a neighborhood quality -- providing fresh and prepared foods for higher prices .
And now the FT has spotted one in the wild in Mesa , Arizona . Mesa is a suburb right outside of Phoenix , the area where WMT is building its first 4 pilot stores .
The intial rollout may be small , but WMT inadvertantly revealed its true plans for Marketside via a job post that was quickly taken down : The store is planned to be a chain of more than 1,000 locations with more than $ 10 billion in yearly revenue .
Walmart will pull in more than $ 400 billion in revenue this year , so $ 10 billion is a drop in the bucket . But do n't discount the effort too quickly . WMT 's growth in the US is limited because it is running out of places that do n't already have Walmarts , so a new format creates new growth opportunities . Plus , the margins on that $ 10 billion could be higher than those in Walmart stores .
The all green lowercase letters , purple awnings , and natural wood finish around the entrances probably have you excited already . However , there is one obvious and very intentional omission on marketside stores : any reference to Walmart .

KANSAS CITY , Kan. — A free man for less than a week , Lamonte McIntyre says he is just trying to take his time trying to get `` acclimated '' and get `` back to [ his ] life . ''
But at age 42 , he is starting from scratch — he has no resume , no work experience .
Even though he spent years behind bars for a crime he never committed , McIntyre will get no financial or social support from the state .
Kansas , where McIntyre was incarcerated , is one of 18 states that offers zero compensation for those who 've been wrongfully convicted .
In Missouri , the state will pay $ 50 a day for wrongful incarceration . However , the individual must be proven innocent by DNA .
Colorado offers $ 70,000 a year . Michigan gives $ 50,000 a year .
`` We are stealing a part of their lives and they are not guilty of what they 've done . And they should have more than an apology from the state , '' said Kansas State Sen. David Haley , a Democrat from Kansas City , Kansas .
For the last two years , Haley has tried to push for a bill to compensate individuals who have been wrongfully convicted . Both times , his bills have failed .
Last year , Senate Bill 125 had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee . The bill would have compensated individuals $ 80,000 for each year of wrongful incarceration , similar to what the state of Texas pays .
The committee ultimately requested the Kansas Judicial Council to examine the issue further and look at what other states were doing . According to the council 's executive director , Nancy Strouse , the council did n't have time to complete a comprehensive study but agreed to assist in research on existing laws and policies in other states . Later , the Legislative Research Department was asked to conduct the research instead .
However , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee told 41 Action News Monday legislative research is working on a `` roadmap '' for lawmakers by looking up what other states do . The goal would be to find a good plan that best fits Kansas .
Part of McIntyre 's legal team has set up a site to help fundraise for his future . The goal is set at $ 5,000 and was more than halfway met Monday .
Editor 's note : A previous version of this story stated that the Kansas Judicial Council declined to look into compensation for people who were wrongfully-convicted . Kansas Judicial Council Executive Director Nancy J. Strouse later told 41 Action News that the council did n't have time for a comprehensive study but agreed to look into policies in other states and later asked the Legislative Research Department to conduct the research instead . The story has been updated .
It 's reassuring that Premier Kathleen Wynne was welcomed to the India 's Golden Temple despite a major newspaper 's front-page warning that she would be shunned as “ pro-gay , ” says Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown . “ One 's sexual orientation should have no bearing on politics , foreign affairs or public service , ” said Brown in a statement Monday .
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne tours the Golden Temple , the holiest shrine of the Sikh faith , on Sunday , in Amritsar , India . ( Robert Benzie / Toronto Star )
The PC leader recently returned from a trip to India with several of his MPPs . “ I know the vast majority in Canada and India share my condemnation of homophobia. ” On Sunday , the Hindustan Times , which has a circulation of 1.1 million , published a headline stating “ Pro-gay Ontario premier runs into an ethical wall in Punjab ” on the eve of her visit to the Sikh faith 's revered temple .

The story below said the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee decided not to honour Wynne — who is openly gay and in India on a trade mission with her spouse , Jane Rounthwaite — with a siropa ( robe of honour ) during her visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar . “ Reason : Wynne , a lesbian , is a supporter of same-sex marriages , a practice opposed by the Akal Takht , the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs , ” the newspaper wrote in the second most important story on its front page . As events played out , Wynne was given a warm welcome at the temple and received the orange cotton robe in a private ceremony after touring the site for two hours . Brown suggested the media-fuelled controversy was regrettable . “ I would certainly be disappointed if the sequence of events happened as reported . There is no place for homophobia anywhere , regardless if it is in Amritsar or Toronto , ” he said in a statement to the Star .
“ I am glad that , despite conflicting reports , the premier was welcomed to the Golden Temple. ” Wynne said she was thrilled by the visit , where she also helped prepare chapati in a huge kitchen that serves free meals to 70,000 pilgrims daily .

“ People were so gracious and happy to have us there . It was very humbling , actually , ” she told the Star 's Robert Benzie . “ The head of the temple wanted to talk about one issue . You know what it was ? Turbans on motorcycles , helmets on motorcycles , ” she added , noting that Ontario does not allow religious exemptions for wearing a helmet while riding . Last month , Brown took four caucus members along on his 16th trip to India to talk about trade opportunities , even securing a visit with his longtime friend and supporter , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Before leaving on her own trip to India , Wynne was asked about Brown 's campaign-style visit and dismissed it as a “ winter vacation. ” “ Here 's the thing : Patrick Brown has travelled as a private citizen to India ; I 'm going as the premier of Ontario . We are taking business leaders with us . We are doing real business , ” Wynne said in January . Conservatives noted Brown 's trip was as leader of Ontario 's official Opposition and that he was welcomed in a visit to Modi 's home . Aside from trade , the political stakes are high in the visits to India as there are about 700,000 Indo-Canadians in Ontario and the Liberals are acutely aware of Brown 's strong ties with South Asian voters .

A recent critical essay by Kevin Kelly on the prospects of “ strong ” artificial intelligence ( AI ) has sparked some debate between those who believe that the emergence of superhuman artificial intelligence is only a matter of time , and between those – like myself – who are somewhat more skeptical . Kelly 's essay touches many salient points I 've been pondering about for quite some time now , and makes the case far more elegantly than I have been able to : the AI myth rests on what is likely a false premise ( that intelligence is something that can be both disembodied and measured on a single scale ) , and because everything ink nature involves trade-offs , there is no actual reason to believe that humans are n't already quite close to the maximum for human-like intelligence . The essay covers many other important points that tend to get ignored in the techno-optimistic ( or pessimistic ? I guess it depends on the point of view ) discourse about artificial intelligences , and I heartily suggest you read the whole essay .
However , there seems to be one further piece of evidence suggesting that strong general-purpose artificial ( machine ) intelligence may be extremely difficult if not impossible to construct . As far as I know , this evidence has not been widely discussed , but it might be useful nevertheless , so here goes :
If strong AIs are almost inevitable ( as many futurists claim ) , why have n't we seen an alien one yet ?
This is , of course , a variation of the classic Fermi Paradox : if intelligent aliens exist , where are they ?
I 'm not going to wade very deeply into the voluminous debate this seemingly innocent question has sparked . It only needs to be said that even when using very conservative assumptions about the emergence of spacefaring species , the speed of space travel and colonization of star systems , then the Milky Way ought to be positively brimming with alien civilizations . The galaxy is old , and in a cosmic blink of an eye , an ambitious species could conceivably have colonized all the star systems it desired .
Recently , we 've come to learn that starfaring might not be as easy as we once assumed , however . As Kim Stanley Robinson put it in his excellent fictional treatise of the subject , Aurora , it is quite possible that ( complex ) life is for all intents and purposes a planetary phenomenon , fundamentally unsuited for the demands of living and thriving in worlds it had n't co-evolved with . Fleshy meat-sacks like use are just not very well suited for the rigors of vacuum , zero gravity and hard radiation . What 's more , even if these fairly straightforward and linear hazards can be mitigated , it seems extremely , profoundly difficult to construct self-contained miniature ecosystems that can keep humans healthy and happy for almost infinite periods of time . Complexity theory in fact suggests that while constructing such habitats might be possible ( only very hard ) , making them self-sustaining to the extent required for subluminal travel between the stars may be forever out of our reach . ( I suggest you to read what Kim Stanley Robinson has to say about the topic here . )
What is perhaps an obvious solution , therefore , is to engineer intelligence that is better adapted to the interstellar void . I remain agnostic about whether that might be feasible at some point in the future : there seems to be no fundamental reasons to think it will be impossible , but I would n't hold my breath while waiting regardless . My suspicion is that such an intelligence would in effect be an engineered version of baseline Earth-human , adapted to life in space but still essentially biological .
However , in theory , space would be the perfect environment for a true machine intelligence . A machine intelligence should not care overmuch about those pesky biological limitations that may forever doom ( or bless ) the baseline humanity to inhabit this one world only . Vacuum and low gravity might in fact be the preferable environment for such a being : outside corrosive atmosphere , with abundant sunlight to capture for energy and the vast wealth of the asteroid belt to mine , what limitations a machine intelligence would have to suffer from ? It seems quite straightforward to assume that if machine intelligences arise at all , they would sooner or later make their way to space – the final frontier . A machine intelligence in space would be free to expand almost exponentially , building automated factories or true self-replicating von Neumann machines . And for a machine intelligence , the vast gulf between the stars might be tolerable to cross – if only to seed the another star system with von Neumann machines . That , by the way , is the most cost-effective and the fastest way to explore the whole galaxy , and it would only require the AI to successfully launch one self-replicating starprobe – hardly a task beyond the capabilities of projected superhuman AIs .
In fact , many knowledgeable observers believe that if humanity is to ever contact intelligent aliens , the actual contact is most likely to happen through intelligent machines . There is even a possibility that such machines already exist in our solar system , but for some reason or another they have n't chosen to make themselves visible to us . A machine intelligence might be watching – but it might also be deeply uninterested about the comings and goings of “ biologicals ” deep within the gravity well and corrosive , unpredictable atmosphere of one of the planets . But how long would it remain uninterested ? Remember , if even one alien super-AI would 've become interested in space exploration with inexpensive von Neumann probes , it could seed all the star systems in the galaxy within half a million years – provided that it takes 500 years for the self-replicator to construct a copy of itself .
Remember also that it 's totally believable that alien civilizations just as capable as us have risen at least one billion years before our time .
There is , of course , another possibility . The simplest explanation for the fact that we have n't seen even one alien AI is that truly strong artificial intelligence that transcends the drawbacks of its biological originators is for all intents and purposes impossible to construct . After all , as Fermi originally noted , the galaxy ( not to mention the universe ) is both vast and old , and there seems to be little reason to assume humans have been its first species to seriously think about building artificial intelligence . ( This hunch seems to find quite a bit of support from the recent discoveries of extrasolar planetary systems . ) And an AI-driven self-replicating von Neumann probe should have been able to reach every planet in the galaxy in practically no time flat , even if travel between the stars takes thousands of years .
Practical impossibility of a superhuman AI would explain why we have n't noticed any signs artificial intelligence . It would also explain why we have n't seen any signs of a runaway AI , for instance : as far as we know , in the admittedly tiny sphere of the universe we 're practically able to observe in sufficient detail , there are no megaprojects such a demented AI might construct – as many AI enthusiasts caution . ( I believe a person who is obsessed about the dangers of a strong AI is as much an AI enthusiast as the one who believes such an AI would usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and even eternal life . )
It might well be that the continuing absence of either human-built or alien AI eventually validates much of Kevin Kelly 's criticism in the essay mentioned in the introduction : a priori , it seems just as believable to assume that humans are already fairly high up on the general intelligence ladder and hence difficult to improve upon , if we use human intelligence as a measuring stick ( which we probably should n't , but that 's a different discussion ) . It may well be that constructing intelligence that is significantly more intelligent than we are will be fundamentally impossible , because of unavoidable trade-offs and drawbacks that are likely to be inherent in such a complex system . And it is entirely possible that the current computational paradigm is fundamentally incapable of even replicating human thought processes , except in speeds that are far slower than what actually happens in the human brains – and , hence , it is very possible that more transistors and faster computation , which many blithely assume will eventually overtake human brains , will never in actuality produce an emulation that will outcompete a human .
It may well be that not just complex life but human-like intelligence are essentially planetary or at least biological phenomena , and as long as we do n't see an alien AI probe bearing towards us , this conclusion is just as likely as other conclusions made about artificial intelligence – a concept of significant , even religious power , but which does not exist .
And , as far as the Fermi paradox goes , my hunch is that the combination of two things explains most of the question : complex life is difficult to sustain outside the ecosystem it co-evolved with , and we are n't observing von Neumann messengers or machine civilizations because the necessary general purpose toolmaking intelligence is also very hard thing to sustain outside the fundamentally biological substrate that is the only medium we know it can reside in . Of course , we have n't been looking up in sufficient detail for very long , and I may be proven very wrong .

Tropical Storm Bill caught meteorologists ' attention when it began as a small series of thunderstorms over the Yucatan Peninsula on June 12th , 2015 . The low-pressure system moved north , gathering strength over the Gulf of Mexico until it was organized enough to be classified as a tropical storm in the early morning hours of June 16th . It made landfall on Matagorda Island at 11:45AM CDT on June 16th with peak wind speeds of 60mph , and had the potential to gain intensity over land due to Texas and Oklahoma 's soaked soils from previous storms . Instead Bill lost strength as it moved through Texas and was reclassified as a tropical depression at 4:00AM CDT on June 17th , and by the time it hit Dallas maximum wind speeds had dropped to about 35-40 mph at the National Weather Service 's Fort Worth weather station .
Bill brought severe rain to Texas , Oklahoma , Missouri , Illinois , and Indiana , with a peak rainfall of 13.28 inches near El Campo , Texas . This region of Texas experienced many storms in the weeks before Bill , so this additional storm caused dangerous floods . In Dallas and Fort Worth the rainfall totals were much lower , with peak 24-hr rainfall totals of about 1-2 inches and 2-3 inches respectively ( you can order free Precipitation Reports on our site to check address-specific rainfall totals ! ) .
We have a weather sensor network live in Dallas that captured temperature , pressure , humidity , and wind measurements throughout the storm . Bill passed over Dallas between 5:00AM and 6:00PM on June 17th . There is a clear fall in pressure throughout the storm , and then a rise in pressure as the storm passes , signaling the return to more normal levels of atmospheric pressure . In most areas of Dallas the roof-level wind speeds were lower than airport-measured winds ; our network of stations measured roof-level peak wind gusts of 15 – 35 mph .
If we focus on just one station we can see a detailed view of the temperature , humidity , pressure , wind speed , and wind direction measurements . As the pressure dropped , wind grew faster and the direction of wind origin shifted from the east , to the south , then finally to the west .
By hosting a weather station , you can have access to this kind of real-time and historic data collected right on your property ! If you 're in our current or planned coverage areas , we 're actively looking for sites and would love to talk to you . You can submit your information here and we 'll reach out to you to get more information on the installation site .

KOIN 6 News Staff - PORTLAND , Ore. ( KOIN ) -- - Hunter the dog , whose firefighter owner last month fought to get him back after he ran away , has been adopted by a new family .
The one-year-old black lab made headlines last month after William Jones , his owner , made a plea to get him back . Jones was fighting a wildfire in eastern Washington when Hunter escaped from his friends care and was taken in by the Humane Society of Southwest Washington .
Hunter was n't micro chipped or wearing a collar so the HSSW waited 10 days and then he was adopted by a new family . When Jones returned from the wildfire and discovered his dog had been adopted by a new family , he publicly begged for him back .
The family gave in to the pressure and gave Hunter back to Jones . However , on October 14 , HSSW again had Hunter in their care after he ran away .
This time , Jones did n't want him back . He is moving out of state , he told HSSW .
Hunter has now been adopted by a new family .
HSSW hopes this story will remind people of the responsibility of caring for a pet . They also believe social media played a role in the story and `` its collective need to assign blame . ''

News Analysis
( MoneyWatch ) Among the policies lawmakers are considering as part of the `` fiscal cliff '' talks in Washington is to change how the government measures inflation in Social Security payments . President Barack Obama has proposed adopting what is known as a `` chained '' Consumer Price Index , or CPI , as part of his plan to reduce the nation 's deficit and raise revenue through an income tax hike wealthy Americans .
Advocates contend that this approach is a relatively painless way to shrink the government 's budget gap and to shore up the federal retirement program , which they contend is financially troubled . But liberal lawmakers and pundits have panned the idea , arguing that it would result in lower benefits for Social Security recipients , millions of whom depend on the program as their main source of income .
What does chained-CPI mean ?
The government currently calculates Social Security 's cost-of-living adjustment , or COLA , each year based on how inflation affects urban wage earners and clerical workers . Known as CPI-W , this index measures changes in the prices of a fixed basket of goods that are deemed to be representative of regular purchases by wage earners .
In contrast , the chained-CPI assumes that as prices increase , consumers make substitutions in what they purchase . The common illustration is that if the price of beef increases but the price of chicken is stable , consumers will purchase less beef and more chicken .
The chained-CPI is being proposed to adjust not only Social Security benefits , but also benefits from a host of other federal programs , such as federal pensions , veterans benefits and Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) . It would also be used to index future increases in tax brackets . This last item is particularly important because if tax brackets rise at a slower rate , then federal tax revenues will increase , also helping to reduce the deficit .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that for the past decade , the chained-CPI increased at an annual rate that was about 0.33 percent lower than the CPI-W . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in future years , increases in the chained-CPI might be 0.25 percent lower each year than increases in the CPI-W .
Based on the CPI-W , the Social Security COLA was zero for both 2010 and 2011 , 3.7 percent for 2012 , and will be 1.7 percent for 2013 . The average dollar increase in Social Security next year will be about $ 21 per month ; it would have been about $ 17 per month if Social Security had based the increase on the chained-CPI .
Earlier this year , the CBO estimated that if the federal government had moved to the chained-CPI on Jan. 1 2012 , it would save more than $ 220 billion over 10 years . The net savings would be considerably lower if Congress adopts measures to soften the blow to the most vulnerable Social Security recipients .
Who would be hurt ?
In general , people who would be negatively affected by the use of the chained-CPI would be retirees and other beneficiaries who receive most of their income from Social Security and who are n't in a position to switch to other goods and services when prices rise .
For example , Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses take up a large share of many retirees ' budgets . Many retirees have no alternative to Medicare , so for these people the only `` substitution '' for medical care paid under the program is to go without it .
With Social Security , one reason that 's a concern is that millions of seniors depend on the program just to get by . According to the Social Security Administration , 86 percent of U.S. households with one member aged 65 or older , or nearly 39 million Americans as of the end of 2011 , receive Social Security benefits . For these households , Social Security income represents the largest component of their total income , at 37 percent , followed by wages at 30 percent .
You might think , what 's the big deal if 37 percent of a retiree 's total income grows at a slightly lower rate ? But averages can be deceiving .
According to government statistics , median income for people over age 65 is roughly $ 20,000 a year . Social Security provides at least half of total household income for 65 percent of all aged beneficiaries . And for non-married beneficiaries , that figure rises to 74 percent , or nearly three-quarters of their income .
For more than a third of of all older beneficiaries , Social Security provides 90 percent or more of total income , while for non-married beneficiaries that figure rises to 46 percent . These are the people who would suffer most under a chained-CPI , a group that encompasses more than one-third of all Social Security beneficiaries and almost half of all single participants in the program , many of whom are elderly widows .
Nine percent of the elderly population have incomes below the poverty line , while another 5.7 percent are defined as `` near poor , '' with incomes between 100 and 125 percent of the poverty lines . So a total of nearly 15 percent of Americans considered poor or near-poor . This percentage is 7.3 percent for all married people , 21.9 percent for single men , and 24.8 percent for single women . These figures are even higher African-Americans and Hispanics .
Let 's take a quick look at one aspect of the substitution issue . The average monthly benefit for new retirees in 2011 was $ 1,241 . In 2011 , the Medicare Part B premium for most new retirees was $ 115.40 per month , representing almost 10 percent of their monthly check . That 's for single retirees ; the percentage increases to over 13 percent for married retirees . And that 's not even counting out-of-pocket medical expenses .
There 's no way to substitute for Medicare premiums , and it 's difficult to substitute for out-of-pocket medical expenses . In other words , paying for these premiums and expenses represents a real financial hardship for the one-third of aged beneficiaries around the country for whom Social Security represents almost their entire income .
The bottom line : The elderly poor , singles , widows , widowers , and non-whites will be most negatively affected by shifting to a chained-CPI approach to calculating Social Security cost-of-living adjustments . If you count just those retirees whose Social Security benefits represent 90 percent of their total income , that 's over 13 million Americans .
Asked what the Obama administration would do to these retirees , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said last week that the `` oldest of Social Security recipients would be potentially protected from the impact of a change like this . '' He declined to offer details .
Possible fixes
The Simpson-Bowles recommendations on Social Security attempted to soften the impact on the elderly poor by proposing a minimum Social Security income . If your Social Security income as increased by the chained-CPI fell below this minimum income , then you 'd be paid this minimum income instead .
Another possible fix would be to continue using the current COLA for the Supplemental Security Income program , which provides additional support to impoverished elderly , disabled and blind people .
It 's not clear if and how a minimum benefit under Social Security or exemptions for the SSI program might work their way into the fiscal cliff negotiations . Any of these fixes impose a `` cost '' by reducing the savings in the federal budget .

A prime example of a Mies van der Rohe townhouse came up for sale this week in Lafayette Park in Detroit , and it looks poised to set a new high price for a Mies townhouse .
“ We 've had this property up less than 24 hours , and we 've had an extremely high volume of interest , ” said Realtor Bill Swanson , speaking on the first day of the listing . “ We 've had seven showings already , and multiple showings a day for the rest of the week . ”
Asking price is $ 313,000 , which does not sound extreme today , but when real estate prices in Detroit were depressed , such townhouses sold for a fraction of that . Now , house prices rise fast in the city 's desirable neighborhoods . More important here , admiration soars for the iconic work of modernist masters like Mies . In the same block , a one-story co-op with an outdoor courtyard is said to have just sold for $ 550,000 cash .

Inside this townhouse , the front and back walls are two stories of glass . The view out each side is the 50-year-old landscape of Prairie School designer Alfred Cauldwell , which wraps the units in greenery .

Mies ' clean-cut floor plan has a large living room against one glass wall , a smaller dining area against the other and a galley kitchen in between .
Longtime owner Toby Barlow did a thoughtful remodel that honored the architecture but tweaked some details , especially in the kitchen and baths . He stole space from a closet for a big Sub-Zero refrigerator , which expanded the kitchen 's work area .
He built a large tiled shower where the tub had been and covered the main floors with cork . In place of a dining table , he put a long counter up against the front glass , so everyone eats facing out .

Barlow pointed out the extreme thoughtfulness that Mies and collaborators put into Lafayette Park . For example , there 's no visible trash outside . Instead , trash is collected in an underground tunnel each unit can access .
A lot of outdoor parking is available , but it 's all set down a few feet below the grounds , so that view is minimized .
The townhouses include blinds you can drop over the glass walls . To eliminate clutter , they retract unseen into a niche when not used .
“ When you live in Lafayette Park , you recognize you 're living in a very thoughtful place , ” he said .
Like most of Lafayette Park , the townhouses are co-ops , not condos , and not all banks give mortgages , although Talmer and Hantz banks do . Many buyers pay cash , Swanson said .
Monthly fees on a co-op are higher than they 'd be for a condo , because they include a payment on the master mortgage and taxes , as well as maintenance , cable and water . The part of the fee that 's interest and taxes is tax deductible .
Barlow is moving just 30 yards away , he said , into one of the courtyard units . He did n't want to leave the neighborhood .
“ It 's imagination at its best , ” he said . “ You 're uplifted by the intelligence that 's all around you . ”

As you go out into the world , I have one wish for you : I hope that you always love the color purple . When people ask you which color you like best , I want you to always shout , “ Purple is my favorite ! ” as loudly and proudly as you do now . Because as you grow bigger and venture beyond our family to preschool and sports teams , some misguided folks might try to convince you that the things you love are actually off-limits to you .
I 've already seen the trouble starting .
It happened a few weeks ago in a children 's clothing store when the woman working behind the counter overheard you begging me to buy you a pair of lavender skinny jeans . You were too busy holding them up to yourself and twirling around , so you did n't notice the saleswoman 's sigh and you did n't see her roll her eyes , but I did and it hurt . Because you see , little guy , those pants were on the shelf of clothing intended only for little girls , but you did n't realize that . You just saw your favorite color and knew those were the ones you wanted . What 's worse is that the saleswoman is n't the only person who will act exasperated at your color preference . And someday you will inevitably notice the way people react to you just being who you are , and it might make you feel bad about yourself .
Unfortunately , I know of other little boys who once loved purple or pink , but then they started going to day care or preschool and quickly switched their favorite color to something more comfortable for a boy to like . Now those little boys claim that they love orange or blue or green , but that 's not you . I hope you know this and stick by the person who you really are .
It is my biggest hope that instead of changing to fit a specific mold , you will instead simply stand up for the things you love .
I hope that you will be the one to show everyone that a little boy can love both purple and dump trucks , kisses and elbow fights , sparkles and dinosaurs , headbands and cargo shorts . No , this is n't an equation in which one side balances out the other ; this is simply adding everything up and at the end of it is you . You , the little boy who I love with the grimy face and nail polish chipped from playing in the sandbox . You , who are so perfect in your complete lack of self-consciousness .
I think that part of the reason you are so carefree is that so far in your 3 ½ years of life no one has tried to tell you what it means to be a boy . It 's been intentional . Your father and I both believe that it does n't really matter if a child likes trucks or ponies or Legos .
What matters to us is simply that you accept yourself , love yourself , and stand by who you are .
Right now , you are just you . You are n't so influenced by popular culture or popular classmates . But I know that as you grow , these days of being blissfully oblivious are going to come to an end . And I just want to hold you close to me and whisper in your ear that I love your happy-skipping-prancing run and not all boys need to walk with a macho swagger . I want to tell you that some things that might make you seem weird or different from most other people can also end up becoming your greatest strengths .
So , as you go out into the world , I have this wish for you :
Hold on to your sparkle , kid .

Poli-Sci Perspective is a weekly Wonkblog feature in which Georgetown University 's Dan Hopkins and George Washington University 's Danny Hayes and John Sides offer an empirical perspective on the issues dominating Washington . In this edition , Hayes and American University 's Jennifer Lawless looks at whether female candidates are hurt when the press covers their appearance . For past posts in the series , head here .
Of late , the press 's tendency to cover the style choices of women in politics has attracted a bit of controversy .
Hillary Clinton looks great and it 's fine . ( Reuters )
Critics lambasted as sexist both a New York Times story about the purses ( and “ purse boys ” ) of women in Congress and a Washington Post article about White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler 's stylish shoes . These pieces seemed to underscore the urgency of a much-publicized report by the organization “ Name It . Change It. , ” which showed that when the media focus on female candidates ' appearance , voters are less likely to support them .
But a recent study we conducted suggests otherwise . We find that women do n't pay a higher price than men for coverage of their appearance . Unflattering coverage does hurt , but it lowers voters ' assessments of both men and women equally . Like other emerging political science research , we show that voters do n't hold women and men to different standards on the campaign trail .
In our experiment , we created two hypothetical congressional candidates , Susan Williams and Michael Stevenson . We wrote eight versions of what looked like a typical newspaper article summarizing the candidate 's support for an education bill . The stories were identical except that we varied the sex of the candidate and a description of how he or she was dressed .
We recruited a national sample of 961 adult subjects and randomly assigned them to read one of the eight articles . Two articles included no mention of the candidate 's appearance . One simply described a press conference at which Susan Williams announced her support for the bill . The other was the verbatim equivalent , but the candidate 's name was Michael Stevenson .
The other six articles included one additional clause that made either a “ neutral , ” “ positive , ” or “ negative ” reference to the candidate 's clothing at the press conference . Respondents who read one of the two neutral stories learned that the candidate was “ dressed in a navy blue suit and red scarf ” ( Williams ) or “ navy blue suit and red tie ” ( Stevenson ) . The positive articles described the candidate as “ looking fit and stylish in a classic navy blue suit and fashionable red scarf ( tie ) . ” And the negative articles portrayed the candidate as “ looking disheveled and sloppy in an ill-fitting navy blue suit and tattered red scarf ( tie ) . ”
After reading the article , respondents were asked to rate – on a scale from 0 to 10 – how favorably they viewed the candidate , and evaluate the candidate in terms of professionalism , leadership , competence , empathy , and other traits . In the figure below , we present the average favorability ratings for each of the conditions .
The striking finding is that candidate sex has no bearing on voters ' evaluations . ( The findings are the same when we examine vote likelihood rather than favorability . ) When Susan Williams and Michael Stevenson are described similarly – whether in neutral , positive , negative , or no appearance terms – their favorability ratings are indistinguishable from each other . Shifts in favorability from one type of appearance coverage to another are also no larger for Williams than for Stevenson .
To be sure , respondents rated the candidates less favorably when their appearance was described as “ disheveled and sloppy ” with “ ill-fitting ” and “ tattered ” clothes . But Williams was n't penalized any more than was Stevenson .
If anything , negative appearance coverage was a bigger problem for the male candidate . When Stevenson 's appearance was described negatively , respondents rated him less favorably in terms of leadership , competence , and his ability to get things done . Williams paid no price on these additional dimensions .
Williams also did not take a hit when her appearance was described in positive terms . She actually received slightly higher ratings on integrity , empathy , professionalism , and effectiveness than when her appearance was not mentioned at all . Stevenson received no such boost .
Several things might explain why our findings differ from the “ Name It . Change It. ” study . First , their news stories included references to the makeup and clothing of only the female candidate . Their experiment never compared female appearance coverage to male appearance coverage .
But such a comparison is important not only because good social science demands it , but also because the media discuss male politicians ' looks too . There 's the “ central-casting appearance ” of the “ strapping ” Gabriel Gomez , the Republican U.S. Senate candidate from Massachusetts . There are Rep. Paul Ryan 's billowing suits and bulging biceps . And of course there 's New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie 's waistline , whose fluctuations garner almost as much attention as the Consumer Price Index . Appearance coverage is not restricted to female candidates , so an analysis of its effects should n't be either .
Second , our experiment held constant everything about the candidates except their sex and the description of their appearance . The candidates ' political experience , issue positions , and backgrounds were identical . That allows us to attribute any gender differences in evaluations to the appearance coverage .
The candidates in the “ Name It . Change It. ” study , however , varied in multiple ways : their marital status ( she was divorced ; he was married ) , issue positions ( she focused on the economy and crime ; he emphasized immigration , energy independence , the economy , education , and health care ) , and political experience ( they served different lengths of time in the state legislature ) . With so many differences between the candidates , it is impossible to know whether gender differences in candidate assessments were a result of media coverage .
Third , our descriptions of candidate appearance were a bit more subtle – and , we 'd argue , more realistic – than were those developed by “ Name It . Change It. ” Their negative appearance article , for example , reported that the female candidate “ sported a heavy layer of foundation and powder that had settled into her forehead lines ” and had “ famous fake tacky nails . ”
It 's hard to imagine how language like this would not affect a voter 's assessments of the candidate . But it is just as difficult to envision a scenario in which sentences like these would pass muster with an editor and regularly make their way into mainstream news outlets ( which remain the most influential political news source during House campaigns ) .
In fact , news coverage that includes any reference whatsoever to a candidate 's appearance is unusual . In a previous study of the 2010 midterms , we conducted a detailed analysis of local newspaper coverage of U.S. House races in nearly 350 congressional districts . Overall , fewer than 4 percent of the articles mentioned a candidate 's physical appearance , style of dress , clothing , or hair and makeup . And those that did were just as likely to be describing a man as they were a woman . Not only is appearance coverage not especially detrimental to female candidates , but it 's not all that prevalent .
We 're not the only political scientists to find that voters judge men and women in politics in very similar ways . In a new book , Deborah Brooks shows that women who act tough , get angry , or even cry on the campaign trail are n't viewed any differently than men who do the same thing . And Kathleen Dolan has found that voters ' evaluations of congressional candidates—male or female—are driven largely by party affiliation , not gender stereotypes .
We are by no means suggesting that gender is irrelevant in electoral politics , or that women 's numeric under-representation is a thing of the past . The gender gap in political ambition is substantial and static . Women are less likely than men to think about running for office . They are less likely to consider themselves qualified to run . And they are less likely to report having been recruited to enter the political arena . The irony of the “ Name It . Change It. ” study is that it could further discourage women from running by making them think ( erroneously ) that the media and , therefore , the voters , care only about how they dress .
The real barriers that women face are formidable . But while women are surmounting them , our research suggests that they wo n't have to worry about what they 're wearing .
Five International Teams Worked Over Four Months To Bring Several Big Data Projects To Life in 3D Virtual Reality Visualization Experiences
BRIGHTON , ENGLAND – Epic Games , in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust , a biomedical research charity based in London , has concluded the Big Data VR Challenge , awarding $ 20,000 to LumaPie . This international team created a VR visualization of study results of environmental and genetic factors that have shaped the development the lives of more than 14,000 residents of the city of Bristol . The Big Data VR Challenge brought together five teams over four months , resulting in an amazing combination of science and 3D design in virtual space , powered by Epic Games ' Unreal Engine 4 .
“ We thank all of the developers and researchers who dedicated their time and expertise to this competition , ” said Epic Games Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney . “ This combination of hard science with the type of 3D development normally seen in the video game world will hopefully inspire new ways for visualization of data to evolve as VR becomes a part of our everyday life . ”
The Big Data VR Challenge brought together a large group of international developers and researchers for an incredible competition , using Unreal Engine 4 to unlock new ways to manipulate and interrogate the huge data sets that are now generated by many scientific studies . The goal was to give researchers the unique ability to manage , manipulate and effectively present huge amounts of data in real time , a problem that has been confounding the science community for years . While the Big Data VR Challenge has concluded , this effort marks the beginning of scientific advances that will continue with collaborations between Unreal Engine developers and leading-edge researchers .
“ All the teams created solutions that address the hurdles of analyzing large data sets in new and ingenious ways , ” said Mike Gamble , European Territory Manager , Epic Games . “ LumaPie in particular have built a brilliant VR application that solves the challenge . They kicked it into the goal . ”
LumaPie is made up of the creative studio Masters of Pie and 3D software development consultancy Lumacode . For ALSPAC Children of the 90s data , the team successfully created a fully functional , scalable VR visualization for the world-leading study , exploiting the advantages of both Unreal Engine 4 and VR to create an immersive environment built from the data itself . Within their end-to-end solution , users have full control with the VR space , intuitively interacting with and manipulating the data to aid research , whether working alone or with several others via multi-user support .
“ LumaPie has delivered an interactive simulation with tangible outputs that can be applied and adapted to other studies as well . The results of this challenge are what we were hoping for and so much more , ” said Iain Dodgeon , Creative Partnerships Manager at Wellcome Trust .

Property owner says she will not rent to recipients again – as fears rise more will follow suit
A Croydon-based landlady has vowed never again to let her property “ to anyone on universal credit ” after the tenant installed by the council was switched to the new benefit and disappeared owing her around £9,500 in rent .
Amira Khan * says she feels let down , angry and “ in debt to everyone ” as a result of Croydon council being one of the first to adopt the government 's flagship universal credit scheme , whose rollout is proving controversial .
New universal credit claimants 'will get no money before Christmas ' Read more
Until now , much of the criticism of the benefit has focused on tenants being evicted for rent arrears following delays in payments . But Khan 's case shines a light on the damage the rollout could inflict on landlords and their future willingness to accept tenants in receipt of it . This week , Lincolnshire property company GAP Property threatened all its tenants with eviction if they failed to pay their rent because of delays in universal credit payments . The scheme is about to rolled out in the area .
Khan , who owns two flats and says the rent they generate is her only source of income , took on the tenant – a single mother – in 2013 after being given verbal assurances by Croydon council staff that the rent of £868 per month would be covered by housing benefit .
She says the council drew up the tenancy agreement , also signed by a staff member . The landlady says all was well until January this year when the rent was not paid for the first time . When she approached the local authority she was told that it was no longer paying her tenant 's rent as the tenant was claiming universal credit . But the tenant told Khan her payments had been delayed .
At this point , the health of Khan 's husband , for whom she had been a long-term carer , worsened and he died a few weeks later . While trying to cope with his death , she says she tried to chase the rent arrears but to no avail .
The council who got me the tenant ca n't or wo n't help , and dealing with the new people is terrible
In May her lawyer sent the tenant a formal request for payment of arrears and , after no response , an eviction notice was sent . The tenant countered this by saying she was being harassed and threatened to call the police .
In June , Khan learned that the tenant had been paid the back rent by universal credit staff . As it had not been passed on to her , Khan was told to fill in a UC47 form that allows landlords to claim rent arrears from the Department for Work and Pensions , which administers the benefit . She says she sent this in twice , but was later told it had not been processed as staff did not have the tenant 's national insurance number . Then the tenant disappeared , leaving the flat in a dreadful state , according to Khan .
The landlady says she is owed around £9,500 in rent and has had to spend £2,500 on repairing damage to the flat . “ The whole thing has been dreadful and I feel let down , ” Khan says . “ The council who got me the tenant ca n't or wo n't help , and dealing with the new people is terrible . I know one thing – I will never have anything to do with anyone on universal credit again . I feel really angry about it all . ”
A Croydon council spokesman said : “ Housing benefit rules allow councils to transfer tenants ' payments direct to private landlords to help prevent arrears . As in this case , councils are not allowed to get involved in rent payments once the tenant moves to universal credit , which is run by the DWP . ”
The council says it has suffered its own rent arrears problem since the new benefit was introduced . In February it said its rent collection rates had fallen from 91 % to 59 % for claimants . It has warned that without changes the system could have a devastating effect as it is rolled out over the next few months .
Landlord defends sending eviction letters ahead of universal credit rollout Read more
Heather Spurr , lead policy officer on universal credit at Shelter , says the homeless charity fears more landlords will follow Khan 's lead and refuse to take tenants who receive the credit . “ Landlords refusing to take tenants in receipt of housing benefit is n't a new phenomenon , but there is evidence that problems around the credit are exacerbating this , ” she says . “ More landlords are deciding they do n't want the hassle .
A DWP spokesperson says : “ Under universal credit , people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than the old system . Over time people adjust to managing monthly payments and reduce their arrears . The majority of people are comfortable managing their money upfront but budgeting advice , benefit advances and direct rent payments to landlords can be provided for those who need it . ”

Copycat thin mint cookies for when you have a craving and there 's no box to be found .
Man , do I have a treat for you today .
The reason I shared cut-out/cookie cutter chocolate sugar cookies with you on Monday ? It 's because I really wanted to share a recipe for homemade thin mint cookies , which are made from– you guess it– chocolate sugar cookie dough . Perfectly enhanced with peppermint and a divine coating of chocolate .
MY LATEST VIDEOS
I brought these to my friends at dinner ( because that 's normal ? bringing cookies in your purse to a restaurant . ) and they thought these homemade thin mints were real thin mints with chocolate drizzle on top .
“ What , you MADE these ? ? ” 🙂
Why yes I made them ! And now you can too .
I think we can all agree that thin mints are the crème de la crème of the girl scout cookie world . And that 's not including those chocolate coconut caramel gems by the name of samoas . But wait , what about peanut butter tagalongs ? I obviously ca n't choose a favorite but it 's safe to say that nothing tastes quite like a COLD thin mint cookie . We 're talking straight out of the freezer cold for that ultimate cool mint chocolate cookie experience . I was never a girl scout growing up– my sisters were both girl scout “ brownies ” ( that 's a thing ! ) , so every March our freezer would be full of thin mint cookies .
Please tell me you prefer your thin mint cookies cold too ? If so , wait until you taste these homemade thin mint cookies after hanging out in the freezer for awhile . It 's even better than the ones you buy in a box .
Which , I 'd like to add so there is no confusion , I fully support girl scout troops and encourage you to support this organization and their fundraiser ! I obviously still purchase samoa cookies and peanut butter tagalongs from the gals outside my grocery store . Hi girls ! Just wanted to add this .
So let 's chat about homemade thin mint cookies .
Thin mints are essentially a crunchy mint and chocolate flavored cookie coated in chocolate . To make them at home , you 'll need a tasty , flat , and round chocolate sugar cookie to cover in chocolate . If you remember from the other day when I shared my chocolate sugar cookies , they are simply sugar cookies with cocoa powder subbed in for some of the flour . This gives the cookies their rich chocolate flavor . Flour and cocoa are sifted together ( do n't forget to sift ! ) then paired with baking powder and a little salt . These 4 ingredients make up the dry ingredients in the cookie dough . We 'll also need softened butter , sugar , 1 egg , and vanilla extract . Since these are mint cookies , we will add a scant 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint extract to the cookie dough . Remember , that stuff is potent ! A little goes a long way .
That 's the cookie dough . It 's simple , straightforward , and since it is homemade– it does n't use any unnecessary or scary ingredients like high fructose corn syrup or artificial caramel color .
You 'll need a round cookie cutter approximately 2 inches in diameter . I had trouble finding one this small sold individually , so I purchased a set . I linked to a couple options in the recipe below . You might have better luck finding a 2.5-inch round cookie cutter . Anything around 2-3 inches is just fine .
After the cookies bake and cool , we 'll coat them completely in chocolate . Since there is so much chocolate in every bite , make sure you 're using a quality brand . Some of my favorites that you can find in a regular grocery store are Baker 's brand baking bars , Ghirardelli , Lindt , or even Trader Joe 's “ pound plus ” chocolate bars . As always , steer clear of chocolate chips . They just do n't compare to real chocolate . Flavor the chocolate with a little peppermint extract for even more cool minty flavor– and add a little oil to the chocolate as well . Not much , just 1/2 teaspoon . Why are you adding oil ? Extracts are alcohol based , so to prevent the pure chocolate from seizing , you need to add a little fat ( aka oil ) . You can also use peppermint oil instead of extract . In which case you wo n't need the added oil .
Use a fork to help you dunk . When lifting the cookie out of the bowl of melted chocolate , you can let excess chocolate drip off through the fork 's prongs .
I had a little extra chocolate , so I drizzled more on top/wanted to make the homemade thin mints look prettier . Obviously . Do n't you know me by now ?
These crunchy mint chocolate cookies ! Mouthwatering status achieved .
So if you dig thin mint cookies as much as I do and find yourself with a hankering– and no box to be found ( the horror ! ! ) – whip up a batch of my homemade thin mint cookies . Let me know if you try them !
Now does anyone have a copycat peanut butter tagalong recipe ? !
Homemade Thin Mint Cookies Yield : 36 two inch cookies Prep Time : 2 hours 15 minutes ( includes chilling ) Total Time : 3 hours 15 minutes ( includes cooling ) Copycat thin mint cookies for when you have a craving and there 's no box to be found . Try them cold or out of the freezer -- they 're incredible ! Print Recipe Ingredients : 3/4 cup ( 172g ) unsalted butter , softened to room temperature
1 cup ( 200g ) granulated sugar
1 large Eggland 's Best egg , at room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract 1
1 and 1/2 cups ( 188g ) all-purpose flour ( spoon & leveled )
3/4 cup ( 63g ) unsweetened natural cocoa powder ( or dutch process )
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt Topping 14 ounces ( 395g ) quality semi-sweet chocolate , coarsely chopped
1/2 teaspoon canola or vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract1 Special Equipment Sifter ( here 's the one I own and love )
2-inch -- or similar small size -- circle cookie cutter ( I own this set , another option here and 2.5-inch option here ) Directions : Make the cookies : In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment , beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy . Add the granulated sugar and beat on medium high speed until fluffy and light in color . Beat in the egg , vanilla extract , and peppermint extract on high speed . Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed . Sift the flour and cocoa powder together in a medium bowl . Whisk in the baking powder and salt until combined . On low speed , slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined . Divide the dough into 2 equal parts . Roll each portion out onto a piece of parchment to about 1/4″ thickness . Stack the pieces ( with parchment paper between ) onto a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour . Chilling is mandatory . If chilling for more than a couple hours , cover the top dough piece with a single piece of parchment paper . You can chill up to 2 days . Once chilled , preheat oven to 350°F ( 177°C ) . Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats . Remove one of the dough pieces from the refrigerator and using a 2-inch round cookie cutter , cut in circles . Transfer the cut cookie dough to the prepared baking sheet . Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used . Bake for 8 minutes -- the cookies will still appear soft . Make sure you rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time . Allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes , then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before dipping in chocolate . Once the cookies are cool , begin the topping : Melt the chopped chocolate and oil together in a double boiler or ( carefully ! ) use the microwave . For the microwave , place the chocolate and oil in a medium heat-proof bowl . Melt in 15 second increments , stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth . Once melted , stir in the peppermint extract . Dip each cooled cookie completely into the chocolate and use a fork to lift out . Tap the fork gently on the side of the bowl to allow excess chocolate to drip off . Place cookie onto a parchment or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheet . Place the baking sheet into the refrigerator to help the chocolate set . Once set , enjoy ! The cookies are the best cold . I love eaten straight from the freezer ! Make ahead tip : Cookies freeze well up to 3 months . Thaw overnight in the refrigerator if desired . You can chill the cookie dough for up to 2 days ( step 3 ) . You can also freeze the cookie dough before rolling for up to 3 months . Then allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator . Then allow to come to room temperature for about 1 hour . Then roll and continue with the recipe as directed . Recipe Notes : Avoid using mint extract ; I find it more resembles the taste of spearmint toothpaste than anything else . Peppermint extract has that wonderful cool mint flavor which pairs wonderfully with chocolate . I 've been getting questions about using this recipe as a slice 'n ' bake cookie to avoid rolling out the dough . This is doable , just keep in mind the dough is a little sticky . Roll into two 2-3 inch diameter logs , then chill for at least 1 hour as directed above . Then slice and bake . Did you make a recipe ?

COLORADO SPRINGS — Heidi Krieger did not ask questions when her coaches added a regimen of blue pills to the handful of vitamins she was already taking every day .
Krieger did not object that her daily workouts were nothing more than extended weight-lifting sessions with no true practice in the techniques of shot put . She liked winning and enjoyed the travel , the attention and all the other perks that came with the success — so even though she shot up from 152 pounds to 230 over two years , she did what her coaches asked and stuck with the program .
Once part of the steroid-addled East German sports powerhouse of the 1980s , Heidi Krieger is now Andreas Krieger — and his is an eye-opening reminder of the consequences of state-sponsored doping in sports .
“ In some ways , they played God without including me or asking me , ” Krieger said in an interview he recently taped with the German Anti-Doping Agency , for which he is a spokesman .
N.Y. Town Still Uncertain Why It Left The Union
The hamlet of Town Line , N.Y. , voted to secede from the Union during the Civil War . People in this tiny town are very proud of it . In fact , firefighters still wear Confederate insignias on their uniforms . The town is marking the 150th anniversary of its secession — and dragging out old artifacts and stories . Yet , the reason why Town Line voted to leave the Union is still unknown .
GUY RAZ , HOST :
It 's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News . I 'm Guy Raz .
ROBERT SIEGEL , HOST :
And I 'm Robert Siegel . The firefighters of Town Line , New York , are known as the Last of the Rebels . They sport a Confederate flag on their uniforms . And we repeat , this is in New York state , near the Canadian border . At the start of the Civil War , the hamlet of Town Line seceded from the Union . And as Daniel Robison reports , the story behind that secession remains a mystery .
UNIDENTIFIED MAN : Ladies and gentlemen , can I have your attention , please ?
DANIEL ROBISON , BYLINE : The only church hall in Town Line , New York , is filled past fire code . It 's a party marking the 150th anniversary of this Northern town siding with the South . Ladies are in elaborate period dresses . Gentlemen swelter in woolen soldiers ' uniforms , like Brandon Adkins who tells people he 's a natural-born Confederate from Upstate New York .
BRANDON ADKINS : One guy , he was calling me a Yankee . And I say , excuse me . I say , I 'm from Town Line . I say , I 'm a Confederate . He says , well , if that 's true , he says , I 'll kiss your rear end in front of everybody to see . He looked it up , and I guess he believes me now that they were the Last of the Rebels .
RAY BALL : I mean , I was very surprised when I first heard it about 10 years ago . I thought , no , you 're - come on .
ROBISON : That 's Ray Ball , a local history teacher . According to him , townsfolk gathered at the schoolhouse just after war broke out . After a rowdy debate , they voted 80 to 45 to secede from the Union . Shortly after , Ball says , five local men headed south and joined the Confederate Army .
BALL : The country was literally coming apart at the seams , and the seams tore much farther north than most people realize .
ROBISON : But locals are still unsure why Town Line , just minutes from Canada , took such a dramatic step . The town supported Abraham Lincoln for president just the year before , Ball says . And residents were mostly German immigrants without connections to the American South .
BALL : They had nothing less to do with slavery here . But - so it had to be something beyond that , why they voted the way they did .
ROBISON : Karen Muchow has researched the story for years and still has n't pinned down an answer . After the Civil War was over , she says , Town Line 's secession was conveniently forgotten .
KAREN MUCHOW : I think it was an embarrassment that it happened . There are no records that we know of . So there are no names , which may have been - it was on purpose .
ROBISON : So life went on . Residents paid federal taxes and even had a U.S. Post Office . Then , in 1946 , right after World War II , a local newspaper dug up the story . Word spread around the country . Telegrams flooded in , hounding the town to rejoin the Union . Even President Harry Truman weighed in , writing an open letter . So bowing to pressure , a vote was scheduled .
( SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC )
ROBISON : Back at the 150th anniversary celebration , the crowd watches grainy film footage of past residents dropping ballots into a box and then lowering Town Line 's rebel flag , which had flown on and off for 85 years . For NPR News , I 'm Daniel Robison .

Asked to share his thoughts on the eight-hour workday , that mainstay institution of working life in Canada , Matthew Sartori let out a soft chuckle . What eight-hour workday ? His reality as a production assistant in the film industry means he bounces between employers and typically puts in 13 or 14 hours per day , while being paid for only 12 .

“ I 'm not exactly happy about it , but I 'm young . I 'm 25 , ” he said , seated on the stoop of a Queen St. W. storefront as the revelry of the annual Labour Day parade swept past . “ I guess I consider this paying your dues , but I do n't know when it 's going to end. ” The annual show of workers ' solidarity , which took place Monday in downtown Toronto , has its origins in the 19th century push for a regimented and predictable nine-hour workday . According to the Canadian Encyclopedia , it was the Toronto Printer 's Union that in Canada led the charge for a shorter workweek , with regular parades that spread and were made official when Labour Day became a national holiday in 1894 . Laws were by then in place to institutionalize the eight-hour work day .

More than 120 years later , however , working life has changed dramatically . Smartphones herald emails and communiqués at all hours , while the punch-in-punch-out rhythm of shift work has waned with the loss of manufacturing jobs in places like Ontario . An average worker spends 50.2 hours per week carrying out “ work related activities , ” and 54 per cent of 25,000 Canadian employees in a 2012 work-life balance study said they spend time at night and on weekends to fulfil their job requirements . The defined boundaries of the workday , in other words , appear to be fraying . “ The eight-hour work day was not only the reality , it was considered the minimum , ” said Ted Brown , a former credit union employee who retired last year , describing how the demands of his job started to creep beyond the scheduled work day in recent years . “ It strikes me that it 's done because it can be done , ” he said . “ It 's harder to get a job and it 's a harder job once you get it. ” Leaning against a brick wall near Queen St. W. and Bathurst St. , a financial analyst watched as rock bands performed on stages dragged by semi-trucks , and rows of ironworkers in camouflage t-shirts marched to the pace of three kilt-clad bagpipers . He said he usually works between eight and 10 hours per day , and as a salaried employee , he pretty much stays at the office until his tasks for the day are done .
“ It 's an ebb and flow type of thing , ” he said , declining to provide his name out of concern for speaking about his employer . “ I would n't say we 're pressured , but there is a certain expectation that when you need to stay late , you stay late … It is what it is — kind of the new reality of work. ” As the Labour Day marchers proceeded along Queen St. , people wearing the colourful garb of their union locals waved flags denouncing precarious work and calling for minimum wage hikes . Many also argued that , with the federal election looming in the offing , the time has come for the Conservative regime to change in Ottawa . One man handing out material from the Canadian Labour Congress , for instance , chanted that the public should “ give ( Stephen ) Harper his layoff notice ” on Oct. 19 .

A Canada Post worker who asked not to be named said his entire livelihood could be on the line , given the Conservatives ' plan to phase out home mail delivery if elected to a fourth mandate on Oct. 19 . “ There 's a lot at stake , ” he said . “ But it 's all right — for now. ” Seated on a bench near the dress shop where she works , 22-year-old Anna Paliy said she 'd like to see a higher minimum wage and more predictable working hours . At the moment , she said , it 's tough to get by in Toronto , even though she 's working full time . She plans to start tutoring at night to supplement her income . “ I feel a little overworked , ” she said , moments before a band passed by on a union-sponsored float , ripping a cover of “ Fortunate Son ” by Creedence Clearwater Revival . “ I 'm struggling . This is no way to make a living in Toronto. ” MORE : Thomas Mulcair courts union vote at Labour Day parade

After news breaks about Mueller 's first indictment , Trump screams `` DO SOMETHING '' to unfeeling universe .
Robert Mueller is expected to make the first arrest in the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election on Monday . There 's no word yet on exactly who will be indicted , but there 's been a lot of speculation since the news broke .
And if Twitter is any clue , Donald Trump is especially wound up about it . He 's often been accused of trying to find distractions whenever bad news about him comes up , and after Sunday 's tweets it 's pretty hard to argue against that . It 's like a sampler platter of everything Trump has tossed out before when he 's felt cornered , a strategy some people might describe as `` flailing . ''
It 's not clear who Trump 's begging to `` DO SOMETHING , '' especially since Congress has already taken the bait and `` Reasonable Republican '' Susan Collins is calling for more hearings into the Steele dossier . But still , it 's the Twitter version of screaming helplessly at the sky .
This is the flattest-out lie in the whole thing : Trump fired James Comey specifically because of the Russia investigation . It 's been a story for nearly an entire year . Republicans have only been pushing their terrible tax plan for the last few weeks . And , more importantly , that 's not how you set up a `` NOT ! joke .
Blaming Hillary Clinton is a technique that worked well during the presidential campaign , which is arguably the last time Trump has had a win . So as Mueller moves forward , it looks like Trump 's retreating to his comfort zone , making false accusations while puffing out his chest and pleading for help at the same time .
Watch Now :
[ dropcap ] C [ /dropcap ] olorado 's latest education official to condemn high school history course standards wonders why those who wrote the curriculum missed what seems to her an obvious point — that the United States voluntarily ended slavery .
Pam Mazanec , a Larkspur businesswoman who sits on Colorado 's Board of Education , posted on a Facebook discussion thread her concerns that questions asked on the Advanced Placement U.S. history test “ portray the negative viewpoint as the correct answer . ”
“ As an example , I note our slavery history , ” she wrote to a woman who teaches AP U.S history . “ Yes , we practiced slavery . But we also ended it voluntarily , at great sacrifice , while the practice continues in many countries still today !
“ Should n't our students be provided that viewpoint ? This is part of the argument that America is exceptional . Does our APUSH ( AP U.S. History ) framework support or denigrate that position ? ”
Mazanec 's comments were posted Saturday evening on the Facebook page , Speak for DCSD , described as “ a place where teachers and parents are encouraged to speak freely about their issues , questions and concerns in the Douglas County School District . ”
She did not respond to several attempts to reach her for comment .
History teachers and civil rights activists question the state Board of Ed member 's understanding of slavery in the United States and the civil war that ended it .
“ The idea that the United States voluntarily gave up slavery is an outright misrepresentation of history . The United States engaged in a civil war to end slavery . There was nothing voluntary about it , ” said Stephanie Rossi an AP U.S. history teacher at Wheat Ridge High School . “ I 'm just flabbergasted at anyone who would make that claim . Flabbergasted . ”
Patrick Demmer , a pastor at Denver 's Graham Memorial Community Church and longtime civil rights activist , said Mazanec 's take on slavery shows “ she 's willfully ignorant at best or she is racially disingenuous at worst . ”
“ She should n't be on the education board . ”
“ What her comment and that whole movement is trying to basically do is repaint history in a way that takes away the ugliness and the hurt and abuse that the African American in America suffered and endured to get to where we are right now , ” Demmer said .
Mazanec took office in January 2013 as one of the state 's seven education board members . She represents the 4th U.S. Congressional District – all of eastern Colorado . She 's an ardent advocate of school choice and , as the state board 's website reads , “ interested in improving civics education . ”
“ Pam understands that a well-educated citizenry is vital to Colorado 's economic future and America 's national security , ” according to her state bio .
Her criticism of the new AP U.S. history curriculum comes as the Jefferson County School Board made national and international news for proposing to review the AP instructional material and , as suggested by school board member Julie Williams , with an eye to replace it with a curriculum that avoids encouraging “ civil disorder , social strife or disregard of the law , ” and instead promotes positive aspects of the nation 's history . Students and teachers have walked out in protest .
Mazanec 's Facebook post admonishing the AP and college level history courses that “ downplay our noble history and accentuate the negative view ” suggests she 's in-line with Williams 's agenda .
Mazanec 's posted message to a teacher named Jennifer said she had read the AP sample test and is concerned about “ an overly negative view of our history and many of our historical figures ( if mentioned ) . ” “ I think our students deserve to have all perspectives – include the negative viewpoints on the motivations , but also the positive viewpoints , ” she wrote .
Rossi , an employee of Jeffco schools , warns of the dangers of viewing – let alone teaching – history as a zero-sum game .
“ To me , history is not a collection of positives or negatives . It 's not a math equation . It 's a story . It 's a story about humans overcoming difficult circumstances . It 's a story of humans making horrific mistakes . And then it 's a story of human beings saying ‘ Wow , we ca n't do that again , ' ” she said .
Mazanec 's slavery comments “ trivialize the experiences of slaves ” and “ cheapen the professionalism of history teachers . ”
“ It 's shameful , ” Rossi said .
“ To say the United States voluntarily gave up slavery is like saying that Germany voluntarily surrendered at the end of World War II , ” added Anton Schulzki , a 32-year veteran teaching U.S. History and the AP coordinator at William J. Palmer High School in Colorado Springs .
Schulzki is a director of both the Colorado and National Councils for Social Studies and he has blogged for The Colorado Independent . He notes that the United States was one of the last industrialized countries to end slavery – not exactly a happy fact in the nation 's history . Still , he said AP History “ actually addresses the whole notion of American exceptionalism and recognizes what 's extraordinary about this country . ”
Schulzki attended last month 's state education board meeting during which members discussed the AP curriculum and whether it threatens American values .
“ History itself is political . We all know that . What 's happening right now is people are politicizing the teaching of history . That should be everyone 's concern . ”

DuPont And Dow Agree On Terms For Huge Merger
Enlarge this image toggle caption Richard Drew/AP Richard Drew/AP
The two largest chemical companies in America will become one entity named DowDuPont , as Dow Chemical and DuPont say they 're joining in a `` merger of equals . '' The new company will have a market capitalization of around $ 130 billion .
After the merger , the resulting behemoth would be split into what Dow Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris calls `` three powerful new companies , '' with a combined revenue of around $ 83 billion .
Now that the two companies ' boards of directors have agreed to term , their shareholders will also need to affirm the merger . Terms of the agreement state that Dow shareholders will get 1 share of the new enterprise for each Dow share they own , while DuPont shareholders will get 1.28 shares . They will own about 50 percent of the new enterprise .
The massive deal also will need the approval of federal regulators .
The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016 , with the segmentation taking place up to two years later .
The three corporations will have distinct identities , according to a news release announcing the merger . Here 's a list of relevant quotes , along with the projected revenue for each proposed company :
Agriculture : `` Leading global pure-play agriculture company that unites DuPont 's and Dow 's seed and crop protection businesses . '' Revenue : $ 19 billion .
Material Science : `` A pure-play industrial leader , consisting of DuPont 's Performance Materials segment , as well as Dow 's Performance Plastics , Performance Materials and Chemicals , Infrastructure Solutions , and Consumer Solutions ... operating segments . '' Revenue : $ 51 billion .
Specialty Products : `` The businesses will include DuPont 's Nutrition & Health , Industrial Biosciences , Safety & Protection and Electronics & Communications , as well as the Dow Electronic Materials business . '' Revenue : $ 13 billion .
As NPR 's Yuki Noguchi reports :
This painting represents a very special labor of love that the chief geeks at Geekcetera.net have been scheming on for a few years now . For the past few years Bunny and Everett wanted to commission a series of oil paintings of themselves , and friends , except painted into various historically significant works of art . Egomaniacal ? Absolutely . Cool idea ? Completely . As it turns out , though , getting this done is n't quite as simple as it sounds . Also , it does n't sound all that simple .
After finding a brilliant painter to make a few of their insane dreams come true , Bunny had another crazy idea . What if we could do the same thing , but with characters from our favorite shows and movies ?
The team immediately went to work , sourcing the right images and creating a series of composites and figure studies for the painter . Hundreds of hours and a dozen drafts later , the first of the 2012 Geekcetera.net painting series is ready for your viewing pleasure :
Sorry about the watermark . You know how it goes .
This painting is based on Rembrandt 's “ The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp ” featuring most of the major cast members of the last 6 Doctor Who is a series . The actual painting is over 3 feet wide , and two feet tall , and to say that it is stunning is an understatement .
I 'm an oil painting now . Oil paintings are cool .
No one cares about poor old Mickey…
When the painter dropped it off , we all stood around the office in a mixture of silence and intermittent high fives . It is just beautiful . We have several more in the works , including a very cool Firefly inspired work , and several other works you know and love .
Sorry Martha and Donna… Except not you , Martha .
To celebrate , we 're releasing a limited edition run of one hundred 12 '' x 15 '' prints on a beautiful 9pt matte cardstock . Each is hand numbered , and suitable for framed or unframed display . Once these are gone , they are gone .
You 'll totally forget about The Silence when you are n't looking at this .
We plan another run later this month , including a full scale print of the original . At only $ 19.99 , we expect these to be gone within a day or two , so order now if you want one ! Order this , plus any 2 items from geekcetera.net and get free shipping on your whole order , while these supplies last . Click here to order at Geekcetera.net .
What do you think ? Did we nail it ?
Netflix is now undoubtedly an entertainment behemoth . In the first quarter of 2014 alone , they streamed 6.5 billion hours of TV and posted revenues of over a billion . Last week , CEO Reed Hastings and and Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt talked about the future of Netflix , and how they 're going to harness their vast oceans of data to stay at the pinnacle of the market . In short ; they 're going to personalise and recommend channels , but not use the data to manipulate the shows themselves .
Speaking at the 2014 Internet Week in New York , Hunt outlined how the future of Netflix lied in tailoring precise recommendations for its users . “ Our vision is you wo n't see a grid and you wo n't see a sea of titles , ” he stated in his keynotes speech . “ Instead you 'll see one or two perfect suggestions that perfectly capture what you want to watch right now depending on your mood and who is with you , who is sitting with you at the TV right now . I think this version is possible . ”
He also discussed the limitations of traditional broadcasting , and what he called the “ tyranny of the grid ” - the way that traditional TV broadcasting relies on a fixed , 24-hour schedule of programmes , usually dominated by what 's universally popular , and not necessarily artistically valuable . Netflix , Hunt stated , aimed to use its data to provide “ 48m different channels for 48 million different subscribers ” , giving a home to cult and niche programming as well as common-denominator favourites . For instance , Netflix made the fourth season of beloved cult comedy Arrested Development , after it was axed by Fox in 2006 due to low ratings . It also alleged a new season of sci-fi cult hit Firefly in the meanest April Fool 's joke ever .
However , whilst Netflix will be using its big data to know your tastes better than you do , it will not be using Big Data to optimise the shows it makes . Speaking at the inaugural Code Conference this week , Hastings stated that data would n't be trampling on the artistic vision of the show 's creators any time soon . “ If you have great creators , and you give ‘ em freedom , you can end up with an incredible product , ” he stated .
He did say , however , that he let House of Cards creator David Fincher know exactly how many people switched off when Kevin Spacey 's character strangled a dog . Fincher replied “ Do n't ever tell me that again ” .
The two speeches seem to add up to a vision of using data to steer customers to quality content , rather than let data tamper with the quality of the content itself . If you want to experience the quality of Netflix 's content yourself , we recommend the second season of Orange is the New Black , which premieres on Netflix this Friday .

Ultrasonic engineers at Bristol University and The Big Bang : UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair are uncovering how a real life version of Dr Who 's fictional screwdriver - which uses sonic technology to open locks and undo screws - could be created .
Television 's favourite Time Lord could not exist without his trusty sonic screwdriver , as it 's proved priceless in defeating Daleks and keeping the Tardis in check . Now Doctor Who 's famous cure-all gadget could become a reality for DIY-ers across the world , say engineers .
Ultrasonic engineers at Bristol University and The Big Bang : UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair are uncovering how a real life version of the fictional screwdriver - which uses sonic technology to open locks and undo screws - could be created .
Professor of Ultrasonics , Bruce Drinkwater , who is working with The Big Bang to inspire young scientists of the future , says the answer lies in ultrasonic sound waves . By operating the waves at frequencies way beyond the realms of human hearing , they can be used to apply forces to objects .
The technology is already being trialled in modern manufacturing to fix parts together and ultrasonic force fields are being developed within the medical field to separate diseased cells from healthy cells . Professor Drinkwater and The Big Bang team are now exploring whether super powerful versions of these sound beams could bring Doctor Who 's iconic device to life .
He says : `` Doctor Who is renowned for bending the rules of science . But technology has radically moved on since the Doc first stepped out of his Tardis in the sixties . Whilst a fully functioning time machine may still be light years away , engineers are already experimenting with ultrasonic waves to move and manipulate small objects . ''
Engineers are looking into how ultrasonic waves can be spun at high speed to create a twisting force similar to that of a miniature tornado , which could undo screws remotely . They have also experimented with rotating ultrasonic force fields which would act like the head of a real screwdriver .
Doctor Who and DIY fans may still have to wait before they can add the sonic screwdriver to their Christmas wish lists . However , Professor Drinkwater hopes his work to make the impossible possible will inspire engineers , technologists and inventors of the future .
`` Doctor Who 's adventures have captured the imaginations of millions , young and old . And , however far fetched the Time Lord 's encounters may seem , there are engineers and scientists out there who are using their skills to bring the magic to life .
`` The sonic screwdriver may still be sometime in the making but ultrasonic technology is already making its mark in the medical and manufacturing arenas with some exciting results . ''
Professor Drinkwater has teamed up with The Big Bang , one of the UK 's biggest celebrations of science and engineering , to inspire young people from all walks of life .
Taking place at ICC London ExCeL from 10 - 12 March 2011 , The Big Bang offers young people the chance to take part in a host of free interactive shows and workshops including Sky One 's Brainiac Live ! and BBC One 's Bang Goes the Theory . It is also the ideal place to find out about the exciting career options available in science and engineering . The Big Bang hosts the finals of the prestigious National Science & Engineering Competition and also kicks off National Science & Engineering Week 2011 .
Thoughts on , Dave Rubin , the alternative media and so forth
Dave Rubin hosts the Rubin Report , which is a show that has long-form interviews discussing politics , religion and culture . When Dave 's show first started I was a big fan because I liked how different it was and I thought he was a fair balanced guy . However that has changed and Dave often comes across as either ill-informed or being partisan these days .
One of my main criticisms about Dave is n't about his political leanings , I do n't care about his politics . My criticisms largely centre around the fact that I do n't think he does enough research or background into the topics he talks about , and the way he handles criticism .
The issues that he talks about such as the media , the regressive left and free speech are topics that I 'm interested in . However whenever Dave is asked about these issues such as the media , his answers are always some vague thing about “ how crazy everything is ” and how he does n't know who to trust in the media . Fair enough , but after being asked about it numerous times you 'd think he would do some more research & give a more informed answer . I think it 's reasonable to say dismiss buzzfeed and infowars . Other youtubers in a similar genre been asked this question and I have learnt from that it 's important to take information from all sides of the political spectrum and make an informed decision . Zarathustra 's serpent ( a youtuber , I 'd highly recommend people subscribe to ) made excellent points about the media in this video https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=DzPH50VC4D4 . He has explained it way better than I ever could lol .
Most people will tell me “ oh but Dave is just an interviewer ” and I understand that but as an interviewer he guides the show . And he is telling his audience that the media is untrustworthy , and not being specific about it so they could end up not reading multiple new sources and thus create an echo chamber for themselves . This means they end up being somewhat closed minded and not open to ideas that do n't confirm their biases .
To be fair to Dave he has had a few liberal progressive voice such as ; Areva Martin and Trae Crowder , but his audience reacted very negatively to these two interviews . So this could possibly be a reason why Dave does n't explore more liberal and progressives voices because his audience does not react well to it . That 's not entirely his fault but he could 've pushed back against them and said “ hey guys this show is supposed to be about exploring ideas , and it 's important to be open to them ” instead of insinuating that Areva was a ‘ regressive ' . Even if people did n't agree with Areva Martin , she brought up some valid points about being pragmatic , in the sense that Bernie would not be able to get what he wanted done and that is a very fair point . And I think Dave could 've focused on the good aspects of her arguments and that he disagreed with some of the things she said about race issues . This is the interview I 'm referring to https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=nY5n4Zgsl7o
I think having progressive/liberals like Areva Martin is good , because if I or others do n't agree with all her positions , she can at least articulate them and she is not going to talk down to people the way Kat Blaque and Franchesa Ramsey do . I believe that more progressive voices would be invited , if Dave 's audience were more open to it and if Dave stood up more for speaking to people on the left we could see more of that diversity of thought Dave talks about .
Many will say but it 's ‘ his show and he can do what he likes ' be that as it may , I 'm holding him to this standard . Because he claims that his show is about ‘ battle of big ideas ' and I have not been seeing that for a while and I think others are getting a bit fed up too .
I would like to see more ideas being explored , than just free speech and the regressive left . I also feel that he 's focusing arguments and discussion on labels and group identities , rather than the issues themselves which imo does n't help the conversation and it turns well-meaning ideas like ‘ classical liberalism ' into memes .
https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=04NrkbbZxUE
Another label Dave loves is the ‘ new center ' he uses this label whenever he is able to talk to someone on the left or right . He has used this term with people like Glenn Beck and Mike Cernovich but these people are not the new centre they are just people who are willing to talk you , Dave . The whole point is to accept that people have different political beliefs , not that just because a person does n't like the regressive left that equals centrist . I do n't like labels being misued , the definition of political centrism . “ In politics , centrism or the centre is a political outlook or specific position that involves acceptance or support of a balance of a degree of social equality and a degree of social hierarchy ; while opposing political changes which would result in a significant shift of society either strongly to the left or the right . [ 1 ] ” Either way I find the way he uses the term to be misleading for that reason .
Dave has a lot of critics , and yes some of them are trolls that comes with having a big following on youtube . But even when valid criticism is levelled towards him he seems to take it badly and is not open minded to it ever . Yes , he did post a video in which he addresses some criticisms about being called a conservative but he is still dismissing constructive criticism made towards him . For example Philip De Franco made a point that Dave had put about misinformation on the Mosque attack in Quebec . Phil asked how Dave felt about leaving out a tweet with misinformation out . The original tweet had pointed out that the attack was committed by muslims and not the fact that it was actually a far-right extremist — this was # fakenews ( something that Dave rails against ) and Dave did not see the need to delete the tweet . Everybody makes mistakes , I do n't except people to always get it right , but when you 're in the alternative media and you make a mistake like that it is important to put out a retraction . A Twitter user known as wokieleaks salt , criticised Dave for focusing all his time on college campus kids when at the time a reporter was assaulted , and wokieleaks was blocked for it . I can understand why people block trolls , but Wokie was not saying anything derogatory , it was more that he 's trying to hold Dave to account . He also had a AMA section recently , and a number of people politely asked him some critical questions and he was somewhat dismissive to their concerns . Here is the link . If Dave does n't think Trump is that bad he could perhaps explain why , instead of just saying it 's the media being hysterical . https : //www.reddit.com/r/Classical_Liberals/comments/6ipull/hey_this_is_dave_rubin_lets_talk_about_classical/
Recently Mother Jones wrote an article about Dave , labelling him as far-right and although I disagreed with it ; I am worried that this will be further excused for Dave not to address legitimate criticisms .
I do n't believe Dave is a bad guy , but I think he could do with some improvements . He should start reading more , whenever people ask him his opinions on Syria he always says oh well I do n't know ‘ both sides are going crazy right now ' instead of informing himself . Most people do n't mind if you take a side , if you can back it up with evidence . If he did this once , I would be okay with it , because it 's honest but not all the time . He also was somewhat ignorant about Richard Spencer being a white-identitarian , this is n't a big deal per se but being someone in the alternative media he should know this . When Sargon of Akkad brought up the fact that Lauren Southern was engaging in activism and not journalism , Dave brought up a point about how the left does it too , which is something he frequently does when there is a criticism levelled towards the right . When progressives such as Sam Seder have engaged with him he has flat out refused to have them on his show . Sam Sholi a left-leaning youtuber has contacted Dave in order to have a discussion with him . I really hope Dave does this because Sam would provide constructive criticism and it would be good to see Dave chat with someone he disagrees with . I hope that Dave accepts , if he does n't it will be very disappointing because it will be a missed opportunity for him to engage with someone who does n't agree with him and maybe they could learn something from each other
I know that Dave is just an interviewer and the show is about his guests but he as an interviewer guides the show and should delve deeper into ideas , challenge people more if they say something absurd . Challenging someone does n't mean berating them , in fact it can make the conversation more interesting . I am criticising Dave because I believe he has a lot of influence and connections with the platform he provides , but I think if he takes on board some of these criticisms his show will improve as a result . He does n't have to agree , I just wanted to give my take on Dave because I was once a big fan of his and I think he can do better . Despite my criticisms , I think he has a lot of influence and I think a few improvements could go a long way .

All four senators are currently against the bill .
The ads are different for each senator and highlight comments they 've made in the past about the bill .
`` When the Senate unveiled its devastating healthcare repeal plan , Senator Heller said : ' I 'm telling you right now , I can not support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans . ' ``
`` But now , Washington politicians are pressuring Heller to support their secret backroom deals that will gut Medicaid and take away coverage from over 120,000 Nevadans , '' says the narrator .
Congress returns from a one-week recess Monday , and McConnell will continue working on getting the votes for the bill .
It needs the least 51 votes to pass , but moderates have worried the bill would cause too many people to lose coverage and conservatives say the bill leaves too many of ObamaCare 's regulations in place .
Appearing as a guest on Tuesday 's MSNBC Live , ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber -- infamous for advising President Barack Obama to deceive the public to get ObamaCare passed -- claimed that now , unlike in the past when politicians were just `` bending the truth , '' now they are `` explicitly lying '' as Republicans prepare to move ahead on repealing ObamaCare .
As host Chris Jansing spoke with two liberal guests and one squishy moderate Republican about the upcoming vote , she sympathetically asked Gruber `` how nervous '' he was about what was about to happen . Referring to Obama administration members , she posed : `` They truly believed that so many Americans had benefited from [ Obamacare ] and it was becoming so entrenched in the way that these kinds of programs do that they felt that America would n't let this happen . And I wonder , as you 're watching this vote and assuming again that this motion to proceed goes through , how nervous are you right now ? ''
Earlier in segment , as the group discussed Senator John McCain returning to Washington to vote on the Senate floor in spite of being diagnosed with brain cancer , Gruber suggested that the Arizona Senator and former POW was n't really so `` heroic '' unless he decides to vote in favor of ObamaCare :
I think it is ironic that John McCain is returning from a surgery that virtually no American could afford without health insurance to vote to deny 15 million Americans health insurance at least . So , you know , we have to step back and ask : What is heroic here ? I mean , it 's heroic he 's making the trip -- he has a heroic history -- but the heroic thing to do would be to stand up and say , `` Look , I just realized that I was the beneficiary of insurance and that Americans can not afford this without insurance , '' and , `` Why should we support a bill that 's going to take insurance away from millions of Americans ? ''
A bit later , Jansing recalled that Obama administration members whom she had spoken with had felt confident that ObamaCare could not be dismantled by Republicans , and then posed :
They truly believed that so many Americans had benefited from it and it was becoming so entrenched in the way that these kinds of programs do that they felt that America would n't let this happen . And I wonder , as you 're watching this vote and assuming again that this motion to proceed goes through , how nervous are you right now ?
Gruber -- known for his contribution to President Obama uttering the `` lie of the year '' -- began by complaining about dishonesty by politicians :
Well , I 'm nervous . I mean , look , you know , I was one of those people , you know , before November 8 , I said , `` Look , the 2012 election was the last one that mattered for health care , and health care was safe . '' But American politics broke on November 8 , and we are used to a history of politicians bending the truth , but now we get politicians breaking the truth . That 's a new thing . We had n't had politicians explicitly lying in the way they do now . That 's really new .
After arguing that ObamaCare will still be difficult to repeal , he added :
< < < Please support MRC 's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today . > > >
You 've got to deal with the bill that the Senate parliamentarian has said ca n't pass with 50 votes , and you 've got to deal with the fact that the subsequent vote is not just a theoretical vote , but actually a vote that 's going to cost millions of Americans their insurance . So I think we 're still better than even odds the Affordable Care Act survives , but it 's just sort of sad that we 're in a world where politicians ca n't even answer the question : Why are you voting for this bill ? They literally ca n't answer the question : What good does this do other than , `` Gee , we have to give up Obamacare . '' That 's just a very disappointing world to be in .
Host Jansing made no mention of the irony that Gruber was complaining about someone else being dishonest as she moved on .
Below is a transcript of relevant portions of the Tuesday , July 25 , MSNBC Live :
NEW YORK - The New York Police Department said eight people were killed and 11 were injured Tuesday in an attack in lower Manhattan .
Police said a truck drove through a crowd on a bike path near the World Trade Center memorial in lower Manhattan .
NBC News reports at least eight people have been killed and 11 more are injured .
The police department posted on its Twitter feed that one person was in custody . New York police said the suspect is a 29-year-old man .
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack `` an act of terror . ''
Officials said the `` cowardly '' attack targeted `` innocent civilians '' on the bike path .
Officials confirmed a man driving a rented pickup truck drove down a popular bike path and struck several pedestrians and cyclists .
After the colliding with several vehicles , the driver exited the pickup truck screaming and armed with what appeared to be a firearm . He was shot by police and taken into custody .
Police said the man was armed with two fake guns , perhaps BB guns or paint guns .
A large number of police vehicles responded to the scene near West Street and Chambers Street , which is near a community college , a high school and a few blocks north of the National Sept. 11 Memorial .
NYPD update
NYPD and other New York officials provided a live update on the attack around 5:20 p.m. Tuesday . You can watch the update here :
Here is the original breaking news report from NBC News :

The media is nothing if it ca n't hold a presidential candidate accountable—if newsrooms and editorialists ca n't force a White House aspirant to keep a promise , uphold precedent , and address suspicions that he 's a tool of Moscow .
Journalism is a joke if we let Donald Trump slide .
And so I have an idea for CNN , MSNBC , FOX News and the three broadcast networks :
Stop interviewing Trump , and stop paying his surrogates , until he releases his tax records .
I do n't make this proposal lightly . I understand as well as anybody that interviewing presidential candidates is an important way to inform the public , especially when the questioning is objective , tough , and revealing of the candidate 's character and policies .
While there are far too many patty-cake interviews aired on networks run by executives who see Trump both as a candidate and a cash cow , the process has revealed his racism , authoritarianism , extremism , and anti-intellectualism .
Considering the stakes , I 'm happy to temporarily cede that part of media 's role to newspapers , magazines , and news websites while the TV executives in Washington and New York use their leverage for a common good .
Trump must be made to release his tax records because he repeatedly promised to do so ; because every major presidential candidate in the modern era has done so ; because Richard Nixon released his tax returns while being audited , which is Trump 's latest excuse for reneging ; because voters have a right to know how much he pays in taxes and to charities ; because there are credible and concerning links between Trump and the Russian government , which is suspected of hacking the Democratic National Committee computers and leaking embarrassing bits .
I went though several orientations of the Pi and hub . This required that I have an easy way to change configurations and move the devices until I got the perfect orientation . I used plastic DVD covers . The width and length of the DVD cover worked well with the mini lunch box . I may redo this with acrylic now that I have the desired pattern .
Prep the DVD covers
Trim clear plastic cover ( what holds the paper )
Split DVD case along seams
Cut the DVD cover to length . Ideal is to snugly press against the low voltage device ring .
Mount components
Screw standoffs on the Pi and Hub
Orient Pi and Hub on their respective DVD plastic
Mark stud location
Exacto a X on the stud location
Press stud in the X
* This will securely hold the component yet allow you to easily more the mount point if needed . Figuring out exactly where the Pi and Hub go and how they are oriented can be determined by the amount of space the cables take and your desired cable path .
Assemble the stack
Measure the depth of the lunchbox . Mine would fit 3 '' bolts .
Measure the spacers needed between each stack
Cut ball point pen tupe to length
Mark and drill holes for bolts
Thread bolts through holes and screw nut on top

In a bid to help Americans lose weight , the Food and Drug Administration has approved marketing of the drug lorcaserin , the first prescription medication to have won the FDA 's blessing since it approved orlistat in 1999 .
Once it is cleared by the Drug Enforcement Administration , the new weight-loss drug will be marketed in the United States under the commercial name Belviq .
The approval comes after a lengthy review by an agency under pressure to help Americans lose weight but also to screen out drugs that could prove dangerous once embraced by a vast patient population .
Just over one in three adult Americans is considered obese , and an additional 36 % are overweight , prompting widespread concern that Type 2 diabetes , heart disease and certain cancers linked to obesity will overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system . Already , obesity-related disease is estimated to account for $ 147 billion in annual healthcare costs .

Denmark , part of the Schengen border-free zone , has deployed extra customs officers on its frontiers in a move causing concern among EU neighbours .
Thirty additional officers were being posted on the Danish land border with Germany and 20 others on the country 's sea borders .
TV crews crowded on to border crossings to record the first checks , with some media offering live coverage .
Denmark 's government is under pressure to curb illegal immigration .
The centre-right coalition moved to introduce the additional customs agents after calls from its populist ally , the right-wing Danish People 's Party ( DPP ) , and the legislation cleared parliament on Friday .
Denmark has ostracised itself from Europe Juerg-Uwe Hahn , Justice minister of Germany 's Hessen region
Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen said earlier : `` We have seen too many examples of violence , break-ins and brutal criminality committed by perpetrators who have crossed the borders . ''
But many have questioned the legality of the Danish move under the 1995 Schengen Agreement , which abolished internal borders , enabling passport-free movement inside much of western Europe .
Juerg-Uwe Hahn , justice minister of Germany 's Hessen region , told Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten that Denmark had `` ostracised itself '' .
He was speaking before a meeting of Germany 's powerful regional ministers in Berlin this week , which is expected to condemn the Danish initiative .

As the first motorist to be checked , she was asked to pull over 20m inside the border , and found herself being questioned by several customs officers as some 50 media people crowded around her car , the paper says .
Also on Tuesday morning , Danish customs officers could be seen working at the Oeresund sea bridge between Denmark and Sweden .
The Danish reinforcements come on top of a force of about 160 , which will grow to 260 by the end of this year , according to Reuters news agency .
Responding to German concerns earlier , Danish officials stressed they did not mean to reintroduce passport controls or hold up travel .
`` This is a matter of reinforced customs control where we will go after illegal import of , among other things , narcotics , weapons and large amounts of money , precisely as we do today , '' tax and customs administration director Erling Andersen said in a statement on Friday .
`` There will not be any systematic control of all vehicles and trains that pass the border , and the controls will be carried out with the least possible disturbance to traffic . ''
Defending the plans back in May , the Danish finance minister said : `` Over the past few years we have seen an increase in trans-border crime , and this is designed to curb the problem . ''
Denmark 's ruling coalition of liberals and conservatives relies on the right-wing DPP 's support to pass legislation in parliament .
The country must hold its next general election by this November .
Taking powerful new scientific evidence about the unreliability of eyewitness identification into account , last year the New Jersey Supreme Court established strict rules to determine when eyewitness identifications are unreliable enough to be inadmissible . In a case decided earlier this week , Perry v. New Hampshire , the Supreme Court had an opportunity to follow suit with a reconsideration of its own . Regrettably but not surprisingly , the Court instead decided to ignore the new evidence . This unfortunate decision is certain to lead to many more innocent people being convicted even though a standard that is workable and more consistent with constitutional values is available .
Perry required the Court to choose between two different systems for determining when eyewitness testimony should be presented to a jury . At a minimum , the Court 's precedents seemed to require that judges exclude eyewitness identifications that were the result of police “ rigging ” — that is , when police deliberately manipulated a witness lineup or photo array . Some circuit courts , however , went further , arguing that judges should evaluate and possibly exclude eyewitness identification if the surrounding circumstances were “ suggestive ” enough to implicate a particular suspect even if this suggestiveness was not the result of intentional police misconduct . In Perry , the Supreme Court ultimately chose the former , less protective standard . A judge can not exclude highly unreliable eyewitness identifications , according to the Court , as long as the suggestiveness was a result of flawed procedures applied in good faith rather than deliberate malfeasance on the part of the police .
The intent of the police might be relevant to whether officers should be held liable in the case of a wrongful conviction . But if a lineup is so suggestive as to be unreliable , the intent of the police is beside the point . The majority 's decision to limit the judicial exclusion of eyewitness testimony to cases where there has been police misconduct has the virtue of establishing a clear rule . But this rule is not logically related to its asserted purpose of screening out excessively unreliable evidence . To an innocent person sitting in jail because of erroneous eyewitness identification , whether he was actually framed is not the crucial issue . Unreliable evidence does n't magically become more reliable because the police officers who produced the identification acted in good faith .
As was predicted by those who witnessed the oral arguments , the Court 's decision was lopsided , with Justice Sonia Sotomayor the lone dissenter . The majority opinion , which Chief Justice John Roberts shrewdly assigned to liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , is superficially persuasive . Eyewitness evidence is hardly alone in being potentially unreliable . “ We have concluded in other contexts , however , ” argues Ginsburg , “ that the potential unreliability of a type of evidence does not alone render its introduction at the defendant 's trial fundamentally unfair. ” If juries are permitted to evaluate the probative value of even more inherently unreliable evidence , such as the testimony of jailhouse snitches , why should they not be allowed to weigh the reliability of eyewitness identifications produced in suggestive circumstances in the absence of active state misconduct ?
As Justice Sotomayor argues in her powerful dissent , however , this line of reasoning is problematic . What 's relevant here is not how unreliable evidence is per se but the likelihood that juries will overrate its reliability . The testimony of jailhouse snitches is often unreliable , but the unreliability of self-serving testimony is self-evident and relatively easy to communicate to a jury . Eyewitness testimony , conversely , is widely assumed to be reliable . The Court 's precedents , Sotomayor argues , are “ rooted in the assumption that eyewitness identifications upend the ordinary expectation that it is 'the province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing witnesses . ' … Jurors find eyewitness evidence unusually powerful and their ability to assess credibility is hindered by a witness ' false confidence in the accuracy of his or her identification . ”
Sotomayor cites recent social scientific research—most prominently , Brandon Garrett 's Convicting the Innocent— showing that juries place excessive faith in eyewitness identifications . It becomes difficult to argue that eyewitness identification should be treated like other forms of evidence given that it is far more likely to lead to false convictions :
The empirical evidence demonstrates that eyewitness misidentification is “ ‘ the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions in this country . ' ” Researchers have found that a staggering 76 % of the first 250 convictions overturned due to DNA evidence since 1989 involved eyewitness misidentification . Study after study demonstrates that eyewitness recollections are highly susceptible to distortion by postevent information or social cues ; that jurors routinely overestimate the accuracy of eyewitness identifications ; that jurors place the greatest weight on eyewitness confidence in assessing identifications even though confidence is a poor gauge of accuracy ; and that suggestiveness can stem from sources beyond police-orchestrated procedures . The majority today nevertheless adopts an artificially narrow conception of the dangers of suggestive identifications at a time when our concerns should have deepened .
The majority in Perry suggests that empowering judges to evaluate and potentially exclude eyewitness identifications in situations where suggestiveness was not a result of police misconduct would be unworkable , greatly expanding the discretion of judges and flooding the courts with appeals . But there is no reason to believe that this is the case . After all , as Sotomayor notes , four federal circuit courts already use the standard advocated in the dissent , but there “ has been no flood of claims ” in these courts .
Because of the exoneration of large numbers of people based on DNA evidence , we know that eyewitness testimony is particularly likely to lead to the innocent being convicted . But with the honorable exception of Justice Sotomayor , the Court has decided to look the other way .
In today 's New York Times , Eric Cantor responds to Paul Krugman by saying in part :
We are pleased to welcome a guest-post by the recipient of the grant to which Cantor refers . He is Walter J . Stone , Professor of Political Science and director of the UC Davis Congressional Elections Study . The 2010 phase of the study , funded by NSF , is entitled “ Political Context and Citizen Response in the 2010 Elections ” ( SES-0852387 ) . For more , see here . He writes :
NSF
I do not dispute Mr. Cantor 's obligation as a member of Congress to decide how federal dollars are spent , nor do I think it illegitimate to argue that scarce federal research funding would be better spent on the medical and biological sciences , rather than the social sciences . I do believe , as other Monkey Cage authors have suggested , that devoting NSF funding to the social sciences is worthwhile , given the importance of advancing our understanding of questions these disciplines address . As for political science , which Mr. Cantor has mentioned more than once in recent statements criticizing social science funding by NSF , I would remind him that the program receives less than 5 percent of the entire social and behavioral science budget , hardly enough to fund an additional handful of studies in medicine or biology .
As for my project , we are using new methods to measure the policy positions and quality of candidates running in House elections to study how voters responded to the choices on offer in the 2010 elections . Mr. Cantor might be interested to learn that our findings challenge a fair amount of the conventional wisdom about congressional elections by showing that they work pretty well . Scholars and other critics , we show , have been too quick to conclude that voters are misled by the power of incumbency , money , and even party . We find that voters tend to choose candidates on the basis of policy agreement and the competence and personal integrity of the candidates running in their districts , much as traditional defenders of democracy would hope .
As a result , winning candidates for the House ( including most incumbents ) are closer to district preferences and more qualified than losing candidates . Moreover , the Republican candidates in 2010 ( many of whom affiliated with the Tea Party ) who wrested their districts away from the Democrats , restoring Mr. Cantor and the Republicans to the majority in the House , were actually closer to their district preferences than the Democrats they defeated . This was true despite the fact that many of the Republican winners were strongly conservative in their views , while the Democrats they defeated were relatively moderate . The reason was due to the conservative views of the districts that swung to the Republican Party in 2010 .
Are these and other results we are reporting worth the $ 267,000 support NSF granted the project ? I have no idea . Could the money have created more value for the nation if it had been devoted to medical or biological research ? Possibly . I am confident , however , that some small investment in understanding citizen behavior in the world 's oldest democracy is worthwhile . If we find that voters act reasonably in selecting candidates for seats in the “ people 's House ” —that they are not dominated by money and other distorting influences—perhaps we will learn to trust that deliberations in Congress , including over how best to spend federal research dollars , will ultimately reflect the public interest .
But to make things worse , the potential mates out there among the superheroes will probably convince you you 're better off alone . Such as ...
It 's a tough life for female comic book characters . If you are n't being killed off/raped/depowered/kidnapped to motivate your gormless love interest , you 're being fitted for your back brace in order to balance your hilariously over=sized super- boobs .
6 Spider-Man AKA Peter Parker
Married To :
Mary Jane Watson
Good Qualities :
Spider-Man has a certain Hugh Grant-esque bumbling sweetness about him , and legs that go on for miles .
Warning Signs :
Spider-Man 's a wisecracker . Everyone knows that , it 's one of his defining character traits . However , audiences only have to tolerate Spider-Man 's lip for 28 pages every couple of weeks , or a couple hours every few years . Imagine trying to live with the guy . Imagine trying to have sex with the guy :

`` So I guess that 's where I left that web-shooter ! ''
On top of that , he 's a terrible provider . Costumed vigilantism gets you tons of headlines and the adoration of millions but the pay amounts to all the spare change he can salvage from window ledges and pigeons ' nests . The good news ? That 's still more than your average freelance photographer pulls in .
The Clincher :
Spider-Man sold his marriage to Satan . Just read that sentence over a couple more times , let it marinate . Done ? OK , allow us to explain :
Spider-Man , in one of his trademark haphazard attempts at doing the right thing , unmasked himself on national television . This led to the Kingpin putting a hit on the wall-crawler , and Aunt May eating the sniper round intended for her dimwitted nephew . With his former caregiver in a deteriorating coma , Spider-Man 's angst began approaching critical levels , attracting the attention of the demon Mephisto .
Mephisto , feeling generous , proposed a deal to Spidey : Aunt May would be returned to full health , bullet-free , but in return ...

... he would have to give up his marriage to Mary Jane . For some reason .
Spidey hemmed and hawed for a while , but eventually came to the logical decision : Abandon countless future years of happiness with the woman he loves in exchange for giving his octogenarian aunt a chance to die of heart failure or something .
The marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson could be likened to a Toyota Prius with faulty brakes : Comfortable and reliable under most circumstances , but destined to eventually flatten itself against a brick wall . And ultimately , not worth it .
Extra fire safety precautions are being taken at a Halifax seniors high-rise after Housing Nova Scotia found the building has the same type of exterior cladding used in London 's Grenfell Tower .
However , the province 's housing corporation said Gordon B. Isnor Manor was inspected earlier this month by the fire marshal and is considered safe for tenants .
Grenfell Tower in West London caught fire June 14 , killing 80 people , including young children . Cladding on the outside of the building was blamed , in part , for allowing the fire to spread quickly .
The fire drew worldwide attention and caused housing officials in Nova Scotia to inventory buildings that had recent recladding projects .
'Very many different circumstances '
During a 2010 renovation , Gordon B. Isnor Manor on Cornwallis Street was outfitted with the same type of aluminum composite cladding as that on Grenfell Tower .
However , officials said there is no cause for alarm .
`` It 's not the product itself that would cause you concern , but how it 's used in conjunction with other products , '' said Ed Lake , executive director of housing authorities with Housing Nova Scotia .
Lake said a combustible material was used behind the cladding on Grenfell Tower . On the Gordon B. Isnor , the cladding was installed over the building 's concrete exterior walls using a non-combustible form of insulation .
`` They were very many different circumstances , '' said Lake .
Sprinklered building
Grenfell Tower was 24 storeys tall , while Gordon B. Isnor is 16 storeys tall . However , Lake said the Halifax building has additional safety features , such as a full sprinkler system , fire alarms throughout and two fire exits on each floor with a fire-rated stairway intended to prevent flames from spreading .
As well , the building 's floors , walls and ceilings are made with fire-resistant materials .
Residents received a letter from Housing Nova Scotia on July 10 explaining the building had been inspected days earlier and the fire marshal found it was safe to occupy .
24/7 monitoring
However , the fire marshal 's office told Housing Nova Scotia to get a consultant to evaluate the wall construction as an added precaution . That consultant is expected to give an independent report to the fire marshal about the building .
Until that report is finished , the housing corporation has hired a person to monitor the building at all hours to make sure fire doors are closed and fire safety systems are working .
Resident Neil MacDonald said he 's not confident the fire prevention measures are enough .
He said tenants tend to help each other out , but there are many people in the building with mobility issues and he questioned whether everyone could get out in case of a fire .
`` I know I could , because I 'm only a few floors up , but I do n't know . That 's a long way up there . And stairwells , if the elevators go , '' he said .
Second building in Sydney
Housing Nova Scotia also found aluminum composite panels on the Esplanade in Sydney .
However , those panels came from an entirely different manufacturer and were a fire-rated product intended for use in high-rises . The Esplanade also has sprinklers , a fire alarm and two exits from every floor .
Even as debate continues over the Charlie Hebdo cartoons , a former female editor of a Urdu daily Avadhnama , finds herself in the middle of legal trouble and facing threats to her life after she made a decision to publish some of them in the wake of the attack on the Paris newspaper .
According to an IANS report , Shirin Dalvi , the editor of Avadhnama , was arrested by Mumbra Police on Wednesday and produced before a magistrate who granted her bail . `` She was arrested on charges pertaining to hurting religious sentiments and related issues by reprinting a controversial cartoon of Prophet Mohammed , '' an police official said .
In its 17 January issue , the Mumbai edition of the Avadhnama had published the same cartoon which had resulted in the attack on the offices of 'Charlie Hebdo ' . A local citizen , identified as Nusrat Ali complained to the Mumbra Police against the Urdu tabloid , contending that it hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and could create hatred among communities .
Soon after the complaint in Thane and similar complaints in Mumbai by various individuals , the Mumbra police investigated the matter and arrested Dalvi . According to an Indian Express report , she now has six FIRs against her and lives in so much terror that she has been forced to wear a burqa at all times . She never wore the veil before this .
Dalai told the paper , `` Facing the community again has become a great concern for me as there is still a lot of unrest . I have avoided showing my face in Muslim-populated pockets . I have not gone back to my house ( in Mumbra ) since the protest started . '' She also says that she has been unable to meet her children , since the controversy broke out . Her kids are now staying with relatives .
Dalvi has also received threats on her mobile . “ My children have my old phone and they told me that someone has been sending messages through WhatsApp , saying “ Maafi nahin milegi ( You wo n't get forgiveness ) , ” she said .
Avadhnama is published from Lucknow , Faizabad , Aligarh , Azamgarh and Saharanpur , and the Mumbai edition was launched around a year ago . Now the owners have issued a statement saying the parent organisation has nothing to do with the Mumbai edition .
According to the IE report , in a statement on behalf of Taqdees Fatima , owner of the Avadhnama title , Waqar Rizvi said Fatima had no links with the Mumbai edition which was run by a separate entity . Interestingly a day after the Mumbai edition published the photos , all its staff including Dalvi were sacked .
Following the outrage , Dalvi admitted to the `` mistake '' and tendered an unconditional apology through the columns of her newspaper , but it was not accepted by the community at large .
Dalvi however says she 's being singled out because she 's a woman editor . She told Indian Express , “ When organisations such as Raza Academy and Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind were satisfied with my apology , I do not understand why these letterhead organisations are hounding me . Their only agenda is to harass a woman editor . ”
She also pointed out that hers was not the only organisation in India to publish the pictures but they were the only ones targeted with FIRs . While some of her colleagues told IE that Dalvi published the photos to get `` publicity , '' she has denied the charge .
The Charlie Hebdo cartoons , which mocked Muhammed have generated controversy ever since the attack on the magazine office that left most of the staff dead . While most in the Muslim world see the cartoons are offensive ( given that it is forbidden to represent Muhammad and the Charlie Hebdo relied on crude depictions of the Prophet ) , others say that the right to free speech includes the right to offend as well .
In India , however as we 've seen even with the recent FIR against AIB , the right to feel offended takes precedence over freedom of speech . However in Dalvi 's case , she is right to point out that she is being singled out given that hers was not the only publication in India that printed the cartoons .

This is an 'embryoid ' at the start of the appearance of SOX17 positive cells ( green ) , which depict birth of the human germ cell lineage / Walfred Tang , University of Cambridge
Using human stem cells , researchers have created precursors to egg and sperm -- called primordial germ cells -- in a petri dish . Until this work , published in Cell today , the feat has only been achieved using rodent stem cells .
One of the first events in the early development of both mice and men is the creation of primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) . After an egg is fertilized by sperm , embryonic stem cells begin to differentiate into various basic cell types that make up the fetus . A small number of these stem cells develop into primordial germ cells , which will go on to become egg or sperm . `` Germ cells are 'immortal ' in the sense that they provide an enduring link between all generations , carrying genetic information from one generation to the next , '' Cambridge 's Azim Surani says in a university statement .
Within the last decade , researchers have been `` reprogramming '' adult cells ( such as skin cells ) to act like embryonic stem cells with the potential to differentiate into practically any type of cell in the body . These induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells have been used to develop human retinas and intestines , for example . Researchers have also created iPS cells that could differentiate into primordial germ cells , but it 's only been successful in rodents .
Now , a team of researchers from the U.K. and Israel traced the genetic chain of events that directs a human stem cell to develop into a primordial germ cell . This stage in our development is called `` specification , '' and once PGCs become `` specified , '' they continue developing toward precursor sperm cells or ova “ pretty much on autopilot , ” Jacob Hanna from the Weizmann Institute of Science says in a news relesae .
They found that a master gene called SOX17 helps direct the stem cells in this process . Previous work found that SOX17 was involved in directing stem cells to become endodermal cells -- which develop into lung , gut , and pancreas cells -- but this is the first time it 's been seen in primordial germ cell specification . ( Surprisingly , the mouse equivalent of this gene is not involved in this process for them . )
The international team followed their discovery by actually making primordial germ cells in the lab . Using both embryonic stem cells and iPS cells ( reprogrammed adult skin cells ) from both males and females , the researchers made sex cell precursors with up to 40 percent efficiency . When they compared the protein markers of their new , lab-grown PGCs with real PGCs collected from aborted fetuses , Nature reports , they were found to be very similar .
Pictured below are clusters of human embryonic stem cells that were differentiated to an early germ cell state ( shown as colored cells ) . Each color reveals the expression of a different gene for PGCs , so researchers could gauge how many of the cells had been programed . All three are combined in a single image on the right .

To some they 're the holy grail of computing ; computer chips that work like the brain — opening up a wealth of possibilities from artificial intelligence to the ability to simulate whole artificial personalities .
To others they are another in a long list of interesting but unpractical ideas not too dissimilar to the ubiquitous flying car .
They 're called neuromorphic chips and the truth about them lies somewhere in the middle .
The main force driving interest in neural network technology is an inconvenient truth : the architecture that drove the information age , created by famed physicist & mathematician John von Neumann ( known as von Neumann architecture ) , is running into the fundamental limits of physics .
You may have seen these effects already : Notice how your new shiny smartphone is n't light years ahead of your last upgrade ? That 's because chips that use von Neumann architecture face a performance bottleneck and designers must now balance the functionality of the chips they design against how much power they 'll consume . Otherwise you 'll have an insanely powerful phone , with a battery that lasts all of 12 minutes .
In contrast ; nature 's own computing device , the brain , is extremely powerful and the one you 're using to read this uses only 20 Watts of power . Access to this sort of powerful efficiency would enable a new era of embedded intelligence . So what 's the hold up ?
Neural networks are not a new idea . Research into the technology traces its roots back to the 1940 's alongside regular computer chip technology .
Today , software emulations of neural networks are powering many of the image recognition capabilities of internet giants , like Google and Facebook , who are investing heavily in startups . However , as they need to run on expensive supercomputers their potential is always limited . They run software neural networks on a system architecture that is serial by nature as opposed to being parallel — one of the keys that makes neural networks so appealing in the first place .
So , how long will it be before we get these neural network chips ?
Actually a class of neuromorphic chip has been available since 1993 . That year , a small independent team approached IBM with an idea to develop a silicon neural network chip called the ZISC ( Zero Instruction Set Computer ) , which became the world 's first commercially available neuromorphic chip .
The independent team had prior experience building software neural networks for pattern recognition at CERN 's Super Proton Synchrotron , a particle smasher and the older sibling of the more famous Large Hadron Collider of Higgs-Boson fame .
Frustrated by the inherent limitations of running neural networks on von Neumann systems they had come to the conclusion that creating neuromorphic hardware was the best way to leverage the unique capabilities of neural networks and , with IBM 's expertise , the ZISC36 with 36 artificial neurons was born . IBM alongside General Vision Inc. sold the chip and it 's successor the ZISC78 ( 78 neurons ) for 8 years from 1993 until , in 2001 , IBM exited commercial ZISC chip manufacturing and development .
General Vision decided to carry on , as they believed the technology had many unexplored applications . They leveraged their expertise to continue developing the neuromorphic technology until , after 5 years of project work ; they managed to raise enough capital to build a successor to the ZISC . In 2007 they launched the Cognitive Memory 1000 , aka the CM1K : A neuromorphic chip with 1,024 artificial neurons working in parallel while consuming only 0.5 Watts and able to recognize and respond to patterns in data ( images/code/text/anything ) in just a few microseconds . It would seem that this gamble on neuromorphic chips could pay off because soon after , neuromorphic research stepped up several gears .
In 2008 , just one year after the CM1K was developed , DARPA announced the SyNAPSE program – Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics – and awarded contracts to IBM and HRL Labs to develop neuromorphic chips from the ground up .
Another year later in 2009 a team in Europe reported developing a chip with 200,000 neurons and 50 million synaptic connections resulting from the FACETS ( Fast Analog Computing with Emergent Transient States ) program which in turn has lead to a new European initiative called The Human Brain Project which launched in 2014 .
Numerous Universities also began ( or renewed old ) programs to look into neuromorphic chips and interest has begun to gain momentum .
In 2012 Intel announced they were getting involved in neuromorphic chips with a new architecture , while Qualcomm threw their hat into the ring in 2013 backed by freshly acquired neural network start ups . Most recently , in August 2014 , IBM announced TrueNorth , a neuromorphic chip with 1,000,000 neurons and 256 million programmable synapses – one of the world 's most powerful and complicated chips . It 's complete with it 's own custom programming language , all of which came from DARPA 's SyNAPSE program .
TrueNorth is deeply impressive technology , a concept that could herald some of the more lofty dreams of neural networks , but sadly it is unlikely to be found in your next tablet for cost reasons . It does certainly prove a point though – we 're entering an age where neural network chips can actually work and are no longer purely in the realms of science fiction .
Why has it taken so many years for these neuromorphic technologies to take off ?
In part , the success of Moore 's Law meant engineers did n't need neural network architectures and it may surprise you to hear this , but many of the issues surrounding the slow adoption of neuromorphic chips have never been technical , the issues stem from a lack of belief . The renewed global interest in neuromorphic chips has opened people 's minds to the idea of ‘ brain chips ' – which is why an 8-year-old chip design can still get people excited . A technology that can be taught ( yes that 's right , not programmed , taught ) to recognize just about anything from a face to a line of code and then recognize what it 's been taught anywhere in enormous volumes of data , in just a few microseconds and can be integrated with almost any modern electronics very easily .
Neuromorphic technologies have the potential to transform everything . One day maybe we will be able to download ourselves onto a neuromorphic brain chip and ‘ live forever ' but long before then more practical applications beckon .
From EEG/ECG monitors that automatically recognize the warning signs in an irregular heart beat to a phone that knows the faces of the friends in a picture it 's taken and automatically sends them all a copy . Pet doors that admit only one individual pet , a car that recognizes it 's driver and automatically adjusts to their settings , robots or drones that can follow anything they 're trained to recognize a cookie jap that locks when it recognizes unauthorized hands… the list of applications is literally endless .
We can enable the things we use to ‘ know ' us , creating neuromorphic things and beginning an era of true ‘ smart ' technologies . Let 's be honest : In reality your smartphone is n't ‘ smart ' , it 's just a well-connected tool that you use . For something to be smart : as in , ‘ intelligent ' , it must first have some way of recognizing the data and inputs that surround it and pattern recognition is something neuromorphic chips are very good at . You could even call it cognition .
New exoplanet like 'one of ours '

An artists impression of CoRoT-9b which was spotted by the CoRoT satellite
It is 1,500 light-years from Earth but CoRoT-9b is the first temperate planet found known to be similar to those within our own Solar System . The presence of CoRoT-9b was detected by a space mission designed to find planets we can not see from the ground . `` It is the size of Jupiter and has an orbit similar to Mercury , '' said lead researcher Dr Hans Deeg . In the journal Nature , the scientists say it is the first planet of its type which can yield detailed information . Eccentric orbits More than 400 exoplanets , or planets outside the Solar System , have been discovered so far but Dr Deeg , who works at the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in the Canary Islands , explained that the others have all been `` exotic '' . `` They are either extremely hot , being very close to the central star on short orbits , or they are on eccentric orbits , taking them close to and far from the central star , giving them extreme temperatures . '' CoRoT-9b has a temperate climate . `` This is the first planet where it makes sense to apply the models developed for planets within our solar system , '' said Dr Deeg . We expect this to be a reference object for the next decade
Dr Hans Deeg The surface temperature is estimated to be between about -20 and 160 degrees Celsius . Dr Deeg explained that although some of the exoplanets previously discovered were thought likely to be temperate it was not possible to confirm that or to find out much information about them . The planet was discovered by an international team of 60 astronomers and identified using the `` transit '' method . During its orbit of 95 days it passes in front of its central star , or transits , for about eight hours . `` The transit method enables us to obtain much more information about it , '' explained Dr Deeg . `` We expect this to be a reference object for the next decade . `` We can derive its temperature as we know the distance to the central star and the type of central star it is . '' A blue planet ? CoRoT-9b was spotted by the CoRoT satellite , which is a mission led by the French space agency , Centre National d'Études Spatiales . Its presence was then confirmed by observations from several telescopes from the European Southern Observatory , in Tenerife and at other sites . `` An analysis of the data from the satellite gives us the size and the data from the ground gives us the mass , '' explained Dr Deeg . `` We do n't know the colour . It 's likely that it has high atmosphere water clouds which might make it blue but that depends on the mixture of gases which we really do not know , '' he added . The scientists say the discovery of the planet shows that the development history of our Solar System has been repeated around other stars . Please turn on JavaScript .

Former Rep. Tom Perriello ( D-Va. ) is considering running for Virginia governor , the New York Times reported Wednesday . Sources confirmed that report to The Huffington Post .
Virginia 's gubernatorial race is likely to be the most closely watched of the 2017 cycle . While Democrats have won the governorship the last three out of four elections and currently hold both of the state 's U.S. Senate seats , Republicans are eager to swing the state back to the GOP .
By entering the race , Perriello , a progressive Democrat , would end outgoing Gov . Terry McAuliffe 's hopes for an uncontentious primary ahead of what 's likely to be a close general election battle . Like most high-profile Democrats in the state , McAuliffe has backed Lt. Gov . Ralph Northam , who announced his candidacy more than a year ago . No other Democrats have jumped in the race .
The Republican side , meanwhile , is already crowded , with four candidates currently vying for the nomination . They include former RNC chairman Ed Gillespie and Donald Trump ally Corey Stewart .
Perriello was elected to Congress in 2008 , and quickly became an ally of then-newly elected President Barack Obama . Despite representing a conservative-leaning district , Perriello voted in favor of Obama 's stimulus package , as well as the Affordable Care Act . He also defended those votes at home , despite the occasionally hostile responses from his constituents . The president returned the favor by campaigning alongside him during his 2010 re-election bid ― the only campaign stop Obama made for a House member that cycle .
Despite the presidential boost , Perriello lost that campaign to Republican state Sen. Robert Hurt . However , the race was remarkably close , particularly considering that many of Perriello 's Democratic colleagues lost by landslides in the tea party wave of that year . He later landed a job in the Obama administration serving as the State Department 's special envoy for the Great Lakes region of Africa .
Obama administration is aiding and abetting felonies ' by 'delivering ' flood of illegal immigrant children to relatives in the US : Withering verdict of furious judge
Federal Judge Andrew S. Hanen called out the Obama administration in December for 'aiding and abetting felonies '
The Department of Homeland Security , he wrote in a scathing decision , 'has simply chosen not to enforce the United States ' border security laws '
Republicans are playing a game of 'we-told-you-so , ' seizing on Hanen 's ruling to claim that the Obama administration is encouraging a flood of illegal immigration , especially among children
One congressman says the Obama administration is intentionally participating in ' a felony – alien smuggling and human trafficking '
As many as 80,000 illegal immigrant children , many traveling alone , are expected to be apprehended crossing the US border this year
Shocking photos leaked out of a Texas holding facility show minors packed in overcrowded rooms
Republicans today quoted a little-noticed December 2013 federal court ruling as evidence of a 'catch and release ' immigration policy that the Obama administration uses to encourage a flood of illegal migrants to the U.S. from the south .
One congressman told MailOnline on Tuesday that Federal Judge Andrew S. Hanen called out the Obama administration for aiding and abetting felonies . And a former lawmaker wrote that the decision shows how the White House is rolling out the welcome mat for human traffickers .
As many as 80,000 children , many traveling with human traffickers but without their parents , are expected to cross the southern U.S. border illegally in 2014 .
He wrote in the case of a 10-year-old Salvadoran girl smuggled in the the United States that the Department of Homeland security is essentially 'delivering the minors to the custody of the parent illegally living in the United States ' – even when Border Patrol agents arrest the 'coyotes ' who sneak them in .
'These actions are both dangerous and unconscionable , ' Hanen wrote .
'The DHS has simply chosen not to enforce the United States ' border security laws . '
Traveling alone : 14-year-old Brian Duran from Comayagua , Honduras , came to the U.S.-Mexico border by himself , reacting to false claims that young immigrant children can be reunited with family members in the U.S . Buses carrying children have been pouring into a border patrol facility in Nogales , Arizona , with authorities rushing to staff and supply makeshift holding facilities for all the minors who turn up in border sweeps
Last week photos leaked from a temporary detention facility in Texas showed hundreds of children crammed into holding rooms , without their parents , as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents processed them .
After they 're fingerprinted and given case numbers , most are turned over to other government agencies or released outright to parents who have no legal basis for being in the U.S .
And 'since most border violators are not caught , the actual numbers arriving presumably are far larger , ' former Oklahoma Republican congressman Ernest Istook wrote Tuesday in a Washington Times essay .
Critics say the Obama administration is turning an already porous border into a sieve on purpose .
'This is a crisis of the federal government 's creation , ' Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer said in a statement , 'and the fact that the border remains unsecure – now apparently intentionally - while this operation continues full-steam ahead is deplorable . '
'Judge Hanen 's order is a must-read for everyone trying to understand the roots of today 's `` humanitarian crisis '' of children being smuggled into the U.S. , ' he added .
'When more people learn the truth , they will hold President Obama accountable [ for ] ... creating human tragedy and suffering . '
Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar , a Republican whose state is housing hundreds of illegal immigrant children in a makeshift holding facility in the town of Nogales , told MailOnline that Hanen 'issued an astute , neutral and accurate decision on the gross incompetence and potential illegal activities engaged in by the federal government . '
'When I first learned that the federal government was opening the Texas border and allowing thousands of illegal aliens into the country , and then transporting them across state lines only to abandon them destitute , homeless and dependent , I believed then this constituted a felony – alien smuggling and human trafficking , ' Gosar explained in an email .
'Judge Hanen agrees ... finding that the DHS has in fact been a criminal participant in human trafficking . '
Rep. Phil Gingrey , a Georgia Republican , told MailOnline that 'the Obama administration has acknowledged the surging number of children crossing the border illegally , ' but 'by failing to enforce current immigration laws , its policies have only exacerbated the crisis . '
'President Obama 's non-enforcement doctrine has perpetuated illegal border crossing – without fear of reprisal – and encourages risking children 's lives to illegally cross the border , ' said Gingrey .
Overflowing : The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids , forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing Many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger
Hanen 's scathing ruling documented a guilty plea from human trafficker Mirtha Veronica Nava-Martinez , who was paid to bring the 10-year-old girl to Virginia but never got past a checkpoint in Brownsville , Texas . She was already a felon convicted of food stamp fraud in 2011 .
The girl 's mother , Patricia Elizabeth Salmeron Santos , lives illegally in Virginia . She paid Nava-Martinez to fetch her daughter and smuggler her across the border .
'Salmeron Santos admitted that she started this conspiracy by hiring alien smugglers to transfer her child from El Salvador to Virginia , ' Hanen wrote . 'She agreed to pay $ 8500 ( and actually paid $ 6,000 in advance ) for these human traffickers to smuggle her daughter ) .
'The criminal conspiracy instigated by Salmeron Santos was temporarily interrupted when Nava-Martinez was arrested , ' but ' [ d ] espite this setback , the goal of the conspiracy was successfully completed thanks to the United States Government . '
Salmeron Santo , he notes , was never the subject of any criminal proceedings .
DHS 'did not arrest her . It did not prosecute her . It did not even initiate deportation proceedings for her , ' Hanen wrote .
It is 'completing the criminal mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the United States . '
Those criminal missions include drug-smuggling plots : Mexican and South American narcotics cartels control much of the human trafficking , using both the coyotes and their immigrant cargo as drug mules during crossings .
'The irony , says Istook , 'is that the White House claims the children are fleeing the dangers of organized crime in Central America – the very organized crime being trusted and paid to transport them to the U.S .
President Obama , he claims , 'denounces the situation as a `` humanitarian crisis '' as though he were not a perpetrator in creating it . '
Status unknown : Maria Eva Casco , left , and her son Christian Casco of El Salvador , were arrested in Texas but later released and transported to a bus station in Arizona 'When more people learn the truth , they will hold President Obama accountable , ' insists Rep. Paul Gosar , whose home state of Arizona has become overrun by children crossing the U.S.-Mexican border
Obama himself likely sparked the mass migration from Central America and Mexico , according to former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano .
Napolitano said Monday night on the Fox News Channel that 'the president of the United States personally and directly caused this with a telephone and a pen , ' referring to Obama 's favorite aphorism for 'executive actions ' that he has taken without the say-so of Congress .
The president flexed his pen in 2012 with a high-profile order that relaxed deportations for potentially millions of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children before June 2007 .
But news reports indicate that human traffickers are purposely misinterpreting Obama 's action , telling families in Central America that the rule applies to them .
Nora Griselda Bercian Diaz , a mother who crossed the border illegally with her six-year-old daughter , told KRGV-TV in south Texas that the message being disseminated in Guatemala is , 'go to America with your child , you wo n't be turned away . '
Spark : President Obama announced in June 2012 that he was relaxing deportation for people who came to the U.S. illegally as children before 2007 -- but human traffickers are telling Third World children that the new rule will apply to them
'Word has gotten out , ' National Border Patrol Council local vice president Chris Cabrera told The New York Times , ' that we 're giving people permission and walking them out the door ' after they 're processed .
'So they 're coming across in droves . '
The White House has carefully disputed the idea that Obama 's 2012 amnesty proposal , which he extended on June 5 , is to blame .
'We have heard sort of rumors and reports , or suggestions , that the increase may be in response to the perception that children would be allowed to stay or that immigration reform would in some way benefit these children , ' White House Domestic Policy Council director Cecilia Muñoz told reporters during a conference call on Monday .
'It seems to be quite clear that what is driving this is what 's happening in their home countries . '
But immigrants sneaking into America seem pre-armed with expectations about how the Obama administration will welcome them .
If you make it , they take you to a shelter and take care of you and let you have permission to stay , ' 13-year-old Robin Tulio told the Times after he was apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol .
'When you appeal your case , if you say you want to study , they support you . '
Jeh Johnson , the newly minted Homeland Security secretary , announced the two-year extension of Obama 's mini-amnesty program on Thursday .

Apr 19 , 2015 ; Seattle , WA , USA ; Texas Rangers pinch hitter Mitch Moreland ( 18 ) gives a high-five to shortstop Elvis Andrus ( 1 ) after Andrus scored a run against the Seattle Mariners during the sixth inning at Safeco Field on April 19 , 2015 .
ARLINGTON - The Rangers have few hitters who have been producing early this season .
For the next two or three weeks , they will have one less .
First baseman Mitch Moreland , hitting .304 , will undergo a minor surgical procedure on Wednesday to remove some bone chips from his left elbow . He will be out about three weeks .
The Rangers will purchase the contract of Kyle Blanks from Triple-A Round Rock to replace Moreland . They will have to make room for Blanks on the 40-man roster . This is the second time in the last two weeks that the elbow issue has flared up for Moreland . He missed most of a week after it first `` locked up '' in Seattle .
After anti-inflammatory medication and treatment , the chips settled in a less sensitive part of the joint and he was able to play for several days . He dove hard for a ground ball to make a strong defensive play Monday and it 's possible that jarred the chips loose again .
`` I did n't know if it was going to come back or not , '' Moreland said . `` When I got up [ Tuesday ] morning it would n't straighten out . It was kind of obvious after that . We did what we could do to get it loose . I did n't want to miss two-three days at a time while we kept trying to get it loose . ''
Team orthopedist Dr. Keith Meister will pluck the chips out in a brief procedure , but Moreland will need about 10 days off to let the sutures heal . After that he will need another week or so of playing time to get ready to return .
Blanks , who was pulled out of the Round Rock lineup on Tuesday , was the Pacific Coast League 's Player of the Week for the just-completed week . Blanks is hitting .327 with three homers in 52 at-bats at Round Rock .

Must Read Today 's Top Talkers :
Bill Gates has launched a multi-billion-dollar initiative to fund new clean energy technologies , with the likes of Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg , Alibaba CEO Jack Ma , and Virgin Group 's Richard Branson among the band of almost 30 high-profile early investors who are committed to taking clean-energy ideas out of the lab and into the marketplace to cut the cost of sustainable energy once and for all .
Announced at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris yesterday , the Breakthrough Energy Coalition brings together governments and universities , billionaire entrepreneurs , investment fund managers , and tech CEOs from around the world that recognise the huge investment needed to replace fossil fuels with modes of cheap , sustainable energy production .
And it 's just in time , with the world expected to be using 50 percent more energy by 2050 than it does today . `` I am optimistic that we can invent the tools we need to generate clean , affordable , reliable energy that will help the poorest improvement their lives and also stop climate change , '' Gates says on his blog . `` I hope even more governments and investors will join us . ''
While the intent of the initiative sounds noble , it has n't attracted billions in investments just because it aims to mitigate the effects of climate change and bring energy to the 1 billion people in the world who are living without electricity - as entirely worthwhile these goals are . Gates says the primary goal of the Coalition is as much to accelerate progress on clean energy as it is to make a profit .
So yep , it 's official : sustainable energy is n't just good for the environment - it 's set to become one of the best investments you can make for your dollar .
The funds will be invested in the most promising innovations from research institutions around the globe that can show signifiant gains on current efficiency levels in solar , wind , hydro , and biofuel technologies . Basically , researchers have done a great job up till this point , but in order to make these technologies seriously competitive with carbon-based energy production , they need some serious cash .
`` The renewable technologies we have today , like wind and solar , have made a lot of progress and could be one path to a zero-carbon energy future . But given the scale of the challenge , we need to be exploring many different paths - and that means we also need to invent new approaches , '' Gates said in a statement .
`` [ P ] rogress towards a sustainable energy system is too slow , and the current system does n't encourage the kind of innovation that will get us there faster , '' Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post . `` We already invest in renewable and clean energy for our Facebook facilities today , but we believe that building a positive future for the next generation also means investing in long-term projects that companies and governments do n't fund . ''
According to CNN , the fund has announced that it will focus its attention on new technology that addresses five key areas : electricity generation and storage , transportation , industrial uses , agriculture , and great efficacy .
Announced at the same time is a second new initiative : Mission Innovation , a commitment by 19 countries , including the US , China , and India to invest more in research on clean energy . By signing this pledge , these countries have committed to double their spending on sustainable energy technologies over the next five years .
Gates has published a paper that he says makes a more detailed case for investing in energy innovation , which you can download here .
We could not be more excited to see something like this come into effect . Serious cash is all that was needed to get sustainable energy over the line as a viable replacement for fossil fuels , and serious cash we now have . Watch this space - we 're going to be seeing some incredible progress and record-breaking solar , wind , and hydro power gains in the coming years , and it 's going to be awesome .

My Dad is sick . There is just no way to sugarcoat it . We found out two weeks ago that he has a cancer of the bone marrow called MDS . In the last month he has spent 19 days at the hospital for blood transfusions , ER visits , various doctor appointments , surgery and finally chemo . “ Chemo indefinitely '' is actually what we have been told . We seem to be past the point of remission or the hope of fully beating the cancer . Without treatment my beloved Father would only have months to live . Our hope and prayer at this time is for the chemo to do it 's job stalling the sickness , while still allowing my Dad to have a quality of life worth fighting for.I can not imagine a world without my father . I DO NOT WANT to imagine a world without my father and just the thought of it makes it hard to breathe . His life is in God 's hands and as much as I wish there was something I could do to take this sickness away , I am left helpless . I must clarify though that we are NOT hopeless - for we serve a God of miracles and I will never stop fighting alongside my family for one . However , there are still so many things I can not do and so many things that are out of my control.In the midst of all the shock and sorrow , I CAN do one thing - try to help ease the remainder of the days my parents are able to spend together . The honest truth is that my dad will spend the rest of his life tied to a hospital and dealing with the side effects of chemo . My mom has done her best to juggle work with all of the appointments and is trying her best to help my dad through the chemo , but it just is n't sustainable . She needs to be able to focus on him and spend as much time with him as possible . And he needs her too - so very badly . The love my dad has for my mom after 43 years of marriage is beyond compare . Right now his biggest concern -even in the midst of his health- is the provision of his bride.That is why I have decided to give this Go Fund Me thing a shot . My goal is that my mom will be able to take a year off from cleaning houses in order that my parents may spend this last season of life TOGETHER . I am taking a step of faith that maybe -just maybe- a community will surround my parents and -one dollar at a time- help carry them through this.PLEASE spread the word and thank you so much for your love and prayers.Blessings , Jamie Stewart
House Speaker Paul Ryan will vote for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump , according to The Janesville Gazette .
Ryan 's hometown paper published an opinion piece from the congressman Thursday afternoon in which he announces he 'll be supporting the Republican frontrunner . Ryan said he and Trump have spoken extensively about his vision for the Republican Party .
“ Through these conversations , I feel confident [ Trump ] would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people 's lives . That 's why I 'll be voting for him this fall , ” Ryan , R-Wis. , wrote .
Ryan had publicly refrained from endorsing Trump after it became clear he would be the presumptive Republican nominee . He wrote Thursday that he could n't announce his support for Trump “ before discussing policies and basic principles . ”
Last week , Trump 's campaign claimed Ryan was set to publicly endorse him , which Ryan 's office denied .
SHARE COPY LINK Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( R-Wisc . ) stopped short of endorsing GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump after a closed door meeting on Tuesday . Addressing reporters , Ryan said he and Trump had a “ very positive ” and are committed to unifying the
Ryan wrote in the opinion piece that he did not agree on everything with Trump , and will speak up when the two differ .
“ But the reality is , on the issues that make up our agenda , we have more common ground than disagreement , ” Ryan wrote . “ A Clinton White House would mean four more years of liberal cronyism and a government more out for itself than the people it serves . Quite simply , she represents all that our agenda aims to fix . ”

Jeremy Corbyn is to announce plans to pump £250 billion into industry in a bid to create a million good quality jobs and unleash `` the untapped potential of every part of the country '' .
The Labour leader will use a speech in York on Friday to highlight plans to create a new National Investment Bank and a network of Regional Development Banks and a National Transformation Fund if the party wins the General Election .
The speech marks a further attempt by Mr Corbyn to focus the election debate on domestic policy rather than the themes of leadership and Brexit favoured by the Tories .
But Conservative Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that Labour would destroy jobs by raising taxes and borrowing if the measures are introduced .
The Labour leader will say that years of Conservative rule have resulted in stagnating productivity , falling public sector net investment and average wages forecast to be lower in real terms in 2021/22 than their 2007/08 level .
He will set out plans for an industrial strategy designed to , galvanise businesses around missions that tackle Britain 's key challenges , from climate change to automation .
The plans will also aim to introduce cross-cutting policies to create a fertile ground for business to achieve these missions and provide greater support to the sectors in which Britain has a comparative advantage .
Mr Corbyn will say : `` When Labour talks about job creation we mean decent jobs , jobs which pay a real living wage , which people can get by on , and which give people a sense of pride and purpose .
`` Labour will invest to drive growth across the whole of Britain , creating wealth which is shared across our country , rather than concentrated in the hands of the few . ''
He will add : `` Under the Conservatives , the richest have got richer , while most people 's incomes have fallen or stagnated . Labour 's plans will make sure everyone shares in our country 's wealth . ''
But Mr Hammond responded , saying : `` Jeremy Corbyn will not create jobs , he will destroy them .
`` His reckless plans for higher taxes and more borrowing will wreck the economy and we will all pay the price .
`` We have made real progress in fixing the mess we inherited from Labour , helping businesses create 2.9 million more jobs so there are a record number of people in work . ''

In the summer of 2015 , researchers at Google realized they could make their artificial intelligence algorithms dream . They set the programs to not just classify images , but enhance what they saw . The machines showed their interpretation of art . The researchers found they could also set the programs to generate images , giving an idea of how the machine thought certain objects looked . This discovery came on the rising tide of the idea that machines could be creative tools . Nearly a year later , Google is announcing Project Magenta , a exploratory group that will experiment with creativity and artificial intelligence . The team will focus on making art in various forms—they 'll first focus on music , and then move to video and other visual media . “ With Magenta , we want to explore the other side—developing algorithms that can learn how to generate art and music , potentially creating compelling and artistic content on their own , ” writes Douglas Eck in the Magenta blog 's first post . The first project released with Magenta is a simple song based on the four first notes of “ Twinkle Twinkle Little Star , ” made by Google researcher Elliot Waite . The song is just a digital piano tinkering with notes that starts out simple , but then becomes increasingly complex and nuanced . There are even a few honestly good musical phrases . ( The drums were added later by a human . )
Artistic Intelligence Researchers have been trying to crack artificial intelligence that makes creative choices since the dawn of the practice . Marvin Minsky , seen as a father of modern A.I . research , wrote in 1960 , “ I am confident that sooner or later we will be able to assemble programs of great problem-solving ability from complex combinations of heuristic devices—multiple optimizers , pattern-recognition tricks , planning algebras , recursive administration procedures , and the like . In no one of these will we find the seat of intelligence. ” There 's more to intelligence than just recognizing patterns , but finding that “ seat ” of intelligence is tricky , and has vexed artificial intelligence researchers and psychologists alike . Martine Rothblatt , founder of Sirius XM , futurist author , and commissioner of her robotic partner Bina48 , says that to be truly creative , machines must be capable of creating more than just random samplings of things they 've seen before . “ The most important element is idiosyncrasy . If you write a program that just randomly mixes elements , that 's not creative , ” Rothblatt told Popular Science at Moogfest . “ A lot of it is in the eye of the beholder . If it feels unique , it will feel creative. ” Thousands of projects attempting to meet this threshold of “ feeling ” creative and novel have been undertaken , particularly in visual art and music generation . They attempt to recapture how Picasso would paint a 21st century scene , or Beethoven 's bombastic sensibilities .

These painting projects , a subset of artificial intelligence research called style transfer , has been extremely successful in replicating and applying the techniques of famous artists . In research by the Bethge Lab in Germany , researchers were able to apply the styles of Picasso , Van Gogh , Wassily Kandinsky , and Edvard Munch to digital images . To do this , they use object recognition algorithms to ignore the objects depicted in the painting , and focus instead on how the objects are depicted . By doing this , they 're able to divorce content from style , and more accurately study each . But some would argue that this is merely an aggregate of pre-made human creativity , not something entirely new . Futurist Jaron Lanier , who leads a research team at Microsoft and first coined the term `` virtual reality , '' says that he does n't think machines could ever be creative . `` The way A.I . works is by recycling data from people , '' Lanier told Popular Science . `` It ultimately still comes from people , and the problem from that is that the people are made anonymous . We 've removed ourselves from the equation . '' Artificial intelligence researcher , creator of the site Creative AI and host of the Ethical Machines podcast Samim Winiger says that creativity is a way of operating , not a spark or inherited talent . “ It 's about creative processes , it 's a way of doing things . You learn to be creative ; you learn to play guitar. ” Winiger said . “ From this perspective it becomes demystified , and you can start to use these tools to optimize your own process. ” Winiger sees these tools as a way to augment human creativity , instead of replace it . In his scenario , a clothing store would be able to generate a dress based on user preferences , and then fabricate it on the spot . “ At that point you can imagine something where an H & M looks very differently , ” Winiger said . And we 're actually getting closer to that reality -- this year , IBM 's Watson helped fashion firm Marchesa design a dress for the Met Gala , suggesting directions for colors and materials . During the production process , Marchesa gave Watson five emotions to draw from : joy , passion , excitement , encouragement and curiosity . Watson analyzed previous dresses from Marchesa , and through its tool that connects colors with emotions , designed a color palate for the garment . Watson services then were able to narrow 40,000 fabrics down to 150 choices , and provide 35 recommendations for designers .

Beardedness , or alternatively clean-shavenness , has long been an important signifier of manliness , inscribing crucial gender and sexual meanings onto the male body . But fashions in shaving are notoriously unstable , even in the nineteenth century , that idyll for the hirsute among us . Beardedness in nineteenth-century Britain , in fact , only reached its zenith in 1892 , while the frequency of clean-shaven faces , lowest in 1886 , continued to increase in popularity for the next 80 years . The necessity and expense of daily visits to the local barber , however , prohibited many from indulging in such luxury and before savvy marketers rooted the fear of the five o'clock shadow into men 's minds , a few days ' growth was often acceptable . Indeed , before the advent of the safety razor , many men might have agreed with the proverb : “ It is easier to bear a child once a year than to shave every day. ” Beardedness , and its intermediate variations , nonetheless had ( and continue to have ) definite implications for manliness and sexuality .
A period of gender and social instability , the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the valourization of particular forms of masculinity , reinforcing in men a sense of strength and virility to counter perceived emasculation . This is exemplified in ads displaying , oddly enough , domination through the act of shaving . Purporting only to refer to pores , an 1899 Illustrated London News ad entitled “ Little Doors ” , for example , evokes sexual penetration . When applying shaving soap to one 's face , the ad instructs men :
you apply it with the brush – and , as it were , force it into those willing little doorways ( emphasis in original ) .
Masculinity here is represented in complex ways . The man in the ad is the active agent while his pores remain passive and docile . While pores are in fact part of the man 's own body , they can only be perceived through the double lens of magnifying glass and mirror . They are almost independent agents against which he must rally . Men are told to “ force it ” into pores , described as “ willing little doorways. ” The ads textual representation of masculinity is aggressive , even if the pictured man lies semi-supine submitting to his barber 's directions .
The barber with magnifying glass and mirror ( described by Anne McClintock as a fetish object of enlightenment and self awareness ) shows his customer the many “ Little Doors ” or pores of his face . There are , worryingly ,
myriads of them – unseen , but always open – [ that ] lead directly through the Skin – to the very life-blood . … Let no impure particle enter – to mingle with the life-giving current ( emphasis in original ) .
These “ Little Doors ” are the sites through which a man can be violated , his “ life-giving current ” poisoned . By their very existence these pores indicate the vulnerability of the male body ; they remain “ always open , ” a portal through which impurity can enter . Hence the “ imperative necessity , ” as the ad warned , “ that you guard these doors . ”
As liminal borders marking uncertainty and potential dangers , the cultural currency of doors at this time is also clear in Robert Louis Stevenson 's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ( 1886 ) in which the first chapter is titled “ The Story of the Door. ” Marked by a “ prolonged and sordid negligence , ” the door is “ blistered and distained. ” It is through this back door that Hyde , embodiment of vice , enters the house . Sexual and anal vulnerability are one available reading . Similarly , in the “ Little Doors ” ad , men are exhorted to master their “ little doorways , ” or pores , and eliminate the threat of vulnerability they represent . They are reminded that these “ doors ” are “ willing ” agents , complicit in the potential corruption of the body . They must avoid impurities as they “ would the deadliest poison. ” It was imperative that men adopt the attributes of normalized masculinity : bodily and sexual self-control and self-discipline .
In an era before manufacturers offered three ( even four ! or five ! ! ) blades on springs protected by fine wires and augmented by microfins and moisturizing strips , shaving posed a genuine threat of bodily injury . As understandings of microbial life and the dangers of infection developed , Nancy Tomes argues that a preoccupation with hygiene , what she calls The Gospel of Germs , took hold of individuals at this time . Men began to shave their beards and women to raise their skirts to avoid the danger of carrying infection . In hospitals too , patients were made aseptic through scrubbing and shaving , while doctors followed by sacrificing beards and moustaches “ on the altar of asepsis. ” The anti-TB movement also made inroads against facial hair . The luxurious beard was now to be sacrificed to “ spare loved ones the curse of hairy , germ-laden kisses. ” One anti-TB slogan asked men to “ Sacrifice Whiskers and Save Children . ”
It is noteworthy that men in this and similar shaving product ads often share a remarkable resemblance to their barbers , one face representing both subject and object in the act of shaving . Fin-de-siècle consumers encountered confusion in the images of masculinity in such ads . But even before the beard became unfashionable , aesthetes like the appropriately named Aubrey Beardsley and also Oscar Wilde deliberately sported a smooth face to express their antipathy for stifling middle-class values and expectations . Their own sexual ambiguity was reflected in their sartorial and personal grooming choices . Already in the late nineteenth century , beardedness and clean-shavennness were never easy-to-read markers of masculinity or sexuality .

Does John McCain really think Meg Whitman would make a good treasury secretary , or was he just trying to win over a few Hillary voters when he was asked a question on this topic during Tuesday 's debate ? I suspect the latter . We all know that eBay is the province of millions of housewives making a few bucks selling yard-sale junk , votes McCain desperately needs . And clearly , by growing eBay into a billion-dollar company during her 10-year tenure as CEO , Whitman made many of those work-from-home jobs possible . But just because she got rich with one of the few early Internet companies to survive the dot-com bubble does n't mean she 's fit to run the Treasury Department .
On the plus side , Whitman has a degree in economics from Princeton and a Harvard MBA , and she spent her early career working for big companies like Hasbro , Stride Rite , and Disney . She also has the ego of a CEO that might serve her well among the G-men at Treasury . ( She donated $ 30 million to Princeton to create a new college named after
herself . ) But she has virtually no experience in the financial sector for which the treasury secretary is directly responsible . Her resume shows scant evidence of fluency with such complex financial products as derivatives or credit swaps , which are in desperate need of thoughtful regulation , and little background in such mundane but critical things as monetary policy .
Her familiarity with the inner workings of Washington are equally thin . While she 's supposedly mulling a run for governor of California , Whitman never registered with either political party until she went to work on Mitt Romney 's ill-fated presidential campaign . She 's also never held a government job , a problem that 's hampered current Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , whose minimal political experience has affected his ability to move legislation through Congress .
More importantly , the treasury secretary has just been empowered to buy up $ 700 billion worth of toxic debt from troubled financial institutions . The job will require overseeing a massive cleanup operation , figuring out just how much those mortgages are really worth and not losing even more of the taxpayers ' money on them . Whitman 's track record on valuing assets is n't encouraging . As CEO of eBay , she way overestimated the potential of Skype , the online phone service eBay purchased in 2005 for vastly more money than it was worth . The purchase is one reason that when Whitman retired in early 2008 , eBay 's stock had lost nearly half its value over the previous two years .
If McCain really wanted to tap a woman for Treasury , he could have mentioned Sheila Bair , the head of the FDIC , who 's already up to her ears managing the wreckage of the financial crisis . Bair has lots of government experience , which includes working on the Hill for Bob Dole and as an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department in Bush 's first term . There , back in 2001 , she sounded an early alarm about the potential dangers to the economy posed by the subprime lending industry and has won praise from consumer advocates for consistently calling for better regulation .
Bair spent some time as a regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and as senior vice president for government relations for the New York Stock Exchange . Since taking over the FDIC in 2006 , she has overseen the sales of Washington Mutual and Wachovia , as well as the takeover of IndyMac , which in July went down as the second-biggest bank failure in US history . One of Bair 's first moves at the FDIC was to purchase a database of information about securitized loans , which quickly led to the discovery that mortgage companies were throwing underwriting to the wind . As a result , Bair was an early proponent of freezing adjustable-rate mortgage “ resets ” to prevent the massive number of home foreclosures that ultimately occurred , showing that she 's had her eye on Main Street as well as Wall Street .
Bair has virtually every credential the next president might want in a treasury secretary . She 's more qualified for the job than a lot of men who 've taken it . Yet McCain only has eyes for Meg , an indication that he still does n't have a serious handle on the economy or even what 's going on in Washington to fix it . More cynically , his pandering to eBay moms with his plug for Whitman falls into the same category as his choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate . Women , in McCain 's world , are peripheral figures at best , and at worst , they 're affirmative-action candidates , chosen mostly for their appeal to voting blocs , not because anyone believes they are the most qualified candidates for the job .

Fear the Walking Dead , AMC 's companion series to its hit show The Walking Dead , boldly refuses to show any Walkers in their promotional material released to date . We got to watch Frank Dillane run away from some unseen menace as Nick in a recent trailer , and all the images released so far have focused on the central family members . It makes sense since AMC is trying to introduce viewers to all new characters before bringing in the blight . Additionally , the network has revealed the first official synopsis for the spin-off which positions its story in a time of ignorance before the chaos hits .
Check out the new trailer for AMC 's Fear the Walking Dead , followed by the series ' official synopsis :
Here 's the official synopsis for AMC 's Fear the Walking Dead :
It was conceived as a project that would foster dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims and act as a bridge between Islam and Christianity . But the completion of a controversial multimillion euro mosque and culture complex is under threat after a prolonged row between its German architect and its Turkish developers .
The Cologne Central Mosque , which was due for completion this summer , has been dogged by controversy since its inception in 2006 . But it is now at the centre of a row over everything from soaring building costs and the colour of its facade to allegations that Christian symbols have been secretly hidden in its construction .
Architect Paul Böhm and Ditib , a branch of the Turkish government 's religious affairs authority , have tentatively agreed to continue with the project but only after the intervention of a retired Cologne mayor . Fritz Schramma said the parties , whom he unambiguously referred to as `` combatants '' , had agreed to complete the project to create a `` transparent , open mosque '' , but only after much intense dialogue . He said he hoped the mosque would `` soon be filled with life '' .
Böhm 's domed mosque , which borrows features from the Ottoman architectural style and has a 55m-high minaret and space for 1,200 worshippers , is destined to become Germany 's biggest mosque and one of Europe 's largest . Its adjoining culture centre will house everything from a library and prayer rooms to a bazaar , a travel agent and a hairdresser .
The architect , whose father was Gottfried Böhm , a famous architect of Catholic churches , won the commission to design the mosque six years ago . But he has since accused Ditib of a smear campaign against him after it produced a list of extra demands and , he says , repeatedly changed the building plans , causing the initial cost to soar by €17m to €34m . He was later banned from the construction site and his contract terminated , demoting him to the role of adviser .
Ditib , which is responsible for 1,000 mosques in Germany , has presented Böhm with a list of 2,000 construction faults , referring to him as `` a brilliant artist but a failed construction manager '' . It is objecting to the sand-coloured facade and accuses Böhm of surreptitiously working Christian symbols into the building , including crucifixes , as well as an X and a P , which together symbolise Christ . Böhm has denied the allegations .
Lale Akgün , a local Social Democrat politician of Turkish origin , has accused Ditib of becoming `` increasingly more conservative and closed , in line with the wider political picture in Turkey '' , saying that the accusations about the Christian symbols had originated in Ankara . Ditib has refused to comment , except to say the project would go ahead with Böhm acting in an advisory capacity only , `` in order to follow the completion of the construction process through to the end '' .
Since its conception , the mosque has caused considerable tension in the city . Among its opponents are those who are against it for aesthetic reasons – including its sprawling size and towering minarets – and others , particularly the anti-immigrant movement Pro Köln and the writer Ralph Giordano , who argue that it is a political symbol that does not belong in the city and would allow Cologne 's Muslims to live in an autonomous world rather than encouraging them to integrate .
But Cologne 's mayor Jürgen Roters argues the city 's reputation would be irreparably damaged if the mosque , whose outer shell is more or less finished , was not completed .
`` It 's important that our fellow Muslim citizens get their own dignified place of prayer and meeting , and that the project is not hampered by further rows or misused for anti-foreigner propaganda , '' he said .
But Böhm , who has complained of unpaid bills and a concerted attempt to push him off the project , said it amounted to a `` very delicate and fragile plant '' whose completion was far from safe . `` The differences of opinion have remained , '' he said .
From gold exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) to gold stocks and buying physical gold , investors now have several different options when it comes to investing in the royal metal . But what exactly is the purpose of gold ? And why should investors even bother investing in the gold market ? Indeed , these two questions have divided gold investors for the last several decades . One school of thought argues that gold is simply a barbaric relic that no longer holds the monetary qualities of the past . In a modern economic environment , where paper currency is the money of choice , gold 's only benefit is the fact that it is a material that is used in jewelry .
On the other end of the spectrum is a school of thought that asserts gold is an asset with various intrinsic qualities that make it unique and necessary for investors to hold in their portfolios . In this article , we will focus on the purpose of gold in the modern era , why it still belongs in investors ' portfolios and the different ways to invest in the gold market .
A Brief History of Gold
In order to fully understand the purpose of gold , one must look back to the start of the gold market . While gold 's history began in 3000 B.C , when the ancient Egyptians started forming jewelry , it was n't until 560 B.C . that gold started to act as a currency . At that time , merchants wanted to create a standardized and easily transferable form of money that would simplify trade . The creation of a gold coin stamped with a seal seemed to be the answer , as gold jewelry was already widely accepted and recognized throughout various corners of the earth .
Following the advent of gold as money , its importance continued to grow throughout Europe and the U.K. , with relics from the Greek and Roman empires prominently displayed in museums around the world , and Great Britain developing its own metals-based currency in 1066 . The British pound ( symbolizing a pound of sterling silver ) , shillings and pence were all based on the amount of gold ( or silver ) that it represented . Eventually , gold symbolized wealth throughout Europe , Asia , Africa and the Americas .
1:47 Investing In Gold
The U.S. government continued on with this gold tradition by establishing a bimetallic standard in 1792 . The bimetallic standard simply stated that every monetary unit in the U.S. had to be backed by either gold or silver . For example , one U.S. dollar was the equivalent of 24.75 grains of gold . In other words , the coins that were used as money simply represented the gold ( or silver ) that was presently deposited at the bank .
But this gold standard did not last forever . During the 1900s , there were several key events that eventually led to the transition of gold out of the monetary system . In 1913 , the Federal Reserve was created and started issuing promissory notes ( the present day version of our paper money ) that could be redeemed in gold on demand . The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 gave the U.S. government title to all the gold coins in circulation and put an end to the minting of any new gold coins . In short , this act began establishing the idea that gold or gold coins were no longer necessary in serving as money . The U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1971 when its currency ceased to be backed by gold .
The Importance of Gold In the Modern Economy
Given the fact that gold no longer backs the U.S. dollar ( or other worldwide currencies for that matter ) , why is it still important today ? The simple answer is that while gold is no longer in the forefront of everyday transactions , it is still important to the global economy . To validate this point , there is no need to look further than the balance sheets of central banks and other financial organizations , such as the International Monetary Fund . Presently , these organizations are responsible for holding approximately one-fifth of the world 's supply of above-ground gold . In addition , several central banks have added to their present gold reserves , reflecting concerns about the long-term global economy .
Gold Preserves Wealth
The reasons for gold 's importance in the modern economy centers on the fact that it has successfully preserved wealth throughout thousands of generations . The same , however , can not be said about paper-denominated currencies . To put things into perspective , consider the following example :
Gold , Cash and Inflation
In the early 1970s , one ounce of gold equaled $ 35 . Let 's say that at that time , you had a choice of either holding an ounce of gold or simply keeping the $ 35 . They would both buy you the same things , like a brand new business suit or fancy bicycle . However , if you had an ounce of gold today and converted it for today 's prices , it would still be enough to buy a brand-new suit , but the same can not be said for the $ 35 . In short , you would have lost a substantial amount of your wealth if you decided to hold the $ 35 as opposed to the one ounce of gold because the value of gold has increased , while the value of a dollar has been eroded by inflation .
Gold as a Hedge Against a Declining U.S. Dollar and Rising Inflation
The idea that gold preserves wealth is even more important in an economic environment where investors are faced with a declining U.S. dollar and rising inflation . Historically , gold has served as a hedge against both of these scenarios . With rising inflation , gold typically appreciates . When investors realize that their money is losing value , they will start positioning their investments in a hard asset that has traditionally maintained its value . The 1970s present a prime example of rising gold prices in the midst of rising inflation .
The reason gold benefits from a declining U.S. dollar is because gold is priced in U.S. dollars globally . There are two reasons for this relationship . First , investors who are looking at buying gold ( i.e. , central banks ) must sell their U.S. dollars to make this transaction . This ultimately drives the U.S. dollar lower than global investors seek to diversify out of the dollar . The second reason has to do with the fact that a weakening dollar makes gold cheaper for investors who hold other currencies . This results in greater demand from investors who hold currencies that have appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar .
Gold as a Safe Haven
Whether it is the tensions in the Middle East , Africa or elsewhere , it is becoming increasingly obvious that political and economic uncertainty is another reality of our modern economic environment . For this reason , investors typically look at gold as a safe haven during times of political and economic uncertainty . Why is this ? Well , history is full of collapsing empires , political coups , and the collapse of currencies . During such times , investors who held gold were able to successfully protect their wealth and , in some cases , even use the commodity to escape from all of the turmoil . Consequently , whenever there are news events that hint at some type of global economic uncertainty , investors will often buy gold as a safe haven .
Gold as a Diversifying Investment
In general , gold is seen as a diversifying investment . It is clear that gold has historically served as an investment that can add a diversifying component to your portfolio , regardless of whether you are worried about inflation , a declining U.S. dollar , or even protecting your wealth . If your focus is simply diversification , gold is not correlated to stocks , bonds and real estate .
Gold as a Dividend-Paying Growth Asset
Gold stocks are typically more appealing to growth investors than to income investors . Gold stocks generally rise and fall with the price of gold , but there are well-managed mining companies that are profitable even when the price of gold is down . Increases in the price of gold are often magnified in gold stock prices . A relatively small increase in the price of gold can lead to significant gains in the best gold stocks and owners of gold stocks typically obtain a much higher return on investment ( ROI ) than owners of physical gold .
Even those investors focused primarily on growth rather than steady income can benefit from choosing gold stocks that demonstrate historically strong dividend performance . Stocks that pay dividends tend to show higher gains when the sector is rising and fare better – on average , nearly twice as well – than non-dividend-paying stocks when the overall sector is in a downturn .
The mining sector , which includes companies that extract gold , can experience high volatility . When evaluating the dividend performance of gold stocks , consider the company 's performance over time in regard to dividends . Factors such as the company 's history of paying dividends and the sustainability of its dividend payout ratio are two key elements to examine in the company 's balance sheet and other financial statements . A company 's ability to sustain healthy dividend payouts is greatly enhanced if it has consistently low debt levels and strong cash flows , and the historical trend of the company 's performance shows steadily improving debt and cash flow figures . Since any company goes through growth and expansion cycles when it takes on more debt and has a lower cash on hand balance , it 's imperative to analyze their long-term figures rather than a shorter financial picture timeframe .
Different Ways of Owning Gold
One of the main differences between investing in gold several hundred years ago and today is that there are many more investment options , such as :
Gold Futures
Gold Coins
Gold Companies
Gold ETFs
Gold Mutual Funds
Gold Bullion
Gold Jewelry
Is There a Bad Time to Invest in Gold ?
In order to ascertain the investment merits of gold , let 's check its performance against that of the S & P 500 for the past 10 years . Gold has underperformed compared to the S & P 500 in the 10-year period ending Jan. 26 , 2018 , with the The S & P GSCI index generating 3.27 % compared to the The S & P 500 , which has returned 10.36 % over the same period .
That said , gold trounced the S & P 500 in the 10-year period from November 2002 to October 2012 , with a total price appreciation of 441.5 % , or 18.4 % annually . The S & P 500 , on the other hand , appreciated by 58 % over this period .
The point here is that gold is not always a good investment . The best time to invest in almost any asset is when there is negative sentiment and the asset is inexpensive , providing substantial upside potential when it returns to favor , as indicated above .
The Bottom Line
Story highlights UN humanitarian chief says Riyadh has prevented aid agencies from landing planes in the country
Warning comes as Yemen is facing one of the world 's worst cholera outbreaks in modern history
( CNN ) The UN 's humanitarian chief has sent a chilling warning that Yemen is facing the world 's worst famine in decades in which millions could die , if Saudi Arabia continues to block aid flowing into the war-torn nation .
Saudi Arabia tightened its blockade on Yemen after Houthi rebels , who have taken over the national government and its assets , fired a ballistic missile last week toward an airport in Riyadh . The Saudis were able to intercept the projectile , but the event has rattled the region politically .
Saudi Arabia has carried out an air campaign against the Houthi rebels since 2015 , after civil war broke out and the internationally recognized government was forced out of the capital , Sanaa .
Since Monday , Riyadh has prevented aid agencies from landing planes in the country and docking at Yemen 's ports , worsening an already dire humanitarian situation , said UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock on Wednesday .
He explained he had put proposals to the UN Security Council to ensure the resumption of aid deliveries , and if they were not achieved , Yemen would descend into famine .

Crystal Bentley , age twenty-three , spent sixteen years in the Texas foster care system . Her testimony in a federal civil trial being held in Corpus Christi casts even more shadows on the embattled Texas Children 's Protective Services agency ( CPS ) . The agency , formally known as the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services ( TDFPS ) , is the subject of a civil rights class-action lawsuit .
Bentley testified earlier this week that she was shuffled from home to home from the time she was two years of age , until she “ aged-out ” at the age of eighteen . She claimed she was repeatedly beaten and sexually assaulted while she was under the watch of CPS caseworkers who frequently did n't show up for monthly visits . Bentley claims that the assaults came from adults who were supposed to be caring for her , the children of foster parents and other foster children , and even her own relatives according to an article in the Houston Chronicle . When caseworkers did show up for monthly visits , her abuse would go unreported because they failed to speak with her privately .
The class-action lawsuit was filed by a New York advocacy group called Children 's Rights . About 12,000 children are included in the class-action suit . These children are in long-term care in Texas .
The group seeks to have U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack order the State of Texas to enact reforms for its children 's services .
The group has been successful in fifteen of its nineteen previously filed lawsuits .
Another former foster child , Jordan Arce , age 19 , told his story about how he was placed in a facility with children who exhibited behavioral or emotional problems . Despite multiple placements and even a group home , Arce was able to maintain his straight-A record in schools . “ I would lock myself in the closet , just so I could study , read , talk to myself , ” he said . “ After I left , I struggled a lot with just connecting to other people . ”
Frequent turnover of caseworkers and management problems are to be blamed according to a series of articles in a San Antonio Express-News investigation .
Representatives for TDFPS tell a different side to the story . In testimony this week , Jane Burstain , the current director for TDFPS , cited statistics that show the department has made vast improvements in caring for foster children . She said Texas has made more placements in homes of relatives , and had more adoptions , fewer children in long-term care , and better training and retention of workers . “ Texas , vis-à-vis other states in the nation , is in the norm with turnover , not significantly better or worse , ” Burstain said in an article written by Stoeltje for the Express-News . “ All child welfare agencies struggle with turnover . ”
Burstain says that large caseloads are not necessarily tied to high worker turnover , or to bad outcomes for children . She said the plaintiffs were confusing “ correlation with causation . ”
The attorney for the Plaintiff Children 's Rights organization disagreed . “ You 've heard over and over again about high caseloads leading to high turnover and bad outcomes , including in countless documents the ( DFPS ) has put out about it , ” said Paul Yetter , a Houston attorney hired to help represent the organization .
Burstain suggested in several emails that “ reasonable minds ” could differ as to whether caregivers were at fault in some cases involving deaths in foster care during 2013 .
“ I did n't say [ the findings ] needed to be changed , I said they needed to be reviewed , ” Burstain said .
Judge Jack , who is hearing the case without a jury , asked , “ Why review them if it 's not to change them ? ”
The class action lawsuit is focused on children in long-term care in Texas who have been harmed by a system that has overloaded caseworkers and other problems .
A psychologist who testified on behalf of the state , addressed questions about an 8-year old boy who had been sexually assaulted by two 16-year-old boys while in a foster home . He said the boy had substantially improved while in the state 's care . This witness received tough questioning by the state 's lawyer , and the judge .
A ruling from the judge is not expected for several weeks .

While some will doubtless disagree , a reasoned look at the replays can leave little rational argument that Diego Costa 's actions were n't deserving of the three match ban he received .
Not that it stopped Mourinho who , after announcing to his post-match press conference in a broom cupboard at the Bescot Stadium that he would not comment on the subject , went on to do so at length .
The subtext of what he said , and the bit which seems to most irk Chelsea , is the lack of even-handedness in dealing with Costa when compared with others .
In the wider picture , consistency is vital . But you 'll not find too many criminals before the court get let off because they tell the judge : “ Another guy got away with the same crime last week . ”
His complaint about the rescinding of Gabriel Paulista 's red was far clearer : that it sets a precedent that players may now retaliate to provocation within the law . Something most had previously thought was entirely contrary every fibre of the game 's being . And that will lead to all manner of argument , you can be sure .
That Mourinho was even talking about these things in the first place causes consternation to many fans of the club .
Chelsea 's eventful win over Arsenal in pictures :
There is a long-standing and popular view that , given the part some sections of the media have played in key disciplinary episodes down the years ( Michael Essien , John Terry , Mourinho himself – the list is lengthy ) , that the club should shut up shop when it comes to the press .
That in itself is a bit of a short-termist view , which neglects to see the flip side of the coin : the great influence managers such as Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson have exerted over the game 's authorities simply by dropping big hints on the back pages .
The issue lays with the FA 's dreadful knee-jerk pandering to popular sentiment , and not the media 's attempt to sell units by reflecting or fuelling it .
If there is a silver lining to all this , it is that it forces Mourinho 's hand when it comes to who he plays up-front .
It has been a constant , since he first came to our attention with Porto , that the coach prefers a settled first XI . One imagines he would never voluntarily drop Costa unless he hit a particularly abject run of form .
He has n't been all he can be in front of goal this campaign , but his influence on games ( such as we saw against Arsenal ) has been growing .
That is why Mourinho so likes Costa : that he , like Dider Drogba before him , is far more than a mere number nine .
( Image : Action Images via Reuters / Tony O'Brien )
In his absence at Walsall on Wednesday night , Chelsea used a 4-3-3 formation harking back to Mourinho v1.0 , with Radamel Falcao as the main attacking outlet , and Loic Remy providing support .
Falcao moved around like the top striker he once was , though his end product was best described as 'rusty ' ( one effort , which almost cleared the roof of the away end , would have made Jonny Wilkinson proud ) .
Remy also had his moments , though did not seem consistent enough even against a League One defence to provide a persuasive case as a week-in week-out upper-end Premier League striker .
Essentially , both showed glimpses of what might be ; and a run in the side , no matter how short , will surely help find some of that missing form .
The issue of Costa , his hounding by opponents and officials , his replacement when banned , his recent lack of goalscoring form – this can all be expected to be a constant this season , and possibly beyond .
He comes with baggage but , for now at least , that baggage is worth it . And , perhaps best of all , he is not Fernando Torres . Which is something for which all Chelsea fans should be thankful .
`` Barring something unforeseen , [ Justin Verlander 's ] going to pitch Opening Day , '' Ausmus said Tuesday morning at Joker Marchant Stadium , where Ausmus just arrived to begin preparing for his third year in charge .
LAKELAND , Fla. -- Opening Day starter was one of the trickiest decisions Brad Ausmus faced in his first two Spring Training camps as Tigers manager . This year , he did n't even need to wait for reporting day .
LAKELAND , Fla. -- Opening Day starter was one of the trickiest decisions Brad Ausmus faced in his first two Spring Training camps as Tigers manager . This year , he did n't even need to wait for reporting day .
`` Barring something unforeseen , [ Justin Verlander 's ] going to pitch Opening Day , '' Ausmus said Tuesday morning at Joker Marchant Stadium , where Ausmus just arrived to begin preparing for his third year in charge .
The Tigers open the season with Interleague Play on April 5 at Miami . It would be Verlander 's eighth career Opening Day start .
Considering an unforeseen circumstance last Spring Training landed Verlander on the disabled list to open the season , sidelined by a right triceps strain , Tuesday 's news is n't exactly a guarantee . Nonetheless , it restores Verlander back to his old status atop Detroit 's rotation , a position he owned until David Price started Opening Day last year .
The news is n't exactly a surprise . Though the Tigers signed free agent Jordan Zimmermann to a five-year , $ 110 million contract in November , they saw Verlander regain his dominance down the stretch last year . After a half-dozen inconsistent starts upon return from the DL , Verlander posted a 2.27 ERA and allowed a .207 batting average over his final 14 starts , surrendering 74 hits over 99 1/3 innings . His 5-5 record during that stretch was partly the result of poor run support , with the Tigers scoring two runs or fewer in seven of the 14 starts .
Video : MLB Tonight on Verlander getting Opening Day start
Verlander started seven consecutive Tigers openers , even beating out reigning American League Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer for the honor in 2014 . The streak ended last year , when Price -- a Trade Deadline acquisition the previous summer -- earned the nod over Verlander , who was coming off a '14 season that was subpar by his standards . Ausmus made that decision well before Verlander 's injury .
`` My gut kind of said that Price deserved it , '' Ausmus recalled . `` And to Ver 's credit , when I told him , he absolutely agreed 100 percent . He was very magnanimous about it . ''
Verlander was graceful at the time , but still competitive . Clearly , the honor meant something .
`` Hopefully at this time next year , we 're talking about me having earned it and done all the things that I 've worked so hard to do to get back to being that guy , '' Verlander said back then . `` I 'd rather be on the mound [ Opening Day ] , but like I 've said many times , I 've got to earn it -- and I plan on doing that . ''
He did that before his first official pitch of Spring Training .
`` It 's a little more clear-cut this year , '' Ausmus said .
Feminist journalist Jill Filipovic recently made a hilariously un-self-aware comment on Twitter .
One advantage the left has over the right is we do n't value bowing to authority . But I see a kind of Messiah worship in Sanders supporters .
— Jill Filipovic ( @ JillFilipovic ) April 15 , 2016
I wonder : was she around when Barack Obama was running in 2008 ? ( Yes , she was . ) Nothing about Bernie 's messiah complex should be remotely new to you if you followed the Obama phenomenon .
The Left still clings to this old view of themselves as bold free-thinkers who “ question authority , ” when they have long since set themselves up as the authorities everyone else is supposed to bow to .
By coincidence , I came across this at about the same time as a video of Bill Nye , the supposed “ science guy , ” taking a break from asking big and important questions like “ What if the Earth were a cube instead of a ball ? ” and declaring that maybe global warming skeptics should be thrown in jail .
He does it through a series of rhetorical questions : “ Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron ? Was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive , and so on . ”
Enron was a case of provable fraud , in which executives lied about specific facts about the operation of their own company—not about complex scientific conclusions . As for tobacco executives , none of them did go to jail ( much to the consternation of anti-tobacco fanatics ) , and for good reason . To ban one side of a political debate from making its case is to condemn them in advance , denying them an opportunity to speak in their own defense .
Courts as Tools of Political Coercion
But Nye is n't just speculating about putting people in jail . He is referring to a specific attempt to use the model of those old tobacco lawsuits to prosecute any company that has ever funded research or advocacy skeptical of claims about global warming . This campaign was started last year and has taken its newest steps recently with a meeting of state attorneys general who vowed to launch “ investigations into whether fossil fuel companies misled investors and the public on the impact of climate change . ”
‘ There is a chilling effect on scientists who are in extreme doubt about climate change , I think that is good . '
The attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands—whom you would think would have enough to deal with at home straightening out a notoriously dysfunctional office—has subpoenaed a leading free-market think tank , the Competitive Enterprise Institute , demanding all of its internal communications from 1997 through 2007 . Why ? Because CEI once committed the presumed crime of accepting money from a major oil company .
This is what you call a “ fishing expedition. ” The prosecutors are not demanding any specific evidence of criminal activity , because they have no specific grounds to suspect it . They 're just demanding everything , in the hope that once they fish through it , they will find something they can cast as incriminating , or at least embarrassing . It 's a well-known form of legal harassment .
To those who object that this will create a “ chilling effect ” on scientific debate over global warming , which is the obvious goal of the investigation , Nye says that 's just fine . “ That there is a chilling effect on scientists who are in extreme doubt about climate change , I think that is good . ”
Goodbye , Free Speech
As bad as that is , Nye 's justification for it is worse . “ As a taxpayer and voter , the introduction of this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen . So I can see where people are very concerned about this , and they 're pursuing criminal investigations. ” I could make the case that Nye 's continued existence “ affects my quality of life. ” Should I get the government to do something about that ?
‘ The introduction of this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen . '
But wait , there 's more . “ The extreme-doubt-about-climate-change people—without going too far afield here—are leaving the world worse than they found it because they are keeping us from getting to work . They are holding us back. ” It used to be that the Left wanted to limit “ commercial speech , ” but “ political speech ” was sacrosanct . Now it is considered acceptable to suppress other people 's speech precisely because they might have an impact on the political debate .
In other words : Bow to authority . My authority .
Bill Nye is just one entertainer , a third-rate popularizer of science . But he is totally representative of the Left 's real attitude about authority . Their fundamental conviction is that the conscience of the individual must be forced to yield to the demands of the collective , as decided by the authorities who presume to speak for it .
Try refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding , and tell me whether you will be forced to bow to authority . Try running a fast-food joint or comic-book shop that ca n't afford to pay its employees $ 15 an hour , and tell me whether you will be forced to bow to authority . Try to keep men dressed as women out of your ladies ' restroom , and tell me whether you will be forced to bow to authority .
You should check out the Twitter feed A Crime a Day , which draws from the vast depths of the US criminal code to inform us of all the actions and decision of private individuals that have been transformed into crimes for no readily apparent reason . Take this one :
21 USC §§331 ( m ) , 333 & 347 ( b ) ( 2 ) make it a federal crime for a retail establishment to sell margarine in packages larger than one pound .
— A Crime a Day ( @ CrimeADay ) March 30 , 2016
There is no real rhyme or reason to the vast patchwork of regulation except : bow to authority .
Thanks to the Left , we live in an era of authority . Authority is their entire agenda , in politics , in economics , in culture , in religion , in science . It 's grimly amusing when they try to hide this , and a lot less amusing when the pretense falls away , and they try to make us bow .

Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates infamously refused to enforce President Trump 's executive order on immigration , which banned immigrants from seven Middle Eastern and African nations . Because of her refusal to comply with the order , Trump relieved her of her duties .
At a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing Monday , Yates stood by her actions , insisting she believes the travel ban is intended to discriminate against Muslims . She could not in `` good conscience '' defend it and or send DOJ lawyers in to defend it .
`` I was not convinced it was constitutional , '' she told Sen. John Kennedy ( R-LA ) . `` There was no way in the world I could send folks in there to argue something we did n't believe to be the truth . ''
That 's when Kennedy challenged her assumptions .
`` Who appointed you to the United States Supreme Court ? '' he asked her . `` At what point does a statue or an executive order become unconstitutional ? ''
Yates said she believes it is the responsibility of the attorney general to make those conclusions . As for the travel order , that was not a decision she `` took lightly . ''

Es wird immer schlimmer .
Nun kommt auch mal die Berliner Zeitung mit einem Artikel zum Untergang um die Ecke : Politische Korrektheit Die neue Intoleranz an Berliner Universitäten
Bildunterschrift : Wer am lautesten schreit , gewinnt : Debatten der Political Correctness werden erbittert geführt , von allen Seiten .
Die Politik hat über Jahre die Hochschulen mit Dummen betankt , die Presse hat schön mitgemacht , und jetzt steht man da und wundert sich , wie so ein Idiotenhaufen zustande kommen konnte . In diesem Fall geht es um die Alice-Salomon-Hochschule , das ist die , an der sie sich neulich schon wegen eines Gedichtes an der Außenfassade bekriegt haben .
Die Hochschule entschied sich dann , in einem Wettbewerb Ideen für eine Neugestaltung zu sammeln . Seitdem herrscht Ausnahmezustand . „ Dieses Gedicht , ausgerechnet an dieser Hochschule “ , sagt Bettina Völter . Und meint damit , dass an der ASH Studierende für Berufe ausgebildet werden , in denen sie mit Menschen in Grenzsituationen arbeiten , mit Geflüchteten , Behinderten , auch Opfern sexualisierter Gewalt . Sie legen hier großen Wert auf Antirassismus und Antidiskriminierung . „ Die Studierenden lernen bei uns auch sehr differenziert mit Geschlechterkonstruktionen umzugehen “ , sagt Bettina Völter . „ Muss dann ein Gedicht an der Fassade stehen , das dieses Thema so bewusst vereinfacht ? “ Für sie ist das eine Frage der Glaubwürdigkeit .
Man könnte die Frage auch ganz anders stellen : Was soll man von einer Hochschule halten , die die Abrichtung von Studenten auf Dummheit zu ihrem zentralen Gegenstand macht und sich dann darüber wundert , dass sie Studenten bekommt , die die Dummheit anbeten ? Geliefert wie bestellt .
Wenn schon die Prorektorin sagt , dass sie die Studenten darauf abrichten , „ differenziert mit Geschlechterkonstruktionen umzugehen ” , und sich dann darüber wundert , dass die dann auf diesem Psychotrip sind , dann stinkt schon der Kopf nach Fisch .
Dabei kommt die Zeitung auf das zentrale Problem dabei :
Als schon alles gesagt schien , in Dutzenden Kommentaren in Zeitungen , im Fernsehen , im Radio , veröffentlichten die Studierenden eine Stellungnahme : „ Angenommen ihr alle wohnt in einem Mietshaus “ , schrieben sie , „ und auf der einen Fassade dieses Mietshauses steht ein Gedicht . Ihr wisst nicht genau , wie der Dichter es gemeint hat , aber irgendwie gibt es euch ein komisches Bauchgefühl . Und ein komisches Bauchgefühl im eigenen Haus – das ist doch nicht schön. “ Es ist der Vergleich , der bei diesen Sätzen aufhorchen lässt : die Uni als Zuhause , als Ort , an dem sich alle Studierenden wohlfühlen sollen und sich wie Mieter bei der Hausverwaltung beschweren können , wenn ihnen etwas nicht passt . Die Universität ist dann nicht mehr primär ein akademischer Ort , ein Raum also , in dem es nicht nur darum geht , was , sondern wie gedacht wird , kritisch nämlich ; in dem grundsätzlich erst mal jede Position verhandelt werden kann , um dann zu schauen , wie alles miteinander zusammenhängt ; dazu gehört auch , eigene Überzeugungen immer wieder herauszufordern , zu hinterfragen , Reibungen und Dissens zuzulassen . Wenn das Bauchgefühl ins Spiel kommt , geht es darum zu sagen : Ich fühle mich verletzt . Und nicht : Ich bin anderer Meinung . Es geht dann um Befindlichkeit und nicht um den Austausch von Argumenten . Und : Wer die Uni als Zuhause sieht , wähnt sich im Recht , nicht nur die Farbe der Wände zu bestimmen , sondern darüber zu entscheiden , wer dort sprechen darf und wer nicht .
Und da muss man hellhörig werden , denn das ist ja exakt die Argumentation amerikanischer linksradikaler Studenten . Und die kann hier nicht unabhängig entstanden sein , denn diese Situation gibt es hier ja nicht . In den USA wohnen die Studenten auf dem Campus , da bilden die Universitäten quasi abgeschlossene Städte mit eigener Polizei und quasi eigener Legislative , aus denen sich Studenten in der Regel gar nicht mehr herausbegeben . Daher kommt deren Sichtweise , dass die Universität nicht der Wissenschaft dient , sondern im Prinzip so eine Art Wellnesshotel oder Luxusinternat , die Fortsetzung von Mutti und dem rosa Kinderzimmer ist .
Eine solche Konstellation haben wir aber in Deutschland nicht , hier waren die Hochschulen noch nie ein „ zuhause ” . Wenn die hier also trotzdem auf diese Masche kommen , obwohl der Auslöser dafür fehlt , heißt das – wieder einmal , ist ja eigentlich immer so – dass die amerikanische Vorgehensweisen kopieren , plagiieren , nachahmen . Und die sich in der Konsequenz einbilden , das Hausrecht wie über ihr Wohnzimmer zu haben , und deshalb auch nicht auf Argumentation oder Recht oder Grundrechte achten zu müssen . Die leben im Prinzip in dem Wahn , dass der Campus wie ihr Kinderzimmer ist , über das sie allein zu bestimmen hätten .
Insofern ist es kurios , dass die Berliner Zeitung an einer deutschen Hochschule eine psychische Erkrankung treffsicher diagnostiziert , die man eigentlich nur in den USA haben kann .
Es sind Proteste zumeist linker Studenten gegen Rechte , Konservative , Islamkritiker , deren Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung nicht mehr zu gelten scheint , sobald sie eine Universität betreten wollen . Und es versagen sie ausgerechnet die , die Toleranz und Diversität ansonsten zu den zentralen Markern ihres Denkens erklärt haben . So wird natürlich eine Auseinandersetzung schwierig , in der die besseren Argumente gewinnen – und nicht der , der am lautesten schreit .
Das ist das , was Linke eigentlich immer herstellen : Sie reißen sich alle Rechte an sich und gewähren anderen keine mehr , um dann mit Gewalt durchzusetzen , was sie wollen . Ähnlich wie normale Straßenkriminalität .
Vor einem Jahr wollte Jörg Baberowski , Professor für Geschichte Osteuropas an der Berliner Humboldt-Universität , an der Universität Bremen sein Buch „ Räume der Gewalt “ vorstellen . Als der Asta zu Protesten aufrief , verlegte die Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung , die Baberowski eingeladen hatte , dessen Auftritt in ihre eigenen Räume , Polizei und ein Sicherheitsdienst schützten den Eingang . Baberowski wandte sich danach an die Kanzlei Schertz Bergmann . Der Asta hatte auf Flugblättern und im Internet verbreitetet , dass Baberowski ein Rechtsradikaler sei , der Gewalt gegen Flüchtlinge verharmlose und „ Menschen mit blankem Hass “ begegne . Vor dem Kölner Landgericht erwirkte Baberowski zunächst eine einstweilige Verfügung . Die Studenten gingen in Berufung . Als die Richterin im Juni deutlich machte , dass sie die Aussagen von der Meinungsfreiheit gedeckt sah , zog Baberowski seinen Antrag zurück .
Das muss man sich auf der Zunge zergehen lassen : Linke Linksradikale bekommen von der Justiz „ Meinungsfreiheit ” zugestanden , gleichzeitig aber können und dürfen sie gewaltsam anderen die Meinungsfreiheit entziehen . Und gerade dann , wenn dahinter solche Organisationen wie der AStA stehen , die direkte Verbindungen zu Parteien haben , die in Regierungen sitzen , dass der Staat selbst die Meinungsfreiheit sabotiert .
Das Problem ist das Prinzip der „ vindictive protectiveness “ : Wer bereits Sprache als gewalttätig , wer die Literaturauswahl einer Vorlesung als Fortschreibung struktureller Machtverhältnisse einer Gesellschaft sieht , dem geht es nicht um eine intellektuelle Debatte , nicht um Wissenschaft , sondern er stellt eine politische Forderung nach einem Ausgleich für empfundenes Unrecht .
Sprachregeln als Mittel politischer Gewalt .
Und dann das :
Ist dagegen etwas einzuwenden ? Ist es nicht wünschenswert , sich um eine Sprache zu bemühen , die nicht verletzend , nicht ausgrenzend ist , auch nicht versehentlich ?
So treffend der Artikel sonst ist , da merkt man dann auch die journalistische Insuffizienz , denn erstens wurde nie belegt , warum derlei Sprache diese „ Vorteile ” haben soll , es wurde nie gezeigt , warum das ein Vorteil sein soll , und die Nachteile hat man auch nie betrachtet . Schon mit der Frage unterstellt man , dass die Änderung eine Verbesserung sei , und fragt dann spitz , was dagegen einzuwenden wäre .
Warum Sprachregeln , die so massiv zu Redeverboten führt , für sich in Anspruch nehmen können sollten , „ nicht verletzend , nicht ausgrenzend ” zu sein , und dabei Leuten das Reden verbietet und sie als „ Rechte ” an die Wand nagelt , wäre zu klären , überschreitet dann aber doch die geistigen Kapazitäten der Berliner Zeitung weit . Ist es etwa nicht „ ausgrenzend ” und „ verletzend ” , wenn man Leute mit Gewalt vom Reden abhält ? Da muss das Hirn doch schon schwer kaputt sein , wenn man solche Positionen vertritt , und das müsste einem Journalisten von Berufs wegen eigentlich auffallen .
Ende Juni hingen überall an den Berliner Universitäten Plakate mit seinem Gesicht , darüber : „ Der Fall Baberowski – gegen rechte und militaristische Ideologie an der Uni ! “ „ Das war richtig krass “ , sagt Judith Sevinç Basad , „ der ganze Campus war tapeziert. “ Judith studiert Literaturwissenschaft an der FU . Die Plakate warben für eine Diskussionsveranstaltung , organisiert vom Asta der Uni Bremen , vom Asta der TU und der IYSSE , jener trotzkistische Gruppe . Judith war eine von einem guten Dutzend Studierender , die dann an einem frühen Abend in einem Hörsaal an der TU saßen , um sich anzuhören , was gegen Baberowski vorlag . Immer wieder meldeten sie sich zu Wort : „ Ist das nicht aus dem Zusammenhang gerissen ? “ – „ Das sagt Baberowski doch so gar nicht. “ Die IYSSE schrieb danach auf ihrer Website , sie seien von der rechtsextremen Identitären Bewegung geschickt worden . [ … ] „ Wenn du sagst , dass du es nicht gut findest , wie Baberowski behandelt wird , bist du gleich rechts “ , sagt sie . Judith hat eine Initiative gegründet , sie hat sie „ Studenten für Demokratie und Meinungsfreiheit “ genannt . „ Der universitäre Diskurs ist meistens links “ , sagt sie , „ daran ist ja auch nichts auszusetzen , aber es gibt einfach keine Mitte mehr. “
Und die nehmen für sich in Anspruch , nicht ausgrenzend und nicht verletzend zu sein ? Fällt das niemandem auf ?
Eigentlich heißt es doch : Die sind praktisch alle komplett durchverblödet , da ist nichts mehr zu retten .
Es gibt eigentlich nur noch einen Ausweg : Wir besorgen uns die Baupläne dieses Sarkophagdeckels über dem Tschernobyl-Kraftwerk , stülpen so ein Ding über jede Hochschule , wenn die gerade mal alle drin sind , und erklären die Umgebung zur Verbotszone .
Sie erzählt , wie selbstverständlich an der Uni zu Gewalt aufgerufen werde , von Slogans wie „ Aus 9 Flaschen können schnell 9 Mollis werden ! “ , den sie an einer Wand im Institut für Sozialwissenschaften gelesen hat , als Studenten dort im Januar gegen die Entlassung von Andrej Holm protestierten .
Und von denen soll man lernen , andere zu respektieren , nicht zu verletzen ? Was man sagen darf und was man nicht ?
„ Kritik sollte anders gehen “ , sagt Judith . Sie bezeichnet sich als Feministin , sie schreibt ihre Hausarbeiten über Genderthemen . Den Diskussionen an der Uni kann sie manchmal trotzdem nicht mehr folgen .
Ihre Sichtweise ist nett . Aber ihre Hausarbeiten – oder überhaupt ihre Studienwahl – sollte sie überdenken . Wahnsinn zu kritisieren ist ehrenwert . Ihn gleichzeitig zu studieren widersprüchlich .
Sie erzählt von einem Panel zum Institutstag im vergangenen Jahr . Da sei darüber diskutiert worden , was getan werden könne , damit Frauen sich in Seminaren häufiger zu Wort melden . „ Es ging dann darum , wie man das Redeverhalten von dominanten Männern bremsen könnte “ , erzählt sie . Es seien Vorschläge diskutiert worden wie nach Geschlechtern getrennte Seminarräume und Rednerlisten , auf der nach jedem Mann eine Frau kommen müsse . „ Es kann doch nicht die Lösung des Problems sein , Verbote einzuführen und die eigene Unzufriedenheit zu delegieren “ , sagt Judith .
Die Frage ist viel weitgehender : Ob nicht der ganze Ansatz gescheitert ist .
Denn bisher wird ja immer gepredigt , dass Diversität und Inklusion das einzig wahre und unfehlbare gute seien . Wie passt das damit zusammen , dass man getrennte Seminarräume und Rednerlisten diskutiert ? Heißt das nicht , dass die Gender Studies an sich und der ganze Diversitäts-Krampf nichts als Quatsch waren , wenn man schon selbst diskutiert , wie man davon wieder weg kommt ?
Im Frühjahr , als ein Hörsaal an der FU besetzt wurde , besuchte sie ein studentisches Plenum , das zum „ Safe Space “ erklärt wurde . Stirnrunzeln und andere Gesten der Zustimmung oder Ablehnung waren nicht erlaubt , weil sich davon jemand verletzt fühlen könnten , stattdessen sollten mit den Händen Kreuze geformt oder gewedelt werden .
Stirnrunzeln ist nicht erlaubt…
Wie konnte das alles passieren ? Zu meiner Zeit an der Uni war so etwas nicht möglich . Aber warum ?
Ein Punkt ist die Abwesenheit von Geisteswissenschaftlern . Ich war an einer technischen Uni , und die Verblödung geht eindeutig von den Geisteswissenschaften aus .
Ein weiterer Punkt ist das Geschlecht . Als technische Uni waren wir hauptsächlich Männer . Im Zentrum dieses Schwachsinns stehen aber immer weit überwiegend Frauen .
Ein dritter Punkt ist das Alter . Wir waren noch 9 Jahre auf dem Gymnasium , und fast alle im Grundwehr- oder Ersatzdienst , also generell zwei Jahre älter . Die Eltern mitzubringen , mit dem Professor reden zu lassen , zum Elternabend zu schicken wäre für uns damals völlig absurd und ausgeschlossen gewesen . Wir waren erwachsen und hätten uns über so einen Quatsch nur schief gelacht .
Ein vierter Punkt ist , dass wir friedlicher , aber selbständiger und freiheitlicher waren . Gewaltsames Handeln wäre uns gar nicht in den Sinn gekommen , aber wenn uns jemand gewaltsam vom Besuch eines Vortrags hätte abzuhalten versucht hätte , hätte er das kein zweites Mal versucht . Bei uns hätte sich so eine radikal-linke Gruppe nicht durchsetzen können .
Ein fünfter Punkt : Wir waren beim Grundwehrdienst . Da wird man sehr nachhaltig von Kinderzimmer , Mutti und Schmuseton entwöhnt . Das merkten damals auch alle älteren Studenten und O-Phasen-Tutoren , dass Leute , die vorher beim Bund waren , einfach erwachsener und selbständiger sind , ihre Klamotten selbst in den Schrank legen können und so weiter , und auch mal einen ruppigeren Ton problemlos ertragen können .
Womöglich hängt die Verblödung am Ende mit dem Aussetzen der Wehrpflicht zusammen . Zuviel unreife Kinder an der Uni .
Der britische Biologe Richard Dawkins , der gerne gegen Political Correctness wettert , schrieb dazu auf Twitter : „ A university is not a ‚safe space ‘ . If you need a safe space , leave , go home , hug your teddy & suck your thumb until ready for university. “
Darauf läuft 's hinaus .
Nine hundred fake iPhones , 28,000 fake NBA jerseys , 1,100 pairs of fake Oakley sunglasses and 12 pairs of fake Calvin Klein boxers — they are among the items detained by the Canada Border Services Agency since 2015 under a new law that aimed to crack down on counterfeit goods flowing into the country .
The knock-offs are contained in some of the 36 counterfeit shipments have been detained since the law was passed . But that number is “ a joke beyond belief , ” says a Toronto lawyer who specializes in anti-counterfeiting .
Lorne Lipkus said the value of Canada 's counterfeit market is likely $ 20 billion to $ 30 billion , but the country 's record on fighting fake goods is among the worst in the world .
“ We bang our heads against the wall , ” he said . “ Nobody can believe Canada does so little . ”
Nobody can believe Canada does so little
Counterfeit products are a growing problem in this country . Before the new law was passed in December 2014 , the RCMP took the lead on seizing counterfeit goods . In 2012 , the police force seized $ 38.1 million in fake goods , up from $ 7.7 million in 2005 .
But it seems unlikely the CBSA has detained goods worth anywhere near that much . A list of 31 of the 36 shipments detained by the agency since 2015 , tabled in the House of Commons recently , shows a total value of less than $ 600,000 , though more than half of the shipments — mainly the smaller ones — do n't have values attached .
The list largely consists of knock-off clothing , glasses , watches and headphones , mimicking brands like Prada , Chanel , Under Armour and Bose . The only Canadian brand on the list is Canada Goose — 20 fake winter coats were intercepted in November 2016 . Most of the shipments had come from China and were caught in Montreal or Toronto .
Before the Combating Counterfeit Products Act was passed , the CBSA did n't have the authority to detain fake goods of its own accord . But the new law allows companies to file requests asking the agency to stop counterfeit versions of their brands at the border . The companies can provide the CBSA with information about how to identify fakes . Once counterfeits are flagged , they can choose whether or not to take the importers to court .
There are currently 169 companies that have filed requests with the CBSA . But those requests have yielded only three dozen results , which Lipkus called “ embarrassing . ”
In total , 10 of the affected companies have pursued litigation against importers since the law was passed . Three of those cases went to court and the other seven were resolved outside of court .
“ The volume of activity has been surprisingly small , ” said Cynthia Rowden , a partner at intellectual property law firm Bereskin and Parr . “ We would have expected there to be more seizures . ”
The RCMP still has the authority to seize counterfeit products on its own . But Rowden and Lipkus both said the police force has stopped making border seizures a priority after the new law was passed giving the CBSA more power .
The documents tabled in the House state that “ the RCMP federal policing program has not discovered any counterfeit goods since December 2015. ” The Mounties ' regional policing divisions were not able to provide information about seizures in the time they were given .
Rowden said part of the problem with the new legislation is that companies end up on the hook for the cost of storing counterfeit goods until their cases are settled , which can make them reluctant to sign on . “ I think a lot of people were very concerned about what those costs would be . ”
Instead , she said , they may prefer to let the goods enter the country and have police intervene wherever they 're being sold .
But Lipkus said the main issue is that the CBSA has n't been given a strong mandate or the resources to tackle the problem .
“ We absolutely have the ability . We do n't have the will . We do n't have a government saying ‘ Do this ' . ”
In a statement , the office of Innovation , Science and Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains said there is “ currently work being undertaken to raise public and private sector awareness of the new regime , ” including a working group of industry and law enforcement officials .
Natasha Tusikov , an incoming assistant professor of criminology at York University , said counterfeit products can be imported by retailers and individuals , who may not always realize the goods are fake .
But counterfeit products are likely a major part of black market trade in Canada . According to the website Havocscope.com , which attempts to compile information on the global black market , the drug trade accounts for the largest portion of the Canadian black market , valued at $ 44.5 billion , followed by counterfeiting at $ 30 billion . Those numbers are several years old .
Conservative MP Dan Albas , who requested the list of detentions , said the fact that most of the products came from China is a reason for concern .
“ This is at a time when the government is embracing further investments and further extension of trade ( with China ) , ” he said . “ We should be very , very aware of these issues . ”
Canada 's record on fighting counterfeit goods is also a source of concern for its trading partners . As of 2017 , Canada remains on the United States Trade Representative watch list , in part because even now , customs officials can detain only counterfeit goods destined for Canada — not those passing through to the U.S .
Rowden said allowing the CBSA to detain goods in transit through Canada “ would make it much more obvious that Canada cares significantly about the distribution of counterfeit merchandise . ”
There are many types of counterfeit goods coming into Canada beyond what shows up on the CBSA 's list . In 2012 , the RCMP seized copyrighted works , such as CDs and DVDs , toys , pharmaceuticals , makeup and batteries as well .
Lipkus suggested the items the CBSA is detaining — mostly apparel — are “ the lowest of the low-hanging fruit and the easiest to spot . ”
But it 's also possible that other types of companies have n't filed requests with the agency . Tusikov said companies making pharmaceuticals , electronics and equipment are less likely to make noise about their products being faked than a clothing designer would be , for fear that safety concerns will taint their brands . As a result , it 's hard to get a handle on the scale of the problem in Canada .
“ We do n't know a lot about this issue . … We do n't have a lot of empirical evidence , ” she said . “ We need to have a lot more data on what 's actually happening . ”
I found this from Calvin at plaidbag.org : The dishwasher and the garbage disposal . The original article from the Washington Post is about how immigrants rarely use dishwashers : Washing their hands of the last frontier . The article says :
In many immigrant homes , the automatic dishwasher is the last frontier . Long after new arrivals pick up football , learn the intricacies of the multiplex and the DMV and develop a taste for pizza , they resist the dishwasher . Some joke that not using the appliance is one of the truest signs of immigrant heritage , whether they hail from Africa , Latin America , Asia or Eastern Europe .
I know people who work in restaurants , and they prewash , even if they use the automatic dishwasher–which is why you can still get a job as a “ dishwasher ” in restaurants . Aside from having to prewash , I also do n't buy the idea that dishwashers are as efficient as handwashing . Sure , some people leave the water running while they wash . But how can scrubbing with a sponge ( which you need for prewashing anyway ) be less energy efficient than a stream of water directed by a large electric appliance ? I could see myself using it for large parties or if my kids start eating more and creating more dishes , but otherwise , I think it 's a waste .
( The only justifiable environmental argument I see is the possibility that there is less wear-and-tear on sponges . But I think most of the sponge-damage comes from the hard scrubbing that comes with prewashing . )
Garbage disposals , on the other hand , should never be used . Calvin 's dad is right not to use one . I know home inspectors who talk about how ground-up solids are not meant to be flushed down regular pipes , and how these can create all kinds of longterm problems .
Speaking of being efficient , I noticed that lots of people do n't have laundry dryers in Japan–they just hang it up . To me , this makes a lot of sense . Having a tumbling drum that heats and dries your laundry for a couple hours each load–that 's energy that could be better used powering your refrigerator or other more necessary appliances . People ought to use solar powered drying machines , like this one :
( CNN ) Today is National Donut Day . Or Doughnut , if you 're a stickler for spellings .
Indeed , like a Dalmatian to a firefighter , doughnuts have been so closely associated with cops that it 's become a trope .
Your office Someone is bound to bring in some
Dunkin ' Donuts but you have to buy a drink
Movies propagate it -- from `` Police Academy '' to `` Wreck-It Ralph . ''
The public peddles it -- such as , when demonstrators dangled doughnuts in front of officers during an Occupy Wall Street rally .
And sometimes police themselves perpetuate it , such as the Chicago cop who allegedly accepted a $ 5,000 bribe -- stuffed in a doughnut bag .
But behind every stereotype , there 's usually an ounce of truth . So we set out to seek how this one came about .
The love goes way back
`` It 's not an urban legend , '' says Michael Krondl . He would know ; he literally wrote the book on this topic , namely `` The Donut : History , Recipes and Lore . ''
Doughnut or donut : The delicious debate Between mouthfuls of sugary bites , we ca n't seem to agree on the correct way to spell the darned thing . The dictionary spelling is , of course , doughnut . Fried sweetened dough in the shape of a ring . Makes sense . But sometime in the late 20th century , we started to shorten it -- thanks to Dunkin ' Donuts . Its stores became ubiquitous . And 'donut ' started creeping into our vernacular -- kind of like our creeping waistline .
The cops-doughnut love affair was in full bloom even before the 1950s .
At the time , cops working the graveyard shift did n't have much choice when they wanted to take a break .
There were the all-night diners . But the food took too long .
And then there were the doughnut shops . They opened early to get ready for the morning crowd . And a cop could walk in , get a coffee ( staying awake is important in fighting crime ) and a doughnut to wash off the aftertaste .
But there was one more draw , Krondl says .
`` A lot of times , young women were working behind the counter . ''
Turning punchlines into headlines
Which brings us to today . Officers have more choices . And also , they 're way more health conscious .
So , understandably , some are bothered by the stereotype . We asked police down in Atlanta about it , but a spokesman politely declined to comment .
Others have embraced it .
In Illinois , officers climb rooftops at Dunkin ' Donuts every year to raise money for Special Olympics .
Thanks to all who donated to @ SpecialOlympics by participating in # CopOnARooftop event . Schaumburg raised $ 5,530 ! pic.twitter.com/dFD7HIlaeb — Villageof Schaumburg ( @ SchaumburgIL ) May 23 , 2016
In Portland , Oregon , when weed became legal , police issued a tongue-in-cheek visual aid to show how much is legally acceptable to carry . They shaped the weed into doughnuts .
And in Michigan , when a local doughnut shop was on the verge of closing , officers pooled their money and bought it . They called it -- what else -- Cops and Doughnuts . Today , you can buy a `` Do n't Glaze me , Bro '' T-shirt there and munch on a `` Misdemeanor Wiener . ''
So if you run into an officer today , do n't be afraid to share the Doughnut Day love and offer them a warm , sugary glazed one . Especially if they 're writing you a ticket .
Washington ( CNN ) In the space of a week , the Trump administration has named Russia a `` rival power , '' sanctioned a close Putin ally , and decided to give Ukraine anti-tank weapons to help in its fight against Moscow-backed militias .
It 's a series of steps that has been paired with tougher rhetoric from the State Department about Moscow 's destabilizing activities in eastern Ukraine , and serious charges from the Pentagon that Russia is intentionally violating de-confliction agreements in Syria .
The slew of actions highlights a decided turn away from the warmer , more cooperative relationship with Russia that President Donald Trump called for during his campaign and early in his presidency .
As Trump nears the one-year mark in office , a number of factors have intruded on those plans . He has been hemmed in by the domestic political constraint of an ongoing investigation into Russia 's interference with the 2016 election , as well as a widespread distrust of Russia and its continuing cyber activities that persists among the intelligence community , diplomats , the Pentagon and lawmakers .
'Pretty confrontational '
Those close to Trump who advocated for more cooperation with Moscow have been shown the White House door . And national security positions across the administration are now staffed with people , including at the Cabinet level , who have expressed more cautious and traditional views of Russia .
`` We 're a year in , and it 's looking like we 've settled on a Russia policy and that Russia policy is pretty confrontational , '' said Matt Rojansky , director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center . `` It 's definitely not the policy you would have expected from Trump the candidate . I think even the Russians understand the idea of a rapprochement is off the table . ''
Moreover , Rojansky adds , the signs point to increasing tensions in 2018 . `` There 's drama ahead , '' he said .
The State Department announced the decision to provide Ukraine with `` enhanced defensive capabilities '' on December 22 , just days after the administration had announced it would permit Ukraine to buy some small arms from US manufacturers .
The same day , the Pentagon accused Russia of intentionally violating an agreement intended to prevent accidents in the skies over Syria , following a recent unsafe encounter between US F-22s and Russian Su-25 jets .
`` Russia is failing to genuinely de-conflict airspace in Syria . Some of these incidents are not mistakes , '' Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Dana W. White told CNN . Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters , `` I do n't expect perfection , but I do n't expect dangerous maneuvers , either . ''
The decision to send arms to Ukraine , long sought by leaders there and backed by many in Congress , comes as violent clashes between Ukrainian soldiers and Russian-backed separatists have increased . Russia 's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Saturday that with the move , the US was `` pushing [ Ukraine ] to new bloodshed . ''
`` The United States , in a certain sense , had crossed the line , '' Ryabkov said , from acting as an intermediary to `` fueling the war . '' The US weapons could lead to `` new victims in our neighboring country , to which we can not remain indifferent , '' the foreign minister warned .
The State Department said in a statement that the assistance , which an official told CNN would include Javelin anti-tank missiles , is `` entirely defensive in nature '' and that the US remains committed to the Minsk agreements , a roadmap for resolving the conflict .
'The source of violence '
The problem , State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this week , lies entirely with Russia .
`` Russia and its proxies are the source of violence in eastern Ukraine , '' Nauert said December 19 . `` The Russian Government continues to perpetuate an active conflict and humanitarian crisis through its leadership and supply of military forces on the ground , as well as its direct control over proxy authorities . ''
A day later , the administration announced new sanctions on three Russians and two Chechens , including Ramzan Kadyrov , the leader of the Russian republic of Chechnya and a close Putin ally , for human rights abuses .
That generated the threat of `` tit-for-tat '' retaliation from the speaker of Russia 's lower house , Vyacheslav Volodin . `` The principle of reciprocity will be observed , '' Volodin said , according to the state news agency , TASS .
All this followed the administration 's National Security Strategy , released Monday , which said that Russia wants to shape a world antithetical to US values and interests , and aims to weaken Washington 's international influence , and `` divide us from our allies and partners . ''
It amounted to enshrining , in a formal document , the antithesis of Trump 's long-stated goal of warmer ties to Russia .
Putin called the strategy `` aggressive '' and said Russia would have to take it into account .

In contrast to the written National Security Strategy , when Trump delivered his speech outlining it , he omitted the written document 's denunciation of Russian election interference and instead , focused on a friendly phone call he 'd had with Putin .
That contrast is emblematic of the year-long tug-of-war within the administration , said Angela Stent , director of the Center for Eurasian , Russian and Eastern European Studies at Georgetown University .
`` What we 've seen all year really is the dual policy of President Trump wanting to have a much closer relationship with Putin , '' and the trio of Defense Secretary James Mattis , National Security Advisor H.R . McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson `` drawing a pretty tough line , '' Stent said .
Tillerson , deeply experienced with Russia from his days as ExxonMobil CEO , laid out a three-pronged policy for dealing with Moscow that involved pushing back where necessary , cooperating with Russia where it is in US interests to do so , and working to establish strategic stability .
The State Department held a few talks with Russian officials to try to get the relationship on firmer footing after the election and ongoing tension over each country 's seizure of some of the other country 's diplomatic properties . Those have either stopped or the administration is no longer announcing them . The State Department did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication .
`` My sense is that they 're beginning to realize that it 's just very difficult to get anything done with Russia , '' Stent said . `` And the Russians have n't diminished the kind of cyber activities '' they were doing during the election campaign , she added .
During his speech about the National Security Strategy , Trump said Putin had thanked him for information that helped thwart a planned terrorist attack in St. Petersburg . The cooperation was `` a great thing , '' Trump said , `` and the way it 's supposed to work . ''
But it does n't look like it will be working that way any time soon . `` Whether the President has abandoned his obviously strongly held view that Putin is someone we should be working with , I ca n't say , '' Rojansky said , `` but the administration has absolutely not made that a centerpiece of its foreign policy . ''
Record Heat in June Extends Globe 's Streak to 340 Months
June was one of the hottest such months on record globally , based on newly released data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . The month extended the unbroken string of warmer-than-average months to 340 , or a stretch of more than 28 years . That means that no one under the age of 28 has ever experienced a month in which global average temperatures were cooler than average ( based on the 20th century average ) .

Global average surface temperatures during June were either the second or the fifth-warmest on record for the month , based on analyses by NASA and NOAA , respectively . The two agencies keep tabs on global temperature trends using large networks of surface monitoring stations and statistical approaches to fill in gaps where stations are sparse , but they use slightly different methods to analyze the data , which can result in slight differences in their rankings .
June continued the long-term warming trend tied to manmade greenhouse gas pollution as well as natural climate variability . The planet has not recorded a single month with temperatures below the 20th century average since February 1985 , when the cult classic film “ The Breakfast Club ” was released , and the last year with a cooler-than-average June was in 1976 . This year so far is tied with 2003 as the seventh-warmest year on record , NOAA said .
Last month featured unusually wet conditions in the eastern U.S. , and tragically wet conditions in northwest India , where rainfall that was 200 percent of average inundated parts of the state of Uttarakhand , killing nearly 6,000 and causing widespread destruction . Areas that experienced higher-than-average temperatures during the month include north-central Canada , most of Alaska — which had its third-warmest June on record — and the Western U.S. , where about 80 percent of the region was in some stage of drought by the end of the month .
Much of northern and eastern Europe , western Russia , parts of Siberia , and north-central Australia also had warmer-than-average conditions , while western and southern Europe , Central Asia , and India had cooler-than-average conditions , NOAA reported .

According to NOAA , global land surface temperatures were the third-warmest on record , while ocean temperatures were closer to average , coming in as the 10th-warmest on record . An area of cooler-than-average waters in the eastern tropical Pacific may be acting to dampen global temperatures slightly , although NOAA experts said on Thursday that neither an El Niño nor a La Niña event is taking place , and one is not likely to take place through the fall . Such naturally occurring climate cycles can influence global weather and climate conditions , and can alter global average temperatures on shorter timescales than manmade carbon pollution , which studies have shown is most likely responsible for the long-term increase in global surface temperatures .
A recent report issued by the World Meteorological Organization found that nine of the 10 years between 2001-2010 were among the 10 warmest years on record for the globe , based on that organization 's rankings , which can differ slightly from NOAA and NASA 's rankings .
In the U.S. , June was yet another month of extremes , with a scorchingly hot and dry West contrasted with a record wet and relatively cool Midwest and East . In all , 18 states had a top 10 wettest June , with Delaware and New Jersey setting records for the wettest such month since record keeping began there in the late 19th century . Utah , on the other hand , set a record for its driest June , with a statewide average precipitation of barely a few drops — just 0.01 inches of rain .
The stark contrast in precipitation between the West and areas east of the Mississippi River has held true for much of 2013 , with California having a record dry start to the year , while four states in the Midwest were record wet for the same period . California has had just 31 percent of its average precipitation for the year , said Jake Crouch , a climate expert at the National Climatic Data Center , on a conference call with reporters .
“ We 're much below where we should be , and we 're much below the previous record Jan to June , ” he said .

I received this page of a Buenos Aires newspaper April 17 , 1943 , with the comment — the word “ milonga ” is not mentioned — from a reader in India .
First , I tried imagining what it was like in those days when one opened the newspaper and read the list of tango orquestas appearing that Saturday night in the clubs . Miguel Angel Balbi showed me newspapers from the 1940s years ago , so I am familiar with the advertising . Was it a difficult deciding where to go ? How did people choose one among the list of orquestas in the Golden Age of tango ? The page features the top nine orquestas of the Golden Age , missing only Pugliese to complete the top ten .
Based on my conversations with several milongueros viejos , the reason that “ milonga ” is n't mentioned in the advertisements is because these dances with orquestas were held in neighborhood clubs on Saturday . The “ milongas ” started around 1948 in nine confiterias bailables downtown with recorded music every day of the week . The milongueros did n't like the competition from the singers on stage who distracted the women from dancing . The women focused on dancing with the milongueros when Raul Beron or Roberto Chanel were n't around . Hence the dances in the downtown confiterias were known as milongas where milongueros went to milonguear . The confiterias bailables were small venues where the dancing changed .
With computer assistance , I enlarged the page to read the details in the ads .
Miguel Calo played in Asoc . S. F. Apolo at Boulogne sur Mer 547 ( El Once ) . The location is now the IFT Theater , a venue for alternative theater productions .
Juan D'Arienzo was announced to play on Sunday with L'Orchestre Lewis Varona ( mambo ) at Club Atletico Independiente , Av . Mitre 450 , Avellaneda , from 19-23,30 hs . Entrada was 2 pesos .
Angel D'Agostino played at Racing Club , Av . Mitre 934 , Avellaneda from 22-4 hs . Male members paid 1.50 , women paid 50 centavos ; male nonmembers 5 pesos , female nonmembers 1 peso .
Anibal Troilo with singers Francisco Fiorentino and Alberto Marino , plus a jazz orchestra , were at Club Atletico Velez Sarsfield , Rivadavia 7855-67 , in Liniers . There were limited streetcar lines in those days and few buses , so people had to rely on a friend with a car for transportation . Ladies paid 50 centavos to enter . Liniers is near the city limit .
Pedro Laurenz with Alberto Podesta performed downtown at Ocean Dancing at 25 de Mayo 279 that had another entrance on L. H. Alem , from 22-1 hs .
Ricardo Tanturi kept two groups of musicians working . One played at Tribu Social Club at Sarmiento 1374 and another with Alberto Castillo plus a jazz orchestra in Circulo General Urquiza , F. D. Roosevelt 5345 , a neighborhood sports club .
Lucio Demare was the headliner at Palermo Palace , Godoy Cruz and Santa Fe in Palermo , where men paid one peso and women entered free .

During July , the Last Word On Sports NFL department will be analyzing the schedules of every team in the NFL and ranking each game in order of difficulty ( with one being the most difficult ) . This series will be split up into the eight most difficult games ( ranked 1-8 ) and the eight easiest games ( ranked 9-16 ) for each team . In this article , the Green Bay Packers most difficult games are the focus .
Green Bay Packers Most Difficult Games in 2016
1 . Week 14 vs Seahawks
The Seahawks and Packers have had some great games in recent years . Unfortunately for Packers fans , Seattle won most of them . However , the latest meeting happened a year ago in Lambeau Field , and the home team won the game 27-17 . Was this the breakthrough game ? Another important aspect about this upcoming game is the playoff implications it will have as the two heavyweights collide in a deciding matchup for NFC seeding .
2 . Week 9 vs Colts
Any game featuring Aaron Rodgers and Andrew Luck belongs on a list of tough games . Luck had a down year last year before he got hurt , and yet he was on pace to throw 35 touchdowns . Think about that . Luck will bounce back and show the world why he was the consensus first overall pick . Four years ago , in Luck 's rookie campaign , the Colts hosted Green Bay and won 30-27 , after trailing 21-3 at halftime .
3 . Week 1 at Jaguars
Blake Bortles is fresh off a campaign where he threw 35 touchdowns and 18 interceptions with a rating of 88.2 . Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns are two reliable studs on the outside , and the defense is up and coming . Dante Fowler Jr. , Jalen Ramsey , Myles Jack , and veteran Malik Jackson make Jacksonville a tougher foe than some other teams on the schedule because they can stop the other team 's offense .
4 . Week 13 vs Texans
The Texans are fourth on the list because it is later in the year . Houston as a team tends to start slowly . But as the season progresses , J.J. Watt erupts and leads the defense to a top three unit in the league . By the time these teams square off , they will be one of the best units in the NFL . Their questions on offense are holding them back .
5 . Week 2 at Vikings
Similar to the Texans , the Vikings are lower on the list because of the questions surrounding their young quarterback . The running game is deadly , and they have an elite young defense . This game will be tough for two reasons : Minnesota will also be revealing its new stadium on Sunday Night Football , and the Vikings will want to prove that their division title was not a fluke .
6 . Week 5 vs Giants
Eli Manning , Odell Beckham Jr. , Victor Cruz in the slot , Sterling Shepard , Rashad Jennings coming out of the backfield , and Dwayne Harris translates to one of the best offenses in the league . The Giants will score on anybody , but will their defense full of high profile free agency signings be able to stop anyone ?
7 . Week 6 vs Cowboys
The Cowboys are in the same boat as the Giants . They possess an explosive offense that can score at will when healthy , but their defense can be exposed . The reason the Cowboys are behind the G-men is their health . In recent seasons , Tony Romo has often been on IR , while Dez Bryant is coming back from a foot injury that required surgery . Ezekiel Elliott has not played a down yet , so he is TBD .
8 . Week 16 vs Vikings
This game could also have playoff implications , a division title could be on the line , potentially a bye week in the playoffs , and the privilege to host at least one playoff game .
Check out the eight easiest games here .
As a labor and delivery nurse , I 've pretty much seen it all — butts and boobs , blood and babies . Many women , especially new moms , wonder just what goes on in that mysterious delivery room . If you 're expecting your first , here are some tips to keep in mind :
1 . Poop is good
You may have heard the rumor going around that some women poop while giving birth . I have news for you : It 's true . As horrifying as it may sound , pooping on the delivery table is actually a good thing . It tells us that you are pushing the right way . Yay ! You may be relieved to hear that your body naturally clears the way for baby before the active pushing stage , so if your nurse gives you the okay , visit the facilities during early labor . And to further put your mind at ease , know that I mean it when I say : your poop is really nothing special .
2 . You really do n't have to lie down
When you think about birth , what image comes to mind ? A woman in the semi-reclined position , sweating while screaming obscenities at her clueless husband , right ? Well , believe it or not , you do have a choice in the position that you deliver in . The whole semi-reclined thing came about more for doctors ' convenience than anything else . Listen to your body while you are in labor and go with what feels right to you . Depending on limitations from your form of pain relief ( like an epidural ) you may be able to deliver squatting , standing , side-lying , holding onto a bar , or even on all fours .
3 . Bring cookies
This one 's important , especially if you deliver at night . I 'm a night-shifter , and I can tell you right now that nothing gets a patient more on my top-priority list than the promise of chocolate-chip cookies at midnight . Put a kindly grandma on a grocery run for a post-delivery snack .
4 . Think of your birth plan as a birth guide
Nothing ruins a birth plan faster than trying to stick to it . The best births I 've seen are the ones with relaxed moms — moms who have a general idea of what they want but are also realistic and flexible when they need to be . A no-intervention , dimly-lit room with soft music and fresh flowers really is n't the goal , is it ?
5 . Shaving is optional
So maybe you 're a little hesitant to let it all hang out in front of what will seem like every doctor , nurse , and random housekeeper in the whole building . That 's understandable . But trust me when I say that preggo-scaping is really not necessary . Besides , who 's going to blame you for not shaving when you ca n't even see over that belly ? The same rule applies for painting your toenails .
6 . Do n't be alarmed if your doctor discussed lunch
… Or your nurse , or your midwife , or that person who draws your blood . There is something about sticking their hands up a woman 's crotch that always makes healthcare workers want to discuss their lunch plans . Weird , I know .
7 . That drape is kind of necessary
If you get a C-section and are worried that you 're missing out on the action , take my advice and just go with it . The things your doctor will be pulling out of your body can be quite shocking . And the re-arranging and re-insertion bit is not exactly pretty either . You may not be ready for the sight of your uterus , you know , outside your womb . Enjoy the blue view from above and focus on what really matters — your baby .
8 . If you 're cool enough , they 'll let you catch the baby
Play your cards right and we just might let you try on the catchers mitt . Show us you can handle it ( read : do n't pass out ) and promise not to sue us . Talk to your midwife or doctor during your prenatal check-ups if you think you might want to try your hand ( pun clearly intended ) at baby-catching . Or have Dad do his part . My husband delivered both of our girls . Coolest.Thing.Ever .
9 . Speak up for the important stuff
You do have a say in your labor and delivery . Whether you have your eye on that room with the whirlpool tub or the nurse who delivered your neighbor 's sister 's friend , you are entitled to the birth you want . But you have to let us know .
10 . The real reward comes after birth
Sure , your baby 's cute , but I 'm not talking about her . I 'm talking about that glorious , calorie-laden first post-delivery meal . Giving birth is like the best workout of your life . So go ahead , order the double bacon-cheeseburger with French fries and a chocolate milkshake . You deserve it .
11 . Find a focal point
You probably learned this in those childbirth classes you remember nothing from , but this one 's actually helpful and really easy . It goes something like this : Find something , anything , to look at during your contraction . Focus on that thing and that thing only through the contraction . Rinse and repeat .
12 . In this case , the hips can lie
I know there 's some old wives tale out there that promises to predict success in childbirth based on the size of one 's hips . But I 'm here to tell you that I 've seen an 80-pound woman push out a baby the size of a Thanksgiving dinner without so much as a Tylenol . Big hips do not necessarily an easy birth make .
13 . Sometimes , we let you sneak in booze
Hey , we 're happy for you too . We might just let you sneak in that beer to celebrate .
14 . What massacre ?
So a bloody battle happened between your legs , but thankfully you 'll never know . Labor and delivery nurses are quick on the draw when it comes to cleaning up the aftermath . Look for phrases like “ a little tear ” or “ a quick stitch ” for clues to what really happened down there . Hint : Use that squeegee bottle ( you 'll know it when you see it ) .
15 . You do n't have to breathe like that
Really , I 'm not sure where that whole hee-haw breathing while giving birth stuff originated . Do n't worry about doing it the “ right ” way . Some women breathe normally , some hold their breath . As long as those little alveoli in your lungs are receiving oxygen , we 're good .
16 . Think of it as a hall pass
You have permission to say exactly what you 've wanted to say to your partner all these years . Every balled-up dirty sock on the floor , every “ Honey , have you seen my wallet ? ” without even looking for it , every last little annoyance — all vented in the perfect cover-up of labor . Now is your chance to let it all out . Your secret is safe with me .
17 . Some women are screamers…
… and that 's ok . I 've seen timid wallflowers transform into raging rivals of ring wrestlers and even one strange case of a woman singing soprano . Hey , whatever it takes . That baby 's coming out one way or another .
18 . All women labor differently
Try not to listen to your neighbor , your great-aunt Mildred , or even your mom on this one . The fact is , no woman experiences childbirth the same way . My mother swore up and down that contractions were hard but pushing was painless . Fast forward a few months and after cruising through my contractions , I found myself cursing her as I pushed out what felt like a burning bowling ball of fire . You ca n't predict how labor and delivery will feel for you , so do n't even try .
19 . Yes , it 's a little awkward for us too
No , it does n't come naturally to us to stick our hands up where the sun do n't shine . In fact , I think that 's why so many of us are compelled to tell you about that awesome salad we ate for lunch ( nerves ) .
20 . Before you , there was Regina
If you 've ever wondered just how labor and delivery nurses learn to “ check ” their patients , allow me to introduce you to Regina . Regina is our resident vagina-in-a-box . We 've all paid a visit to Regina in the backroom before turning loose on real , unsuspecting patients . So next time you enjoy a quick and pain-free vaginal exam , just thank Regina .
21 . That said , you really ca n't shock labor and delivery nurses
From a patient watching The Jerry Springer Show while pushing , to a woman who lost her underwear in her girly parts , I 've seen it all . So fear not if you have Jekyll and Hyde tendencies when giving birth — we expect it .

BEST BURGER : Alewife
Housed in the Eutaw Savings Bank Building , Alewife does n't mess around when it comes to burgers .
They only serve one -- and that 's plenty .
The `` smoke burger '' is the creation of chef Chad Wells . Like any successful artist , he wanted to take what inspired him and outdo it . The smoke house does nothing conventional . It is a burger with an IQ , as complex as it is delicious . Eleven ounces of seamlessly combined strips of meat including : brisket , skirt and fillet beef .
The name is in tribute to the elements throughout the burger : Smoked Gouda , smoked chipotle mixed within aioli mayonnaise and the slabs of applewood bacon , twice smoked . It 's a process to prepare . But it 's worth it .
The burger is textural , with great flavor . Ketchup is not needed . The duck fries that accompany it are as rich as the burger . Hand cut and fried in duck fat , they are also tossed with garlic , marjoram , rosemary and salt .
Of the forty-some odd brews that rotate daily , the staff recommends something light to join the meal , nothing heavy , as the smoke burger will fill you up plenty .
Some 180 smoke burgers go out of the kitchen daily . In three weeks they expect to sell their 10,000th . And coming soon , Alewife plans to add `` the evil twin , '' the smoke burger 's doppelganger with crab meat . 21 N. Eutaw St. , Downtown

( Note : this post is ` just for fun ; ' no premeds , doctors , researchers , or nobel laureates were meant to be offended in the writing of this post . )
The bane of many American physics grad students is teaching introductory physics to premed students . Due to the nature of med school admissions , one ends up with classrooms full of students who can not afford to get anything less than an A+++ if they hope to make it to ( Ivy League ) Med School . Further , due to the nature of medicine , these students also approach physics as something that 's meant to be memorized by rote . Note to premeds : every time you ask your TA what the relevant formula is so that you can memorize it , you kill a fraction of that poor grad student 's soul .
Not all premeds are like this . In fact , it may be true that most are n't . But it sure needles the hell out of grad students when they have to teach those that are . It 's no surprise then , that there 's an uneasy tension between doctors and physicists .
So you 'll have to excuse me when I stuck out my tongue and blew a big raspberry to the medical community after I heard about the following paper :
A mathematical model for the determination of total area under glucose tolerance and other metabolic curves . M.M . Tai . Diabetes Care , Vol 17 , Issue 2 152-154
( Try removing the phrase “ glucose tolerance and other metabolic ” if you find that title daunting . ) I encourage you to take a quick look at the abstract , whose stated objective is this :
OBJECTIVE–To develop a mathematical model for the determination of total areas under curves from various metabolic studies . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS–In Tai 's Model , the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis ( abscissas ) into small segments ( rectangles and triangles ) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas .
Hint ! If you replace phrases like “ curves from metabolic studies ” with just “ curves , ” then you 'll note that Dr. Tai rediscovered the rectangle method of approximating an integral . ( Actually , Dr. Tai rediscovered the trapezoidal rule . ) To top it all off , Dr. Tai decided to name this “ Tai 's Model ” and the medical community cited this paper 75 times .
It 's highly possible that I 'm just an overly smug physicist , but I still find this especially amusing . No—it 's not an early April Fool 's gag . Nor does the abstract hint at any specialization of the basic mathematical tool ( summing the areas of rectangles ) beyond what is familar to any high school calculus student . Does n't second semester calculus start with estimating the areas under curves by drawing rectangles on graph paper ?
Okay , you might argue that unlike physicists , not everyone in the world takes calculus . Fine—but if you 're a scientific researcher dealing with numbers and data , I should hope that you 've had a complete high school mathematics curriculum . Is n't calculus required for med school , anyway ?
What I find really interesting is that the abstract notes that the Tai Model is significantly more accurate than other ` widely applied ' methods . What could these other ` widely applied ' methods have possibly been ?
I do n't mean to pick on Dr. Tai , especially since I only have access to the paper 's abstract . In fact , it 's perhaps a credit that s/he rediscovered the rectangle/trapezoidal method . Further and more seriously , this paper is perhaps an important example of the importance of interdisciplinary communication .
My more reasonable friends claim that this abstract is n't really as amusing as I make it out to be . And to be sure , they 're right .
Murray Gell-Mann developed the “ eight-fold way ” to explain the spectrum of hadrons in the 1960s . It was n't until after he 'd developed this formalism that he discussed his model with mathematicians , who then told him that he 'd rediscovered group ( representation ) theory . This ushered ina new era in the history of particle physics where symmetry became our guiding light and group theory became a necessary tool for any particle theorist . Though , to be fair , in the 1960s group theory—unlike calculus—was n't something that physicists were expected to take during high school .
Anyway , the lesson here ? It does n't hurt to keep in contact with your friends that are outside your professional field . Once in a while they might be able to tell you something useful .

I am a fourteen year old junior high student . I have been learning a lot about the presidential campaigns and have been watching some of the debates . I think that many of the candidates are very successful in lots of different ways .
In this game you will be able to interact with the candidates and learn more about them and their views . Check out the video promo I 've made to get a feel for what the game will look like . So far I 've made it so you talk with other people about the candidates , but the plot will be much more intricate and you take your role as the `` kingmaker '' to determine who the best candidate will be .
I have made many other video games and I have what it takes to release this game before March 1 , 2016 ( that 's Super Tuesday ! ) . The game will be available for a low price ( less than $ 5.00 ) because it 's for educational purposes .
Game play should take about 45 minutes . For the game to be produced we need $ 5,000 . This will cover buying digital resources and making sure that the game is in compliance with copyright rules . It will also help me use consultants to make sure everything is correct and will cover marketing and my salary . We have also set some Stretch Goals :
If we raise 8,000 $ we will include action sequences into the game . This means that you might get into a fight with a taxi driver or a bunch of ruffians .
If we raise 10,000 $ we will have cars that move around on the street , the people will also not wander in the street . It will be a lot more realistic . The character would also be able to drive a car .
If we raise 15,000 $ + there will be a debate scene with several of the candidates present .
With your help we will reach these Stretch Goals and build a successful game . Here are some screenshots from the game so far :

Throughout the country next year , Democrats running for Congress will try to tie every Republican they can find to President Trump .
But Republicans in Maryland 's 6th District believe they have a not-so-secret coat of armor to protect them from those attacks : Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) , who has repeatedly distanced himself from the president and maintains high approval ratings across party lines .
For the first time in a half­-­
century , there will be no incumbent seeking reelection to the seat that Rep. John Delaney ( D ) is giving up to run for president in 2020 .
That gives Republicans surveying a potentially dismal electoral map a rare chance to compete for an open seat in one of the more purple parts of Maryland , a mostly Democratic state whose eight-member congressional delegation includes only one Republican , Rep. Andy Harris .
HANDOUT - Amie Hoeber , of Potomac , Maryland is seeking the GOP nomination to run for a Montgomery County congressional seat ( Maryland ? s 6th district ) held Rep. John Delaney , who is not seeking reelection . ( Hoeber campaign ) ( N/A/Hoeber campaign )
At least three GOP candidates are running in the 6th District , while five Democrats are in the hunt for their party 's nomination .
The Republicans are Amie Hoeber , a defense contractor who challenged Delaney in 2016 ; Matt Mossburg , a former state delegate ; and Lisa Lloyd , a nurse practitioner from Potomac . The Democrats are Andrew Duck , a retired intelligence officer ; Nadia Hashimi , a pediatrician and novelist ; state Sen. Roger Manno ( D-Montgomery ) ; Del . Aruna Miller ( D-Montgomery ) ; and wine magnate David J. Trone , who spent an eye-popping $ 13.4 million of his own money last year on a losing House primary campaign in a neighboring district .
The serpentine 6th District stretches from the affluent — and more liberal — Washington suburbs in Montgomery County to more conservative counties reaching into Appalachia . Hillary Clinton won the district last year , while Hogan cleaned up three years ago with about 58 percent of the vote .
HANDOUT - Matt Mossberg is a candidate for Maryland 's 6th Congressional District . ( Mossburg for Maryland ) ( N/A/Mossburg for Maryland )
In 2012 , Delaney ousted longtime congressman Roscoe Bartlett ( R ) with an assist from a map redrawn to favor a Democrat — now the subject of a gerrymandering lawsuit that is on hold until the Supreme Court decides a similar case from Wisconsin .
Maryland Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathleen Matthews said the party is determined to hold onto the 6th District seat and is working to convince voters that Trump 's policies hurt western counties that rely on Medicaid expansion and rural aid programs , which he has stripped from his budget .
`` This is a president who , in large numbers , they voted for and he betrayed them , '' she said .
But Republican candidates say recent turnout models in the 6th District — plus the opportunity to link themselves to Hogan rather than Trump — give them a chance .
The 2012 presidential election drove Maryland Democrats to the polls , helping Delaney unseat Bartlett by double digits . Delaney won reelection by a slim margin two years later , an off-year election with a governor 's race that featured a lackluster Democratic candidate and generated a wave of Republican enthusiasm .
The 2018 contest again comes in a gubernatorial year , with Hogan on the ballot and no White House race . The National Republican Congressional Committee has put the 6th District on its list of targets .
`` Given the district 's performance in past off-year election cycles , a strong Republican candidate can certainly put it in play , '' NRCC spokesman Chris Martin said .

Before national funders would consider making an investment in the district , however , they will look for candidates who have an effective campaign team and fundraising network .
Hoeber raised $ 1.17 million last year , including $ 550,000 of her money , and garnered 40 percent of the vote against Delaney . ( In a Federal Election Commission complaint last year , Delaney accused her of illegally coordinating with a super PAC funded mostly by her husband . )
She has not reported fundraising for the 2018 race , campaign finance reports show . She plans to kick off her campaign Tuesday afternoon at a restaurant in Potomac .
Mossburg , who served in the General Assembly from 1994 to 1998 , has raised $ 5,501 and loaned himself $ 5,038 , with $ 4,171 in cash available , reports show . The Frederick resident is presenting himself as the conservative voice and an underdog in a race in which Hoeber and several Democrats are able to tap their personal wealth for campaign resources .
He said he has been in recovery from opioid addiction for about four years , making him uniquely qualified to tackle a crisis gripping the state .
`` It really does take someone who 's going through recovery to bring that wisdom of addiction from a firsthand experience , '' Mossburg said .
Lloyd , whose campaign finance report was not online as of Friday , said she is concerned about federal government overreach into education at all levels and worried about Maryland schools failing to prepare children for life after graduation .
Hogan expects to stay out of the GOP primary in the 6th District , his spokesman said , but Hoeber is reminding voters that the governor backed her over Delaney in the 2016 general election .

Hoeber said she plans to focus her campaign on economic development , transportation and the opioid crisis . And she took a jab at Trone , whose deep pockets and 2016 run for Congress have garnered him considerable attention at this early stage .
`` I 'm not like Trone where I 'm just shopping for a seat , '' Hoeber said . `` I 'm running because I understand this district well . And I think I can do the best job for it . ''
Trone spokesman Alex Koren criticized Hoeber for accepting donations from lobbyists and super PACs last year and said , `` David is flattered that Amie Hoeber is focused on him rather than winning her own primary . ''
Koren said Trone will follow Delaney 's model of focusing on `` policy over politics and bringing Democrats and Republicans together to get things done . ''
Trone has given his campaign $ 748,939 so far , but he also raised $ 43,076 from donors , more than in the entire primary last year . He is spending at a fast clip as well .
Miller raised $ 559,879 over two quarters , leaving her with $ 525,176 in cash — the most of any Democrat at this point . She is backed by Emily 's List , which funds female candidates who support abortion rights .
In an interview , Miller said she wants to create jobs in alternative energy industries to make up for losses from the fracking ban , which she co-sponsored in the legislature . She is working on a bill to provide funding and training to make computer science and coding classes available in schools .
Andrew Duck ( D ) is running for Congress in Md . ( N/A/Duck for Congress )
Manno , who has announced a string of labor endorsements in recent weeks , raised $ 202,165 , and has $ 170,778 in cash . A state lawmaker since 2007 , he has touted his experience working as a Capitol Hill policy staff member when the Affordable Care Act passed .
`` It 's a very hard time for people who pay the bills . '' he said . `` They need a tenacious , skillful and passionate advocate working on their behalf in a Congress that 's broken . ''
Duck , who twice ran for the seat when it was firmly in Republican hands , has $ 11,013 in the bank . Hashimi has raised $ 61,057 so far and loaned her campaign $ 225,000 , leaving her with $ 281,125 in cash .
The primary is June 26 .
President Obama may be trailing Mitt Romney in the polls on who 'd do a better job fixing the economy .
But if the Earth ever is attacked by hostile beings from another planet , a strong majority of voters believe Mr. Obama would be superior in dealing with the situation .
In what may be our favorite polling question of the campaign so far , a survey by the National Geographic Channel , first reported by USA Today , finds that 65 percent of Americans say Obama would be better suited than Mr. Romney to handle an alien invasion .
And lest you are tempted to dismiss this poll as pure silliness , the study also found that 36 percent of Americans think UFOs exist , while another 48 percent are n't sure . Which means that at least some of the respondents judging the presidential candidates ' alien-fighting abilities may see it as a plausible scenario . ( According to the poll , 79 percent also say the federal government has been hiding information about UFOs from the public – which may actually say more about the public 's overall distrust of government than its views on aliens . )
Even for those who do n't really think aliens might attack Earth , we say it 's an interesting poll question – essentially prodding which candidate voters would prefer at the helm in the case of a sudden , terrifying crisis that threatens the world 's very existence .
Or , to put it another way , it 's kind of like asking voters which candidate has more Will Smith in him ? Who 'd be more likely to bring down an enemy spacecraft , charge over to the wreckage , and punch the alien in the face ?
For most Americans , the answer seems to be Obama .
Of course , part of Obama 's edge here may come from incumbency . He 's already the president , so voters are automatically more inclined to see him as a wartime leader . Obama 's foreign policy ratings in general have been a source of strength for him . This is the guy who took down Osama bin Laden , after all –so why not aliens ?
On the other hand , it 's worth pointing out that in the most recent Gallup poll , Obama and Romney were essentially tied on the measurement of who is a “ strong and decisive leader , ” with 53 percent of respondents saying Obama was , and 55 percent saying Romney was .
Still , it seems being a strong leader is n't exactly the same thing as defending the nation against aliens .

Delving further into the alien-fighting scenario , the National Geographic survey also probed the key question of sidekicks . Who would Americans want at their side in an alien attack ? According to the poll , 8 percent chose Spider-Man , 12 percent said Batman , and a full 21 percent chose the Hulk .
Hmmm . Maybe Romney should pick New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie as his running mate , after all .
The history of JavaScript benchmarks is a story of constant evolution . As the web expanded from simple documents to dynamic client-side applications , new JavaScript benchmarks were created to measure workloads that became important for new use cases . This constant change has given individual benchmarks finite lifespans . As web browser and virtual machine ( VM ) implementations begin to over-optimize for specific test cases , benchmarks themselves cease to become effective proxies for their original use cases . One of the first JavaScript benchmarks , SunSpider , provided early incentives for shipping fast optimizing compilers . However , as VM engineers uncovered the limitations of microbenchmarks and found new ways to optimize around SunSpider 's limitations , the browser community retired SunSpider as a recommended benchmark .
The genesis of Octane #
Designed to mitigate some of the weaknesses of early microbenchmarks , the Octane benchmark suite was first released in 2012 . It evolved from an earlier set of simple V8 test cases and became a common benchmark for general web performance . Octane consists of 17 different tests , which were designed to cover a variety of different workloads , ranging from Martin Richards ' kernel simulation test to a version of Microsoft 's TypeScript compiler compiling itself . The contents of Octane represented the prevailing wisdom around measuring JavaScript performance at the time of its creation .
Diminishing returns and over-optimization #
In the first few years after its release , Octane provided a unique value to the JavaScript VM ecosystem . It allowed engines , including V8 , to optimize their performance for a class of applications that stressed peak performance . These CPU-intensive workloads were initially underserviced by VM implementations . Octane helped engine developers deliver optimizations that allowed computationally-heavy applications to reach speeds that made JavaScript a viable alternative to C++ or Java . In addition , Octane drove improvements in garbage collection which helped web browsers avoid long or unpredictable pauses .
By 2015 , however , most JavaScript implementations had implemented the compiler optimizations needed to achieve high scores on Octane . Striving for even higher benchmark scores on Octane translated into increasingly-marginal improvements in the performance of real web pages . Investigations into the execution profile of running Octane versus loading common websites ( such as Facebook , Twitter , or Wikipedia ) revealed that the benchmark does n't exercise V8 's parser or the browser loading stack the way real-world code does . Moreover , the style of Octane 's JavaScript does n't match the idioms and patterns employed by most modern frameworks and libraries ( not to mention transpiled code or newer ES2015+ language features ) . This means that using Octane to measure V8 performance did n't capture important use cases for the modern web , such as loading frameworks quickly , supporting large applications with new patterns of state management , or ensuring that ES2015+ features are as fast as their ES5 equivalents .
In addition , we began to notice that JavaScript optimizations which eked out higher Octane scores often had a detrimental effect on real-world scenarios . Octane encourages aggressive inlining to minimize the overhead of function calls , but inlining strategies that are tailored to Octane have led to regressions from increased compilation costs and higher memory usage in real-world use cases . Even when an optimization may be genuinely useful in the real-world , as is the case with dynamic pretenuring , chasing higher Octane scores can result in developing overly-specific heuristics which have little effect or even degrade performance in more generic cases . We found that Octane-derived pretenuring heuristics led to performance degradations in modern frameworks such as Ember . The instanceof operator was another example of an optimization tailored to a narrow set of Octane-specific cases that led to significant regressions in Node.js applications .
Another problem is that over time , small bugs in Octane become a target for optimizations themselves . For example , in the Box2DWeb benchmark , taking advantage of a bug where two objects were compared using the < and > = operators gave a ~15 % performance boost on Octane . Unfortunately , this optimization had no effect in the real world and complicates more general types of comparison optimizations . Octane sometimes even negatively penalizes real-world optimizations : engineers working on other VMs have noticed that Octane seems to penalize lazy parsing , a technique that helps most real websites load faster given the amount of dead code frequently found in the wild .
Beyond Octane and other synthetic benchmarks #
These examples are just some of the many optimizations which increased Octane scores to the detriment of running real websites . Unfortunately , similar issues exist in other static or synthetic benchmarks , including Kraken and JetStream . Simply put , such benchmarks are insufficient methods of measuring real-world speed and create incentives for VM engineers to over-optimize narrow use cases and under-optimize generic cases , slowing down JavaScript code in the wild .
Given the plateau in scores across most JS VMs and the increasing conflict between optimizing for specific Octane benchmarks rather than implementing speedups for a broader range of real-world code , we believe that it is time to retire Octane as a recommended benchmark .
Octane enabled the JS ecosystem to make large gains in computationally-expensive JavaScript . The next frontier , however , is improving the performance of real web pages , modern libraries , frameworks , ES2015+ language features , new patterns of state management , immutable object allocation , and module bundling . Since V8 runs in many environments , including server side in Node.js , we are also investing time in understanding real-world Node applications and measuring server-side JavaScript performance through workloads such as AcmeAir .
Check back here for more posts about improvements in our measurement methodology and new workloads that better represent real-world performance . We are excited to continue pursuing the performance that matters most to users and developers !

Some public figures end up popularizing their favorite fashions ; a select few have their fashions named after them . That was the case for Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , who effectively took India 's reins from none other than Gandhi ( his mentor ) as the first Prime Minister of a free India . Hardly reminiscent of Gandhi 's famous homespun clothing , the Nehru jacket is a descendant of the northern Indian achkan , a closed-neck , coatlike garment usually considered court dress for Indian nobility . Indeed , it was when the jacket was marketed to Western audiences that it took the `` Nehru '' title , the charismatic Prime Minister having popularized its style in public appearances during his tenure in government . Nehru was n't the only prominent figure associated with it ; the minimalist aesthetic of the jacket inspired the likes of the Beatles ( who wore the style at their Shea Stadium performance ) as well as Sammy Davis Jr. , who claimed to own more than 200 of the jackets .

New head coach Patrick Kisnorbo is adding his own influence to Melbourne City with a host of new signings .
Melbourne City have added to their team with the experienced W-League campaigner Rhali Dobson .
A Newcastle Jets foundation player , the pacy 25 year old makes move from her hometown club after making 55 appearances over nine seasons .
`` When I first spoke with Patrick and the staff at City , I knew it was the right time for me to take on a new challenge , '' said Dobson explained .
`` The opportunity to continue my career in a highly professional environment with such a talented group of players is incredibly exciting . I ca n't wait to get started and contribute to the team 's effort to win another Championship this season. ” Rhali Dobson
“ Rhali is a talented forward who has great experience playing in the W-League during her time with Newcastle , '' said Kisnorbo .
`` Her pace and energy will provide us with an added dimension in attack and she is a fantastic addition to our playing group . ”
As well as the experience , Kisnorbo has signed two promising young players in attacking midfielder Sofia Sakalis and defender Hayley Richmond .
Junior Matilda Sakalis joins the club after recently competing at the AFC U16 Championships scoring one goal in the tournament . The talented 15 year old is considered one of the best young prospects in the country .
Meanwhile defender Hayley Richmond signed onto the senior squad after a season as a train on player .
Following the departure of Teigen Allen . the Young Matildas defender provides versatility as a full back or centre back as required . If selected for the Young Matildas , Richmond would miss the first week of the season with the AFC U19 Championships to be held in mid to late October 2017 .
“ Hayley and Sofia are both exciting prospects who have international experience within the Young Matildas and Junior Matildas setup , '' said Kisnorbo .

Some of the nation 's leading social conservatives are openly expressing dismay about the Republican strategy to reclaim the U.S. Senate as the 2014 midterm campaign hurdles into the homestretch .
As the annual Values Voter Summit convenes in the District of Columbia this weekend , there 's a distinct sense among faith-driven leaders that pockets of their base remain uninspired by some of the candidates who are crucial to GOP success in November . The feeling of foreboding stems from a perception that Republican standard-bearers in key races are taking social conservatives for granted to cater to the highly prized independent voters who often swing margin-of-error contests .
“ Not all of the races have a strong conservative candidate in it . There is a lack of intensity in some places , ” says Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council . “ The more the candidates are encouraged to run to the middle to attract independents , they leave their base at home . ”

Gary Bauer , who unsuccessfully contested the 2000 GOP presidential nomination and currently serves as president of the conservative non-profit American Values , says the Republican establishment has again mistakenly settled on avoiding social issues to keep attention focused solely on the economy .
“ Campaigns only run on economic issues , I think we 've seen repeatedly , do not work for the Republican Party . [ Mitt ] Romney ran a campaign 99 percent on the economy , and the economy sucked and Barack Obama won re-election handily , ” he says .
In a concerted effort to blunt Democratic attacks portraying Republican candidates as hostile to women , a cadre of GOP Senate candidates have in recent weeks backed over-the-counter access to birth control . Despite some evidence of success with the tactic , Bauer dubs the strategy “ silly . ”
“ The availability of birth control , the whole issue is ridiculous . If there 's somebody in America that ca n't readily get birth control , I 've never met them . There 's more birth control available for more people at more ages than ever in our history . I do n't even understand why that 's taken as a serious issue , ” he says . “ I think it 's a silly strategy and I do n't think in the real world it does anything plus or minus . I think it 's an ineffectual tactic . They all have the same political consultant advising them and he needs to go back to the drawing board . ”
Perkins echoed that sentiment , calling the birth control play “ foolish , ” particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling in the Hobby Lobby case that dealt conservatives a win for religious liberty . The high court found in June that for-profit corporations do not have to provide certain types of contraceptives to their employees if doing so violates the employers ' personal religious beliefs .
“ Why go back and relitigate that and undermine it ? ” Perkins asks . “ It 's almost snatching defeat from the jaws of victory . The Democrats have found something that works with these moderate Republicans . They say ‘ Boo ! War on women ! ' And they jump , instead of standing their ground and being on the offense against a president who has amassed a dismal record . ”
Perkins and others believe Republicans should be beating the drum of a consistent national message with a particular emphasis on the country 's security in the wake of a reemerging terrorism threat .
“ Right now , I think the elections are still relatively local , they have n't been nationalized . It 's to the benefit of Republicans if these races become national , ” Perkins says .
Kelly Shackelford , the president of the Liberty Institute in Plano , Texas , is likewise concerned the GOP slate of candidates is missing an opportunity to craft a cohesive , unified message around security at home and freedom from government overreach .

“ I do n't see it . It looks like they 're trying to run out the clock instead of have a positive message of all this together . I do n't see the messaging with them connecting the dots . I just have n't seen that or I think they 'd be further ahead , ” he says . “ Letting every race be a local race , that 's usually a mistake . ”
Republicans need six seats to wrest control of the U.S. Senate away from Democrats and most prognosticators believe they are narrowly favored to complete the task , although social conservatives are increasingly apprehensive about their chances . Part of the lingering anxiety emanates from their searing 2012 election experience , when some polls pointed to Republican victories in the presidential race and several Senate contests that never came to be .
While recent surveys show the GOP is enjoying the traditional partisan enthusiasm gap in a midterm , there 's also evidence that fewer voters are engaged this year than in 2010 .
According to a recent CBS/New York Times survey , six in 10 are paying some attention to the upcoming election . Four years ago , when Republicans produced historic gains at all ballot levels , that number was at more than seven in 10 in September . Additionally , nearly half of registered voters say they are less enthusiastic than usual about voting compared to previous midterm elections .

This weekend 's Values Voter Summit will ostensibly attempt to raise the stakes of the midterms , with potential presidential aspirants such as Gov . Bobby Jindal , R-La. , Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum all slated to speak .
Ralph Reed , chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition , sees the polls showing an intensity gap favoring Republicans , but says he hears “ anecdotally that some social conservatives are not as motivated as they were in 2010 and 2012 . ”
“ I think the Senate is a jump ball , ” he says . “ The Republicans are sitting on a 3 to 4-seat pickup right now . The last two will depend on how the ball bounces at the end . ”
Without a fully invigorated base behind them , Perkins envisions the possibility of the grand old party once again falling short of great expectations .
“ The Republicans , like Romney , stepped over the base . You see Republicans running those same plays again , ” he says .
Most of the language features that were introduced with the C++11 Standard are easy to learn , and the benefit that they provide is quite obvious . Looking at them does n't make you think , `` Oh no , now I 'm going to have to learn this . '' Instead , your immediate reaction is , `` Oh great , I 've always wanted that . '' In some cases , like lambdas , the syntax is a bit hairy , but that 's of course not much of a problem . For me , the one big exception to all these were rvalue references . I had a really hard time wrapping my head around those . Therefore , I did what I always do when I need to understand something : I scraped up all the information I could get my hands on , then wrote an article on the subject . It turned out that a lot of people were having the same problem , and the article helped quite a few of them . Great , everybody 's happy . A while later , sometime in 2012 , I noticed that there was another feature , or rather , a pair of features , in C++11 that I had not fully understood , namely , the auto and decltype keywords . With auto and decltype , unlike rvalue references , the problem is not that they are difficult to grasp . On the contrary , the problem is that the idea is deceptively easy , yet there are hidden subtleties that can trip you up . Let 's start with a good look at the auto keyword .
Archaeology 's taking to the air . Researchers spent a month this summer testing a semi-autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle—basically a semi-autonomous drone—high in the Andes in Peru . The goal : to scan a colonial town from the 1500s that had been built over an Incan settlement , and then abandoned .
It 's a collaboration between Vanderbilt University archaeologist Steven Wernke and engineering professor Julie Adams . Adams tricked out a vehicle from Aurora Flight Sciences to include cameras and algorithms that allow the drone to achieve optimal flight patterns . The resulting detailed 3-D map will be much more precise than high-resolution satellite images .
Here 's Steven Wernke : “ By our calculations this vehicle will be able to take imagery of an area in about 10-15 minutes that would take two or three entire field seasons using traditional methods . ”
The system can fit into a backpack . Once the researchers incorporate what they learned , they hope the technology can assist in the rapid cataloguing of a variety of archaeological sites , some of which are already being lost to the ravages of new developments and time .

President-electsought to cast himself as a unifier in his victory speech early Wednesday morning , calling for all Americans to come together to `` bind the wounds of division . ''
`` To all Democrats , Republicans , independents across this nation , I say it is time for us to come together as one united people , '' Trump said , taking the stage just before 3 a.m. after walking out to the score from the movie `` Air Force One . ''
`` For those who chose not to support me in the past , of which there are a few people , I 'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can reach out and unify our great country . ''
Trump became president-elect after a stunning string of victories in almost every major swing state , threading the needle on what many political pundits had deemed an impossible path to 270 electoral votes .
While the conversation in recent weeks had centered on whether he would concede if he lost , Trump addressed his supporters at the New York Hilton Midtown with more than 270 electoral votes in the bag and more potentially on the way .
`` Hillary has worked very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt for her service to our country , '' Trump said .
`` I mean that sincerely , '' he added , a nod to the contentious rhetoric on the campaign trail that led to him labeling her `` Crooked Hillary '' and calling on her to be put in prison .
Then , the real estate mogul sought to show he will be willing to work with others in his administration .

MOSCOW — As dusk fell , nine young men gathered on a leafy street in Chertanova , a bedroom community on the outskirts of Moscow . Their hair cropped short , some put on surgical masks and thick work gloves . Aleksei Khudyakov , their leader , issued final instructions like a platoon leader briefing his soldiers for a raid .
“ The dorms where they live are on the other side of the building , ” Mr. Khudyakov , 25 , explained as his cadre shuffled with anticipation .
“ They ” are the latest target of political and popular outrage here : unregistered immigrant workers , especially those from former Soviet republics like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan . And Mr. Khudyakov 's team intended to catch them where they slept .
“ We 're going to go in , ” he told the group , half warning and half pleading with them to refrain from violence or even foul language , “ but we 're not going to be rude . I do n't want to see aggression . ”
WASHINGTON -- The Republicans bent on defunding Obamacare or shutting down the government are `` fanatics '' with a `` Thelma and Louise '' -like mission to drive the nation off a cliff , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) said Monday .
The federal government will run out of money after Sept. 30 if Congress does not act by then to authorize more spending . Rather than simply do that , the House of Representatives last week passed a bill that would keep federal offices running only if the Senate and White House agreed to defund the Affordable Care Act . Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama are refusing to give in to that demand .
In his opening Senate floor remarks Monday afternoon , Reid said the only people who actually want Obamacare defunded are extremists .
He pointed to polls that have found broad support for most elements of the health care law and noted that many Senate Republicans think using a government shutdown to try to defund the law is a terrible idea .
`` Are Republicans so intent on undermining both President Obama and his signature health care law that they 're willing to inflict severe damage to our economy in the process ? '' Reid said . `` America will know exactly who to blame : Republican fanatics in the House and the Senate . ''
`` Two dozen Senate Republicans have spoken out against this foolhardy plan to drive the economy off the cliff -- two dozen , '' Reid added . `` This 'Thelma and Louise ' style just is n't getting the attention of the American people in a positive tone . If Democrats do n't bow to every demand they [ tea party Republicans ] have , they want to go right over the cliff . Well , we 're not going to go with them . ''
Reid said the Senate will deal with the House 's continuing resolution -- as the spending bill is called -- and send it back to the House as quickly as possible .

A Kentucky police officer has been named in a federal lawsuit filed Monday alleging that he illegally handcuffed and restrained two elementary school students with disabilities . According to the lawsuit , Kenton County Deputy Sheriff Kevin Sumner , a school resource officer assigned to the Covington Independent Public Schools district , used handcuffs last fall to restrain an 8-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl , placing the cuffs on their biceps behind their backs . Sumner allegedly did so after the students failed to comply with directions given by school authorities . Both students had previously been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and the boy had also been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , according to the lawsuit , which was filed on behalf of the students by the Children 's Law Center in Kentucky , Dinsmore & Shohl , and the American Civil Liberties Union . The suit alleges Sumner violated the students ' civil rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act .
Two videos accompanying the lawsuit show a November 2014 incident in which Sumner tells an 8-year-old Latino student , identified as S.R . in the lawsuit , to “ Sit down like I asked you to ” while handcuffing him as the child cries and expresses that he 's in pain . Earlier that year , Sumner allegedly detained L.G. , a 9-year-old African American student , in the back of his cruiser , after she disrupted the classroom and was requested to be escorted to an in-school suspension room . The lawsuit also details two subsequent incidents in which Sumner handcuffed L.G. , one of which resulted in L.G . going to a hospital for psychiatric assessment and treatment .
The lawsuit comes amid growing concerns about the conduct of police officers serving inside the nation 's K-12 schools ; as Mother Jones reported recently , in the last five years at least 28 students have been seriously injured , and one student killed , by school cops . The lawsuit underscores the gaps in oversight and inadequate training for officers assigned to schools , as well as the disproportionate impact of school policing on students of color .
Kenton County Chief Deputy Pat Morgan told Mother Jones that the sheriff 's office has reviewed the incidents involving the two students . Morgan said he does not consider handcuffing to be a use of force that would be subject to an internal investigation , but he declined to comment further on the case , pending review of the lawsuit by attorneys for the sheriff 's office . Previous court rulings have found that handcuffing can constitute excessive force .
In a statement to press , Debra Vance , the director of communications for Covington Independent Public Schools , said that she could not speak about the case specifically due to student privacy concerns , but added that school resource officers “ are not called upon by school district staff to punish or discipline a student who engages in a school-related offense . ”
Update , August 10 : This post has been updated with comments from Luigino Bracci Roa , whose Twitter account was closed down . Ars is still waiting for Twitter 's response to multiple requests for further information .
Original story
Venezuelan free software activist Luigino Bracci Roa has claimed that his Twitter account was closed down permanently by the US company without any prior warning , after the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) complained about videos he had posted on the micro-blogging service .
The @ Lubrio account was popular : Bracci says that he tweeted 133,000 times since he created the account in 2008 , and had garnered nearly 43,000 followers in that time .
On his blog , Bracci shared the letters of complaint sent by the IOC to Twitter , which show that the committee did not demand that his account be shut down , but instead asked Twitter to `` immediately and permanently remove the material '' from its website . That 's hardly surprising given the IOC 's attempts to impose strict controls on all media outlets and how they use material connected with the Olympics .
Ars has sent several requests for clarification from Twitter , asking why the account was permanently shuttered in this way , and without warning , but it was yet to respond at time of publication .
In an e-mail , Bracci told Ars he had tried three times to have his suspension revoked : `` Unfortunately , I 've received two automatic answers , telling me that 'Your account has been permanently suspended due to a violation of copyright Policy ' . He added that if he had received a warning rather than a permanent suspension , he would have deleted the videos immediately .
In his blog post , Bracci claims that under Venezuelan law the seven short videos—all under 90 seconds in length—were legal , although a long comment on the post disputes this . Ars has asked Twitter to clarify how it decides whether content posted in jurisdictions outside the US contravenes its copyright policy , but has not yet received an answer . Bracci points out : `` I ca n't take legal actions against a company that is not established in my country , '' since Twitter has no office in Venezuela .
Bracci also contrasted the harsh punishment meted out to him simply for posting videos with the situation regarding what he says are hundreds of Twitter accounts that made death threats against the current Venezuelan president , Nicolás Maduro , and supporters of his predecessor , Hugo Chávez .
In an earlier blog post , Bracci reproduced dozens of tweets that appear to threaten people , or post their personal details , all in contravention of Twitter 's official rules . Bracci told Ars : `` It is 'normal ' to see some Twitter accounts making death threats against Venezuelan left-wing people , or against supporters of the Venezuelan government . You can use the Twitter search feature to find phrases like 'matar chavistas ' ( kill Chavez 's supporters ) , and you will find hundreds of matches . ''
Bracci says that `` many affected users filed claims using the tools provided by Twitter , without success . '' Ars has asked Twitter what action it took against this abuse of its service in Venezuela , and is awaiting a response . As Bracci wrote to Ars :
What is more difficult ? Design an algorithm to detect when someone uploads an unauthorized video from the Olympic Games ? Or design an algorithm to detect when someone tweets death threads against a person , or a group ? It 's unacceptable that the copyright of corporations is considered more important that some human rights , like the freedom of speech , our personal data or our privacy .
Although Bracci calls Twitter 's action a `` vulgar act of censorship , '' the episode is really about the power of companies to impose arbitrary rules and to act pretty much as they wish , since users of their services have little choice but to accept both . Bracci 's case also raises the important issue of jurisdiction—how global online services implement their rules against the background of differing local laws .
Indonesian Military ( TNI ) commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo said his side planned to improve the distribution of personnel across the country 's territories , especially in the eastern part of Indonesia , including in Papua .
`` We hope military personnel and military bases are no longer concentrated around Java , but also in the border areas so that those [ bases ] help create new economic centers and trigger development , '' Gatot was quoted as saying by Antara on Thursday at TNI headquarters in Cilangkap , East Jakarta .
When asked to give further details about the plan , Gatot said the TNI would focus on distributing naval personnel first , while the expansion of Army and Air Force bases had yet to be planned .
( Read also : Indonesia reinforces its command over Natuna waters through military bases )
`` Currently , the TNI has only been focused on [ developing ] the Eastern Fleet . We need to establish a new fleet in Papua , '' Gatot added .
Currently , the TNI has the Eastern Fleet based in Surabaya and Western Fleet in Jakarta . ( dmr )
As Cubing becomes increasingly popular , more players are looking for an accessible entry point to the hobby . “ Set Cubes ” —Cubes constructed using only cards from a given set or block—are an appealing option to newcomers and a less daunting alternative to building a traditional Cube from scratch .
Unfortunately , anyone looking for advice about set cubes is barraged by conflicting information .
Graham Stark , of LoadingReadyRun and Strip Search fame , announced his plans for a Modern Masters set Cube , and the peanut gallery started chiming in with suggestions .
A 3/2/1 common/uncommon/rare ratio .
4/2/1 .
5/3/1 .
What 's the right answer ?
I 've never been a proponent to adhering to strict design rules , but do recommend that designers learn the rules before they break them . All of the above ratios will produce a different gameplay experience , and all of them deviate from the ratios present in a retail set like Modern Masters . If we do n't know what the standard is , we ca n't know how our choices deviate from the norm , and how those deviations affect the drafting environment .
The Retail Ratio
In modern Magic design , the cookie-cutter large set release contains 249 unique cards : 101 commons , 60 uncommons , 53 rares , 15 mythics , and 20 basic lands . In terms of pack distribution , mythics occupy the same slot as rares , and each mythic occurs at about half the rarity of a rare .
This means that over the course of 60 packs ( ignoring foils ) , we would expect to open about 53 rares and 7 mythics .
For the sake of simplicity , we can think of a set as having 100 unique commons , 60 uncommons , and 60 “ rares . ”
Further , an 8-player draft will have 240 common cards , 72 uncommon cards , and 24 rare cards ( 24 boosters with 10 commons , 3 uncommons , and 1 rare each , again ignoring foils ) .
Put it all together and we have the following :
A 6/3/1 ratio .
Next , there are two main questions that will dictate how you proceed :
• Do you want to stick to the retail rarity ratios ?
• How do you want to create your Cube packs ? Do you want to shuffle all the cards together in one big pile , or create packs with fixed rarity distributions ( i.e . packs with 10 commons , 3 unncommons , 1 rare or mythic ) ?
Method 1 : Retail Replication ( Packing )
This method is for players who want to perfectly recreate the experience of a retail draft , without the hassle of having to buy packs every time you want to draft . The approach is simple . Before the draft , separate your cards into three piles : commons , uncommons , and rares/mythics . Then create each pack by taking ten commons , three uncommons , and one rare/mythic card . Draft as usual .
The first advantage to this method is that you guarantee an even rarity distribution within your packs . The second , and more hidden advantage is that you need fewer cards . Since you are collating packs , you can achieve that perfect 6/3/1 ratio with as little as the following :
300 commons ( 3 of each )
120 uncommons ( 2 of each )
53 rares and 15 mythics ( 1 of each )
The biggest difference between this method and retail drafts is that you limit the variability of your draft pools if you only have 3 copies of each common . The expected number of copies of each common in a retail draft is 2.4 copies , but individual cards will often appear 4 or more times in an 8-man pod .
The approximate probability distribution of number of copies of a common card in a retail draft is as follows :
In total there 's about a 22 % chance that you 'll see a given common 4 or more times in a triple-large-set retail draft . Naturally , the more complete sets of commons you have ( say , 5 or 6 sets ) , the closer your drafts will reflect the variability of a retail draft , but the gains are relatively marginal . If you 're looking to scrape by with the minimum number , three of each common will certainly suffice .
As for disadvantages , sorting the cards into rarity piles can be a little tedious . More importantly , it 's hard to play with the rarity ratios within this “ packing by rarity ” method . I 've seen players use an 11th common or a 4th uncommon in the pack , but it gets trickier if you want , say , 20 % more rares in your environment .
Method 2 : One Big Pile
Speaking of including more rares…
The “ one big pile ” method consists of gathering a selection of cards and shuffling them together for a traditional style Cube draft . Of course , this method has no guarantee on each pack containing a rare or mythic , but it also allows the designer to play with numbers much more easily .
Assuming that you are using 360-card draft pools , here are the average number of cards you will see in a draft using an approximate retail ratio ( 6/3/1/1 ) and two ratios proposed in the Graham Stark tweet at the top of the article .
The most important thing to realize is that by tweaking these numbers , we can dramatically alter the feel of the environment , and not always for the better . For example , below are Return to Ravnica ‘ s converted mana cost curves by rarity :
At a glance , we see that the common and uncommon curves roughly approximate what we would expect to see as a deck 's curve . The rares and mythics are much more top-heavy . As we mix in more rares , we create an increasingly “ bomby ” environment .
The overall curve of the environment 's cards wo n't change all that much , but it 's important to keep in mind the distinction between rares and commons . Bombs are most frequently printed at the higher rarities , whereas the bulk of a set 's removal will ( thankfully ) be at common or uncommon . As we shift the ratios toward more rares and fewer commons , the equilibrium between bombs and removal shifts as well .
The result is a move towards what is known in the Cubing community as “ Dragon Magic : ” games that are defined more by raw card power finishers than by interactive game play . With more costly bombs floating around , there are more cards that help slower decks stabilize , potentially making life more difficult for aggressive decks .
The downside to this method is that in order to get anywhere close to a reasonable ratio between commons and rares , you 'll need a lot of commons and all accompanying sleeves . A 6/3/1/1 distributed pile requires a full 600 commons and 180 uncommons .
Method 3 : The Hybrid
Lastly , there 's a hybrid method that combines the design flexibility of the “ one big pile ” method with the low card count requirements of the “ packing ” method . Let 's say I wanted my 360-card drafts to contain 240 commons , 90 uncommons , and 30 rares/mythics . With the hybrid method , we could do the following :
Before the draft , separate our cards into three piles : commons , uncommons , and rares/mythics . Then , grab the appropriate number of cards from each pile , and shuffle together the resulting 360 cards to draft .
Note that the packs wo n't have perfectly balanced rarity distribution . The major benefit here is that we can easily tweak the numbers from draft to draft . Decide 30 rares is too few ? Grab a couple more the next time around .
This method is also quite well-suited to getting a proper rarity distribution in full-block Cubes . For a full Return to Ravnica block draft , one could use 1-2 of each common , and a single copy of every uncommon , rare , and mythic .
As a practical tip , I recommend having your players rarity sort their decks into piles at the end of each draft to minimize prep work for the next draft .
Tweaking a Pile
Retail sets must serve a wide variety of masters . They must provide the cards to keep Standard metagames churning . They have to be sufficiently accessible for New World Order . They must entice Commander players , and have a positive impact on the financial bottom line .
Each of these is tangential at best to the process of creating a great Limited environment . Game-ruining bombs meant for Constructed play are tucked away at higher rarities , but still enter the fold . Unplayable chaff pads the packs alongside cards that wo n't see play outside of an EDH table .
Even the best of sets could provide better gameplay if the draft environment were the sole concern . As a set Cube designer , you can disregard all the constraints that guide Wizards ' designs . Wish there were more removal ? Consider the Izzet guild underpowered ? Think [ card ] Pack Rat [ /card ] was a massive mistake ? Make some changes !
A set Cube provides the perfect opportunity to test your design chops in a controlled setting . The set has already been made , all you need to do is provide small tweaks to an existing design .
Personal Recommendations
When designing a set Cube , consider following modifications :
1 ) Trim the edges
Cards like [ card ] Umezawa 's Jitte [ /card ] do n't really have a place at a low-level draft table , and are typically greater sources of frustration than fun . Although one of the appeals of drafting is seeing what rares you 'll crack each draft , some cards push things a bit too far . I 'd take a hard look at the Jittes and [ card ] Pack Rat [ /card ] s of the set .
On the other end of the spectrum , cards like [ card ] Darksteel Forge [ /card ] will never escape the sideboard of an M14 deck . Worse , you do n't even get the joy of rare-drafting in a set Cube .
2 ) Consider adding fixing
Retail sets are often a little light on fixing for my taste . A little bit of fixing goes a long way , with fewer games ending in color screw , and more room to experiment as a drafter . I certainly would n't complain if I saw a sprinking of shocklands in somebody 's Modern Masters cube .
3 ) Adjusting aggro
If you 're upping the density of rares , make sure your lower converted mana cost decks remain competitive . The obvious route is to increase the density of powerful aggressive cards . Another option is to look at the assortment of removal spells you are using . A [ card ] Pacifism [ /card ] is equally effective against aggressive cards and bomby finishers , whereas a more expensive removal spell like [ card ] Trostani 's Judgment [ /card ] is great against Sphinxes and Dragons while still giving room for the Goblins and Soldiers of your set to breathe .
4 ) Vanilla replacement
Lastly , when looking to add spice to a set Cube , consider replacing some of the more boring vanilla cards with functionally similar upgrades . In a Return to Ravnica block Cube we could consider shaving a couple [ card ] Gutter Skulk [ /card ] s for [ card ] Blood Scrivener [ /card ] s. I would n't go overboard , but it 's a nice option for adding texture and excitement to an environment without disrupting your mana curves .
Closing Thoughts
Building a set Cube is a great unintimidating way to dip your toe in the Cubing waters . It 's also the perfect environment for tweaking variables and seeing how they affect drafting dynamics . If you have any questions , feel free to ask them in the comments below . Thanks for reading !

Say good-bye to the dull-brown columns around the concession stands , the cramped team store , the sports bar with its mahogany furniture and wall engraved with the names of long-dead icons such as Elvis Presley and Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
TD Garden is about to undergo a $ 70 million transformation that will bring in black-and-white subway tiles to concession stands and registers that allow customers to punch in their food orders and swipe credit cards to pay for them .
The plans also call for 55-foot media wall in the Courtside Club , wraparound television screens , and a loft feel to a membership-only restaurant . The size of the Proshop , which sells Celtics and Bruins merchandise , will also double .

Delaware North Cos. , the owner of TD Garden , will pay the costs of the renovations , but that probably will mean increases in membership fees to access the Legends Club , which is open to season ticket holders . The new prices will be unveiled in the coming months .

The Bruins , owned by Delaware North chief executive Jeremy Jacobs , have announced higher ticket prices for next season , but the increase is unrelated to the renovations , TD Garden officials said .
On Wednesday , TD Garden representatives showed off their plans to give the 20-year-old sports and concert venue a facelift and younger look . The renovations , which will begin this summer , after the Stanley Cup playoffs , are expected to take about two years .
The project aims to improve the fan experience and update the technology , said Amy Latimer , president of TD Garden .
The renovations are designed to coincide with the much larger changes planned for the surrounding neighborhood , Latimer said .

Delaware North and developer Boston Properties Inc. are planning to build a $ 950 million complex in front of the Garden , which will include three new towers . The buildings will have residences , restaurants , offices , a hotel , and an underground grocery store .
That complex will attract more people to the area , Latimer said , and the sports and concert venue should fit into the new environment .
“ You 'll be coming into a high energy space , ” she said . “ We want to feel it . ”
TD Garden , which opened in 1995 , has undergone smaller updates . Delaware North spent $ 20 million in the past four years to renovate the premium seating levels , add an environmentally friendly roof , and make technology improvements , such as free , wireless Internet arenawide .

To your success ,
UPDATE : As of 9 a.m. PST , the water level has increased to 901.24 ft. , and water is overflowing the 1,700 ft. long emergency spillway .
For the first time in the 50 year history of Oroville Dam , Lake Oroville has exceeded its design limit as of 3 a.m. PST this morning , reaching 900.1 ft. elevation .
The inflow rate into the reservoir continues to exceed the outflow rate , increasing the probability of the first-ever use of the emergency spillway . This would cause massive erosion of the hillside , which in this Google Earth image is to the left of the narrow concrete spillway ( 2015 imagery , reservoir 50 % full ) :
I have made an estimate of when the emergency spillway might be breached based upon rates of inflow and outflow ; the following chart suggests around 8 a.m. this morning :
These ( unofficial ) model-projected levels in the above chart assume measured inflow into the reservoir continues its steady decrease , and the outflow remains the same as it has been since 8 p.m. last night , when engineers reduced the flow through the damaged concrete spillway to avoid damage to power line towers :
Even if flow through the concrete spillway is increased to full-flow , the topping of the emergency spillway would only be delayed by an hour or so ( 9 a.m. ) . Lake levels would not keep increasing afterward , as suggested in the above chart… the model estimates are just meant to suggest we are likely headed to a breach of the emergency spillway , which will then provide an additional outflow channel for the lake .
I have no idea whether engineers have any “ tricks up their sleeve ” to avoid the emergency water release . The electricity generating turbines have been shut down due to debris in the water . I suspect we will be seeing some rather dramatic ( and very muddy ) video later today .

Colorado benefits from skiing , drawing tourists from around the world in a way that Washington does not . Also , Colorado is n't surrounded by states with a lot of medical marijuana , and it 's closer to the Midwest , South and Northeast .
All of this has driven prices down in Washington for farmers like Lauerman .
`` In the early days , we were able to get , like , $ 1,700 to $ 2,200 a pound , wholesale . Now it 's like $ 700 , $ 800 a pound , '' he said . `` That 's not profitable at all . I 've got most of my stuff stashed away for later . ''
He 's hoping to wait it out and eventually succeed with a branding strategy that may make him the first grower to put his name and likeness on a line of cannabis products . The label for his Farmer Tom 's Organics looks as if Jerry Garcia took over Newman 's Own . Lauerman also has released a set of trading cards based on the strains of pot he sells .
Read MoreLegal US pot sales are slamming Mexico 's illegal growers
But it may be too late . Lauerman 's farm is facing foreclosure , and he is filing for bankruptcy protection . He 's not the only one , as growers and retailers have turned on each other . While some growers accuse retailers of demanding unprofitable wholesale prices in order to make a retail profit , Oliver echoed others in saying that `` the people who are complaining the loudest about the glut ... are those producers who came online in July and were charging $ 21 a gram , gouging the retailers because they were the only producers on the market at the time . ''
Watching all of this from afar is Gonzalez of GFarmaLabs . He 's looking to expand from California into Washington .
`` The guys that own these facilities that now have all this pot , they owe investors money , '' he said . `` This is a boom like anything else . '' He 's waiting for a bust . `` We 're going to be able to go in there , and we 're going to buy facilities for pennies on the dollar . ''
It 's gotten so bad at the moment that Lauerman said some growers are `` giving it away '' to help get rid of inventory and build customer loyalty . The situation could be compared to the wine grape glut in California a decade ago , which led to the birth of Charles Shaw Wine , aka Two Buck Chuck . Could there be a Two Buck Toke as the Washington pot industry searches for stability ?
As Lauerman pointed out , there 's certainly enough product for one : `` There 's 45,000 extra pounds floating around out there with no home right now . ''
As you know , we have many symbiotic relationships with bacteria . In fact , the average human gut contains about 1 kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) of these microscopic cells , some of which are beneficial . If you 've ever had to take antibiotics , you may have come to learn how dependent we are on certain strains of bacteria to process plant materials… albeit through a rather uncomfortable experience . Certain flora , like E. coli , live in our intestines and help us synthesize vitamins K and B-complex , which are then absorbed by the body .
But microbes provide us with more than just dietary aide . Actually , microbes offer a unique line of evidence into investigating human migrations , which is crucial to have in anthropology . Since they evolve faster due to their exponentially expedited life span , we can trace how human population diverged from one another . One of my favorite papers on the subject was last year 's support for the Out of Africa model of human migrations using the genetics of Helicobacter pylori , another gut dwelling bacterial species .
A similar study on the topic was published today in the open access journal PLoS One . The title , “ Amerindian Helicobacter pylori Strains Go Extinct , as European Strains Expand Their Host Range , ” does a great job at explaining the main results of the paper . But I 'll try to provide a bit more detail in this post .
First , let me introduce the microbe to you . Unlike some of the other flora that reside inside of us , H. pylori , is more or less a parasite and a nasty one at that — known to cause stomach and intestinal cancers because of the chronic inflammation it causes . The inflammation stems off of the reaction of a component of its gram-negative staining walls , a lipopolysaccharide that initiates an immune response . However , most of us play host to this species and do a good job at keeping it under control . Inflammation only becomes a problem when combined with other deficiencies in the health and immune system of the individual .
The authors of this study made 131 bacterial cultures , 19 of which came from from Africans , 36 from Spanish , 11 from Koreans , 43 from Amerindians and 22 from South American Mestizos . They lysed the cells from the cultures and did lots of PCR and sequencing reactions for 7 housekeeping genes from each of the 131 cultures . When they did a comparison of the sequences they noted an interesting , but consistent result : decreased diversity of H. pylori strains in the human group with the least genomic diversity .
In other words , Native American human populations , who experienced a population bottleneck while crossing Beringia , also inadvertently caused a H. pylori bottleneck ! We 've suspected that Native American populations have undergone a bottleneck because looking at their ABO blood group diversity , they show a remarkable dominance of O blood type — something not seen in European and African populations .
Among Mestizo people , H. pylori genetic diversity was high . That 's because Mestizos are people of mixed ancestry — a hodgepodge of Spanish and Native American hybrids . In fact , the authors could see the hybridization in the H. pylori from these people . Although bacteria reproduce asexually , they have this phenomenon , called recombination , which is effectively a sharing of parts of DNA . Mestizo H. pylori had some signatures from Amerindian H. pylori and some from European H. pylori indicating their was a sharing of H. pylori genes from these two different populations , just as there was a sharing of human genes .
Even though I 've made this point before , similar to languages , material culture , and our own genetics , the genetics of organisms associated with humans , be it bacteria , rats , etc . can effectively tell us a lot about human migrations . This paper documents how a founder effect of sorts , a decrease of genetic variation of H. pylori among Native Americans due the effects of crossing Beringia some 15,000 years ago . It also documents the increase in genetic diversity of H. pylori as these Native American groups mixed with European ones .

The last stop on our southern road trip was Cincinnati Ohio . Cincinnati is actually a northern Rust Belt city , but it looks across the Ohio River to Kentucky , giving it a bit of southern charm . Its influences are mainly midwestern , but it also has a touch of the Mississippi River town feeling you get in St. Louis and the Appalachian hill town sensibilities of upstream Pittsburgh . It 's relatively small city population of 297,000 people anchors a large and sprawling metro area with a population of over 2.1 million ; the nation 's 28th largest . That means the city proper has only 14 % of the region 's population ( compared to Buffalo at 23 % ) . With a GDP of about $ 92 billion , Cincinnati is roughly equal to Buffalo ( $ 46B ) in per capita wealth . However , with 10 fortune 500 companies Cincinnati has a strong concentration of high-end wealth that Buffalo does not have .
Fountain Square in Downtown Cincinnati is busy at all times throughout the week . This weekend image shows people relaxing with a game on the Jumbo-tron across the street .
Buffalo and Cincinnati traded places several times to hold various spots in the top 20 largest metros throughout much of the early 20th century . This means that Cincinnati , like Buffalo , is packed with great architecture . I had wanted to visit Cincinnati for years after seeing pictures of the city 's Over the Rhine neighborhood . Over the Rhine ( OTR ) is a section of the city directly adjacent to downtown . It gets its name from the original German residents who populated the area across the Miami and Erie Canal ( the Rhine ) from downtown . The Canal has long been filled in , so the transition from Downtown to OTR is virtually seamless today . Seamless , that is , except for the poverty that covers much of OTR in contrast to Downtown 's relative prosperity . Downtown has few dilapidated buildings and no surface parking lots . A downtown Macy 's and Tiffany 's hint a high and wealth in the city . A smattering of other retail and restaurants make the streets friendly and relatively active for the business district in a mid size American City . There were people around at all times , even on a weekend . Downtown was clean and pleasant but felt visually sterile . Over the Rhine , on the other hand , is anything but visually sterile . It 's densely built cacophony of buildings from the 19th , 20th and 21st centuries is a real American treasure .
Over the Rhine as seen from Mt Adam .
I do n't know how this gorgeous neighborhood survived the urban renewal period . Buffalo completely wiped away similar neighborhoods on three sides of its downtown . Like so many other American cities , this core of the original old city was left with minimal to no investment for decades as the population and wealth pushed further out from the center . In the case of Cincinnati , that meant up and over the hills that surround downtown and OTR . The old neighborhood was left for the city 's African-American population , which correspondingly was also the city 's poorest group . Despite substantial disinvestment , remarkably few buildings were lost . The neighborhood remains dense , with a relatively small amount of surface parking . Today the OTR is still overwhelmingly poor and African-American with many vacant and uninhabitable buildings . It has also long held the status of the city 's highest crime neighborhood . Despite this , OTR is the location some of the city 's major civic institutions . The Findley Market , in one of the poorest parts of the neighborhood furthest from Downtown , is a popular public market , housed in a gorgeous shed style building , not unlike Buffalo 's long gone Chippewa Market . Its web site boasts of over 800,000 shopping visits a year resulting in over $ 30M in sales annually from a diverse cross-section of the region . Also located in Over the Rhine is the Cincinnati Music Hall , home of the Cincinnati Opera and the Symphony Orchestra . The Music Hall is an incredible Victorian pile of bricks facing the gorgeous Washington Park . The recently renovated park is one of the most beautiful urban spaces I have ever experienced . It is a vibrant urban room full of neighborhood activity that is densely ringed with a wall of wonderful brick buildings .
Like the Findley Market , the park and the music hall also sit in the midst of extreme poverty . But , as you might have guessed , poverty is not the future of OTR . Although the neighborhood experienced a race riot as recently as 2001 , gentrification is working its way in to the area big time . As with many of America 's historic cities , Cincinnati 's is rediscovering the value of its older neighborhoods . New investment has spread from downtown for several blocks into OTR . The core of this investment is on Vine Street , which is packed with restaurants , stores and people . But , the new wealth has also spread latterly from Vine in fits and starts covering dozens of blocks in each direction . The result is a mixture of wealth and poverty in direct proximity in a way I have never seen . New buildings are pushed up against historic buildings that are nothing but shells . The poor and the gentrifiers share the same sidewalks with expensive German cars sharing street parking with rusty junkers . There is no defined line between the new investment and the ongoing disinvestment . I wondered if the long-time residents could see the writing on the new tuck pointed walls .
One last thing about Cincinnati that is particularly relevant to Buffalo . Recently , I read an interview with Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley on the Urbanophile blog . In the interview , he promotes the city 's assets of sports , architecture , beautiful hilly geography , an impressive corporate headquarters economy , and mature cultural institutions . But , his more interestingly he asserts that Cincinnati is fortunate it never absorbed the vast areas of suburban land in the form of consolidated or metro type government as several peer cities have . What , you say ? Metro government is not a good idea for aging Rustbelt cities ?
Since I was a teen I looked at successful consolidated cities like Toronto , Indianapolis and others and concluded that metro government was a logical step for Buffalo . I looked on in frustration as it never happened . But recently I 've come to the same conclusion as Mayor Cranely . In any consolidation , the central city may get the benefit of the more wealthy suburban areas in the short run . But in the long run the city trades away influence and control over its destiny , while taking on the very real burden of the suburban over dependence on a high quantity of infrastructure per capita . The mayor points out that Cincinnati 's high density population and downtown core , filled with high paying companies , puts the city in an enviable position moving forward . As the city becomes more desirable and the neighborhoods begin reinvigorating , the city will be increasingly able to provide better services to its citizens . He says that If the city had combined with its suburbs its new wealth would have to be shared with an increasingly unsustainable suburban region , which is dependent on massively sprawling and aging infrastructure . Places like consolidated Nashville , with vast land area and thin population , may suffer a disadvantage to Cincinnati , with is smaller boundaries , and its ability to concentrate its resources in a smaller denser land area .
I think there is something to this . Buffalo has a long way to climb back from decades of disinvestment . But , as we see bidding wars drive up the real estate prices in many parts of Buffalo ; and as we see a steady new trickle of companies moves back into the city ; and as we see renovations in parts of Buffalo that was unimaginable just 6 years ago , we can start to imagine a Buffalo that is once again prosperous and stable . What happens as , inevitably , large parts of suburban Buffalo age , becoming less desirable , and less economically sustainable ? That new wealth trickling back into the city is going to be increasingly available for improving the condition of Buffalo 's tiny 40 square mile footprint instead of being spread over hundreds of square miles of sprawl .
Anyway , I was in Cincinnati for a very short time ; not enough . I ca n't wait to get back to see more . Besides Over the Rhine there are other great neighborhoods such as quirky Mount Adam , a densely built area with winding hill-top streets overlooking Downtown . The University of Cincinnati , which is stuffed with sports venues and a few remarkable buildings designed by starchitects is also worth a visit . I highly recommend Cincinnati as a must-see for anyone who loves cities .
Almost everyone recognizes that if humans are truly to go deeper into the Solar System , we need faster and more efficient propulsion systems than conventional chemical rockets . Rocket engines powered by chemical propellants are great for breaking the chains of Earth 's gravity , but they consume way too much fuel when used in space and do n't offer optimal control of a spacecraft 's thrust .
NASA recognizes this , too . So in 2015 , the space agency awarded three different contracts for development of advanced propulsion systems . Of these , perhaps the most intriguing is a plasma-based rocket—which runs on Argon fuel , generates a plasma , excites it , and then pushes it out a nozzle at high speed . This solution has the potential to shorten the travel time between Earth and Mars to weeks , rather than months .
But to realize that potential , Houston-based Ad Astra Rocket Company must first demonstrate that its plasma rocket , VASIMR , can fire continuously for a long period of time . The three-year , $ 9 million contract from NASA required the company to fire its plasma rocket for 100 hours at a power level of 100 kilowatts by 2018 .
This week , Ad Astra reported that it remains on target toward that goal . The company completed a successful performance review with NASA after its second year of the contract , and it has now fired the engine for a total of 10 hours while making significant modifications to its large vacuum chamber to handle the thermal load produced by the rocket engine .
When Ars visited Ad Astra early in 2017 , it was pulsing its rocket for about 30 seconds at a time . Now , the company is firing VASIMR for about five minutes at a time , founder Franklin Chang-Diaz told Ars . `` The limitation right now is moisture outgassing from all the new hardware in both the rocket and the vacuum chamber , '' he said . `` This overwhelms the pumps , so there is a lot of conditioning that has to be done little by little . ''

As the company continues to test the new hardware , it is gradually building up to longer and longer pulses , with inspections in between . Ad Astra remains on target to perform the 100-hour test in late summer or early fall of 2018 , Chang-Diaz said .
Initially , the company foresees the plasma rocket as a means for pushing cargo between Earth and the Moon—or on to Mars . With solar powered panels , the rocket would have a relatively low thrust and therefore would move loads slowly but efficiently . But with more power , such as from a space-based nuclear reactor , it could one day reach much higher velocities that would allow humans to travel rapidly through the Solar System .
A Russian driver hardly reacts as a meteorite lights up the sky
AN OLD ballistic missile system should be modified to defend Earth from asteroids , a Russian scientist says , citing a major explosion over the Urals earlier this year .
The Soviet-era SS-18 `` Satan '' heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles were ideal for conversion into a rapid-reaction anti-asteroid system , said senior rocket researcher Sabit Saitgarayev at the weekend .
Mr Saitgarayev , of the State Rocket Design Centre , pointed to the destructive power of the meteor which burst over the Russian Ural Mountains on February 15 . The sonic boom of the airburst blew out windows and damaged thousands of buildings around the city of Chelyabinsk .
About 1200 people were injured . Some 50 were hospitalised .
NASA believed the space rock to have been some 15 metres in diameter .
Mr Saitgarayev said the old 1960s-era Soviet `` Satan '' missiles were ideally suited to such an interception role as they could be held ready for launch for up to 10 years .
`` Carrier rockets created on the basis of intercontinental ballistic missiles like ( Satan ) , which use standard liquid fuel based on hydrazine , are well-suited for fighting suddenly discovered small objects , '' he said .
`` They can stay in the condition of their readiness for launch for ten and more years , after some re-equipping . ''
This would enable `` Satan '' to be launched against an inbound asteroid with only 20 minutes warning .
Most modern missile systems need several days to fuel , and this is usually done before a scheduled launch .
Saitgarayev said giving the `` Satan '' an upgrade including a third stage booster would enable it to target - and destroy - asteroids some five to six hours before they would strike the Earth .
David Cameron has warned that Nigel Farage presents a `` threat '' to the wellbeing of the British economy because the Ukip leader wants to `` give up '' on Britain 's role as an outward trading nation .
In some of his harshest words about Ukip , the prime minister accused Farage of promoting a `` totally unrealistic , pessimistic vision '' which would make Britain turn its back on the world .
Cameron , who admitted that the Tories face a tough fight in the European elections on 22 May as opinion polls point to a Ukip victory , asked voters to support the `` politics of the answer rather than the politics of anger '' .
The prime minister , who has been accused by Nick Clegg of failing to confront Ukip , also hailed Britain 's EU membership for giving free access to European markets , although he insisted that it is right to carry out major reforms to the EU .
Speaking at a Q & A session at an engineering firm in Stroud , Gloucestershire , the prime minister said of the Ukip leader : `` So , is he a threat to our economy ? Yes he is because we are a trading nation and his answer is to give up . ''
Cameron said that Farage was wrong to try and pull Britain out of the EU which would limit access to crucial markets . `` He is wrong . The idea of turning your back on the world and saying we are going to try and build fortress Britain , we are going to leave Europe , we are going to shut the door to anybody coming here . It is a totally unrealistic , pessimistic vision about what this country can achieve . ''
But the prime minister said that Labour and the Liberal Democrats were wrong to reject his plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain 's EU membership ahead of a planned referendum in 2017 . He said : `` My message to anyone thinking about voting for Nigel Farage is do n't give up on Britain in the world , give us a chance to get in there , negotiate a better deal for Britain and with me in charge you 'll get a referendum before the end of 2017 where you can decide do we stay inside this reformed organisation or do we leave . ''
Cameron acknowledged that Ukip is a threat to the Tories on 22 May . Opinion polls are suggesting that Ukip will win the elections ahead of Labour in second place and the Tories in fourth . The prime minister asked : `` Is he a threat to me and my party - well politics is about choice . We are in elections , they are competitive elections and I am going to try and get out around the country and convince people - do n't give up , do n't take a pessimistic view of Britain in the world . ''
But Cameron moved to reject an idea , suggested by some Tories , that he should bring forward the date of his planned EU referendum from 2017 if Farage fares well in the elections . `` We should n't change the date because I want to offer the British people a better deal . The idea of a referendum now would really be offering people two unacceptable choices - stay in Europe , with everything as it is now , or leave altogether and give up on Britain 's trading relationships . I do n't want to give that choice because Britain should have a better choice so I will stick to the plan I have set out . ''
The prime minister did move to reach out to disaffected Tory voters tempted by Ukip when he said he understood that people feel frustrated . `` I know people are frustrated with their politicians , sometime angry that we have n't taken more steps to deal with some of these issues . But what we have got to have in our country is the politics of the answer rather than the politics of anger because we have to fix these problems - fix our welfare system to it rewards the hardworking , fix our immigration system so it benefits the whole of our country .

This Was 1993 : 20 Years Ago I Heard The Perfect Rap Song
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Wild Pitch Records Courtesy of Wild Pitch Records
On May 4th , decades before James Todd Smith accidentally bartered the bloody residue of transatlantic slavery for some gold chains , I wore a $ 4.33 burnt orange du-rag and Cross Colours T-shirt to a record store called Camelot Music in Jackson , Miss . A few days earlier , before purchasing the du-rag or making the twenty-minute trek to Camelot in Mama 's hooptie , I popped a VHS with old episodes of Martin in my roommate 's VCR and I recorded a video on Rap City by a new group from Oakland called The Coup . The song was called `` Not Yet Free '' and the unreleased album was entitled Kill My Landlord .
This was 1993 .
I was six years removed from 2 Live Crew 's Move Somethin ' album cover ushering me into puberty ; five years from BDP and Public Enemy revising revisionist American histories ; five from NWA showing us all how and why we should f -- - the police ; three years from LL 's attempt at a `` conscious '' racial profiling song ; two years from Ice Cube making the most provocative album of the late 20th Century ; one year from a predictable bloody rebellion in LA ; and five months from Dr. Dre forcing us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about cinematic weed music , while birthing a puppy dog named Snoop .
Neither of us had ever heard that kind of hyper-awareness of our hyper-awareness , not even from Ice Cube .
In Jackson , and other parts of the black belt , we were no longer the dutiful disciples of the Holy Trinity of MCs — KRS , Kane and Rakim . We respected the gods , but we were done exclusively eavesdropping on the rhymes coming out of New York City . West coast music , as varied as it was , met us where we were and , truth be told , it was music we could see and hear . We also accepted that the west coast and the black belt were family , and had been since the second great migration of the 1940 's ushered thousands of southern black families to Los Angeles for jobs in the automotive and defense industries .
It 's true that the south , dismissed as culturally slow , meaningless and less hip ( hop ) than New York , had yet to , as Albert Murray wrote , lyrically stylize our southern worlds into significance . But if outsiders really listened to the musty movement behind the Geto Boys , UGK and 8 Ball and MJG , they would have heard the din of deeply southern black boys and girls eager to keep it real local . We wanted to use hip-hop 's brash boast , confessional and critique to unapologetically order the chaos of our country lives through country lenses with little regard to whether it sounded like real hip-hop .
We were real blues people , familiar in some way or another with dirt . There were no skyscrapers and orange-brown projects stopping us from looking up and out . We did n't know what it was like to move with enclosed subway trains slithering beneath our feet . And we liked it that way .
En route to lyrical acceptance of our dirty , we met Scarface , Ice Cube , Pimp C , Bun B , MC Ren and D.O.C . And after a while , we realized that they were our cousins , our uncles , our best friends , us . We lyrically rode through Compton , Oakland , Port Arthur and Houston the same way we rode through Jackson , Meridian , Little Rock , New Orleans and Birmingham . We rode in long cars with windows down , bass quaking and air fresheners sparkling like Christmas tree ornaments .
We felt pride in knowing that the greatest producer alive was an uncle from Compton , and the most anticipated MC in the history of hip-hop was a lanky brother from Long Beach . We knew , no matter what anyone in New York said , the baddest MC on earth , song for song , album for album , was an aging cousin from South Central Los Angeles whose government name was O'Shea .
This was 1993 .
As inspirational as we found Dre 's music , Snoop 's flow and Cube 's criticism , an articulated fear and hatred of black women was part of what made them so nationally attractive . Like nearly all of our lyrical pedagogues , these MCs practiced a form of spectacular psychological and/or emotional dismantling of black women passed down by the practices , policies and patriarchy of America .
Chuck D and Flav had already told us all that women were `` blind to the facts '' of who they were because they watched the wrong television shows . Slick Rick warned us to pre-emptively treat women like prostitutes since all they did was `` hurt and trample . '' Too Short painted the freakiest of tales and constantly reminded us that the correct pronunciation of the words `` woman '' and/or `` girl '' was `` bitch . ''
Big Daddy Kane and Nice and Smooth let us know that no matter what we heard from Too Short , pimping was never easy . The Geto Boys showed us how to kick a woman in the ass if she claimed to be pregnant with our baby . Before we elected a modern Falstaff with hoish tendencies to the White House , MC Ren evocatively taught us how to gang rape a fourteen year old preacher 's daughter and sodomize any woman `` saying that they never would suck a dick . ''
This was 1993 .
Back in my dorm room , I rewind-pause-played my way through the shifting points of view of `` Not Yet Free . '' I memorized all three verses the same night I saw it and told my boy , Eric Caples — a formidable MC himself — that I 'd just heard the perfect rap song . The next day , in Eric 's room , I watched his face as he watched the video .
The first image beneath the boom of the 808 was a black woman standing upright in matching white necklace , bracelet and earrings . The woman had a sawed off shotgun on her back and a child in her arms . She looked directly into the face of the child was nursing . As engrossing as the image was , Eric was mesmerized by what he heard .
YouTube
The Coup 's DJ , a woman named `` Pam , the Funkstress , '' scratched — teased — variations of Ice Cube 's `` Blacks are ... Blacks ... Blacks ... Blacks are too f -- -ing broke ... '' for 40 seconds before finally arriving at `` Blacks are too f -- -ing broke to be Republican . ''
Eric bobbed his head to the beat and furrowed his brow when Boots rhymed , `` Everyday I pull a front so nobody pulls my card / I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice looking hard . '' Neither of us had ever heard that kind of hyper-awareness of our hyper-awareness , not even from Ice Cube .
We both covered our mouths when the organ dropped and Boots explored his role in capitalism : `` This web is made of money , made of greed , made of me . Oh , what I have become in a parasite economy . ''
Eric closed his eyes and smiled at the precision , sensory details and familiarity of E-Roc 's verse and voice as he picked up where Boots left off .
`` In the winter there 's a splinter with the smell of the rain
And the scent of the street , but all I smell is the pain
Of a brotha who 's a hustler and he 's stuck to the grind
Of a sista who 's a hooker got ta sell her behind . ''
Later in the verse , E-Roc ruptured the individual desperation narrative , placing himself as an actor , agent and witness on the streets he previously described : `` Now my dreams and aspiration go from single to whole / As I realize there 's a million motherf -- -ers in the cold . ''
Boots came back in at the end of the song , with a new point of view . The shift was marked by a minimal bass guitar and deepening of his voice . In the video , Boots ' words come out of the mouth of a pawn shop owner whose store is filled with guns we presume he 'll sell to brothers killing other brothers .
`` N -- -az , thugs , dope dealers and pimps
Basketball players , rap stars and simps
That 's what little black boys ... are made of ...
Sluts , hoes and press the naps around your neck
Broads , pop that coochie , b -- -- es stay in check
That 's what little black girls ... are made of ... ''
The point of view changed hands one more time , as Boots reoccupied his subject position and asked , `` But if we 're made of that , who made us ? / And what can we do to change us ? '' He delivered his last lines of the verse to pawn shop owner , the surveillance camera and , ultimately , to us .
I stopped the VCR before the end of the song to see what Eric Caples had to say . I told him that I was going to use my work-study check to buy some gas for Mama 's car , then drive the mall to buy the whole album tomorrow . I remember literally telling him that Boots was my new favorite MC and that I believed `` Not Yet Free '' could change hip-hop forever .
`` It 's dope , '' Eric eventually said about the song and video . `` They can rap and that DJ can scratch . Boots ai n't no Snoop , though . And I can tell you right now that that tape wo n't be no Chronic either . ''
I sucked my teeth , and rewound the VHS to the beginning of the video again .
Sitting on the floor of that dorm room , I would have sworn on everything I loved that hip-hop would never be the same after `` Not Yet Free '' and Kill My Landlord — even though I had n't heard it yet . I really knew that everything involving hip-hop , black boys , black girls , freedom , capitalism , raced oppression , truth , rape music , violence , white supremacy , honesty and me was about to change forever .
The next morning , with a pocket full of work-study money , I headed to Super D to buy some new clippers to cut my hair . The clippers were more expensive than I thought they 'd be so I bought a du-rag instead . I put the du-rag on in Mama 's hooptie and headed to Camelot .
The manager told me that they did n't carry Kill My Landlord and that he had n't even heard of The Coup . He claimed he could get one copy of the album in stock in 7-10 business days if I wanted him to . I thought hard about whether I 'd have money for the album in 7-10 business days .
A half hour later , I purchased Above the Law 's Black Mafia Life and a three-piece from Popeyes .
Back in my dorm room , I blasted a song called , `` Pimpology 101 '' and set my roommate 's VCR to record another episode of Rap City .
This was 1993 .

Dragon 's Crown Patch Makes Wizard More Powerful , Tweaks Network Settings
By Spencer . September 3 , 2013 . 1:31am
Atlus is improving Dragon 's Crown again with another patch . This one adds a few features like a triangle cursor on the bottom of the screen so other characters are more visible and an option for random players to jump into the Chaos Labyrinth in the network menu . One of the big changes is the Wizard has been rebalanced . The Wizard 's has more maximum MP and his magic power has been increased as well .
The Amazon 's neck breaker attack can be canceled and after a successful parry the Amazon 's berserk level will go up by one . That last change should make the Amazon much more effective since you can build up to level 3 berserk faster .
Another major tweak in Dragon 's Crown is you can progress through the story in offline multiplayer if you and the other characters are at the same point . If a game has an error in online multiplayer , Dragon 's Crown wo n't kick players back to the town any more you 'll end up at the start of the dungeon instead . The patch also fixes various bugs and adjusts skills . The update goes live in Japan today .
Self-described “ conservative feminist ” Christina Hoff Sommers delivered a speech outlining her primary objects to contemporary feminism . Item one : “ Today 's movement takes a very dim view of men . ”
And here is the problem with the play and with the gender feminist * philosophy that informs it : Most men are not brutes . They are not oppressors . Yes , there are some contemptible Neanderthals among us , and I have no sympathy for them whatsoever . But to confuse them with the ethical majority of men is blatantly sexist .
In the video clip ( but not in the transcript ) , Sommers is more over-the-top in defining feminists as male-haters , going so far as to express pity for boys whose mothers are feminists .
I 'd like to see a serious discussion of male-bashing in feminism . Unfortunately , Sommers ' treatment of the subject is n't serious . She cites one , and only one , source to show that “ the gender feminist philosophy ” considers “ most men… brutes ” : Eve Ensler 's play The Vagina Monologues .
But The Vagina Monologues is n't a non-fiction essay . It 's a play about women 's experiences surviving rape and abuse . That 's not the sole subject of the play , but — just after the importance of women loving their bodies — it 's the primary theme . Complaining that a play about the abuse and rape of women has too many abusive men in it is unreasonable and unfair .
There is a positive male character in The Vagina Monologues , a man who so loves vaginas that he teaches his girlfriend to love her own vagina . Sommers dismisses this character entirely , for the transparently ridiculous reason that the character is describes as being bland on first meeting ( although he later proves to be an unusually great lover , because he loves women 's sex parts so much ) . It 's hard to respond to Sommers ' argument , because it 's not even an argument ; it 's just an irrelevant statement . He is a positive character ; he does n't mysteriously cease being a positive character because he seems bland at first , or because he loves vaginas .
In this speech , that 's Sommers ' only evidence that contemporary feminism considers most men brutes — in one popular play about rape and abuse , many but not all of the male characters are negative . I find that evidence underwhelming .
Note what Sommers does n't include : A single recent quote from a feminist leader saying “ most men are brutes. ” If this is indeed the common viewpoint of contemporary feminism , I 'd think that Sommers would be able to find a dozen such quotes easily ; yet Sommers does n't provide even one .
* * *
Sommers ' case is ridiculous , overstated , and the “ evidence ” she introduces is embarrassingly weak . But I 'd like to consider the question of feminist hatred of men a little bit more .
In the comments at Feminist Law Professors , David Cohen writes :
I strongly contest her theories about feminist hatred of men . For the past two decades , I 've now been a very outspoken feminist man on three very different university campuses , within one prominent feminist legal advocacy group , and as a frequent blogger on this blog . With the advocacy group I worked for for 7 years , I worked with many other feminist legal advocacy groups . In none of these settings was I ever once treated in any way that made me feel that the ( mostly all , but not exclusively so ) women hated me or men generally . They ( as do I ) hate men who do bad things to women ( and other men ) . But , there is no general hatred of men . Sommers ' claims to the contrary are just wrong . In fact , I often found ( and still find ) myself in a position I did n't want to be in — being praised for my feminist work because of the work but also because I was a man . I appreciate the first part of that but feel like the second part is wrong-headed and unnecessary .
That seems right to me . I ca n't claim to have worked as much with feminists as David Cohen ; but I 've been a women 's studies major , occasionally volunteered for feminist causes , and virtually all my friends for the past 20 years have been feminists . And , with one exception , my experiences have been similar to David 's . If man-hating is so pervasive in contemporary feminism , why do n't men in feminism encounter it more ?
Furthermore , in my experience , feminists are more likely than non-feminists to be supportive if I say men are screwed over by sex role expectations ; that the targeting and bullying of wimpy boys is a real and significant problem ( non-feminists are more apt to respond “ boys will be boys ” ) ; that being cut off from feeling free to express ourselves emotionally does real damage to men ; that men who go into traditionally female fields like child care are unfairly looked at with suspicion ; and so on . Again , with one exception .
That one exception is , the internet . Years ago , on Ms Magazine 's feminist bulletin board ( this was in the dark ages , before blogs even ) I met a handful of self-proclaimed radical feminists who 'd say genuinely man-hating things : men are biologically inferior to women , all men consciously plot to keep all women in fear of rape , and so forth . These women were a minority of posters on the Ms boards ( and a minority among the radical feminists there ) , and many other posters objected to these statements .
Nonetheless , these bigoted , anti-male views do exist among a small minority of feminists , and ever since the Ms Boards I can no longer say I 've never encountered any genuinely man-hating feminists . But to claim that such views are the dominant philosophy of contemporary feminism is nonsense .
It 's also through the internet that I first encountered men 's rights activists , also known as MRAs . MRAs , of course , are extremely sympathetic to the idea that boys and men are being harmed by contemporary sex roles — but for many , their sympathy is exclusively for males . Their is a tone of bitterness and hatred in how many MRAs discuss women and harms to women , very similar to the way some feminists on the Ms Boards discuss men and harms to men . The difference is that those feminists are , in my experience , a small minority among all feminists ; but a huge portion of MRAs exhibit rage towards towards women in general and feminists in particular .
* * *
There 's a more subtle form of sexism against men that I think is much more common than the “ men are mostly brutes ” mentality that Sommers criticizes ( but provides no examples of ) . In the last 20 years — and due , in my opinion , to the growth of the MRA movement ( which was itself strongly influenced by Sommers ' book Who Stole Feminism ? ) – too many feminists have developed a knee-jerk resistance to discussions of how sexism harms men .
This is understandable . After a hundred conversations with MRAs , feminists have learned that when someone begins talking about how men are harmed by sexism , they 're often leading up to the anti-feminist conclusions that women have nothing to complain about , and feminism is a morally terrible movement . Concerns about harms to men are sometimes use by MRAs to crowd out discussion of harms to women . Feminists , frankly , have become defensive , and in some cases have circled their rhetorical wagons .
But although this is understandable , I also think it 's unfortunate . Men are harmed by sexism , and although I would n't want that point to crowd out discussions of harms to women , it should be part of the spectrum of issues feminists discuss .
( * Although Hoff Sommers uses the term “ gender feminist , ” which she coined , she never defines the term in the transcript of her speech . ( In the video , she says she uses the term interchangably with “ victim feminist . ) For more about the term “ gender feminist , ” see this series of posts . Although she would n't put it this way , in practice Sommers categorizes all feminists who are n't libertarian conservatives as “ gender feminists . ” )
To allow intra-feminist discussion , comments on this post on “ Alas , a Blog ” are limited to feminist and feminist allies only . However , the cross-post at “ Blog By Barry ” is open to feminists and non-feminists .

Newcastle consider cash plus player deal with Marseille over £18m N'Koulou and Toon idol Taylor
Newcastle are weighing up a move for Marseille 's £18m-rated centre-back Nicolas N'Koulou .
The 23-year-old has been targeted by AC Milan and Juventus but is keen to move to England and is interested at the prospect of joining the colony of former French League players at Newcastle .
Swap shop : Steven Taylor could be used in a deal for Nicolas N'Koulou
Alan Pardew wants a replacement for Argentine Fabricio Coloccini but N'Koulou 's valuation is above what they had earmarked to spend .
However , Marseille may be willing to take a player in exchange as part of the deal and are known to admire Newcastle defender Steven Taylor among others .
Cameroon international N'Koulou said : ‘ The club and me are together on my future . If they receive an offer they ca n't refuse , then we will have to part company . '
The owner of a St. John 's restaurant says he was shocked to see an eviction notice on the door of his business on Monday .
Alfred Hynes has been running Gracie Joe 's at 123 Quidi Vidi Road since 2011 . Hynes said because of personal and financial issues , 2015 was a hard year for the business but , he said he thought his business partner and landlord was giving him an opportunity to get back on track .
`` I have a fair amount invested in the building . We 're at odds right now and I 'm hoping that we can come together and work things out , '' said Hynes .
Leslie McNab is the owner of the building . In a statement to CBC News , McNab said Hynes had n't paid rent in more than a year and owed her more than $ 40,000 .
`` Well , that would be her interpretation of it , certainly , '' said Hynes who claims he sat down with McNab in November and came up with a plan to move forward .
McNab said she 's working to find another tenant for the property .
On Monday , after the eviction notice appeared on the building , Hynes announced that Gracie Joe 's was permanently moving to the Grand Wabana Inn on Bell Island .
`` There 's some amazing people over here , the vista is incredible and it offers up a bit of clarity for sure . ''
Hynes said Gracie Joe 's will be back in business at its new location by mid-January .

Vivendi prosegue la sua scalata di Mediaset e ora punta verso il 30 % del Biscione , soglia oltre la quale il gruppo transalpino sarebbe costretto a lanciare un'opa . A dirlo in una nota diffusa a mercati chiusi è stata ieri la stessa società francese presieduta da Vincent Bolloré , che ha ribadito come il suo obiettivo sia « aumentare la partecipazione in Mediaset entro il limite del 30 % del capitale e dei diritti di voto » . All'ultimo aggiornamento disponibile , il gruppo francese disponeva del 20 % delle azioni Mediaset e , ai prezzi di chiusura di ieri , salire di dieci punti percentuali costerebbe a Vivendi oltre 400 milioni di euro .
« Sfortunatamente l'accordo per l'acquisizione del 100 % della pay tv Premium e del 3,5 % di Mediaset è sfociato in una causa legale e le nostre proposte per una risoluzione amichevole non sono state accolte da Fininvest » , si legge nel comunicato del gruppo francese . « Ora la nostra salita nell'azionariato di Mediaset è in linea con la nostra strategia che punta a sviluppare le attività nel Sud Europa » .
Non la pensa così Fininvest , azionista di maggioranza di Mediaset , che solo pochi minuti prima della dichiarazione d'intenti di Vivendi aveva comunicato di aver presentato un esposto alla Consob accusando il gruppo francese di abuso di informazioni privilegiate e manipolazione del mercato . L'esposto di Fininvest contiene la richiesta all'organismo di controllo presieduto da Giuseppe Vegas di esercitare poteri che potrebbero comprendere anche il sequestro delle azioni . La holding della famiglia Berlusconi ha dichiarato in una nota che l'atto fa seguito alla denuncia presentata alla Procura di Milano lo scorso 13 dicembre e per cui ieri sono stati depositati nuovi documenti dai legali di Fininvest .
Mediaset aveva già risposto con un comunicato dai toni duri all'intervista rilasciata pochi giorni fa dal ceo del gruppo francese Arnaud De Puyfontaine al Corriere della Sera . « Le gravi affermazioni contenute nell'intervista sulla stampa italiana troveranno adeguata replica nelle sedi più appropriate » , si leggeva nel comunicato di Mediaset , la quale aveva comunque voluto sottolineare che « non esiste alcuna trattativa : nell'incontro di venerdì , richiesto da Vivendi , la società ha ribadito le proprie posizioni .
Una delle domande che circolano ora in ambienti finanziari è : Vivendi sorpasserà la soglia del 30 % e lancerà un'opa su Mediaset . Al quesito nei giorni scorsi lo stesso de Puyfontaine aveva riposto in maniera abbastanza sibillina : « Abbiamo i mezzi per farlo , ma non posso fare commenti » , aveva dichiarato il top manager di Vivendi .
Mentre lo scontro tra le due società prosegue , il titolo del Biscione sta vivendo un momento d'oro in borsa . Ieri , prima dei comunicati diffusi da Vivendi e dalla stessa Mediaset , a Piazza Affari il titolo del gruppo televisivo di Cologno Monzese ha terminato le contrattazioni in rialzo dell ' 1,5 % a 3,6 euro per azione , incrementando così al 57 % il guadagno messo assieme nell'ultimo mese .
Ma la partita non coinvolge soltanto il titolo Mediaset : Equita , per esempio , ha scritto che « tra i possibili riflessi della battaglia Mediaset -Vivendi ci sono opportunità che si riapra il tema dell'aggregazione Ei Towers-Rai Way » . Questo , secondo gli analisti della sim , perché « il supporto politico offerto a Mediaset contro Vivendi evidenzia una relazione meno tesa tra il governo e la famiglia Berlusconi » e quindi « l'operazione potrebbe essere presentata come una difesa dell'italianità dell'infrastruttura » . Proprio il governo Renzi aveva posto un vincolo , per decreto , alla vendita del 51 % di Raiway , disponendo che il controllo restasse in mano alla Rai . Secondo Kepler Cheuvreux , inoltre , la vicenda Vivendi /Mediaset apre « scenari interessanti che in qualche modo potrebbero coinvolgere Telecom » ; si tratterebbe di un altro passo verso « la convergenza telecom-media , che segue recenti operazioni simili in Europa e negli Usa » . Tuttavia , lo scenario che prevede una fusione Telecom-Mediaset « resta improbabile o altamente speculativo » , secondo gli analisti di Kepler . ( riproduzione riservata )

As great as our big brains are they also have a significant downside : they 're expensive . Despite the fact they only account for 2 % of your body weight they require 20 % of your calories to keep them going . That 's about as many calories as you get from a Big Mac , all spent on just keeping your brain ticking over . Despite all the benefits they give us we simply would n't have been able to evolve them unless we could somehow fuel them .
Surprisingly , even though we have to fuel a massive thinking organ we do n't use more energy than a chimp ; whose piddly little brain is only ¼ the size of ours ( which will make it more embarrassing when they take over the world ) . This prompted Aiello and Wheeler ( 1995 ) to suggest that other parts of our body had shrunk to lessen their energy requirements , creating a surplus which could be spent on the brain .
They figured that it was the gut which had made this noble sacrifice . Pound for pound the digestive system is as energetically expensive as the brain ( Aiello and Wheeler , 1995 ) , so it seems likely that if an animal could they would reduce the size of it . Evolution is a balancing act , trying to make the best animal as quickly and as energetically cheaply as possible ; so if an expensive organ can be made smaller it will be . This need not have happened specifically to enable large brains , natural selection could just be making our ancestors more efficient , which had the happy coincidence of creating an energy surplus .
Indeed , we do have smaller guts than an animal of our body size should have ( Aiello and Wheeler , 1995 ) , but why could our ancestors afford to shrink their gut ? After all , being able to digest food is rather important to survival . It would seem that around 3 million years ago our family had started spending more time on the ground , where they started to venture into open grassland . There they would find large prey animals , which are an abundant source of energy rich meat .
Whilst it is more likely they were scavenging this meat than actually hunting the animals themselves , they were nevertheless managing to eat meat by ~2.5 million years ago ( de Heinzelin et al. , 1999 ) . This high calorie food is much easier to digest than plants , meaning that we could get by with a smaller ( and energetically cheaper ) gut . It 's telling that only 200,000 years after the first evidence of meat consumption appears our brains had doubled in size ( Boyd and Silk , 2009 ) .
So we eat meat , meaning we can get by with a smaller gut . This leads to a surplus of energy which can be spent on developing a large brain , because large brains are great . This improves our technology , allowing us to process food with tools and fire . This effectively “ pre-digests ” the food , allowing our guts to shrink even further . Around 1.7 million years ago , when the first evidence of fire appears , brain size increases from 600cc to 850cc . 200,000 years later they 'd increased to 1150cc , which falls within the range of modern humans ( Boyd and Silk , 2009 ) .
So it would seem that the expensive tissue hypothesis is a good explanation for what enabled the development of large brains . Granted it does n't explain why they then got bigger ( we have other hypotheses for that ) but it does “ set the stage ” for the growth . This was thinking for over a decade until in 2011 a team from the University of Zurich discovered what appeared to be a fatal flaw in the expensive tissue hypothesis .
Many ideas about human evolution use evidence from other species to support their claims . If something prompts the evolution of a trait in another lineage then it may have prompted the development of that trait in ours as well . Aiello and Wheeler – the inventors of the ETH – believed the same would be true for the expensive tissue hypothesis and that we would find that many other species had reduced gut size in favour of large brains ( and vice versa , because cows are dim ) . However , Navarrete et al . ( 2011 ) examined over 100 species of mammal in an effort to find this correlation but failed ( although they did find a correlation between brain size and quantity of fat deposits , with big brained animals having less fat ) .
Overturning a well-accepted hypothesis is something every scientist dreams of doing , and these researchers proudly wrote that “ brain size is not negatively correlated with the mass of the digestive tract or any other expensive organ , thus refuting the expensive-tissue hypothesis. ” Aiello herself appears to have accepted this conclusion , although claims the expensive tissue hypothesis is still valid . It 's just that fat that decreased over time and that enabled brain growth ( Aiello and Anton , 2012 ) .
Under this new model an animal has two choices to deal with harsh environments . They can either build up fat reserves or evolve large brains to come up with new behaviours and adapt to any changes . Humans appear to have gone for the latter , using intelligence to get lots of energy from meat and later cooked food at the expense of fat stores ( until fast food came along , and we got to be both fat and big brained ) . The expensive tissue hypothesis still holds true , just replace “ gut ” with “ fat . ”
Others have been less hasty to jump ship . Humans do have smaller guts than they should after all ; that 's something that ca n't be ignored ( Aiello and Wheeler , 1995 ) . Further , it might not be appropriate to use animal data to investigate what happened to human digestion . After all , no other species uses fire to prepare their food and we 're the only primate to eat a large quantity of meat . Indeed , our large brains could n't be funded without an improved diet ( Fonseca-Azevedo and Herculano-Houzel , 2012 ) ; although that says nothing about whether a reduction in gut size was also required . However artificial selection experiments in fish show that when you evolve them to have large brains this comes at the cost of smaller guts ( Isler , 2013 ) .
The fact that multiple lines of evidence suggest the original claim that gut size has reduced , freeing up energy for large brains still holds water . However , the fact fat deposits also appear to be linked to brain size suggests the picture is more complicated than Aiello and Wheeler originally suggested . ; and that other areas of the body have sacrificed energy for the brain ( and improved diet also played a role , independent of changes to internal organs ) . Which body part made the most sacrifices is something people will likely argue for years to come , but one fact is clear : our brains have a hefty price tag .

Bangladesh embassies , consulates , high commissions , permanent missions in different countries and international organizations represent Bangladesh and its people . These missions are controlled by Bangladesh Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) . According to MOFA 's website , a total of 65 embassies , consulates , high commissions , deputy high commissions , permanent missions are stationed in 51 countries . ( List below . However , this list may not be updated ! ) All these foreign missions have physical location ( buildings , offices ) and many have online presence ( websites ) . Through their physical and virtual locations these foreign offices provide various kinds of services to people .
This article , in general , will review the state and effectiveness of the websites of Bangladesh embassies and consulates . It will touch upon the language , social engagement , quality of information , management related issues . At the end , it will attempt to provide some suggestions .
At present , there are 48 embassies , consulates , high commissions , deputy high commissions , permanent missions of Bangladesh government can be found online ( Sources : MOFA website and internet search ) . A gallery of screenshots of Bangladesh Embassies and Consulates can be found here .
Due to lack of information regarding the website policy of Bangladesh Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) , this article has to rely on WYSIWYG method to write about the conditions of websites .
To start with , apart from the James Bond 007 , Mr Daniel Craig 's visit to Bangladesh Deputy High commission in Kolkata , online presence of Bangladesh foreign missions are not admirable . Many missions have no web presence . Those who have are plugged with difficulties – dead links , no links , outdated information , slow speed , hacked domain , expired domain , disorganized information structure , no public engagement , security concern are few to mention . Following are some more prominent problems :
Naming Principles of Bangladesh Embassies and Consulates
Nomenclature ? Bangladesh embassies and consulates have adopted various kinds of name for different missions . For example , bdembassy , bangladeshembassy , bangladoot , bangladesh , bdembassyuae , cgbdubai etc .
Moreover , sometimes when a domain name was expired or hacked , simply another name was taken and a website was lunched . For example :
Bangladesh High Commission in India , New Delhi
www.bhcdelhi.org > > www.bdhcdelhi.org
Consulate General of Bangladesh in LA , USA
www.bdcgla.org > > www.bangladeshconsulatela.com
Embassy of Bangladesh in Japan
www.bdembjp.com > > www.bdembassy.jp
Deputy High Commission of Bangladesh in Kolkata , India
www.bdhckolkata.org > > www.bdhc-kolkata.org
Permanent Mission of Bangladesh in Geneva , Switzerland

Domain Policy of Bangladesh Embassies and Consulates
Acquiring and implementing a systematic , well-organized , appropriate top-level domain ( TLD ) policy is vital to any website . At the government level , it is also a question of public trust , national security and standardization . Bangladesh Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not secured and implemented any consistent domain name plan for its foreign mission websites .
It seems like Bangladesh MOFA uses any and every top-level domain names available for their missions abroad . Here are some samples of top-level domain names in use for MOFA foreign missions today :
Name ( Entity ) Name ( Entity ) .com ( commercial )
.org ( organization )
.bh ( Bahrain )
.be ( Belgium )
.bt ( Bhutan )
.bn ( Brunei Darussalam )
.ca ( Canada )
.cn ( China )
.de ( Germany )
.lk ( Sri Lanka ) .np ( Nepal )
.nl ( Netherlands )
.ru ( Russia )
.sa ( South Africa )
.sg ( Singapore )
.se ( Sweden )
.ch ( Switzerland )
.tr ( Turkey )
.uk ( United Kingdom )
.uz ( Uzbekistan )
.vn ( Vietnam )
Language Support
All websites of Bangladesh embassies and consulates are in English . None of them has Bangla language support except Bangladesh Embassy in Nepal . Other missions sometime post government circulars , notices , press releases , directives , etc . in Bangla . However , they are all in jpeg or pdf format .
Considering its international importance , English is a right choice . However , considering Bangla language is a big issue in Bangladesh and possibly most of the visitors are of Bangladeshi origin ( an unscientific assumption ! ) , and it is a national language of Bangladesh , all websites could have been supported with Bangla language . And if possible , all websites can provide local language support as well . For example , Bangladesh Embassy in Japan can be in Japanese language , beside English and Bangla .
Ironically , Bangladesh MOFA website is completely in English but they have attempted Bangla language support !
Interestingly , Bangladesh Embassy in Uzbekistan has Russian , Bangladesh Embassy in Turkey has Turkish language and Bangladesh Embassy in China has Chinese language support .
Social Engagement
Social media , like Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , Google+ etc . are powerful tools to connect and stay in touch with clients or fans of any service organizations . Almost no Bangladesh embassies and consulates have social media connections except Kenya ( Facebook ) and Nepal ( Facebook , Twitter , Google+ ) . Interestingly , Bangladesh Embassy in Kuwait has no website but only Facebook page !
Information and Website Structure
All MOFA websites have serious consistency problem in regard to information and website structure .
Information
The information provided in various websites of Bangladeshi missions abroad are widely varied . Basic information about Bangladesh , economy , culture , tradition are not uniform . In some instances , they are missing .
Structure
Like information , website structures are widely differs , confusing and has no harmony . Let 's take one example – contact is one of most important link/menu at the navigational structure of any website . One can see a wild ride of the link , here are few examples :
Bangladesh Embassy in Sweden and Turkey : ‘ Contact Us ‘ on top right horizontal level . Good .
‘ on top . Good . Bangladesh Embassy in the UAE : ‘ Contact Us ‘ is on the footer only ! !
‘ is only ! ! Bangladesh Embassy in Saudi Arabia : there is no ‘ Contact Us ‘ . If they have , it is HARD to find .
‘ . If they have , it is HARD to find . Bangladesh Embassy in Sri Lanka : ‘ Contact Us ' is not on navigation menu , just pasted at the front page . Easy to lost .
Website structures can be different but all must pass usability test and be user-friendly . Navigation does not have to be same or even similar , but it must be intuitive in nature . ‘ Keep looking until you find ' policy is not a great idea .
Control and Management
Who controls Bangladesh embassy and consulate websites ? According to MOFA website , Kuwait , Lebanon , Myanmar , Nepal , Philippines , Qatar , Sri Lanka , and Thailand have no websites . However , they have websites and can be found online . Is Bangladesh MOFA in control of these websites ? or Is this simply a lack of update issue ?
There is no information about Bangladesh Consulate in Milan , Italy on MOFA website . However , one website of Consulate Milan was found online ! The website works and seems legitimate but question remains why there is no information about this consulate on MOFA website ?
Management of the websites can be delegated to other entities but who control and own these domain names and websites are not clear . Many of the websites are simply created , credited , sponsored , donated by other entities . There are also no copyright , disclaimer , terms and conditions , privacy policy related issues posted , including Bangladesh MOFA 's own website .
If these websites are owned and controlled by Bangladesh MOFA , as a rule of thumb , that information should be mentioned . Allowing person 's or organization 's name to appear on a government website is not professional .
At the time of writing this article , at least 19 MOFA foreign mission websites have the name of a person or organization printed at the footer – including some foreign web developers . Even at the footer of MOFA 's own website has personal seal of a creator ! Nothing is wrong in mentioning who is the designer or developer of the websites , however , it is very unconventional for a government website .
Proper control and maintenance of Bangladesh foreign mission websites are a national security issue .
Other Observations :
Many issues can be mentioned that are affecting good web experience for visitors , such as
Websites have many dead links , bad request links ,
Websites are almost static in nature ,
No interactive options in any websites ,
There are many kinds of platforms in use ,
No cookie policy compliance regarding EU countries ,
Sites are not secured ( https ) to do any data transaction , if necessary , etc .
Bangladesh Foreign Missions At A Glance :
Ways to Improve websites of Bangladesh Embassies and Consulates
There are many ways to improve the websites of Bangladesh embassies and consulates . Consult with some industry experts can be one way to go . Below are some obvious suggestions :
Naming principle can be made uniform and consistent . For example : using mofa.gov.bd as a top-level domain , all foreign missions can be named with city in which they are stationed . Here are few examples :
Abu Dhabi
https : //www . abudhabi . mofa.gov.bd Karachi https : //www . karachi .mofa.gov.bd London https : //www . london .mofa.gov.bd Los Angeles https : //www . losangeles .mofa.gov.bd
New York https : //www . newyork .mofa.gov.bd Nairobi https : //www . nairobi .mofa.gov.bd Washington D. C. https : //www . washingtondc .mofa.gov.bd
General information about Bangladesh history , politics , geography , culture , tradition , literature , government structure , investment policy , etc . can be furnished by Bangladesh MOFA . This information can be data-rich , synchronized , well researched . Rest can be given to each mission to add information according to their need . Website structure can be professional , user-friendly , modern and if possible , aesthetically appealing !
Websites can be made in English with Bangla and local language support . Bangla language will help Bangladeshis in need and local language may assist foreign investors , tourists and information seekers . For example :
Embassy Language 1
Language 2
Language 3
USA English Bangla UAE English Bangla Arabic Sweden English Bangla Swedish Tajikistan English Bangla Russian Malaysia English Bangla Malay/Chinese
When possible , rating system , FAQ , QA , social media sections can be added to better serve the clients .
All websites should be made responsive and mobile-friendly as more people are accessing web via cell phones and tablets .
To make websites fast , secure , and hacker proof appropriate measurements can be implemented according to industry experts . ( like https , CDN etc . )
Copyright , terms and conditions , disclaimer etc . should be clearly stated in all websites of Bangladesh MOFA foreign missions .
All foreign missions can have web presence . At present , 17 embassies and consulates have no websites .
Online presence of nation like Bangladesh is very important as more and more people are seeking information online . For many investors , tourists , researchers , expatiates , businessmen a website is the first and prime source for information . Therefore , it will be wise for Bangladesh MOFA to create fast , secure , accurate , comprehensive and working websites for all of its embassies and consulates as soon as possible , including its own .
People who like Joseph Stalin the most of all the actors in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution now account for 24 percent of Russians , or three times more than the share of 8 percent registered in 1990 .

According to the poll conducted by the independent Levada research agency in March this year , 24 percent of Russians described Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin as a revolutionary with whom they sympathize .
At the same time the proportion of people who named their favorite character as Vladimir Lenin fell from 67 percent in 1990 to 26 percent this year . Other figures mentioned in this year 's poll were Tsar Nicolas II of Russia and the first head of the Bolshevik security service , Felix Dzerzhinsky – 16 percent each named them as their favorite participants in the 1917 turmoil .
Forty-two percent of those who took part in the 2017 poll said that in their opinion the fall of Russian monarchy that came as a result of the February 1917 bourgeois revolution was “ a very substantial loss. ” Twenty-seven years ago , only 11 percent of Russians held similar positions .
Some 49 percent of respondents in this year 's poll said the October Revolution played a positive role in history . Thirty percent described this role as negative , while 21 percent found the question too difficult to answer .

At the same time , 36 percent of respondents said that the Bolshevik Revolution gave Russia a major impetus for social and economic development . Fifty percent maintain that the country 's development after 1917 went on in accordance with the features and traditions of the Russian people , just as it had before .
Twenty-eight percent of respondents believe events similar to the 1917 Socialist Revolution could be repeated in modern-day Russia , and 59 percent described such scenario as improbable .
Last March , Levada conducted a separate poll dedicated solely to Stalin . Back then , 54 percent of respondents described their attitude to Stalin as positive , 17 percent said their attitude was negative , 32 percent said they were indifferent about the late Soviet dictator and 14 percent could not give a definitive answer .
The majority of respondents acknowledged that Stalin 's radical policies had caused millions of casualties among innocent Soviet citizens and mass violations of human rights . Two thirds of respondents agreed that Stalin was a tyrant and about half said that Stalinist purges were crimes .
However , 26 percent of respondents said that the repressions were caused by political expedience and should be justified from a historical perspective .
Hydrogen peroxide and silver really do react that way . The hydrogen peroxide has to be extremely concentrated for it to work -- around 90 percent , compared to drug store hydrogen peroxide that is sold at a concentration of 3 percent . If you have a 90-percent concentration like that , hydrogen peroxide makes a great rocket propellant !
Hydrogen peroxide 's chemical formula is H 2 O 2 . When it comes into contact with silver , the silver acts as a catalyst . The reaction frees the extra oxygen atom to produce water , and also generates a lot of heat . The heat turns the water into steam , which the engine can eject at a very high speed through a rocket nozzle .
Used in this way , hydrogen peroxide is a monopropellant . Compared to a normal rocket engine that burns two different chemicals ( a fuel and an oxidizer ) , a hydrogen-peroxide engine is very cool and relatively safe . It is also very easy to throttle .

Services
We reported on Thursday that the most experienced driver in the history of the sport had `` concluded '' his commentary contract with Brazil 's TV Globo .
Brazil 's UOL Esporte is now claiming Barrichello , 42 , fell out with the broadcaster due to `` relationship and contract '' problems , and also because he allegedly used his role to `` offer his services to F1 teams '' .
The report said the former Williams and Ferrari driver had trouble following some instructions , like calling Red Bull 'RBR ' instead of the name of the energy drink , for commercial reasons .
Coincidence ?
But the real trouble may have begun in Singapore last month , when Barrichello reportedly told Mercedes ' Toto Wolff he was `` ready and fit '' to become the dominant team 's reserve driver .
Barrichello reportedly also lobbied last year to make his return to F1 with Sauber .
`` According to insiders , '' UOL claimed , `` Barrichello never accepted that he is a former Formula One driver . Coincidence or not , that ( Singapore ) was his last outing as a broadcaster . ''
Breaching the conditions
The final straw may have been when Barrichello appeared as an online presenter , breaching the conditions of his exclusive contract with Globo .
`` UOL Esporte contacted Rubens Barrichello but received no response , '' said the report . Barrichello 's co-pundit and friend Luciano Burti also declined to comment .
Globo denied that its relationship with Barrichello had broken down , insisting the contract was concluded `` amicably '' .
BURBANK , CA—The long-standing economic , political and social divisions between blacks and whites in America at long last ended Monday with a TV producer 's casting of a black actor in a bit part as a teen computer-whiz archetype .
Though racial equality had , throughout U.S. history , been seen as little more than a distant dream , TV producer Fern Blochner—co-producer of such popular daytime teen `` dramedies '' as Crestwood Daze and Chillin ' Out In Study Hall—made that dream a reality when it came time to cast her newest series , My Home Ate My Dogwork , airing Saturday mornings on NBC .

`` You would n't normally think a black kid would be running a high-school computer lab , but we have one doing just that , '' Blochner said of her show , whose uplifting and dignified portrayal of black youths in America is being widely credited for the sudden flowering of racial justice and harmony across the nation . `` Our casting decision boldly defies the societal stereotype that black people are not smart enough to run high-school computer labs . ''
Shortly after the airing of the premiere episode of My Home Ate My Dogwork—in which the computer-whiz character is clearly visible in the background in no fewer than three separate scenes—the barriers of poverty , crime , and lack of equal access to education that have kept America 's blacks at a disadvantage came crashing down .
`` I 'll admit , I was a bit shocked when I found out I got the part , '' said Darrell Goodwin , the 17-year-old actor who plays the computer whiz . `` I thought to myself , 'The computer lab… run by a black kid ? How could this be ? ' Then I realized that the casting decision deliberately defied society 's racist expectations , expectations that I myself had bought into by doubting myself . ''

Though Blochner and her associates said they had reservations about the controversial casting decision , particularly regarding how others in the traditionally white entertainment industry would react , they held fast to their conviction that the teen computer whiz should be black .
`` We were worried that institutional , internalized racism on the part of industry executives might manifest itself in the form of opposition to our casting decision , '' Blochner said . `` But we stood our ground , and , as a result , such closed-mindedness is now a thing of the past . ''
Blochner said she came up with the idea to make the computer-whiz character black while doing background research for the show .

`` We wanted our show to be as accurate as possible , so we spent some time at New Trier High School in the affluent Chicago suburb of Winnetka to ensure authenticity , '' Blochner said . `` But after a few days at the school , we noticed a disturbing and unfair aspect of the upscale high school 's student demographic : There were no blacks . ''
`` We were very concerned that the high school had no black students , and that none of the students at the school had ever known any blacks , and that there were no blacks living anywhere within the neighborhoods zoned for the school , '' Blochner continued . `` We said to ourselves , 'This is unfair ! ' and were determined to change reality for the better . So we decided that in our fictional version of the school , we would put in a black kid , and we 'd make it seem like he 's smart , too . ''
Noted sociologist Edwin Hull explained how the producers of My Home Ate My Dogwork were able to bring about racial equality in the U.S .

`` By boldly envisioning a world in which African Americans possess the socioeconomic wherewithal not only to attend a high school like New Trier , but actually to run the computer lab therein , this television program created a 'positive media portrayal ' of African Americans , '' Hull said . `` This proactive portrayal of a positive African-American role model boosted the collective self-esteem of the nation 's African-American community , thus establishing racial harmony at last . ''
Hull noted that this strategy was similar to the one used by the 1998 Environmental Media Awards , at which episodes of Baywatch and The X-Files featuring pro-environment themes were credited with last year 's spontaneous healing of the ozone layer and the return of several dozen long-extinct species to the global ecosystem .
As public school students in New York state sit at their desks today taking the Common Core based English Language Arts tests , a nationally known opponent to the core is in Syracuse . Education Historian Dr. Diane Ravitch spent the day Tuesday at Syracuse University .
Ravitch , who has written about the issues and is the author of a very popular anti-Common Core blog , does n't have anything good to say about the new , more rigorous curriculum that 's taken over New York state classrooms . First there 's the way it was conceived .
`` The process was extremely secretive , it was done behind closed doors , '' Ravitch explained . `` There were few , if any teachers . I do n't think there were any teachers on the writing team . ”
Then there 's the way it was funded through the Gates Foundation .
`` It 's been estimated by people who study the Gates website that they spent $ 2.3 billion to create the Common Core , ” Ravitch said .
And because the experts were n't at the table , the curriculum is flawed .
“ I 'm talking about people with knowledge of disabilities . I 'm talking about people with experience with early childhood education , so many of the standards are completely developmentally inappropriate , ” Ravitch said .
So what are the results of the Common Core ? She says there 's an over reliance on testing .
“ They do n't have time to play , they do n't have time to socialize , it 's just all academics all the time , '' Ravitch explained . `` It 's totally inappropriate . Other countries just do n't do this . ”
She adds that the tests currently going on in classrooms across New York state are hurting education , because of a big focus on standardized testing .
“ School has to be not just work , work , work , '' Ravitch said . `` We do not live in just a Confucian society , we live in a society that was gloried in creativity and imagination . And all that joy of learning is being stamped out in this effort to crack down on kids and throw them in the pool and all that nonsense we hear coming from our state leaders . ”
Teachers are also leaving the profession .
`` Veteran teachers are leaving ; young people are seeing teaching as a stopgap until they find something else today . What 's going on in this country is the distraction of the teaching profession , ” she said .
And there 's a deepening of the division between rich and poor .
`` The children who will be left behind are the children in poverty , the children who need the most help will get the least help , and the children who are the winners , will be winners yet again , '' Ravitch said .
Ravitch noted that one of the big problems with this new curriculum is that it treats all children the same .
“ The assumption here is that all children are like molten metal , and they can be shaped and made exactly the same , '' she explained . `` And the assumption is wrong . I find myself wondering , first of all there were no teachers involved in writing the standards , but I do wonder if any of the people involved do have children or if their children are bound for Harvard , Yale and Princeton , so they think all children are like theirs . ”
And she 's not impressed by a portion of the state budget passed this week which delays inclusion of tests on student records for two years .
`` It 's simply to get through the elections , '' Ravitch said . `` To calm down the parents , your child wo n't be punished this year . Two years from now your child will be punished . ''
Ultimately , the way to improve education in this country is to attack the root of the problem , poverty and segregation , and she 's encouraged by the growing number of parents who are refusing to let their children take the test
`` Gosh , it took 70 years to get rid of the Soviet Union , lets hope it does n't take 70 years to get of this nonsense , '' Ravitch said . `` This is child abuse , this is wrong , this does n't improve education . ''
The New York Knicks ' collective state of mind is n't very good right now , as the team stumbles through a ton of early-season struggles . JR Smith told the press after last night 's crushing overtime loss at home to the Indiana Pacers , that he is in panic mode . Per ESPN : “ The Knicks ' 103-96 overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday was the team 's sixth in a row at Madison Square Garden . ‘ We 're frustrated , ' Smith said of where the team is mentally , despite most saying it 's too early to panic . ‘ Like you say , it 's too early to panic , but me , personally , I 'm panicking . I do n't like this . I do n't want to play 3-8 basketball , ' Smith continued , in regard to the Knicks ' record . ‘ I do n't want to play 50-50 basketball . If we 're going to be a championship-caliber team and call ourselves that , then we 've got ta play like that . It can be no other way . ' The Knicks played hard Wednesday and put forth the kind of effort that coach Mike Woodson wants to see on a regular basis . In several of their previous losses at home , the Knicks put forth lackluster effort and were n't competitive at times . ‘ I 'm proud of how we competed , ” Woodson said . ‘ That 's something I had n't seen a lot this early season , and that was New York Knick basketball . Unfortunately we 're a little snake-bitten right now in terms of getting over the hump . ' The Knicks are 2-5 since losing Tyson Chandler to a fractured right fibula . Carmelo Anthony had 30 points and 18 rebounds , and the Knicks led by three with 9.2 seconds left . But Iman Shumpert was called for a foul on a Paul George 3-point attempt , and George ( 35 points ) made all three free throws to force overtime . The Knicks put forth effort Wednesday night , but it has n't always been there this season . And that has been frustrating for Smith . ‘ Lack of intensity , ' Smith said . ‘ I hate to say it , but our defense 's backbone is on Tyson , and Tyson 's not here right now . And we know that , and he 's not going to be available for a few weeks now , so we 've got ta step it up individually . It 's a team game , but individually we 've got to take pride in guarding the ball , guarding our man . We have to enjoy stopping the other team . ' ”
There are wounds that do not heal . Forty years after the coup that ushered in a brutal , seven-year military dictatorship in Argentina , 12 Israelis who immigrated from that country are demanding that Jerusalem release documents on its ties with the junta .
Most members of the group lived in Argentina when the junta was in power , from March 1976 to December 1983 , and some of them lost family members in the “ Dirty War. ” But according to one member of the group , Jessica Nevo , 54 , “ It was only when we came here , to Israel , that we began to read in the foreign press what was happening there , in Argentina . We did n't know there were torture camps below the military bases . I learned about the defense ties with Israel only recently . ”
Eitay Mack , an Israeli lawyer who campaigns for transparency about the country 's defense exports , has filed Freedom of Information Law request with Israel 's defense and foreign ministries on behalf of the group . It demands the full disclosure of ties with the junta : arms sales , military installations built and operated by the state or Israeli companies and correspondence about Jewish political activists who were persecuted , detained or who disappeared during the junta era .
Even now , many of the Jews who lived through the period ask whether Israel did enough to rescue young Jews who were identified with leftist movements in Argentina and persecuted by the regime .
“ The aim is for us who live here — Israeli citizens who have chosen to be here and whose family members were murdered there — to feel that if we did n't do all we could have done at the time , at least we will atone for what happened and we will do everything to bring the truth to light , ” says journalist Shlomo Slutzky , 59 , who immigrated to Israel from Argentina a few weeks after the coup and is one of the group 's leaders .
Nevo , a Bar-Ilan sociologist and feminist peace activist , immigrated from Buenos Aires in 1978 , at age 16 . She says her family was harmed by the regime both directly and indirectly : One member of the group is Francisco Tolchinsky , a relative who came to Israel with his siblings after their parents were murdered by the junta . In the FOI request , he noted that while he has little hope of learning more about his parents , he hopes the information can contribute to a fuller understanding of that dark time .
“ I believe [ our request ] has moral significance . It could be old-fashioned but I think there 's a place for such things , so we can tell our children and grandchildren that we did something , ” says Slutzky , one of whose relatives are among the “ disappeared . ”

“ We want to know what happened to [ him ] — was Israel informed of his disappearance , was Israel asked to intervene in his behalf ? Did they do anything ? Maybe Israel did more than it 's ready to say , but this too must beknown , ” Slutzky says .
Nevo believes the truth will come out , even if their petition is denied . She says their FOI request sets a precedent , after which “ it will be impossible to continue to use the ‘ security ' mantra to hide the Israeli connection ” to the junta , adding , “ security is also knowing what happened there . ”
An estimated 30,000 people disappeared in the Dirty War , among them 2,000 Jews . The junta operated over 300 illegal detention sites . Torture was routine , including beatings , electric shocks and sexual assault .
Jessica Nevo , a member of the group that filed the freedom of information request . Moti Milrod
News of Israel 's ties to the junta is increasingly coming to light . In 2012 Argentina 's largest newspaper , Clarin , reported on retired Argentine pilots and military figures who testified that in 1982 they secretly flew to Israel , where they met with representatives from the military and defense manufacturers and returned with their plane loaded with light arms , mortars , air-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons .
According to Hernan Dobry 's book “ Operation Israel : The Rearming of Argentina During the Dictatorship 1976-1983 , ” the weapons were meant for use in Argentina 's war against Britain ( Falklands/Malvinas ) , and then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin was motivated primarily by anti-British sentiment . Israel also reportedly sent gas masks , land mines , radar equipment and tens of thousands of heavy coats for the war effort .
Testifying before Congress in 1981 , the U.S. deputy secretary of defense said that in the three years since the U.S. arms embargo on Argentina , Buenos Aires had bought some $ 2 billion in arms from Israel and European states . Other estimates put Israel 's total defense exports to the junta at about $ 700 million .
Mack , the lawyer who filed the request , says this one is different from his FOI requests over Israeli defense exports to states such as Burundi , Rwanda and South Sudan : This time the applicants are Israelis with relatives who murdered or disappeared , who do n't know whether Israel tried to save them or to help the junta .
“ Most of their parents ' generation is old or dead , and they have many questions . Now is the time to reveal the truth , so people can get some answers ” before they die , Mack says , adding that it 's also important for Israel to take responsibility and learn from its mistakes .
Also signatory to the request are Wanda Clara and Marcus Weinstein , of Buenos Aires . They want to know more about what happened to their son Mauricio , an Israeli citizen who was abducted in the Dirty War . In an email Marcus Weinstein , a physician , described street patrols and nighttime arrests and abductions of civilians . After being tortured , many were shot and killed or thrown out of helicopters into the sea .
Mauricio Weinstein was 18 , a senior in high school . On the evening of April 18 , 1978 he was at his father 's office , near his school , where he planned to sleep because he needed to go in early the next day .
The soldiers came to the home as the rest of the family sat down to eat with guests . “ They stood us up against the dining-room wall and took me in a car , with a pistol to my head , to my office . I was forced to open the door . My son was abducted , I saw them put him in a car , ” Marcus Weinstein wrote , adding that a few of his son 's classmates were also abducted that night .
“ Several months later , I heard he was in the El Vesubio camp , which the prisoners called ‘ hell . ' In July , apparently , he was ‘ transferred , ' that is , killed . ”
The Weinsteins contacted the authorities and also appealed to the local Jewish community and to Israel . Marcus Weinstein says he felt the Israeli diplomatic representatives cared little interest about the disappeared Jews , including his son and a second Israeli citizen . Today he wonders whether it 's possible to understand 38 years “ of suffering and memory , without truth or justice . ”
The event in Tel Aviv to mark the 40th anniversary of the military coup in Argentina , last week . Moti Milrod
Last week , Israel 's Meretz party and the World Union of Meretz held a memorial in Tel Aviv to mark the 40th anniversary of the coup in Argentina . It was called “ Nunca Mas ” ( never again , in Spanish ) .
The demand for disclosure is not without its critics in Israel 's Argentine community . Some fear it will hurt Israel 's international reputation , while others say there 's no point dwelling in the past . Better , they say , to remember the dead and the disappeared while focusing on safeguarding democracy and human rights in Israel and in Argentina .
But others say those with personal experience have a duty to gather information . “ I , who grew up as a teenager in Argentina , my memory is that it is forbidden to talk , to voice what you believe , ” says Nevo . “ This is something that you learn right away : Do n't say anything , do n't ask anything . The experience of growing up in a dictatorship has enabled me to recognize the concealed militarism here . I want answers . I want to know what 's in those documents . I want Israel to give an accounting . ”
In a response , the Defense Ministry confirmed it had received the FOI request and will attend to it in the usual manner .
Here it is , this week 's snapshot , going by the fancy name “ 15w46a ” is now available .

Murder plot allegation against fifth-graders stuns Washington town
Two fifth-graders in Colville , Wash. , may be charged with conspiracy to commit murder after a knife and gun are found in a backpack at school .
According to a court affidavit made public this week , the incident came to light shortly before 8 a.m. on Feb. 7 , when a fourth-grader told a teacher he had seen an 11-year-old boy with a knife .
Rasmussen said he would argue that the 10-year-old and his 11-year-old codefendant be held criminally responsible on charges of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and witness tampering — a charge filed after authorities said the boys promised to pay $ 80 to a student if he agreed not to tell anyone about the plot .
`` This was a plan . And it was a plan to kill , '' Stevens County prosecuting attorney Timothy Rasmussen said Thursday .
The boys last week confessed to plans to harm an additional six students at the school .
School authorities said two fifth-grade boys planned to use the weapons to lure another student outside the school and kill her `` because she was really annoying . ''
SEATTLE — In what has become a chillingly familiar event across the country , school authorities in eastern Washington recently discovered a gun and a knife in the backpack of a student . But what stunned the small town of Colville was whom the backpack belonged to : a 10-year-old student at Fort Colville Elementary School .
The teacher searched that boy 's backpack and that of his 10-year-old friend and found the weapons in the friend 's backpack . They included a knife with a 3¼-inch blade , a .45-caliber Remington 1911 semiautomatic handgun and an ammunition clip .
`` My background is a high school counselor and psychologist , and quite frankly , in 30-plus years , I never heard of anything like this at this age level , '' said Colville School Supt . Mike Cashion .
Rasmussen was also nonplussed .
`` To me , 10- and 11-year-olds do bad things , '' he said . `` They throw rocks through windows . They shoot BB guns at people 's cars . They hit people with sticks , they set a cat on fire . Those are things that children do . But this was a plot to kill . ''
When questioned separately shortly after the weapons were discovered , the boys admitted their plot , authorities said . `` I was going to kill her with the knife and [ the other boy ] was supposed to use the gun to keep anyone from trying to stop me or mess up our plan , '' the older boy told detectives .
When shown a class list , the boy identified six other classmates who were targeted .
The older boy said he had been friends with the girl for several months `` but that he hated her now . '' He said the girl `` had recently become rude and would pick on him . ''
`` The plan was nipped in the bud by other students who saw something and said something , '' Cashion said , adding that the school had been promoting a program that encourages students to report suspicious things .
Rasmussen said students younger than 8 were considered incapable of committing criminal acts in Washington state . For children between the ages of 8 and 12 , the law presumes they are similarly incapable but calls for the court to hold a hearing to determine whether they had the capacity to commit a crime . That hearing is set for Feb. 20 .
At a community meeting Wednesday night , Cashion said one parent expressed gratitude that because of the alertness of school staff , the gathering was a forum and not a funeral .
Another asked whether authorities would entertain the possibility of providing teachers with guns in the classroom . Cashion said he responded that the option was under consideration by the Legislature , but that most teachers were n't trained to use guns .
`` I told them I ca n't imagine a teacher taking a gun out , leveling it at a fifth-grader and killing them , '' he said . `` It 's the antithesis of what we are . ''

We all grew up hearing conflicting stories about the difference between luxury and off-brand items . Anecdotes like the idea that all potato chips are made in the same factory and the only difference between Frito and Kroger is the packaging they come in . Or other stories that off-brand meats are mixed with scraps of leather and only buying name-brand quality can ensure a man gets what he wants from a product .
There 's no definitive line that can be drawn saying that all luxury is the same product with better packaging , or that all generic items are inferior , dangerous products and should be avoided like the plague .
Instead , individual men need to adopt a mentality that 's old enough it 's become its own aphorism : Penny wise and dollar smart .
It 's easy for most men to see the importance of being penny wise . If I have $ 100 today and need a new pair of shoes , it 's in my best interest to buy a pair that costs less than $ 100 . I 'm not spending more than I have , and am I saving my pennies .
However , that pair of shoes that cost me less than $ 100 will most likely only last me for a year or two . After that I 'll have to purchase another pair , and then another after that . Whereas , had I instead invested in a pair of shoes that cost closer to $ 300 ( and ensured I was paying for a better shoe , not just a different name ) then I would be able to wear that same pair for years .
So the cheap shoes over ten years end up costing me a total of $ 500 , but the more expensive shoes only cost me $ 300 over the same period of time .
But even with that understanding in the back of his mind , there are a significant number of men who refuse to splurge on any item in their wardrobe or other aspect of their lives .
They claim they ca n't afford it now , they need an option now , and there 's nothing else to be done about it . They convince themselves that they do n't really need the superior quality because they 're easier on their shoes/car/suits/furniture than most men and the extra quality is n't a factor worth investing in . Some men will even avoid purchasing higher-end products out of a twisted sense of pride . Their ego is invested in their humility and they look down their noses at men who are “ slaves to luxury . ”
All of these may be valid reasons for avoiding particular purchases at particular times , but it is wise for a man to learn to control these impulses instead of being controlled by them . All of us will have the need for better quality throughout our lives . Once we recognize that and we learn what luxury items will improve our lives , we can start to make wiser purchases .
Knowing what a man needs in his life is obviously an individual undertaking and not something that can be summed up for all men on one website . But , what we can do is help illustrate what the major benefits are to investing in a higher-quality purchase .
That “ wool blend ” item that comes from certain retailers when a man buys one suit and gets seven free can be 98 % polyester and 2 % wool . Technically it is a wool blend , but only technically .
Let 's use suits as an example :
What many men fail to realize is that the cloth used in suits across the world varies greatly . That “ wool blend ” item that comes from certain retailers when a man buys one suit and gets seven free can be 98 % polyester and 2 % wool . Technically it is a wool blend , but only technically . Polyester may be more durable but it does n't breath well , it 's not as comfortable , and it gets a terrible sheen in places that see too much use and abuse .
Wool is more expensive to use because it 's more difficult to access . Mills have a limited number of sheep on a limited number of farms . Whereas polyester can be created night and day with fewer limitations .
So , it may be cheaper , and the suit may even be more durable ( arguably ) . But it wo n't look as good and it wo n't wear as comfortably – making it more of a pain to wear than a pleasure .
A cloth 's quality is n't the only factor in its price . Another large aspect is its rarity . The difference between cashmere and wool is a great example . Wool comes from sheep all over the world . There are wools that come from nearly every continent . However , cashmere is the product of a specific breed of goat – the cashmere goat . On top of that , cashmere is not a wool , it 's a hair .
The amount of usable hair per goat is smaller , the amount of overall goats is smaller , and this is what makes cashmere more expensive . There is more time and effort required to obtain enough material to make a suit . It costs the farmers more , it costs the mills more , it costs the suit maker more , and it costs the consumer more .
Some men value rarity for rarity 's sake . It 's what makes gold valuable . Others value an item despite its rarity and are willing to pay more for the benefits regardless .
Continuing with our suit comparison , it 's not just the cloth that determines the cost of a suit , but the way in which a suit is made .
Entire books have been written about all of the different aspects of quality suit construction . Rather than going into overt detail , check out this great summation from NPR .
The last reason men are willing to pay more for luxury may be considered shallow or vapid , but it is a valid reason for some – name brand . Our lives are largely driven by our relationships with other people . Family , friends , co-workers , acquaintances , competition , they all impact us .
Some men see a name brand as a tool in their tool bag . Customers can be convinced of the quality of a restaurant by the top-shelf drinks they serve . Clients can be convinced of a consultant 's success by the car he drives and the watch he wears .
Our brains try to be as efficient as possible . As a result , we often will make shortcut value associations and name brands help us accomplish just that . This is an amoral aspect of our lives and is something that can be used to a man 's advantage if he chooses to do so .
While learning where to invest in quality is one aspect of being dollar smart , its counterpart knows what purchases are still worth making as cheaply as possible . This especially holds true for a man 's wardrobe as a well-dressed man should have an intentional balance between timeless style and fashion .
Trendy or attention-seeking items are better off picked up on the cheap . Stacked bracelets , bright chinos , a loud blazer , and other pieces that fall more towards fashion than style wo n't see as much rotation in a man 's closet – making their durability and longevity less important .
Trendy or attention-seeking items are better off picked up on the cheap . Stacked bracelets , bright chinos , a loud blazer , and other pieces that fall more towards fashion than style wo n't see as much rotation in a man 's closet – making their durability and longevity less important . They also wo n't see as permanent of a stay in a man 's wardrobe . I love a good pair of bright blue chinos as much as the next style blogger , but I 'm under no delusion that I wo n't feel the same way ten years from now .
On the other hand , timeless items like well-made dress shoes , suits , sweaters , and coats typically will be more traditional in their styling . These same items can also see much more daily use and abuse – meaning it 's a better financial decision long term to invest in the highest quality a man can in the beginning .
Items that take a beating , things like bags , jeans , leather jackets , and others are also going to be worth investing in . In the long run , it 's a much better value proposition to buy an item nice and buy it once , then it is to have to continue to make upgrading purchases .
See how Saddleback Leather does n't cut corners .
Daily and simple things that see regular rotation are fine to save on . Underwear , T-shirts , socks , etc . are items that do n't see any major differences in either comfort or quality when the price goes beyond a certain point . A T-shirt from Target will fit just as well , feel just comfortable , and last as long as one from Prada .
The final piece to the puzzle of learning to invest in a quality wardrobe knows when to make those quality purchases . Just because a man wants to pay for quality items does n't mean he wants to pay more than he has to .
If a man is dead set on buying new items , his best option is to take advantage of sales . Those may be seasonal , related to holidays , or part of a promotion for a specific store . It does n't matter what the sale is , many of the best items still see severe mark-downs .
Another way to approach purchasing quality items is to continue the long-term mindset by buying out of season . Most retailers work with limited space and need to clear out items from each season to make room for what 's next . Buying a coat in the summer or swim trunks in the winter is a great way to capitalize on better prices for great items .
The only downside to this approach is that many items , such as suits and dress shoes , do n't change as much on a seasonal basis . That pair of of double monks wears just as well in the spring as it does in the fall , so waiting for it to be off season is a fruitless exercise .
The other route is to go after used purchases . Because quality items last so long and so well , it 's often easy to find them for very low prices and still in great quality . Options like eBay and thrift stores require a bit more digging , but when a good find is made , the cost per item is typically lower than through any other channel .
The key to all of this is for each man to take the time to make thought-out , deliberate decisions about what his best choices for long-term investments and the best ways to make those purchases . Each of us will have different needs , but each of us should buy the absolute best we can afford when the value is worth the price .
Leadership , integrity , courage … they 're the attributes of a good soldier … and qualities that can be put to use as part of the clean-energy revolution .
Just ask Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Barber . After more than 20 years of service , he 's retiring from the Army and transitioning to civilian life . But he plans to continue serving his country by joining the solar-energy workforce .
Barber got excited about renewable energy after watching the film “ An Inconvenient Truth. ” But he did n't know how to break into the industry .
Then , in a twist of fate , just as he was sharing his interest with his career transition counselor , she received a phone call about the Solar Ready Vets program .
Barber : “ I can just remember thinking to myself , OK this is God telling me , ‘ This is your place , this is what you need to be doing because you have a passion for it . ' ”
The Solar Ready Vets program is a collaboration between the Department of Energy and Department of Defense . The six-week program prepares veterans to join the solar industry as installation technicians , system inspectors , or sales representatives .
Now Barber 's eager to help spread the use of solar energy .
Barber : “ That 's what it 's about … leaving the world a little bit better for the people that come behind us . ”

A 10th elderly patient has died after being kept inside a nursing home that turned into a sweatbox when Hurricane Irma knocked out its air conditioning for three days , even though just across the street was a fully functioning and cooled hospital .
Hollywood police said Thursday in a news release that 94-year-old Martha Murray died Wednesday . They said her death was related to the problems at the facility following Irma . The first eight patients from the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills died Sept. 13 , three days after Irma struck . The ninth died Tuesday .
From the perspective of Florida Gov . Rick Scott and relatives of those at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills , criminal charges are warranted . But under Florida law , a prosecution might be difficult . Two of three ex-state prosecutors contacted by The Associated Press had doubts as to whether Dr. Jack Michel , the home 's owner , or any of his employees will be charged .
CONTINUE BELLOW AFTER THIS AD
All agreed that any criminal prosecutions will hinge on whether the nursing home staff made honest mistakes or were “ culpably negligent. ” Florida defines that as “ consciously doing an act or following a course of conduct that the defendant must have known , or reasonably should have known , was likely to cause death or great bodily injury . ”
Hollywood police and the state attorney 's office are investigating .
The home has said it used coolers , fans , ice and other methods to keep the patients comfortable — and that might be enough to avoid prosecution .
“ There is a difference between negligence , which is what occurs when you are not giving a particular standard of care vs. culpable negligence , ” said David Weinstein , a former state and federal prosecutor now in private practice . “ So if they are doing everything humanly possible given the circumstances and this all still happened it may be negligent and provide the basis for a civil lawsuit , but not enough for criminal charges . ”
Retired University of Florida law professor Bob Dekle , who prosecuted serial killer Ted Bundy as an assistant state attorney , said he doubted charges would be brought .
“ I would rather be a defense attorney on this case than a prosecutor , ” Dekle said . “ There are some cases that are better tried in civil court than criminal and this might be one of them . ”
Former U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey disagreed .
“ Given the magnitude of the tragedy and the apparent availability of a hospital 50 yards away , prosecutors are not going to accept that this was an unavoidable tragedy , ” he said .
Gary Matzner , the nursing home 's attorney , said in a statement that Michel and the staff are cooperating with the investigation .
“ The center and its employees and directors are devastated by this tragedy , ” he said .
Irma reached Broward County on Sept. 10 . The home has said a felled tree took out a transformer that powered the air conditioner , but it maintained power otherwise . It said it reported the loss to Florida Power & Light and was promised repairs in the next two days , but the utility never arrived .
Scott 's office said that over those two days , home administrators Jorge Carballo and Natasha Anderson were in contact with the state about the failed air conditioner but never said the situation had become dangerous . The state said they were told to call 911 if needed .
On the afternoon of Sept. 12 , the home borrowed portable air coolers from Memorial Regional Hospital , the trauma center across the street . Later that night , home administrators said , a physician 's assistant checked the patients and none were overheated and the building temperature never exceeded 80 degrees . Under state law , the temperature was not supposed to exceed 81 degrees .
In the early hours of Sept. 13 , the deaths began . Three 911 calls were made before 6 a.m. , causing Memorial staff to rush across the street to offer assistance . Doctors and nurses said they found the home 's staff working to cool the patients , although they and police have said the facility was very hot .
No temperature reading has been released as police have said that is part of the investigation .
Three people died on the home 's second floor and seven succumbed at the hospital , including the two who died Tuesday and Wednesday . The state said four of the deceased had body temperatures between 107 ( 41.6 Celsius ) and 109 ( 42.7 Celsius ) degrees .
Dr. Randy Katz , the hospital 's emergency director , said last week it was impossible to say whether any of the dead would have survived if they had gotten to the hospital hours earlier .
The number of deaths and injuries could be a determining factor in whether to bring charges . Weinstein said prosecutors could argue that after the first patients became seriously ill , administrators should have known an evacuation was necessary . Dekle agreed the number could be key .
“ The more dead victims there are in a homicide case , the less likely a jury is to find reasonable doubt , ” Dekle said .

Is It a Crime the Death of 10 Patients at Nursing Home at Hollywood Hills ? From the perspective of Florida Gov . & relatives , criminal charges are warranted
In a world where Godzilla has dominated our pop culture conversation for more than 50 years , it 's a shock that this will be the first time it 's been made into an anime .
The Godzilla : Planet of the Monsters CG-anime hybrid is the byproduct of Netflix , Toho Animation , and Polygon Pictures — part of a new era for both the kaiju monster himself and the world of anime . The reptilian giant was borne from the Japanese movie industry in the 1950s , making his way across the Pacific to the U.S. and back multiple times in live-action . Now , he 's back in Japan in his first anime iteration .
Watch the Godzilla Planet of the Monsters Trailer
The Japanese-language trailer released by the Toho Animation YouTube channel features more monster action than the first cryptic trailer that premiered two months ago . Here we see a futuristic vision of an Earth ravaged by Godzilla , as humankind struggles for survival , building giant mecha robots ( not unlike those in Pacific Rim ) and pterodactyl-like mech machines to fight the kaiju . But Godzilla is not without his own defenses — Godzilla has the power to shoot deadly blue lasers out his mouth , in addition to being a giant lizard .
And because this is an anime film , we ca n't have all this action without it being set to a cursory J-pop song ( “ White Out ” by Xai ) .
Netflix has been making moves in the Japanese anime industry lately , which has disrupted the notoriously low-wage business . Godzilla is part of a slate of 12 original anime series that the streaming giant plans to release over the year , original and outsourced content included . The experimentation in the heavily CG-ified anime style of Godzilla : Planet of the Monsters is the first sign of this anime industry shift — because of the fast turnaround of the industry , animators usually put out shoddy work . While the heavy CG in Godzilla is a little jarring ( and could use with a few tune-ups itself ) , this is a promising new direction for an industry that has suffered from bad press due to its treatment of animators and their budgets .
Here 's the synopsis for Godzilla : Planet of the Monsters :
Since it was first released as a feature film in 1954 , “ Godzilla ” has become a colossal cultural icon loved by millions around the world . The 2016 release of “ SHIN GODZILLA ” , directed by Hideaki Anno , reinvigorated the franchise with a novel and realistic depiction of the iconic monster story , earning 82.5 million US dollars at the box-office and capturing the imagination of new and old fans alike . Now in 2017 , GODZILLA evolves in an unexpected direction as a feature-length animated film . The animated movie takes the franchise into uncharted territory — a harsh world of the future in which Godzilla has dominated the Earth for the past 20,000 years , and a fateful final confrontation with mankind looms . Prepare for the earth-shattering roar of a brand new GODZILLA , unlike anything heard or seen before .
Godzilla : Plant of the Monsters is written by Gen Urobuchi and Sadayuki Murai , and directed by K ? bun Shizuno and Hiroyuki Seshita .
Godzilla : Planet of the Monsters will be released on Netflix sometime in 2018 , after its Japanese theatrical run begins on November 17 , 2017 .

His University of Nevada Wolf Pack teammates called him “ Flint , ” because all it took was one catch for him to fire up the offense . Now , his New England Patriots teammates call him “ Sunshine , ” because his long locks draw resemblance to Ronnie Bass from Remember the Titans .
But regardless of the nicknames he has been given , tight end Zach Sudfeld is trying to make his own name in the NFL . And that begins with him making New England 's 53-man roster as an undrafted rookie .
Not so long ago , just being in NFL training camp seemed like an unfathomable opportunity for the Modesto , Calif. , native .
After redshirting during his walk-on freshman season in 2007 , shoulder , wrist and knee problems kept Sudfeld off the field for all of 2008 . By the 2009 season , No . 44 had recovered and fought his way onto the field via special teams . Then in 2010 , Sudfeld was able to record four starts as well as his first collegiate catch .
His redshirt senior campaign of 2011 was materializing into a promising one . Sudfeld had earned the starting nod in the season opener against Oregon . He registered a reception early on , too .
Ultimately , Sudfeld 's three-yard grab would end up being his first and final statistic of the 2011 season . Plays later , his leg encountered the wrong end of a block .
It snapped completely .
The 6 ' 7 ” , 260-pounder left that game versus the Ducks on a stretcher . With four surgeries already on his college resume , there was a strong possibility that the then-fifth-year senior would never play football again .
Although for Sudfeld , that possibility was something he refused to let become a reality .
Following a fifth and sixth surgery , Sudfeld was back rehabbing , determined to make a go of whatever chance he had left . The NCAA granted him a chance in the form of a medical hardship , which meant that Sudfeld found himself with a sixth year of college eligibility .
He made it count .
As a veteran member of Nevada 's Pistol offense , Sudfeld hauled in 45 passes for 598 yards and eight touchdowns in 2012 . In the process , the can't-miss target garnered recognition as a Mackey Award semifinalist — an award bestowed upon the best tight end in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision .
He caught passes . He blocked for ball-carriers . He did whatever head coach Chris Ault needed him to do during his time in Reno . Nevertheless , with an injury history as long as a grocery list , even a 4.71 40-yard dash , a 7.00 three-cone time and a 9 ' 5 ” broad jump at his pro day could n't get Sudfeld drafted come April .
The Patriots took an interest in the hours after , and Sudfeld has been a storyline worth monitoring ever since . Yet in order to understand what kind of player Sudfeld could potentially become for the Patriots , it 's important to understand what kind of player Sudfeld was for the Wolf Pack .
He was — and is — a player of three dimensions .
First Dimension : After the Catch
Jason Phillips — a former NFL wideout and current Southern Methodist offensive coordinator — once said , “ I 'm looking for playmakers . I 'm not looking for possession receivers . I can find tight ends to do that . ”
What Phillips meant is that being an effective pass-catcher is about more than catching the pass . It 's about staying on your feet , turning upfield and making a play .
The question is : What if wide receivers are n't the only ones who can serve as playmakers ?
Against Air Force on Oct. 26 , 2012 , Sudfeld provided some food for thought .
On a 2nd-and-7 , Sudfeld set up off-line as part of Nevada 's “ 12 ” personnel with one running back and two tight ends . Countering that , the Falcons operated out of a 3-3 front with the safeties cheating up .
The defense 's bunched look permitted Sudfeld to quietly slip out to the flats as quarterback Cody Fajardo took the snap from shotgun and delivered the ball his way .
Sudfeld twisted his head around just as the pass sailed in . He reached his arms back and secured the ball palms-up . It was swift catch that needed to be , seeing how two Air Force defenders were closing in .
Even with the ball thrown behind him , Sudfeld 's feet stayed active through reception . He did n't slow down . In turn , he gave himself enough time pick up the first down and redirect as a defensive back approached . But with Sudfeld headed outside the numbers and the defensive back headed towards the sideline , the tight end was able to maneuver past the tackle with a stiff arm .
Sudfeld 's subtle turn and push-off propelled him up for another 13 yards . His vision through the defense netted a 20-yard gain before he was finally brought down at the 50 .
Making plays after the catch is critical to an offense 's success . So when a tight end is able to do so just as well as a wide receiver , it adds another element to the passing attack .
Second Dimension : Blocking
The value of the tight end position is ever-changing along with the rise of pass-first offenses from high school to the pros . Nonetheless , at the position 's very core is the prerequisite of blocking .
In a November interview with Wolf Pack Athletics , Sudfeld reaffirmed that sentiment and explained its merit in the Nevada football program :
“ A Nevada tight end is n't just someone who catches the ball . You better be able to block , ” Sudfeld said . “ That 's something you learn when you first get here . If you ca n't block , you do n't get to see the field . ”
With seasoning , Sudfeld proved he could block . He showcased his ability to do so versus Boise State on Dec. 1 of 2012 .
Aligned as an H-back on a 3rd-and-5 , Sudfeld was orchestrated to pull to the right C-gap after Nevada 's slot receiver went in motion through the backfield . The plan was to deceive the Broncos ' 3-3 “ Under ” defense enough so that the zone blocking scheme could create an opening on the right side of the field for a QB keeper .
It worked . Fajardo took the snap and faked the handoff to Stefphan Jefferson , all while Sudfeld swung in front .
Sudfeld quickly manned his territory , sunk his hips and zeroed in on the weakside linebacker . Fajardo followed his lead .
Sudfeld engaged his block , managing to stay as low as his long frame would allow him to . It was n't clear-cut leverage victory for Sudfeld , it was simply enough for Fajardo to evade through the second level behind him .
Sudfeld fell to the turf as his knee bend carried his momentum off-kilter . Still , his efforts came to fruition with a fresh set of downs , and then some .
Thanks to Sudfeld 's lane-clearing , Fajardo scrambled through the defense for a gain of eight and a first .
Sudfeld may not be the most powerful blocker . He may not be ideal for in-line pass protection , either . That being said , he is very difficult to fend off when he is running downhill . And in Nevada 's fast-paced offense , he was running downhill a lot .
The gameplan was tailored to his skill set . His efficiency confirmed that .
According to Ben Volin of The Boston Globe , Sudfeld graded out as a 94.6 percent blocker last fall . He led all FBS tight ends with 24 blocks resulting in scores ; 19 of which came during run plays , five of which came during pass plays .
Not bad for a guy who could only muster 11 bench reps of 225 pounds at his pro day .
Third Dimension : End Zone
With his high school basketball background and his height equivalent to an NBA small forward , Sudfeld wears a bull 's eye on the football field . That bull 's eye is magnified near the end zone . Sudfeld averaged one touchdown every 5.6 receptions in 2012 and had a five-game TD streak from Sept. 15 to Oct. 13 .
He hit a dry spell over his next five contests , but Sudfeld found pay dirt once again versus the Arizona Wildcats in the Gildan New Mexico Bowl on Dec. 15 of 2012 .
On a 1st-and-10 at the Wildcats ' 28-yard line , Sudfeld stood in a three-point stance opposite Arizona 's outside linebacker . The “ Y ” tight end was prepared to run a wheel route off the edge .
As Fajardo handled the snap , Sudfeld burst out of his stance and brushed his arms around the inside shoulder of his man . That rapid release and physical push-off left the backer on all fours while Sudfeld remained on his two feet .
Out of his initial three steps , the route-runner kept his pad level low to gain acceleration towards the open field .
By running to the outskirts , Sudfeld generated a size mismatch that could be exploited . Fajardo exploited it , taking a shot deep down the right sideline .
Strides ahead of the defensive back shading him , Sudfeld rotated his head back towards to football . The key was for him to maintain straight-line speed while tracking the ball .
The smaller defensive back was unable to do the same .
Sudfeld increased separation while setting his eyes forward . Looking overhead , he watched the ball spiral into his open hands and harnessed the catch through to the end zone . It was good for a 28-yard score .
With the Patriots ' tight end depth in a state of uncertainty , Sudfeld 's unexpected arrival could give way to unexpected emergence .
He is oft-injured and he is lean in terms of upper-body strength . But what the 24-year-old brings to the table is multifaceted upside . He 's mobile with the ball in hands , he 's an aggressive blocker , he 's a red-zone threat .
While expectations must be tempered , there 's reason to believe Sudfeld will do more than make New England 's final roster in September .
There 's reason to believe he will make an impact .

Browsing the Coachella 2017 lineup when it was released last week , two names stood out .
Namely , Tennis and Big Gigantic .
Both these bands are from Colorado , from scenes I became very familiar with when I covered them as a Colorado-based entertainment journalist from 2009 to 2014 . Big Gigantic rose from the state 's understated electronica scene to become a festival mainstay and high-powered headliner , while Tennis is a critically respected indie-pop darling .

Two other Denver bands , the Lumineers and Nathaniel Rateliff & The Nightsweats , had big enough years to justify a lineup slot .

The Denver metro area has a population of about 2.7 million people , while metro Phoenix has about 3.25 million people . Big Gigantic is from Boulder and is not part of the Denver metro area ; the college town has a population of 97,000 . Compare that to Tempe , with a population of 162,000 .
With so many more people in the urban and college areas of Arizona , this begs the question : Why are n't there any Copper State bands at Coachella ?
I scoured Coachella lineups going back to 2010 for any sign of the Valley , and I came up empty-handed . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I do n't think any band that formed in Phoenix has played Coachella for a very long time — at least seven years .
Update : Since this piece published , I 've been informed that I missed Jimmy Eat World , which played the fest in 2011 , and Z-Trip in 2010.And had I gone back to 2009 , I would have spotted Phoenix band Dear and the Headlights . Tucson band Calexico also played in 2009 . Mea culpa .
The closest thing to a Phoenix band to appear at Coachella in recent years is the band Phoenix , and they 're from France . In 2016 , Pinetop native Zella Day , who took guitar lessons in Phoenix as a teenager , played the festival , and Puscifer , which you could say is based out of Maynard James Keenan 's house in Jerome , played in 2013 .
That 's it .
It might seem foolhardy and futile for Phoenix bands to chase national attention . Why not build up what we have in the hopes that if we build a vibrant enough scene , the rest of the country will notice ? But Coachella is the biggest and most important music festival in the United States , and as such serves as a barometer for the visibility of the local scene . And by that metric , we 're not doing well .
I can think of at a few reasons as to why this might be the case . These are just educated guesses .
Phoenix 's lack of density really harms the music scene . It 's the really dense cities that tend to produce bands that make a splash nationally . Take a look of this population density map and look at the darkest ( most dense ) cities : New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , even Boston , New Orleans , Miami , and San Francisco all are known to some degree for their music scenes . Then take a look at the light blue dots in the Phoenix area . We 're a city of endless suburbs , with hardly any density to be found .
Phoenix lacks the infrastructure to send bands to major festivals like Coachella . If bands stay local , then they do n't have a chance to develop contacts with people in Los Angeles , which seems to be a must for anyone looking to make a splash nationally . But I 'll admit this argument has flaws — why go to LA when bands can upload a YouTube video and build a national audience via the internet ? Still , perhaps there 's some truth to the Bible quote being thrown around the local hip-hop scene with anti-local venom : `` no prophet is accepted in his hometown . ''
Phoenix has n't produced a successful enough band to play Coachella . If the internet has eliminated the need to move to the coasts to make it big , then the only remaining answer is that Phoenix bands just have n't reached the level of popularity necessary to get noticed by Coachella organizers . It 's not for lack of talent — a listen to some of the best albums produced by Phoenix bands in 2016 will dissuade anyone from that notion . But still , few of those bands made much of a splash outside the desert , and some are downright obscure here .
Phoenix bands do n't sound like Coachella bands . Perhaps there 's a certain mainstream-appealing sound that Coachella organizers are looking for , something that will attract people from all over the country . And maybe Phoenix bands just are n't making it .
Hate it or love it , the fact that so few bands ever make it big while staying local to Phoenix creates a disincentive . If talented musicians look around them and see none of their peers making a comfortable living playing music in Phoenix , why should they stay ? That 's why promising young artists like Wolvves and Futuristic and Sincerely Collins and Luna Aura and Bogan Via and countless others move to LA or New York . And until some of the great local bands here start scoring slots on national festivals , why should they stay ?
NewsPolitics - U.S .
October 7 , 2016 ( LifeSiteNews ) — A Trump-Pence administration will “ err on the side of freedom ” when it comes to religious liberty and empower local communities to address issues of bathroom privacy because the government “ has no business imposing its will or its values ” in that arena , Gov . Mike Pence told Dr. James Dobson on his radio show Wednesday .
Pence and his wife , Karen , were guests on the pro-family leader 's Family Talk show . Pence told Dobson that Donald Trump will appoint judges “ to the Supreme Court and all of our courts in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia . ”
“ I could n't be more proud to stand with him [ on ] that , ” Pence said .
The Republican vice presidential nominee blasted the HHS abortion and contraception mandate that is attempting to force the Little Sisters of the Poor and many other faith-based institutions to formally cooperate via their employee health plans in the provision of life-ending drugs and devices .
“ What I can tell you is that a Trump-Pence administration will be dedicated to preserving the liberties of our people , including the freedom of religion that 's enshrined in our bill of rights , ” Pence said . “ We have a long tradition in this country of accommodating religious belief and respecting religious belief . But under this administration , you 've seen the heavy hand of government — whether it be in the Hobby Lobby case or whether it be in the Little Sisters of the Poor [ case ] — where there is an unwillingness by the administration to accommodate the religious sensibilities and convictions of ministries or private organizations . ”
“ Our administration 's going to err on the side of freedom , ” he continued . “ We 're going to err on the side of protecting the liberties of our people . ”
The imposition of transgenderism on the country and new regulations attempting to force employers to fund “ sex change ” surgery are “ such an example of ” how under the Obama administration , there is “ no area of our lives too small to … regulate , no aspect of our Constitution too large for them to be willing to ignore . ”
“ Donald Trump and I both believe [ these issues ] not only can be resolved with common sense at the local level , but they are every single day , ” Pence said . “ They should be resolved with the safety and well-being of our children first and foremost , their privacy interest and rights , and with common sense . Donald Trump and I simply believe that all of these issues are best resolved at the state level by the people of communities . ”
Blasting the “ heavy hand and liberal agenda ” of the Obama administration , Pence said , “ We 'll educate all of our kids , we 'll figure our way through these issues , but Washington has no business imposing its will or its values on communities around the nation . ”
Pence said the administration under which he would be vice president would address issues of clashes between religious liberty and alleged discrimination through the courts , as has been “ done throughout the history of this nation . ”
“ I truly believe that ensuring that we have people appointed to the court who will respect our Constitution and respect the God-given liberties that are enshrined there is very much , very much on the ballot this year , ” he said .
Geophysical Warfare -- `` Rainmakers . '' During the Vietnam Conflict , our warfighters needed a way to interdict enemy traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail . `` Project Popeye '' helped answer the call . China Lake adapted its cloud seeding technologies to enhance rainfall thereby significantly deterring enemy activity on the trail . This highly successful China Lake technology was also used in hurricane abatement , fog control , and drought relief .
The press stories led to demands from members of the U.S. Congress , led by Senator Claiborne Pell , for more information . U.S. House and Senate resolutions in favor of banning environmental warfare were passed as Senate Resolution 71 on July 11 , 1973 , H.R . 116 of 1974 , H.R . 329 of 1974 and H.R . 28 of 1975 .
The initial area of operations was the eastern half of the Laotian panhandle . On 11 July 1967 , the operational area was increased northward to around the area of the 20th parallel and included portions of far western North Vietnam . In September 1967 , The Shau Valley in South Vietnam was added to the operational area . Operations over North Vietnam were eliminated on April 1 , 1968 concurrent with conventional bombing restrictions being put into effect . The southern region of North Vietnam was added to the operational area on September 25 , 1968 and then removed on November 1st of that year concurrent with a halt to conventional bombing of North Vietnam . In 1972 , most of northeastern Cambodia was added to the operational area ,
Starting on March 20 , 1967 and continuing through every rainy season ( March to November ) in Southeast Asia until 1972 , operational cloud seeding missions were flown . Three C-130 aircraft and two F4-C aircraft based at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base Thailand flew two sorties per day . The aircraft were officially on weather reconnaiseance missions and the aircraft crews as part of their normal duty generated weather report information . The crews , all from the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron , were rotated into the operation on a regular basis from Guam . Inside the squadron , the rainmaking operations were code-named `` Motorpool '' .
During October 1966 , Project Popeye was tested in a strip of the Laos panhandle east of the Bolovens Plateau in the Se Kong River valley . The test was conducted by personnel from the Naval Ordnance Test Station located at China Lake California . Fifty cloud seeding experiments were conducted with the result that 82 % of the clouds produced rain within a brief period after having been seeded . It was claimed that one of the clouds drifted across the Vietnam border and dropped nine inches of rain on a US special forces camp over a four hour period . After the successful completion of the test phase , Project Popeye transitioned from an experiment to an operational program of the U.S. Defense department .
Robert S. McNamara , U.S. Secretary of Defense , was aware that there might be objections raised by the international scientific community but said in a memo to the president that such objections had not in the past been a basis for prevention of military activities considered to be in the interests of U.S. national security .
Project Popeye was an experiment in increased rainfall through cloud seeding jointly approved by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Defense . The technical aspects of the experiment were verified by Dr. Donald F. Hornig , Special Assistant to the President of the United States for Science and Technology . The government of Laos was not informed of the project , its methods or its goals .
Operation Popeye ( Project Popeye/Motorpool/Intermediary-Compatriot ) was a US military cloud seeding operation ( running from March 20 , 1967 until July 5 , 1972 ) during the Vietnam war to extend the monsoon season over Laos , specifically areas of the Ho Chi Minh Trail . The operation seeded clouds with silver iodide , resulting in the targeted areas seeing an extension of the monsoon period an average of 30 to 45 days . As the continuous rainfall slowed down the truck traffic , it was considered relatively successful . The 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron carried out the operation to `` make mud , not war . ''
One Friday morning in June , two Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents tried to conceal themselves in a courtroom vestibule , where a “ No standing ” sign was taped to the wall . Hidden from the view of everyone in Queens Criminal Courtroom AP8 , the agents could see and faintly hear who was being called before the judge 's bench , including a 29-year-old Chinese woman who expected to have her case resolved that day . She had no idea ICE was there to arrest her .
The woman 's Legal Aid Society attorney learned of ICE 's plans from Queens Criminal Court Judge Toko Serita . The judge was under no obligation to share this information ; Legal Aid Criminal Defense Practice attorney-in-charge Tina Luongo later said at a City Council hearing that by doing so , the judge “ probably broke a rule. ” The woman 's attorneys had to act quickly : After Judge Serita called her case , the woman would be fair game for ICE . The public defenders made the desperate decision to ask the judge to set bail in her case , and through a Mandarin interpreter they explained the situation . In the custody of a city court or in jail , it would be much harder for ICE to arrest her . Minutes later , the woman was taken into custody by court officers . Kate Mogulescu , the Criminal Defense Practice supervising attorney , who was there that day , later told the City Council , “ This was terrifying for our client and her family . ”
The plainclothes immigration agents refused to produce identification , according to Mogulescu . She approached one of the agents , who she said told her his last name was Lee and that he was there for several women in AP8 , though he would not say whom — nor did he produce warrants or any paperwork for those women . Later that day , Legal Aid staff said , they saw that the same ICE team had taken two other people into custody from outside the Queens courthouse . Once it appeared ICE was gone , they asked for the Chinese woman 's case to be called again . She was then released from custody .
ICE 's attempt to arrest this woman made local headlines , but the stories had few details about the agency 's target . She had been arrested by the NYPD in February in Queens and charged with prostitution and practicing massage without a license , a common allegation after police raid massage parlors . This arrest is how she ended up in AP8 , one of New York 's human trafficking intervention courts , and how she came to be described in statements to the press as a victim of human trafficking — though she had made no statements of her own .
A human trafficking intervention court does not prosecute people for trafficking . The “ intervention ” in the name begins with vice officers , after they place someone accused of prostitution offenses in handcuffs . “ By and large , we work under the assumption that anyone who 's charged with this kind of crime is trafficked in some way , ” Judge Judy Harris Kluger , one of the court 's prominent advocates , told the City Council in 2013 . The courts , she has written , are meant to treat those arrested as “ victims , not defendants . ”
Now ICE has signaled that it will use the trafficking courts as a way to stalk immigrants . As Legal Aid 's client learned , ICE wields terrifying power in these courts : Agents will try to take people away from the defense attorneys standing at their sides , and without a warrant . People can then disappear into the immigration detention system , where they are not currently guaranteed the same rights to legal representation . As it stands , defendants risk being released from criminal court right into the custody of ICE . “ This is an agency that zealously guards its ability to arrest anyone that it wants , wherever it wants to do it , ” Andrew Wachtenheim , supervising attorney at the Immigrant Defense Project , testified before City Council in June .
On a blistering-hot morning just six days after ICE showed up at the Queens trafficking court , dozens of community activists flanked members of the council , including Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito , on the steps of City Hall . “ To target a survivor of human trafficking as she benefits from a highly specialized court program to help survivors rebuild their lives is indefensible , ” Mark-Viverito said . “ We will not allow this to stand . ”
Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito on ICE 's courthouse arrests : `` We will not allow this to stand . '' William Alatriste/New York City Council
But in addition to the outrage expressed at ICE arresting immigrants in this sanctuary city , there is a question worth asking : how and why those immigrants came to be in trafficking court in the first place . The vast majority — 91 percent — of Legal Aid clients charged with unlicensed massage are not U.S. citizens , Mogulescu told the City Council .
Immigrants , like the other defendants in trafficking court , got there the same way : through arrests . “ While we share in all of the outrage and shock that this happened in the human trafficking intervention court , we really ca n't be very surprised , ” Mogulescu said . “ This is a question of arrest policy , and who is brought into criminal court as sitting ducks for ICE enforcement . ”
On average , the NYPD arrests three people a day — 1,196 in 2015 , according to data obtained by the Legal Aid Society from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services — for offenses related to selling sex , including prostitution , “ loitering for the purpose ” of prostitution , and “ unauthorized practice of a profession ” ( the charge used in massage parlor raids ) .
The day after the City Hall press conference , Judge Serita would hear another thirty or so cases in her trafficking court . Waiting their turn on the wooden benches , the defendants sat solo and in pairs . It was not unusual to see one woman stick around until another 's case was called ; they 'd watch each other 's bags , exchange commentary between cases , and leave together . The defendants the week after ICE turned up were Asian , Latina , and black , which also was n't unusual . Most of the defendants asked for an interpreter — Chinese , Korean , Spanish . One defendant almost missed her case when the court officer fumbled with her name . Another woman two rows back called out to her in time for her to rush up to the bench .
Judge Serita 's demeanor throughout was warm but practiced . She offered variations of the same phrase : “ If you stay out of trouble and lead a law-abiding life , your case will be dismissed. ” If you take at face value the court 's mission to treat people as victims and not criminal defendants , it 's a strange thing to say . Women engaged in prostitution , the court 's advocates argue , do n't have a choice when it comes to the offenses they stand accused of . How are they then supposed to choose to lead “ law-abiding lives ” as the judge orders ?
These defendants ' victim status is conditional : not only on agreeing to “ stay out of trouble , ” but on attending multiple sessions with one of the agencies Serita assigns them to based on their case . Then they return to court , where the judge reads a report on their progress . The judge can decide if their case will be sealed or if she will mandate more sessions . On that day , the week after ICE targeted her court , Serita saw defendants she had mandated to six , eight , or even twelve sessions . If defendants fail to complete the sessions , or if they fail to appear again in court , a warrant could be issued for their arrest .
When the statewide rollout of the trafficking courts was announced in 2013 , they were heralded as a new approach to addressing prostitution charges . This new approach has not been accompanied by a new approach to policing . Since 2013 , some prostitution arrests have gone up , and dramatically in Asian immigrant communities , like charges for “ unauthorized practice of a profession , ” the same offense the woman targeted by ICE faced . In 2012 , there were just 31 such arrests of Asian-identified people in New York City , according to a 2017 report from the Urban Institute and the Legal Aid Society ; in 2016 , the NYPD arrested 631 Asian-identified people for this offense . Overall arrests of Asian-identified people in New York City charged with both unlicensed massage and prostitution increased by 2,700 percent between 2012 and 2016 .
In trafficking court , judges do n't get into the particulars of these arrests . “ I 'm gon na try to stay out of trouble , ” one of the Queens AP8 defendants was heard to say as she left court . “ But I ca n't promise. ” No one in this court could . The defendants walking out with their cases sealed have every reason to believe they could be arrested again , so long as the police treat any past prostitution arrest as a reason to lock them up . As the Voice has reported , this is all too common : A group of women is suing the city over what looks like the standard police practice of profiling women based on their race , gender , and past arrests , even those who have gone through trafficking court .

Even before that suit , the City Council was aware of the problems with prostitution arrests . In 2015 , at a special hearing on the trafficking courts , Jessica Peñaranda , special project coordinator at the Urban Justice Center 's Sex Workers Project ( SWP ) , testified , “ While we support the basic tenets of the courts as a way to reduce the harm and risk of exploitation of sex workers and trafficking victims , our extensive experience informs a strong belief that arresting individuals is not the most effective way. ” Peñaranda added that one defendant had told SWP that , during a raid , an undercover officer had commented , “ If it was n't for us finding you , you would be dead . ”
At the same hearing , Audacia Ray , then the director of the Red Umbrella Project ( RedUP ) — a group led by people in the sex trade , including those who have been arrested and sent to the courts — also testified . “ The assumption is embedded in the system right now that arresting folks is rescue and is a way to get people into services , ” Ray told the council . “ There has been a lot of talk today about the violence of the sex industry and the trauma people face….For us , experiences in the courts and experience with the police — that is trauma and violence . ”
Judges know , intimately , the risks that come with these courts . Though ICE 's presence in the trafficking courts is a recent development , deportation is not a new threat faced by defendants . “ You understand that if this happens again , ” Judge Serita told a defendant in 2013 when a reporter was present , “ the offer that is being made now might not happen , and if there are immigration issues you can be deported. ” At the press conference to protest ICE actions in the trafficking courts , Kluger — one of the architects of the courts — told reporters that the agency 's actions were a “ violation. ” But then she was asked : If that 's so , why does the NYPD continue to arrest victims of trafficking ?
Kluger , who now heads Sanctuary for Families , which offers services to trafficking court defendants , tried to bat the question away : “ Well , ” she said , “ that 's a whole other issue. ” Pressed , Kluger added that while she did n't think they should be arrested , “ You 'd have to direct that to NYPD . ”
A recent city criminal justice reform commission has , in fact , recommended that the state legislature remove prostitution laws from the books . At the time , Kluger responded to this announcement by claiming the human trafficking courts were “ in essence decriminalizing prostitution offenses. ” But that 's not the case : Without the NYPD 's prostitution arrests , the trafficking courts would be empty ; there would be no defendants in the courts for ICE to so easily target .

OK , so I 've been sucked into the vortex that is Pinterest . Go ahead . Judge me . I wo n't share the spanakopita recipe I found that makes the best cheesy spinachy goodness you will ever taste . So there .
Yes , Pinterest is making my ass grow .
But that 's not my problem . The real problem ? The kids on Pinterest .
I caught this snippet over on Gawker the other day ( hat tip to the ever awesome STFU , Parents for that one ) about parents going absolutely apoplectic over the picture above ( which I do n't own — so if it 's yours , let me know , I 'll take it down . . . but it seems like it 's fair use . . . so anyways ) . See that “ f ” bomb ? Yeah . So parents and grandparents alike were clanging their God damn pearls because , OMG , think of the children !
Honey child , I did think of the children . In fact , I think so much of my particular 6-year-old that . . . get this . . . she is not allowed on social media . Not in a house , not with a mouse . . . or a track pad .
This is why people hate us , fellow procreators ! Because we think our kids should be allowed everywhere . And common sense says they 're not .
This is what we know about Pinterest : it 's a site that is driven by images . People “ pin ” pictures to their virtual pinboards , and everyone gets to look at them . And you know what happens when everyone can put pictures on a place where everyone can see them ?
Gee , let 's think a moment shall we ? Oh wait , right ! People will probably put some picture that offends your precious sensibilities . And if you 're an adult , that 's OK. Because you have developed the motor skills to move your little hand over to that track pad , do a little slide of the forefinger , and change the page .
Kids , on the other hand , well , it 's just too darn late , is n't it ? They 've seen the “ f ” bomb , and they want to use it . And they WILL . In the grocery store . Next to that really judgy old bat who likes to sniff loudly when your child dares speak in a volume above catatonic in her presence .
This , my friends , is why I do n't friend kids on Facebook . This is why I have no problem that cranky people unfriend me after I let loose a tirade against certain very rude people on Facebook that may or may not contain the “ f ” bomb because they were dumb enough to let a little kid onto their Facebook wall ( did n't I mention I do NOT friend kids ? ) .
Now , do me a favor , would you ? Leave me and my Pinterest in peace . I hear there 's a recipe for Rolo-stuffed chocolate chip cookies on there .

Have you “ liked ” Inside Out Motherhood on Facebook yet ?
Mountains folded around Guinsa Temple like the petals of a lotus flower . Brightly painted buildings interrupted winter 's whites and greys . The sprawling complex was crowded with visitors in hiking apparel , which in South Korea meant vibrant nylon . Many had come to practice their Buddhist faith ; others were there for exercise and the view . I was probably the only one who 'd come for the food .
My guide 's sombre grey robes belied her cheerful energy . Her route to the kitchen wound halfway up the mountain . I began to drag behind , grimacing at the endless cement steps .
“ Think in your mind that the stairs go down , ” she suggested .
“ Down , Hyeonduk Seunim ? ” I asked . “ Seunim ” is Korean for “ monk ” , and politeness dictated that I always use her full title .
She nodded . “ The mind controls the body . ”
I tried , but my brain was n't buying it . The temple was a web of staircases , and from where I stood , they all led up .
At 70 years old , Guinsa is young for a major religious site . It was founded in the final year of Japanese occupation as a lone hut , but it quickly became a destination for pilgrims and tourists alike . Visitors left donations and these gifts helped the temple grow . Now the towering complex fills a valley in the northern Sobaek Range , 150km southwest of Seoul .
Every day , the monks serve a free lunch to all visitors . I asked Hyeonduk Seunim about this tradition as we walked . She described the meal as an expression of gratitude ; it acknowledges the faith and donations that built Guinsa Temple . But anyone was welcome , Buddhist or Christian , Korean or foreigner . The temple would feed them all .
Massive earthenware pots filled the kitchen courtyard . They held soy sauce , fermented beans and red pepper paste . The monks grow and preserve all their own food , from cabbage to chestnuts . Traditional staples like fermented soy , marinated sesame leaves and kimchi – Korea 's emblematic pickled vegetables – stretch the gap between harvests .
Inside , the kitchen was a cement horseshoe lined with massive cauldrons . Each held enough rice for 500 or soup for 3,000 . They were so deep , the monks stirred them with shovels . Around the corner , a young woman in a pink headscarf washed rice . The starchy water went into another kettle to make a soup base .
Upstairs in the cafeteria , we were asked to take only what we could eat . The food was simple vegetarian fare : rice and kimchi , soybean soup , roast potatoes . Pilgrims and day hikers sat elbow to elbow , with hundreds of people sharing the long tables . On holidays it could be thousands , especially at Lunar New Year , which falls in January or February , and Buddha 's birthday in May .
Sharing food is integral to Korean culture . People eat from the same dishes , toast from the same glass . Food is an expression of community . By welcoming everyone to their table , the monks of Guinsa made us all family , at least for a meal .
As family members , we were expected to eat everything on our trays . Hyeonduk Seunim scolded a trio of men for leaving without finishing their food . Hanging their heads like schoolboys , they sat back down . My guide noticed stray grains of rice on my tray too . She scooped them up with a spoon and popped them firmly in my mouth .
After lunch , Hyeonduk Seunim invited me to a ceremony . We backtracked down the stairs to the Main Dharma Hall , where a golden Buddha dominated the room , flanked by Bodhisattvas . Offerings of fruit were stacked in front of them . Banners fluttered overhead , and the walls were painted like pages of a picture book . Monks pounded drums and chanted , their voices as ornate as the woodwork .
Hyeonduk Seunim guided me to a red cushion at Buddha 's feet . “ You are our guest . ”
On my right knelt two well-dressed women with the faces of sisters . They did n't look at me , but focused sad eyes on the Buddha . I wondered what kind of ritual I was intruding on . Hyeonduk Seunim settled on my other side , and together we bowed .
For the next hour we processed between altars , bowing again and again . One hinge from the waist , three full prostrations , another hinge . I began to understand how the monks handled all those stairs .
I did n't recognise the ceremony until we reached the final altar , buried under bowls of vegetables , pillars of apples and glass jars of candy . A white piece of paper had been placed on a throne at the centre of the display . This was a memorial service , and the paper represented someone who had died . The floor vibrated with drumbeats as we bowed again .
In Korean tradition , there are certain days of the year when the spirits of the dead return to their families . They are bowed to and feasted . On Lunar New Year and the autumn harvest holiday Chuseok , the entire country takes part in ancestor rites . But today , it was just these two women marking the anniversary of a loved one 's death .
The ceremony ended and we processed outside to burn the paper . As it crumbled to ash , the sisters turned to me for the first time . They thanked me for coming to honour their ancestors . My presence was n't seen as an intrusion ; it was a connection .
“ Maybe in a past life their relative was American , ” Hyeonduk Seunim translated .
I was invited to join them for the last part of the ritual . Hyeonduk Seunim gestured us into a spare , empty room with a low table at the centre . Bowls of fruit and vegetables were brought from the altar , along with mugs of coffee and barley tea . The offerings to the dead were now shared by the living . This symbolically brought both worlds together for a meal .
We all sat down to eat : the spirits , the sisters , the monk and me , the stranger who was maybe not a stranger . Together at the table , we were family .
Where do you rank in our tribe of worldly readers ? Answer these questions to get a sense .
Detroit Tigers ' J.D . Martinez ( 28 ) celebrates with teammate Victor Martinez after hitting a three-run home run in the fourth inning of Game 2 in baseball 's AL Division Series against the Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore , Friday , Oct. 3 , 2014 . ( Photo : Nick Wass AP )
J.D . Martinez has talked to Victor Martinez recently .
And Victor Martinez told J.D . Martinez that he 'd like to stay with the Tigers .
`` He 's definitely indicated that if he 's got a legitimate offer and it 's close enough to everybody else , he definitely wants to stay in Detroit , '' Martinez told Jim Bowden and Casey Stern on MLB Network Radio 's `` Inside Pitch '' on Tuesday evening .
Victor Martinez is a free agent . He is perhaps the best free agent hitter on the market .
He compiled a career-year of 32 home runs , 103 RBIs and a .335 average in 2014 , was the Tigers ' team leader and will reportedly aim for a four-year deal this off-season .
The team extended him a one-year qualifying offer worth $ 15.3 million on Oct. 31 . He has until Nov. 10 to accept or , most likely , decline the offer .
J.D . Martinez , too , had a career year , totaling 23 home runs with 76 RBIs and a .315 average in 123 games with the Tigers .
He was released by the Astros on March 22 and signed by Detroit two days later .
`` I was just happy that I felt like I kind of found a home , '' J.D .
Martinez said in the interview . `` In Detroit , I feel comfortable . As soon as I came in , they made me feel a part of the team . ''
Martinez is arbitration-eligible and due for a raise in 2015 , predicted to be $ 2.9 million by MLB Trade Rumors .
Elaborating on Victor Martinez 's desire to stay in Detroit , J.D . Martinez said : `` Our team was just very close . I know a lot of guys do n't really want to trade that and the chemistry we have . It 's hard to find somewhere else . For the most part , we were just having fun all year . I know a lot of guys definitely would like to come back but at the end of the day it 's still a business so whatever the decision is , they 're going to make the best decision for them and their family and you have to respect that .

More than a decade ago the Massachusetts Association of Realtors succeeded in getting the state to increase real estate license renewal requirements . They rallied behind the importance of adding a continuing education requirement for agents in the industry , claiming that these courses would increase the quality of service to Massachusetts homebuyers .
Unfortunately , a new Beacon Hill Institute policy study that we co-authored found that their quality of service never increased but that instead the industry enriched itself through the regulations .
The Massachusetts Association of Realtors ( MAR ) lobbied the Legislature for years to implement a continuing education requirement . When it finally passed , Association President Laura Shifrin claimed , This law will raise the level of professionalism within the real estate industry and help ensure quality representation for consumers relative to home buying and selling.
Historically , after passing their initial licensing exam , real estate agents only paid a nominal fee to renew their license every two years . Beginning in 1999 , real estate agents were required to complete 12 hours of continuing education training prior to each license renewal .
Those who did not complete the education , but paid the fee , were placed on inactive status. Inactive agents could not represent clients , but they could earn referral fees by referring business to an agent with an active license .
Continuing education courses often dont have much to do with industry practice . They also often lack any exit exams demonstrating that anything valuable was learnt through the instruction . However , added regulations do succeed in eliminating competition . In this case , MARs new requirement effectively pushed large blocks of agents out of the business .
Prior to the continuing education requirement , many agents maintained their licenses after ceasing to practice the profession full time . Some worked on a part-time basis while others might only represent themselves or a friend every few years .
For agents who only made such occasional sales , it wouldnt be worth going through the 12 hours of classes every two years . We suspected there were many such agents and as a result the requirement would shift business from very low volume agents to full-time agents .
The results of our study confirm these suspicions . The continuing education requirements reduced the number of active real estate agents by 58 percent , while increasing the incomes of remaining agents by 17 percent . MAR responded to our study by claiming that they didnt think that 6 hours per year was much of a barrier . The numbers tell a different story . It might not be much of a barrier for their average member who is a full-time agent , but it is enough of a one to crowd out part-timers . And it gets worse .
Our study also analyzed data on the number of consumer complaints made since the implementation of the new standards , and specifically the number of complaints where the board took action against an agents misdeeds .
The study found no evidence that either the volume of complaints , or those requiring a response from the board , decreased after mandating the continuing education courses .
The evidence suggests that MARs relentless lobbying for the continuing education requirement was not a publicly spirited attempt to increase their service quality . Instead , it was a classic case of regulatory capture .
In other words , full-time agents changed the law to limit their competition from part-timers and enhanced their own incomes in the process . Sadly , the much-touted benefit to consumers has yet to be seen .
Massachusetts residents are now forced to overpay for brokerage services of no better quality than they were before MAR passed the continuing education requirement . Clearly , the Realtors are benefiting while the public pays the price . Until the requirement is repealed , the citizens remain the biggest losers .

Two men walk past vintage Mercedes-Benz cars at the Techno-Classic classic car fair in Essen Thomson Reuters By Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - German carmakers are considering the use of aircraft-style `` black box '' data recorders in self-driving cars , a contentious idea in a country worried about surveillance , but potentially a crucial step in getting the new technology on the road .
Mercedes-Benz and BMW are among automakers to have developed autonomous or semi-autonomous cars , along with technology firm Google .
But while some features , such as assisted parking , are commercially available , legal questions are hampering the roll-out of other technologies , such as automatic overtaking on motorways , and fully self-driven cars remain prototypes .
Installing an aircraft-style data recorder could help to address some of these questions by giving manufacturers and insurers clarity over who is liable when an autonomous car gets into a crash .
The issue is being debated by Germany 's `` roundtable on autonomous driving '' , a group hosted by government officials .
The group aims to ensure Germany does not lose its edge in car manufacturing and includes automakers , lawyers , privacy advocates and insurance executives tasked with identifying shortcomings in Germany 's regulation , technological know-how , and legal framework .
`` Whether cars should have a black box is one of the items being discussed , '' a person familiar with the deliberations , who declined to be named , told Reuters .
With 90 percent of accidents caused by human error , engineers at automakers are convinced cars should be given more leeway to intervene and help drivers in a dangerous situation , much in the same way computers help pilots land planes .
But a crucial issue to resolve , and one being debated by a subgroup of the roundtable , centers on liability .
German law does not distinguish between a car in an accident which was driving semi-autonomously or completely without driver input , even though there is an enormous difference technologically , and from the level of driver involvement .
To determine whether a car , its driver , or a third party was primarily responsible for an accident , insurers and carmakers want to collect car data , including its speed and inputs from sensors , cameras and the driver .
Insurers could also use the data to draw up policies .
`` We could create insurance premiums more tailored to a certain risk profile , '' said Martin Stadler , an expert for automotive matters at German insurer Allianz .
Who gets to gather vehicle data and how , though , is highly controversial in a country haunted by a history of surveillance from the Gestapo secret police and East Germany 's STASI .
More recently , revelations by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden that Chancellor Angela Merkel 's cell phone and mass internet traffic was being monitored , prompted calls for even tighter privacy safeguards .
KEEPING THE SOFTWARE FIRMS AT BAY
Information about the location and speed of a car could also be attractive to advertisers and communications companies who could use the data for their own commercial purposes .
German carmakers say they want to take a restrictive line on how data from autonomous and semi-autonomous cars is used , a move that could make it harder for software and telecom companies trying to make inroads into the auto industry .
`` We accept that personal data belongs to the customer , and that we are not entitled to do with it whatever we want , '' Thomas Weber , head of development at Mercedes-Benz told a conference on innovation last month , a comment which observers took to be a thinly-veiled swipe at Google .
`` The fact that we take these issues more seriously than some other companies is an opportunity for German industry , '' he said .
Germany 's Auto Industry Association VDA is holding talks about whether it is possible to reach a common position on how to deal with vehicle data rights , Weber said .
The roundtable hopes its stance on data security and other matters will form a template for a `` European position '' which other manufacturers can adapt . To promote its views , it has already held presentations at the United Nations and European Union .
Its position on data appears to be gaining traction .
`` Ultimately the person who generates the data , the driver , should have the final say over how it is used , '' Allianz 's Stadler said .
Earlier this month , Peter Mertens , Senior Vice President , Research and Development at Volvo Cars , told a conference : `` Our view of autonomous driving is not to gather personal data and use this for business . Our vision is to make driving safer . ''

A shootout comprised of four motorcycles of inline three-cylinder arrangement displacing four dissimilar engine capacities from three manufacturers ? An unthinkable prospect when Triumph brought the venerable Speed Triple stateside in 1995 . Yet here we are today embroiled in this exact scenario , nearly crapping our britches in childlike excitement at the wonderful diversity of three-cylinder motorcycle models from which to choose .
Get the Flash Player to see this player .
2014 MV Agusta F3 800 Review – First Ride
Triumph has long been the sole manufacturer of inline-Three motorcycle engine arrangements , but MV Agusta is now fleshing out the segment with five three-cylinder models : Brutale 675/800 ; F3 675/800 ; Rivale 800 , with the forthcoming sport-touring Turismo Veloce 800 announced for 2014 making it six . Yamaha 's FZ-09 is the first Japanese Triple in three decades , but how long will the trio of other Japanese OEMs ignore the growing deuce-ace trend ?
Yamaha Triples Retrospective
Displacing 847cc and boasting an MSRP of $ 7,990 the 2014 Yamaha FZ-09 smacks like a shovel to the face of other OEMs . Comparably priced 2014 models from Kawasaki and Suzuki , the Versys ( $ 7,999 ) and SFV650 ( $ 8149 ) , are powered by significantly smaller 650cc Twin engines . When last tested , dyno numbers for these two bikes were 56.5 hp at 8250 rpm and 39.5 ft-lb of torque at 7250 for the Versys , and 65.8 hp at 8500 rpm and 42.7 ft-lb of torque at 7800 rpm for the SFV . The FZ-09 wallops those figures laying down 104.8 hp at 10,800 rpm and 59.5 ft-lb of torque at 8,300 rpm .
Against the bikes in this shootout , the 847cc FZ easily bests the 675cc Street Triple R but surprisingly is only 1.9 hp down from the 798cc Brutale and is up 9.1 ft-lb in terms of torque . Compared to the substantially larger 1050cc Speed Triple R , the FZ is down only 11.4 horsepower and 10.5 ft-lb of torque .
Factoring weight into the equation , the lithe FZ , at 414 claimed wet pounds , bests the 466-pound claimed wet weight of the Speed Triple R by 52 pounds . The Street Triple R is lightest of the group with a 403-pound claimed curb weight , with the Brutale 's curb weight second at 413 pounds .
Full Four Thirds Shootout photo gallery
“ The Speed Triple R is the outlier of this quartet due to its noticeable bulkiness , ” says Chief Hooligan , Kevin Duke . “ An engine with one of the flattest sportbike torque curves ever is always ready with a considerable shove , but its outright force is blunted by its considerable weight penalty . ”
At least the Speed Triple R and its smaller sibling , the Street Triple R , can boast the best fuel mapping of the group . The only two bikes here with cable-actuated throttles ( not ride-by-wire ) , the Triumphs lack electronic ride modes , but their smooth power delivery makes them unnecessary – the STRs ' power inputs are easily modulated with nary a hiccup from their EFIs . Both the MV ( exhaustively reported ) and the new FZ , however , suffer from maligned fuel delivery .
“ The Italian boutique brand has regularly disappointed us with ride-by-wire throttles that seem disassociated with what your throttle hand requests , and the Brutale 800 continues that unwelcome tradition , ” says Duke . “ Our feelings about the Brutale would improve markedly if it had the same reliable throttle response as the Triumphs ' . ”
The FZ-09 is fitted with the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle ( YCC-T ) ride-by-wire system , a technology incorporated on several of its previous models , making it even more remarkable how the company could fail when it comes to two out of the three ride modes available .
“ A and Standard ride modes are practically useless in the canyons , ” says Editor , Troy Siahaan . “ B is definitely my favorite , too bad it chops off 10 hp . Standard is acceptable on the street , but I could n't find any situation where I wanted A mode . ”
But that 's not to say the FZ 's motor was n't appreciated .
“ If Yamaha could tune out the harshness of throttle application , this Triple would be one of my favorite engines of all time , ” Duke observes . “ I love how its front wheel comes up accelerating in first gear then , after a short shift to second , it 'll wheelie again as it crosses its torque peak ! ”
While Yamaha and MV are busy writing updated algorithms for their fuel mappings , no one complained about Triumph 's only tech , ABS , on both its Triples . In fact , tester demerits for the Street Triple R , our 2009 Bike of the Year and winner of numerous shootouts , were few and minor .
“ It 's hard to fault the Street R , but compared to , say , the Yamaha , the Street R has narrower handlebars which takes a little more effort to throw it into a turn , ” says Siahaan .
“ There 's an obnoxious engine whine/whistle that masks some of the nice engine sounds , ” gripes FNG Editor , Evans Brasfield . “ And initial brake application is a little abrupt , ” he adds .
Quite possibly our strangest gripe comes from the shootout pitting the Street Triple R against its arch rival , the Brutale 675 where we reported :
“ In a strange twist of hooligan etiquette , the STR may be too genteel , as if Triumph manufactured the hooliganism out of its hooligan bike . Much of this is attributed to the bike 's new , taller first gear that stretches to 77 mph before hitting the rev limiter . ”
2013 MV Agusta Brutale 675 Vs . Triumph Street Triple R – Video
The Brutale 800 handily won both the Appearance/Fit/Finish and Cool Factor categories on our ScoreCard , and at $ 12,498 , placed third in the pricing department . When all the scores were tallied , though , Brasfield , Duke and Siahaan all ranked the Brutale last , albeit a skin-of-the-teeth victory by third-place finisher , the Speed Triple R : 82.87 % vs 83.01 % , respectively .
It was only yours truly who felt that by saving the $ 3.5k in MSRP between the Brutale and Speed R could I better resolve the Brutale 's poor fuel mapping and swap sprockets to stretch the crazy-short gear ratios , creating a better-performing Brutale . Try decreasing the width of the Speed Triple R between your legs or removing the nearly 60 pounds it has over the Brutale without spending any money . Making the same argument for the $ 12,799 standard Speed Triple , however , would n't be as easy ( see sidebar ) .
Triumph Speed Triple – The Bike We Really Wanted By Troy Siahaan This is the bike we wanted to include in this test . At $ 12,799 , the standard Triumph Speed Triple is a whopping $ 3200 less expensive than its R-badged sibling . Of course , for that price you give up the Ohlins suspension , forged aluminum wheels , Brembo monobloc calipers and some carbon trim here and there , but the heart of the Speed Triple – the 1050cc three-cylinder engine – is still there and unchanged . But Triumph could only accommodate the R model in time for this test . We thought the upgraded suspension , wheel and brake advantages might make the big Triumph the clear winner in this test , but it did n't turn out that way . Our biggest complaint with the Speed Triple R is its heft and forcing it through the tight stuff . Taking this into consideration , we can confidently assume the most noticeable difference would be the slower steering resulting from the non-R 's heavier cast wheels . While not Ohlins pieces , the standard Showa suspension is plenty capable , and the standard two-piece Brembo front calipers are n't too far behind the R 's monoblocs . The third-place-finishing Speed Triple R and runner-up Yamaha FZ-09 came very close in our final standings ; 83.01 % vs 84.86 % , respectively . If we had been able to test the standard Speed Triple , which would suffer less of a price penalty , the two bikes would have swapped places in our overall rankings .
Although the Street Triple R transitions somewhat lethargically compared to the frenetic Brutale , it 's our choice for best handling bike in this group . Its combination of a stable chassis and balanced suspension make it easiest to ride fastest . “ The Street R 's well-tuned suspension is an excellent compromise of compliance and tautness , ” says Duke .
MPG Yamaha FZ-09 37.8 mpg MV Agusta Brutale 800 33.6 mpg Triumph Speed Triple R 33.4 mpg Triumph Street Triple R 32.5 mpg
Next up , in the handling department is the FZ-09 . Considering its relatively soft suspension , the FZ was a surprise to all editors when the going got twisty . Stiffer springs , heavier fork oil and a flatter handlebar will inexpensively upgrade the FZ 's performance while maintaining the bike 's civility . As is , the FZ will , after leaning farther than you 'd expect with so much legroom , drag a footpeg through a tight arching corner then lift the front wheel on the exit – even while in its 10-hp-less B mode .
“ It has soft suspension , soft brakes , soft seat , and tall bars , and yet the FZ-09 is my second favorite bike here , ” says Siahaan .
Bloated with technologies such as traction control ( TC ) , electronic assist shifting ( EAS ) , four ride modes including a customizable one to tweak throttle sensitivity , engine braking , etc. , the Brutale is a flagship of advanced electronics . Pile on its counter-rotating crankshaft , and the combined technologies of the other three bikes here do n't come close to matching the Brutale 's technological bounty .
When the bike swapping stopped , the riding fun ended and the ScoreCard filled out , there emerged an undeniable winner unanimously agreed upon by all four editors : the Street Triple R .
“ We went out on a short limb when we awarded the Street Triple R our Motorcycle of the Year in 2009 , but this shootout has solidified the prescience of this selection , ” says Duke . “ Even among its newly created and larger-displacement competition , the Street R remains exceedingly capable , fun and charismatic . ”
From here , however , not all editors were of the same opinion . Brasfield , Duke and Siahaan all subjectively chose the Speed Triple R as their second place bike , while I preferred the FZ-09 . It was n't until the objective scores of price and weight were factored in that the FZ surpasses the Speed R for an overall ranking of second place .
The voting discrepancy continued with third- and fourth-place standings where the majority ranked the Brutale last . I ranked it third above my last place choice , the Speed 3R . In this case , however , objective scores could n't save the Brutale from finishing fourth in this shootout . But it was close .

If money 's tight buy the FZ-09 , it 's the best bang for the buck in this shootout and already a front runner for our 2014 Best Value award . However , if you 've got the coin , drop it on the Street Triple R. If all bikes were this good , we 'd be in motorcycle nirvana , and the R 's insubstantial $ 600 MSRP increase over the standard Street Triple relegates the standard to unconsidered status when cross-shopping the two .
“ Compared to the other bikes in this test – and nearly any other motorcycle you can name – the Street Triple R is amazingly cooperative and trustworthy when sniping a twisty road . You 'll go around corners quicker on the Triumph , ” Duke articulates .

For the majority of people purchasing this bike , the suspension shortcomings are less of an issue , as it 's only when hammering a canyon road when it behaves poorly . Also , upgrading the suspension can be done at a reasonable cost . The FZ 's poor fuel-mapping is another issue . Yamaha will certainly have a fix for the abrupt throttle response in A and Standard modes , but until then those two ride modes are almost unusable on this otherwise wonderful motorcycle .
“ Factor in the cost and it 's fighting for top billing , ” says Siahaan . “ I 'd love to spend the money saved on the FZ-09 and throw a good suspension package at it . That plus a pipe and EFI tuning ( and maybe better brakes ) and the FZ-09 would be hard to beat . ”

Despite its bulky impression next to the rapiers in this comparison , the Speed Triple is a delightful roadster with broad capabilities .
“ If you 're looking to do 500-mile days on your three-cylinder roadster , you 'd do well to purchase the Speed Triple , ” Duke observes . “ Its wide seat offers plenty of support , and its chassis and high-quality suspension are fully up to the task of burning comfortable miles on your way to remote twisty roads . And , as we proved in our Literbike Streetfighter Shootout , the big Triple performs admirably on a racetrack . ”

The Brutale simultaneously thrills and annoys us . It enjoys being ridden aggressively , but its tricky throttle response and firm suspension exhausts its rider quickly .
“ If you 're looking for comfort , look elsewhere , ” says Duke . “ The Brutale serves up the sportiest ( read : most cramped ) riding position and the most unyielding seat . But in terms of excitement , the Brutale is professional-grade fun . It feels feral and rambunctious , but it 's not for the timid . ”
“ I . Do n't . Like . This . Bike , ” says Siahaan . “ I really want to like the bike because it 's by far the best looking bike here , but it begs to be ridden at 9/10s or higher all the time . Any less and it feels like a lot of bikes to manage for a simple cruise . ”
Recently , Pebble has taken out a $ 5M loan and $ 5M line of credit with a Silicon Valley based bank , even though it raised $ 20M ( $ 18M after fees ) as the largest Kickstarter project of all time . TechCrunch speculated that the wearables company is somehow in trouble , especially now that Apple – a 20-ton behemoth of a company if there ever was one – is entering the market .
We could n't disagree more – Pebble is doing a lot of things right , and that 's one of the reasons we 've integrated our MeetingPulse software with the Pebble smartwatch . We think Pebble is going to be a major player in the wearables market for years to come . Even with Apple in the same space .
Here 's why :
1 . They are growing rapidly
Especially in tech , growing rapidly is the sign of a healthy company – companies that grow too slowly risk losing technological advantages . And while $ 18M raised in one of the largest crowdfunded campaigns ever is good initial capital , it 's especially important for Pebble to keep growing now that Apple has entered the smartwatch market . They should seek to expand production capacity , technical skill , and brand footprint . All of these require additional capital investment .
Right now , Pebble has 25 open jobs listed on their website . This does not sound like a company that desperately needs money to stay afloat – this sounds like a company that is ready to take on bigger challenges .
2 . They take calculated risks .
Pebble decided to take out a business loan instead of relying on finding a VC . It was probably the right call , all things considered . Giving away an equity share to VC can end up very expensive to a growing company . Loans may have interest attached to them , but interest is predictable and relatively small . When it comes down to it , it can be easily paid off from revenue . Venture capital , on the other hand , is giving away an equity share that will be worth tens or even hundreds of millions as the company gets bigger . That might not be a good deal in the long run . The loan is cheaper and risk much less value : the guys at Pebble understand risk very well .
Of course , risk is a huge part of Pebble 's history . Pebble went to Kickstarter to get their startup capital . Kickstarter campaigns may seem low-risk ( certainly , they cost little-to-nothing out of pocket if you fail ) but a failed Kickstarter can doom a product and company . Because a failed Kickstarter implies one of two things : that the demand in the marketplace was n't there , or that you could n't promote your work successfully .
Not only did Pebble take that risk , they succeeded by leaps and bounds – they 're the largest Kickstarter project of all time , raising more than $ 20M .
3 . They 've got First Mover advantage
Sure , Pebble does n't have the brand name recognition of Apple ; and Apple Watch is a serious competitor . But Apple is banking almost solely on name recognition to push their product . We talk about competitive differentiatiors ; well , there 's little to differentiate the Apple Watch from its own iPhone , except that it 's smaller and comes with straps .
This is not a coincidence – Apple needed a watch sooner rather than later , to enter the market before Pebble established a foothold in it . And because they already had the technology used in the iPhone , they adapted the technology to a new area it was n't designed for .
On the other hand , Pebble is already working on the next generation version of the watch , the Pebble Time , which improves on the first version by incorporating better graphics ( 64-color vs. monochrome ) , an accessory port , and a microphone – advances that they incorporated after getting feedback from their customers .
4 . They understand their market .
Pebble gets something that Apple does n't : Wearable technology plays by different rules than portable technology . Apple designed the Apple Watch for people who have already bought into the Apple ecosystem – it requires an iPhone 5 or later to use , uses proprietary wristbands , and costs about as much as an iPad Mini . Tech-comfortable early-adopters who use Apple products and have disposable income are a small market , compared to the much larger market that Pebble is going after – the one currently dominated by the Swatch Group , Casio , Timex , etc .
In many ways , an Apple Watch fails at some features that are currently taken for granted in wristwatches generally . My current non-smart-watch does n't shut off its display in order to save battery life and does n't need to be charged nightly – because , quite frankly , the first thing a watch must do is tell time at a glance , not a “ swipe-and-glance. ” These are inconveniences in a product that has n't required either charging or turning off its display since 1923 . The long battery life , always-on display , and a price-point comparable to non-smart watches were n't added to pebble as “ nice to haves. ” They were crucial features for urging people to upgrade from a non-smart watch to a smartwatch .
5 . They 're easy to develop for .
Perhaps the most important thing is that Pebble has made their product extremely easy to develop for . There are no barriers between a developer and app development , no gatekeeper to approve or disapprove of a particular application . That means that new applications will come to the Pebble first . We already see this dynamic playing out in the smartphone market – Android has often been first to market with new features simply because there were fewer barriers towards getting them approved or integrated .
Apple , comparatively , requires developers to jump through more hoops and halts development on applications that may interfere with Apple 's business interests . ( I doubt you 'll see third-party software that allows the Apple Watch to integrate with an Android phone anytime soon , for example . )
With all these considerations , we think that it 's not only presumptuous but downright foolish to consider Pebble a struggling company or struggling product . It seems to have hit the sweet spot of affordability , efficiency , and productivity , and if it needs a bit more capital , it 's just an indicator of growth .

Pokémon Innocent Childrens ' Game ... or Not ? I 've said it before and I 'll say it again ! You need to know what something represents before allowing your kids to have it or to bring it into your home . Just because the unsaved world has things , it does not mean that it is okay for a child of God to have these same things . Objects carry curses and are open doors for demons . The unsaved person already belongs to Satan , so to them , ... '' What 's another curse ? . '' However , God warns if you , a Believer , participate in the things of Satan and disobey God , then that sin will open doors for demonic spirits to operate in your life and the lives of your family . You will also be out of God 's will and fellowship , and your prayers will not be heard . I posted the article below to teach you the true meaning behind `` Pokémon '' . It was not written by me and is not copyrighted by Real Deliverance Ministries . You must destroy all Pokémon stuff and get it out of your home . You and your children must repent and renounce Pokémon and choose to submit to God . They are not just cute little creatures ! That 's what Satan wants you to believe . If he told you they were an extension of his evil and a legal open door for his demons to have a right in your life , you would not buy them ! There are many other kids ' toys , games , and cartoons that are open doors for demons . You should go through all of your kids ' things ( and your home ) and get rid of all these occult objects : The Gathering
The Smurfs
Digi-mon
Dungeons and Dragons
Unicorns
Trolls
Anything with magical , mystical powers If you are not sure you may email me with a description of the item and I 'll let you know about it . For a full listing of items that should n't be in your home , read The War Manual . There 's a whole chapter devoted to this topic ! THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF , PEOPLE ... GET WITH GOD 'S PROGRAM !
The following is a REAL letter I received : ( reprinted with permission ) Hi Bill ,
I am in need of advice . I am a Christian and have a 6-year-old son who has always been a happy boy . He recently has become angry and aggressive . I never allowed Poke'mon things in our home , but I started slipping and he started watching the shows . He went to play with a boy across the street , and his brother introduced him to the Poke'mon and Magic games and he has been playing it .
Since then , he has been hitting and screaming and does n't remember his outbursts . He 's like another child . It has actually become worse since I moved into this house about 6 months ago , but is getting worse every day . When I go to my parent 's home for a few days , he is back to his normal self ; I come home and he is angry . It 's come to the point that I am leaving this home this week and we are putting the house up for sale and moving back to the area near my parents ( where we used to live ) . I 'll come here on the weekends to get our home together for sale . I wanted to move anyway because the chaos here has made me unhappy and I 'm not very thrilled with the area anyway . My husband is starting to finally see the changes . What is going on ?
Suzy AND NOW I PRESENT THE ARTICLE ON Pokémon : Pokémon - Innocent child game or ?
by Rich Deem Read the article on Mr. Deem 's site Pokémon ( short for POcKEt MONster and pronounced Poh-keh-mon ) is now the rage among both Christian and non-Christian children in much of the world . What do these `` pocket monsters '' teach our children and what are the philosophies underlying this `` innocent '' game ? Is this something that Christian children should be involved with ? Pokémon is a role-playing game similar to Dungeons and Dragons , MAGIC , and others , but with more subtle occult overtones . It is a copyright of Nintendo and was first created in Japan in 1995 , where it was highly influenced by Japanese mysticism . Much of its character seems to come from Shinto ( the traditional religion of Japan ) , Buddhism , Hinduism , other Eastern religions , and New Age philosophies . The game reflects Japan 's warrior past in its violence , with the object being to conquer other Pokémon through physical force or sorcery . Besides the Eastern religious overtones , New Age concepts abound in the Pokémon cards.2 Each Pokémon is a certain `` type , '' which describes their `` energy . '' There are currently 7 types of Pokémon , including `` Grass , '' `` Fire , '' `` Water , '' `` Lightning , '' `` Psychic , '' `` Fighting , '' and `` Colorless . `` 3 Many of the 150 Pokémon use violence to conquer other Pokémon . This violence includes gnawing , slashing , smash kick , fire blast , seismic toss , electricity , poison , psychic blasts , paralyzing , etc.4 This is not the `` innocent '' game that it is made out to be . Other Pokémon `` evolve '' through the use of `` stones '' ( thunder , water , moon , fire , and leaf ) which are items used to summon powers ( the origin of these `` powers '' is not stated , but they are not from God ) .4 Training cards also include those that use `` potion '' and `` super potion '' to magically heal your damaged Pokémon fighters . Many Pokémon evolve `` naturalistically '' to become other Pokémon ... In examining the cards , it is apparent that macroevolution is being taught , since `` species '' that have evolved from other species are similar in appearance . In some instances , the term `` evolution '' is used incorrectly , since individual Pokémon are able to `` evolve '' into more powerful creatures . In essence , the game is teaching a kind of reincarnation . Here are some examples of Pokémon types and what they do : Name Attack Method Jynx `` Merely by meditating , the Pokémon launches a powerful psychic energy attack '' Abra `` Using its ability to read minds , it will identify impending danger and teleport to safety . '' Kadabra `` It emits special alpha waves from its body that induce headaches even to those nearby . '' Weepinbell `` It spits out poisonpowder to immobilize the enemy , and then finishes the enemy with a spray of acid . '' Ponyta `` Its hooves are 10 times harder than diamonds . It can trample anything flat in moments . '' Machoke `` Karate chop does 50 damage points '' `` I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each Pokémon to understand
The power that 's inside .
Got ta catch them all ! '' The words above are from the Pokémon song that is sung at the end of the television program . Children are being encouraged to tap into the power of the Pokémon cards . Further instruction is given at the official Pokémon card site : `` Carry your Pokémon with you , and you 're ready for anything ! You 've got the power in your hands , so use it ! `` 5 Many children are taking this instruction to heart and literally carry their Pokémon cards with them everywhere . We are even seeing these cards appearing at our church and Christian school . Children are being encouraged to tap into supernatural power instead of the power given by God.6 They are told that the more cards they collect , the more power they will have . Many children are completely addicted to the cards and spend all of their free time playing with them . If nothing else , Pokémon has become an idol in their lives - being more important to them than God . The use of Pokémon cards can potentially open doors to demonic oppression through the following activities:7 possession ( known or unknown ) of occultic records , tapes , books , pictures , charms , tools , games , etc . seeking or giving consent to occultic power or occultic revelation fascination with occultic power , occultic revelation , or psychic phenomena , in general escapism through thrill-seeking , science fiction , soap operas , or some other addicting hobby/activity fascination with violence , especially violence devoid of justice meditation on anything other than God 's revealed truth chanting or other cultic/occultic forms of worship The Bible 's teaching is clear about being involved in occultic activities . We are told not to become involved in sorcery or divination or consult with mediums or spiritists.8 The high penalty ( death ) for engaging in sorcery indicates the seriousness of this sin in the eyes of God.9 While Pokémon continues to gain popularity , its creators will continue to introduce new ways to become a Pokémon `` Master . '' At some point , in order to maintain interest in the game , it will become necessary to add new features/characters and alternate means to `` get the power . '' My prediction is that this game will add more New Age features , along with more violent and bizarre characters . Those who are involved in Pokémon will continue to be indoctrinated more deeply in the New Age philosophies . In fact , Pokémon resources are listed under New Age resources.10 Another threat to children who play with Pokémon and other role playing games is the tendency to become involved in more serious forms of role playing games , such as Doom,11 Dungeons and Dragons , Magic : the Gathering , and role playing games with even more occultic overtones . In fact , Pokémon sites often have links to these sites ( wizards.com , etc. ) . The `` Role Player 's Realm , '' which links to Pokémon and other role playing games has the uninhibited URL `` http : //www.screaming.demon.nl/ . '' The association with the occult is fairly obvious . Conclusions Pokémon teaches the following concepts/philosophies that are counter to Christianity : Violence as a means of obtaining power . Evolution New Age concepts ( reincarnation , psychic power ) The use of occult objects ( magic stones ) to gain power over your opponent Continued participation in Pokémon may lead to : Involvement in the game that leads to psychological addiction such that the game becomes an idol in the life of the child Involvement in malevolent role playing games ( and people associated with them ) Open doors to demonic oppression Recommendations If your child has accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior , I recommend that he be given the facts about Pokémon and what the Bible says about participating in sorcery . A child who is encouraged to pray about his involvement in Pokémon and follows the Holy Spirit will voluntarily give up participation with Pokemon-associated activities . Several children we have talked to have made this decision without being forced to do so by their parents . If your child has not accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior , I would make the decision unilaterally and explain why he would not be allowed to participate in Pokemon-related activities . If your child is highly involved with or addicted to Pokémon , I would provide extra support for them and encourage and provide opportunities for them to engage in other , less threatening hobbies/activities .

The team headed by Jonathan `` MusambaN1 '' Torrent , who played under the eu4ia tag up until now , has been acquired by the Spanish organization Giants .
Giants , an organization which was born with Counter-Strike but has lately shifted its attention towards Spain 's most popular game , League of Legends , will once again field a CS roster five years after its last attempt at holding a CS team .
The former gBots player , TorPe , will also be part of Giants
Jonathan `` MusambaN1 '' Torrent and Rubén `` TorPe '' Jesús Gómez Rodríguez—Oscar `` mixwell '' Cañellas and Christian `` loWel '' Garcia Antoran 's teammate in gBots— , have already donned the Giants jersey in 1.6 and Source , respectively .
Joining them this time will be three youngsters , Javier `` Vasili '' Huélamo Gracia , Iván `` NaOw '' González , and one of the newcomers that has turned most heads in Spain lately , Raúl `` DeaTh '' Jordán Nieto .
`` Today is a great day for me and my teammates , to have the opportunity of signing with the best club in our country [ ... ] A new stage begins in which we will have to work harder than ever to show this team has what it takes to meet our goals despite the responsibility bearing the Giants banner supposes . '' - Jonathan `` MusambaN1 '' Torrent `` I 'm back in an old house and a future home . I want to thank Giants for this opportunity , as far as our fans go , I want to say we 'll work hard not to disappoint anyone . '' - Rubén `` TorPe '' Gómez Rodríguez
Giants will be present in Spain 's ESL Masters league , which has a $ 22,100 prize pool and is due to kick off next week , after having made it through one of the four qualifiers last month .
Cyclists taking part in a road race through the mountains of the Scottish borders were attacked by elderly men brandishing sticks who tried to block their path .
The two men , thought to be in their 70s , were both dressed in tweed and flat caps and were said to be local farmers protesting at the road closures preventing them from getting between their fields during the harvest .
Police are investigating the incident and are keen to speak to witnesses who saw the men , who had disappeared by the time they arrived on the scene .
The 74-mile race , which began and ended in Peebles , some 23 miles south of Edinburgh , attracted almost 2,000 competitors and required the closure of several local roads .
Angry cyclists vented their fury online , and organisers of the Tour O The Borders event branded the men 's actions “ totally outrageous ” and said they were “ horrified ” by what had happened .
Manatees at Three Sisters Springs in Florida . ( Photo : WTSP-TV )
Three Sisters Springs in Florida had to close a one acre plot of water to swimming and kayaking on Monday when over 300 manatees rapidly moved into the springs at an unexpected rate .
The area reopened Tuesday , but will close again when the tide begins to rise and the manatees return to the interior area of the springs , Laura Ruettiman , an environmental education guide at the Springs told USA TODAY Network .
Manatees congregate in the area during high tide and cold weather , Ruettiman said .
During a manatee count conducted by the manatee watch volunteers on Monday , a total of 293 manatees had moved into the interior of the springs by 1:00 p.m .
By 1:30 p.m. the manatee count in the interior of the springs had surpassed 300 total manatees and The U.S . Fish and Wildlife issued the temporary closure of Three Sisters Springs . All of the viewing or swimming around the proximity remains open during the closures .
`` We have a record number this year , '' Ruettiman said . `` We have 150 more manatees here than have ever been recorded in the past . ''
The high numbers may be a result of greater protection in the area and because habitat areas in other parts of the state are being lost , according to Ruettiman .

This is one well-designed piece of malware :
Conficker B++ is somewhat similar to Conficker B , with 294 of 297 sub-routines the same and 39 additional subroutines . The latest variant , first spotted on 16 February , is even more sneaky than its previous incarnations , SRI explains .
Conficker B++ is no longer limited to reinfection by similarly structured Conficker DLLs , but can now push new self-contained Win32 applications . These executables can infiltrate the host using methods that are not detected by the latest anti-Conficker security applications .
[ ... ]
The malware also creates an additional backdoor on compromise machines to create an altogether trickier infectious agent , SRI explains .
In Conficker A and B , there appeared only one method to submit Win32 binaries to the digital signature validation path , and ultimately to the CreateProcess API call . This path required the use of the Internet rendezvous point to download the binary through an HTTP transaction . Under Conficker B++ , two new paths to binary validation and execution have been introduced to Conficker drones , both of which bypass the use of Internet Rendezvous points : an extension to the netapi32.dll patch and the new named pipe backdoor . These changes suggest a desire by the Conficker 's authors to move away from a reliance on Internet rendezvous points to support binary update , and toward a more direct flash approach .
SRI reckons that Conficker-A has infected 4.7m machines , at one time or another , while Conficker-B has hit 6.7m IP addresses . These figures , as with previous estimates , come from an analysis of the number of machines that have ever tried to call into malware update sites . The actual number of infected hosts at any one time is lower than that . SRI estimates the botnet controlled by Conficker-A and Conficker-B is around 1m and 3m hosts , respectively , or a third of the raw estimate .
The below table contains a group of five first-line centres in the National Hockey League , with their Corsi % On ( percentage of 5-on-5 shot attempts with the player in question on the ice ) and Corsi % Off ( percentage of 5-on-5 shot attempts with the player in question off of the ice ) . I 've omitted names in an effort to temporarily mitigate bias .
First-Line Centres Centre ( 2014-15 ) Corsi % On Corsi % Off Player A 55.3 % 46.6 % Player B 53.8 % 50.7 % Player C 58.5 % 48.9 % Player D 56.0 % 47.7 % Player E 53.4 % 48.7 %
I think we can comfortably agree that these five players share two things in common : one , their respective teams are in control when they 're on the ice , and two , there is depreciable performance when they come off of the ice . It 's important to note , though , that the Corsi % Off for each of these centres is n't terrible – it 's actually at or around what we would expect for a weighted performance of lines two , three , and four based on prior work done at HockeyGraphs
The point is n't that these players are likely great at their craft . It 's that these players likely play on teams with at least fairly competent depth , perhaps enough to compete for a playoff spot .
Let 's work this exercise one more time . We 'll focus on the same five centres but , this time , grab their Corsi % On and Corsi % Off for the years 2011-2014 .
First-Line Centres - On and Off Ice Corsi % Centre ( 2011-14 ) Corsi % On Corsi % Off Player A 57.7 % 49.0 % Player B 50.2 % 47.9 % Player C 54.7 % 47.7 % Player D 56.5 % 50.6 % Player E 47.2 % 44.3 %
for Player A through Player D , we see more of the same – a range from very good to elite possession numbers via Corsi % On , and mostly average possession numbers based online expectations via Corsi % Off . Player E , however , is substantially different . He was getting caved in by the opposition , and his team was just appalling with him on the bench .
Players A through D , in order : Henrik Sedin , Nicklas Backstrom , Sidney Crosby , and Joe Thornton . As you might have expected . Player E ? Ryan Nugent-Hopkins .
Though there 's been a lot of handwringing about another possible disappointing season in Edmonton , I think there 's something to be said about measurable improvement . I know Oilers fans – and probably the front office and coaching staff , too – dream of this team making a magical jump from draft lottery quality to legitimate playoff contender overnight . Unfortunately , progress often takes time . That 's especially true if you 're trying to build a team that can hang its hat on puck possession , and not riding the wave of variance to a fluky post-season berth .
And make no mistake , Edmonton has improved at 5-on-5 . Part of it is because Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and his linemates seem to be finally taking the next step , entering their playing primes as a group . Part of it is because Edmonton has done an excellent job at repairing some galaxy-sized holes in the lineup away from the top-line , enough that this team is no longer pulling dreadful 44 % control with their top players off of the ice .
Let 's touch on Ryan Nugent-Hopkins first . We know he 's still towing positive RelativeCorsi % from the numbers above . Additionally , he – with assistance from Taylor Hall and Jordan Eberle , certainly – is on the verge of hitting a Corsi % he 's only seen a couple of times previously in his career . The graph to the left is a 15-game rolling average , which will let us capture his recent 2014-2015 uptick .
While Nugent-Hopkins and the Edmonton top-line are starting to decisively control play , it 's not exactly uncharted territory – we have seen stretches , albeit brief ones , of that top-line clicking in the past . What 's made Edmonton respectable , again , is that the second , third , and fourth line are starting to pull their weight a bit , something that 's been as elusive as winning within the Oilers organization for years now .
We can use the same 15-game Corsi % rolling average for the Oilers over all of the games Nugent-Hopkins has played , but specifically exclude all of the shifts in which Nugent-Hopkins was on the ice . How does Edmonton look now compared to years past ?
Just like Ryan Nugent-Hopkins , the Oilers second , third , and fourth-lines have seen brief stints of respectability before . But , compare the first graph to the second graph , and you 'll notice that this team 's never really had both groups going at the same time . When Nugent-Hopkins was struggling early in his career , the rest of the Oilers group was doing OK . When Nugent-Hopkins had a great run during the lockout-shortened year , the rest of the Oilers lines could n't get out of their own way .
Can Edmonton sustain this sort of success ? Right now , the team sits at 48.5 % Score-Adjusted Fenwick % through sixteen games – ranking 21st in the NHL . It 's only a start , but let 's remember the Edmonton teams of past , and their league-wide ranking by Score-Adjusted Fenwick % : 28th , 26th , 30th , 29th , 26th , 29th , and 28th .
Improvement is a relative term . Edmonton 's doing it . In the event that they can fix the goaltending that 's really been the source of their pain for most of this season , the Oilers could be a team trending up in the standings .
In-N-Out Burger pop-up sparks feeding frenzy in Toronto
In-N-Out burger came to Canada -- for one day only
Storified by CBC News Community· Thu , Sep 11 2014 21:25:51
In-N-Out 's Toronto pop-up sold out before it even opened : http : //t.co/yjth66NQ0L http : //t.co/skMNZ799PQComplex
And yet , as many of us know all-too-well , Canadians often get short-changed in terms of fast food options compared to our friends south of the border .
White Castle , Carl 's Jr , Sonic , Checker 's , Hardee 's -- the number of American burger chains we so often hear about , but ca n't actually visit in our home and native land , is enough to drive a drive-thru connoisseur crazy .
This is why , whenever a major U.S. franchise announces that it 's opening up a restaurant in Canada , many of us freak out .
It happened with Chipotle , it happened with Chick-Fil-A , it happened with Panera Bread , and now , it 's happening with California 's In-N-Out Burger -- albeit rather briefly .
In-N-Out announced earlier this week in a Metro newspaper ad that it would be holding a one-day-only pop-up from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Ganzi Osteria restaurant on Jarvis st. in Toronto on Thursday . Being a city where gourmet burger joints are nearly as ubiquitous as Tim Horton 's locations , one would think that Toronto 's appetite for beef would be well-satisfied .

The game of Chess , said to have been invented as early as 600 A.D. in India , is said to have been characterized by attacks against the enemy King . Nevertheless , since the popularization of the game since the past 3 centuries , a number of principles have been evolved by the erstwhile masters of the game , which have been tried and tested over a prolonged period .
One of such principles related to the opening moves of a chess game , initiated and advocated by Francois-Andre Philidor in the year 1749 . Unfortunately , the importance of the principles of Philidor was realized much later than he expired , in the nineteenth century , and is commonly referred to as Classical Opening Principles of Chess .
Philidor moved away from the general notion of attacking the enemy king at every possible opportunity in the game of chess . Philidor insisted that the attacks should be more properly planned and executed to win over the enemy . He also laid emphasis on minor objectives in the game . You may have known by now that the major objective of chess game is to attack the enemy king . Philidor emphasized that apart from the major objective , minor objectives such as conquering the centre from the enemy and controlling the conquered centre , should be pursued as part of the development of the game . With this concept getting popular among the chess players , the art of defending against attacks gained more prominence and the games challenge and fascination was taken to a new level .
Without dwelling more on Philidor , let me explain the classical opening principles .
Well , the centre of the chessboard refers to the four vital squares in the central part – the four squares commonly referred to as e4 , e5 , d4 and d5 .
The four major aspects of Classical Opening Principles are —
Centralization
Quick Development
Early castling
Knights before Bishops
Centralization : The most important part in the chessboard is the centre . It is but obvious that pieces placed in the centre attack more squares than those positioned on either sides of the board . For example , a knight placed in “ d4 ” can effectively attack eight squares . Do you know what they are ? They are c2 , b3 , b5 , c6 , e6 , f5 , f3 , and e2 . Assuming that the same knight is not in d4 , but in h1 – then the knight can attack only two squares – f2 and g3 .
If you do not control or possess a fair share of the centre , then it might be difficult to maneuver pieces from one side of the board to the other side of the board .
Quick Development : The second important part of Classical Opening Principles is Quick Development . You might know that pawns are of the lowest cadre . The minor pieces such as bishops and knights are the next cadre . The Queen and the rooks are the major pieces in the chessboard while the ultimate superior is the King .
According to classical principles , developing minor pieces is considered important before developing major pieces such as rooks and the queen . It should be ensured that pawn movements are restricted to the minimum . The knights can jump over other pieces in the board and as such , pawn movement is not necessary for developing the knights . If you open up the pawns in front of the King and the Queen , then the two bishops are opened up , and so are the Queen and the King .
Early castling : Castling , as you all know , is one of the special moves in chess , where the king is allowed to move two squares in a single move . In addition , two pieces are moved in a single move , the King and the Rook .
The two rooks are in the two corners . In line with the concept of quick development , both the minor pieces such as bishops and knights can be moved out after the pawns in front of the queen and the king are opened . Now there will be no pieces in between the King and the Rook at the kingside , while queen will be there in the queenside . You can take up castling on the kingside , thereby opening up the rook to combine with the Queen and the other rook . In addition , the King in the first row will be guarded by the Queen and two rooks .
Knights before Bishop : Another part of the classical opening principles is to move the knights before the bishop . As already stated , the knights can be moved without waiting for the pawns to leave way , as they are capable of jumping over pieces lying in between the original square and the destination square of the knight . As such , it is suggested that knights are moved into the front before opening up the bishops .
These classical opening principles , if employed effectively , can open up to fascinating contests in the middle game , as the art of defense and attack needs to be mastered to enhance the level of knowledge in the game of chess .
Polymers that change shape , size , or stiffness in response to light , heat , or liquids could be useful materials that power mechanical devices . Alternatively , that induced motion could be used to generate electricity for low-power devices .
Some polymers swell in water , which can make them suitable as an artificial muscle . Current materials ca n't replicate motion that 's as smooth , fast , and powerful as muscle contractions , though careful design has now helped scientists improve the performance of water-induced material actuators . And , in the process , they 've made a device that can slowly charge a capacitor—just by getting wet .
Mingming Ma and co-workers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built a material that has strands of a water-responsive polymer called polypyrrole held between a rigid skeleton of a different polymer ( made from branched ethylene glycol connected with borate groups ) . This construction mimics the structure of our muscle fibers , which have strings of stretchy fibers surrounded by a rigid matrix of collagen .
Things start moving when the scientists place their new material on a wet surface . Water vapor seeps into the bottom of the material , severing the links between the polypyrrole and the rigid matrix . The water also breaks some of the bonds in the rigid matrix .
These chemical changes cause the material to soften , swell and pull away from the surface . As more of the film peels off the surface , the curved sheet topples onto its side . If this film was a crunchy taco shell , the fillings would be spilling all over the table . And while tacos ca n't move out of this position without help , this material can .
Water evaporates from the moist side of the film ( now on top ) and that portion of the material stiffens . Meanwhile , a part of dry side of the sheet ( now on bottom ) absorbs water from the surface and curls up . This asymmetric swelling and stiffening causes the material to stretch and leap across the surface . Eventually , what was originally the dry side of the film settles on the wet surface and the cycle begins again .
The researchers harnessed that mechanical motion to generate electricity . They covered the new film in a material that generates electricity in response to mechanical stress . This piezoelectric actuator generated about 1.0V with a 10-megohm resistor in the circuit . Capturing that motion-induced voltage in a different circuit and rectifying the signal , the researchers charged a 2.2 microF capacitor in about 7 minutes to its full capacity ( about 0.66V ) .
These materials might be used to generate electricity for low-power devices , the researchers write . But it 's the material 's performance , not the application , that 's the advance here . Adding a rigid matrix to polypyrrole increases the water-induced stress by four orders of magnitude and increases the strain six-fold over polypyrrole alone . The mechanical power density of the new material is on the order of 1 watt per kilogram .
The idea of harvesting energy from a moisture gradient , rather than typical sources like light , heat , or wind , is interesting , write Hyoki Kim and Sunghoon Kwon , of Seoul National University , in an accompanying commentary . Though the electrical energy generated from this prototype is low , stacking these devices might help increase the power output , they add . However , they caution that the polymer film might break after many cycles of actuation .

Managing Local Administrator Passwords
So you have a complex password policy on your domain , ensuring that users change their password every 60-90 days , passwords are complex , their passwords ca n't be re-used and your users are not local admins but one thing poses a security risk , the local administrator password .
The chances are you have deployed your standard Windows image using a password specified within the image/MDT or SCCM task sequence and in some cases you do not have the IT resources to ensure that this password is changed on a regular basis and even if you are , are you ensuring that the passwords are being documented and stored securely ? .
Security Risk – Local Administrator Rights
If you do not have a well maintained local administrator password strategy it opens your network up to security vulnerabilities including elevation of privilege . It is n't going to go down well when your standard local workstation admin password is shared and users add themselves to the local admin group , potentially in the worst case scenario adding malware , key loggers etc .
The Answer – Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution ( LAPS )
Microsoft LAPS is a free tool released back on May 1st 2015 and allows you to automate the process of updating local administrator passwords on your workstations and servers across your Active Directory domain/forest . LAPS uses a local agent in conjunction with GPO deployed settings to update the local administrator password at set intervals , based on complexity settings that you specify and most importantly it automatically stores backups of this info within Active Directory .
Deploying Microsoft LAPS
First of all you will need to download the installer from the following URL – https : //www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx ? id=46899 . In the below section we will run through the entire installation and configuration process ;
Management Server Installation A single installer is used for both the server and client installs , the only real difference being that the management tools need to be installed on the management server . Run the LAPS.x86 or LAPS.x64 installer as per your system architecture , then run through the following ; Launch the installer At the custom setup screen select the management tools and select run from my computer and then click Next
Click on the Finish button to finalise the installation Active Direct Schema Modification In order for computers to write back their local administrator passwords and expiry date/time , a schema update is required . The update adds the following two values : ms-Mcs-AdmPwd – Stores the password in clear text
ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime – Stores the time to reset the password To add these values , launch a PowerShell session on your management server and perform the following actions ; Type – Import-Module AdmPwd.PS to import the required LAPS module
to import the required LAPS module Type – Update-AdmPwdADSchema Note : If you have an RODC installed in the environment and you need to replicate the value of the attribute ms-Mcs-AdmPwd to the RODC , you will need to change the 10th bit of the searchFlags attribute value for ms-Mcs-AdmPwd schema objet to 0 ( substract 512 from the current value of the searchFlags attribute ) . For more information on Adding Attributes to or Removing attributes from the RODC Filtered Attribute Set , please refer to http : //technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754794 ( v=WS.10 ) .aspx .
Active Directory Rights
Computer Rights In order for computer accounts to write values to the ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime and ms-Mcs-AdmPwd attributes in Active Directory , the following PowerShell command needs to be run ( note if closed the previous PowerShell window you will need to run Import-Module AdmPwd.ps again ) Set-AdmPwdComputerSelfPermission -OrgUnit < name of the OU to delegate permissions >
User Rights
By default members of the Domain Admins group will have rights to view the local administrator passwords stored in Active Directory , however what happens if you want your desktop support team to view them ? . To facilitate this you will need to delegate rights . To do so use the following PS command : Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission -OrgUnit < name of the OU to delegate permissions > -AllowedPrincipals < users or groups > Going another step further you can also delegate rights to allow groups or individuals to force a password change . To do so use the following PS command : Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission -OrgUnit < name of the OU to delegate permissions > -AllowedPrincipals < users or groups >
Group Policy Configuration First of all you will need to copy the LAPS ADMX and ADML files to your central store . The two files are located in the % WINDIR % \PolicyDefinitions folder on the management server . Now follow the below ; 1 . Open Group Policy Manager and either create or modify a GPO that you wish to apply the LAPS settings . 2 . Expand Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\LAPS 3 . Configure your Password Settings , Name of the Local Admin Account and Enable Password Management , as per the below examples : Deploying the LAPS client
Deploying the client is a simple process . Using the same MSI installation files you can deploy the client to your x86 and x64 clients via GPO , SCCM or other third party application deployment systems . Simply use the /quiet switch for client deployments . Check its working .. Active Directory Users & Computers Opening the Active Directory Users & Computers console and viewing the Attribute Editor of a machine located within the OU that you earlier deployed your LAPS enabled GPO to , should result in values being available as per the below screenshot ; LAPS Admin GUI
On the management server that earlier installed LAPS on , you will have the LAPS GUI . This will allow you to both look up details from computers but also set a new expiration date for the existing local admin password ;

In a disaster aftermath , whether caused by hurricane or earthquake or tsunami , the right impulse is to rush in with appropriate relief . For people of faith , too often this same “ rush in ” model is applied to making excuses for God .
This comes to mind today — now — after conversations both with friends in Haiti and my sister in Manhattan in Sandy 's wake . After Haiti 's earthquake , I wrote about avoiding these kinds of statements in this excerpt :
We grope at straws trying to make sense of the suffering . To fill the silence , we say things that are sincere but sometimes silly . We find slivers of Scripture that prop up our defense , but do we want the kind of God that the logic of our straw-patched statements creates ?
“ What a miracle how that girl was pulled from the rubble ! ”
The straw God spoken into being by this statement is one whose power and compassion are disturbingly out of whack . If God could orchestrate the rescue of the one , then why would n't God have protected the many in the first place ?

Friends in Port-au-Prince told me about an 8-year-old girl who survived when the building she was in collapsed — but her mom and sister died in front of her , and her father had died some years ago . She wandered the streets in shock . Days later someone found her and got her back to her village . At that point , do you say , “ What a miracle of God that she survived and was brought back to her village ” ? Is n't that like a babysitter taking your three children out for a canoe ride , returning with only one — because the other two drowned — and then expecting to be congratulated for bringing back one of the three alive ?
“ Well , people down there have always been really poor , right ? ” Or “ They believe in Voodoo , right ? ”
Most people avoid saying these types of statements ( one prominent TV personality aside ) because when said aloud the monstrous logic is so clear . But I have heard them spoken in conversations , and they often seem to linger in the background as a way to find some order . The logic implied is that God 's rain falls on the just and unjust , but God 's judgment is highly selective and tends to fall especially hard on those who are poor ( and whose skin is n't white ) . But what about my friend Emmanual ? He is a pastor and a motorcycle taxi driver . When the earthquake struck , he was out working on his motorcycle . Hundreds of people in his church ( including two of his sisters and a brother ) were together at a prayer service in the name of Christ . They were all killed . God , then , must not judge only harshly — at least that would be consistent — but also capriciously and disproportionately . The victims are to blame for the crime .
“ At least they 're in a better place now . ”
Even if we believe eternal life is true , which I do , that does n't reduce present suffering , does it ? And it 's not a fair dismissal of suffering , because God put such value on this life . Nobody , not believer or atheist or anyone in between , is certain about whether there is a next life . Conceivably any suffering on earth could be eclipsed by the goodness of what is to come , but meanwhile a statement like this simply creates a monstrous God for whom the ends ( even if they torture people ) justify the means .
“ Is n't it amazing that we … happened to be there at just the right time to help ? ”
This self-help God provides suffering to some as an opportunity for others to express compassion or work on self-improvement . This would n't be an all-bad God if everyone made it through . Suffering can be positive for both the helpers and those being helped . But it 's far from positive for everyone . Some die . Some suffer too much to ever recover . Others fail the opportunity for self-improvement and live lives of disappointment ( often taken out on their own children ) .
Also by Kent Annan : What Can We Say ? Theology for Murder and for Living
And does n't this create a God who is a buffoon of a logistician — who can coordinate getting one group into the perfect place , but for some incompetence could n't get the young mother off the porch before the concrete blocks collapsed on her ?
“ We might not understand , but it 's all part of God 's plan. ” Or “ It was meant to be . ”
Would n't any plan this flawed be sent back for major revisions before it could be put into place ? The architect says , “ Here 's the building design , but occasionally the elevator will malfunction and a dozen or so people will plummet to death . The water piped in for the daycare is occasionally radioactive and will cause slow , painful deaths for some of the children . Oh , and the entire building will collapse in the middle of the business day every few years , but we 'll rebuild. ” Um , back to the drawing board please . This platitude about God 's plan is often said citing the verse in Romans 8:28 that “ all things work together for good , ” but surely the assertion of faith is that “ in all things God works for the good of those who love God , ” that God eventually overcomes evil with good , not that all this madness is part of a detailed plan .
But without these simplifications , what can we say to fill the heavy silence ? The simple answers are all unsatisfying as attempts to settle the aftershocks of suffering . Hopefully , in faith and doubt , part of faithfulness is to keep asking , listening and asking again .

“ Lo , who has not been startled a thousand times by the accents of this grave music , whose severe char­acter , nevertheless , animates itself with the fires of passion and throws the soul , enlarged , into a reli­gious reverie a thousand times more inebriating than the imposing voices of the great waters of which the Scriptures speak ? Who has not tasted the charm of so many pieces sublime or original , stamped by the geniuses of the centuries past , who are no more and who have not left any other traces ? Who has not shuddered at the simple planning of the Office of the Dead where the tender and the terrible are so admirably mixed ? What Christian has ever been able to hear the Pascal chant of the Haec Dies without be­ing tried with that vague sentiment of the infinite , as if Jehovah Himself was having His majestic voice heard ? And who has not heard , during the solem­nities of the Assumption of All Saints , an entire congregation making the sacred vaults of the roof resound with the inspired accents of the Gaudeamus , without his being brought back through the ages , to the epoch when the echoes of subterranean Rome resounded with this triumphant chant , when the Empire was painfully terminating its course , and the Church was starting its eternal destinies ? ” – Dom Gueranger , founder of Solesmes
“ The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of inestimable value , greater even than that of any other art ” ; also “ sacred music is to be considered the more holy , the more closely connected it is with the liturgical action. ” – Sacrosanctum Concilium
Catholic identity ; chant is always and everywhere identified with the Catholic faith . Praise and worship / pop music makes the worship less Catholic , because it is taking something that is in the ‘ world ' ( with all its associations with entertainment , concerts , etc . ) and importing into the Mass ; which itself is ‘ otherworldly ' . Chant draws the senses in and elevates the mind towards the worship of God .
Chant captures the solemnness of the Mass
Popular hymns from the 70s/80s are superficial . Chant captures the difficult human emotions associated with deep sadness , suffering , longing for eternity , transcendent joy , the expectation of miracles , the profundity of salvation through death , or most other themes at the core of the Catholic faith . Chant is able to express meaning and sensibility of the life of Christ and the Church throughout the liturgical year , and is deeply beautiful in its complexity .
Chant is distinctively made for the Mass
The chant goes beyond the four hymns you can pick for Mass ( known as the four-hymn sandwich ) . Gregorian chant developed alongside with the Mass as the Mass was eventually organised into a liturgical year . The essential musical structure of Mass emerged in the Middle Ages as the Entrance prayer became the Introit , and the Offertory and Psalm chants came into use . Because chant is attached so closely to the Mass as a part of its structure ; chant is not only the music of the Mass , it is only the form of music that qualifies .
Chant lacks a beat-style , metered rhythm of modern music such as in rock , country , blues , etc . This is called plainsong . The rhythm is more free-flowing . There is an underlying pulse but it does n't cause you to want to tap your toe or dance . What it does do is lift the senses , to take us out of time and reflect on eternal things . In contrast , music with beats keeps us grounded and internal .
Past Popes ( notably Pope St. Pius X ) proclaimed the importance of Gregorian chant and polyphony as the official music of the Church 's liturgy . Para 116 of SC affirmed chant is “ especially suited to the Roman liturgy ” and “ other things being equal , it should be given pride of place in liturgical services . ”
Chant is humble
Praise and Worship tends to concentrate all attention to the performers . The bands are featured as they do all the singing , and the singing style naturally elicits egoism . Chant does not seek to put the talent of any individual singer on exhibit . Scholas serve the Mass , making the chant all about community prayer . The ego is buried , as St. John the Baptist said “ Let me decrease and let him increase in me . ”
Multiculturalism
Any priest from Africa could come to any parish in another country and quickly pick up on the Mass ordinaries and propers . The ordinary settings of the Kyrie , Gloria , Credo , Sanctus and Agnus are worldwide settings in which no national culture in particular is embedded in its sound and feeling . This is true of the propers of the Mass ( Introit , Gradual , Alleluia , Offertory , Communion ) . The Catholic Church is a universal church and universal liturgical forms are required to reflect its global unity . Furthermore , its music in Mass must transcend time , place and cultural character of its people .
Musicians want a challenge
Chant has centuries of daunting and difficult repertoire and best serves to organize and measure the best of musical talent in the church . Postconciliar practice hardly challenges musicians and does nothing to inspire serious musical accomplishment .
The Motu Proprio : Summorum Pontificum
The Summorum Pontificum granted greater freedom to priests to use the Tridentine liturgy in its 1962 form . It provides the impetus for the revival of Gregorian chant . Although the Tridentine is more associated with the chant , the Novus Ordo and both forms of the Mass use the Graduale Romanum as the normative form of music . The introits , communions , and chants are the same in both forms .

Joe DiMaggio Hits Safely in 56 Consecutive Games in 1941
On May 15 , 1941 , it began . On that day , Joltin ' Joe DiMaggio went one-for-four with a run batted in against Eddie Smith and the Chicago White Sox .
From that fateful day until July 16 , fifty-six games later , DiMaggio hit safely in every game , setting a brand-new record that still stands as one of the greatest achievements in baseball history .
While DiMaggio was no stranger to being the star of an always impressive Yankee team , 1941 was even more special than usual . While the rival Red Sox were being led by Ted Williams and his unbelievable batting average , he ended the season at .406 , DiMaggio pulled his team out of an early slump , and led them to the World Series , and himself to an Most Valuable Player Award .
The run to the championship was jump started by DiMaggio 's streak . It is ironic that the streak began against the White Sox , who on at least four occasions nearly ended DiMaggio 's streak themselves . However , it was the Indians , not the White Sox who finally held the Yankee Clipper hitless . On July 17 , third baseman Ken Keltner made two terrific back handed stops to rob DiMaggio of two hits , ending the streak . DiMaggio had ninety-one hits in two-hundred twenty-three at bats during the stretch , hitting .409 . The Yankees had the last laugh , as they won the game , and later the World Series .
DiMaggio kept his streak alive through the All-Star break ( and in fact the game itself as he went one-for-four ) and the death of Yankee great Lou Gehrig on June 2 .
`` The Streak '' , as it has come to be known added to the legend of the great DiMaggio . The eleven-time All-Star was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1955 . In fact , the first line of his Cooperstown plaque pays homage to his 1941 streak .
DiMaggio is one of only a few players whose famous record still stands , as even Hall of Fame worthy Pete Rose ( hit in forty-four consecutive games in 1978 ) and Hall of Famer Paul Molitor ( thirty-nine games in 1987 ) have fallen far short of his record .
Baseball Almanac proudly presents a game-by-game record of the unbreakable , the amazing , the record setting , The Streak .
Gov . Mark Dayton : `` Fifty-nine Republican House members voted for the bill , which is 66 percent of all the Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature . That certainly qualifies the bill as bipartisan . ''
Online voter registration is proof that lawmakers can move quickly to pass policy if facing a hard-and-fast deadline .
The Minnesota Senate cleared a proposal Tuesday afternoon to set up a system of online voter registration in the state . DFL Gov . Mark Dayton said he plans to sign the bill into law as soon as he recieves it Tuesday evening . House lawmakers previously passed the same proposal on a bipartisan vote .
“ I am very pleased that this bill passed with bipartisan support in both bodies , and I look forward to signing it into law today , ” Dayton said in a statement after the Senate vote . “ All-told , 62 of the 89 Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature voted in favor of the bill . ”
Democrats who control the Legislature faced a midnight deadline Tuesday that would suspend the state 's current system of online registration . Ramsey County District Judge John Guthmann ruled Monday that Secretary of State Mark Ritchie overstepped his authority when he unilaterally implemented the program last year .
Republicans and Democrats roundly criticized Ritchie 's move to implement the system on his own after an online voter registration bill initially failed get support in the Legislature . Republicans cried foul and filed the lawsuit , despite mostly supporting the policy that allows online voter registration .
More than 3,600 people have used the system since last September . Guthmann ruled that those registrations would remain valid .
“ This tool has already proven its ability to reduce taxpayer costs by modernizing the work of local government , ” Ritchie said in a statement . “ Online registration has been embraced by Minnesota voters who appreciate the security and ease of the process . ”
The bill goes into effect the day after the governor signs it into law , meaning there could be only a short gap between the midnight suspension of Ritchie 's voter registration program and the new legislatively approved online tool .
After more than two hours of debate , the Senate passed online voter registration on a 41-24 vote . Republicans criticized Democrats for rushing the proposal through the process . Senators accepted the House version of the bill due to time constraints , despite initial differences between their two bills .
The original Senate bill had more provisions that ensured the security of citizens ' private data being used by the Secretary of State 's Office , Republicans said , and they offered a series of failed amendments to strengthen those provisions .
“ I favor online voter registration — I think it 's a good idea , ” said Sen. Scott Newman , a lead Republican on election issues in the upper chamber . “ I sincerely believe the Senate version of this bill is superior and the House version is inferior with respect to our data security . ”
Newman and other Republicans pointed to recent state-related data breaches in public safety , the Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) and a recent breach with the new state-run health insurance exchange , MNsure .
“ Our state agencies are failing us , ” Newman said . “ The idea of data privacy is almost like a full employment act for lawyers . ”
The proposal would also allow citizens to apply for an absentee ballot through the Secretary of State 's website . In both cases , citizens must provide a driver 's license number , a Minnesota-issued ID card number or the last four digits of their social security number and an email address in order to register online .
“ I feel that it 's important for the state to establish an online voter registration system , ” DFL Sen. Katie Sieben , the author of the bill , said . “ I think voters across the state of Minnesota want the convenience of being able to register to vote online…I do n't see any need to delay this further . ”
DFL Rep. Steve Simon , the lead on the issue in the House , said he was “ proud ” legislators passed the bill so quickly after the “ court decision effectively ended it. ” “ The result is greater convenience for eligible voters , savings for taxpayers , and a stronger democratic process , ” Simon , a candidate for secretary of state , added .
Slow starts still plague the Gold Coast Titans but coach Neil Henry admits he has no idea how to solve it after their 32-26 NRL loss to North Queensland .
A fast-finishing Titans piled on two tries in the final five minutes but fell short yet again due to the way they began the round four clashes at Cbus Super Stadium on Saturday night .
In the first 20 minutes North Queensland enjoyed almost 80 per cent possession with a 100 per cent completion rate , racing to a 10-0 lead .
The Titans had completed 50 more tackles by that stage .
Gold Coast typically dug deep to snatch a 12-10 first half lead before two-try Cowboys backrower Coen Hess took charge in the second stanza .
The Titans are now the only NRL team to have not scored a point inside the opening 20 minutes of a match this season .
Not that Henry had to be reminded .
`` We 've talked about starting better , '' Henry said .
`` But there 's no magic formula to starting better .
`` I do n't know if you have a solution to it ? ''
In their first four games Gold Coast have not only failed to score in the opening 20 minutes , they have also conceded a total of 38 points in that time .
`` It 's the patches where we do n't have the ball for the first 10 minutes ( which hurt ) , '' Henry said .
`` It takes a lot of energy out of the guys out there - it all adds up . ''
Gold Coast 's whirlwind finish coming back from a 20-12 halftime deficit only added to Henry 's frustration .
Henry admitted he wondered what might have been if their attack - led by impressive halfback Ash Taylor - had received more ball , and earlier .
`` I thought we played some entertaining football and really tested their defence , '' he said .
`` But we needed a bit more possession and our goal-line defence needs to be better .
`` If we get that right our attack is good enough to worry other teams . ''
Cowboys co-captain Johnathan Thurston enjoyed a points decision over Taylor but admitted the Titans No.7 had kept him honest .
`` That 's always going to be the way when you come up against an exciting talent like him , '' Thurston said .
`` He 's no doubt got a big future ahead of him - it was nice to get one over him . ''
Ex-Sydney Roosters centre Dale Copley also impressed with two tries on Titans debut .
Another Titans debutant , ex-Brisbane winger Daniel Vidot , also scored in the final Titans frenzy .
Gold Coast still have 11 players out including NRL star Jarryd Hayne - not back for at least another three weeks - and ex-Parramatta rake Nathan Peats .
In another worry , prop Agnatius Paasi is nursing a shoulder injury while co-captain Ryan James may come under scrutiny for his 18th minute hit on Cowboys prop Patrick Kaufusi .
Tickets for the Tiny House Conference ( “ tiny houses , big conference ” ) in Portland , Ore. , in April cost $ 349 . The event featured inspirational talks like “ Downsize Your Space and Life ” and “ Future of the Movement. ” In Charlotte , N.C. , you can hire a tiny house life coach to help with your transition .
There have been some skeptics . In December 2013 , The Atlantic ran an article headlined “ The Health Risks of Small Apartments. ” The results the magazine reported were inconclusive . Small spaces may pose psychological risks to some populations , but not to others . Some of the experts interviewed by The Atlantic argued that age might matter . Micro apartments could be good for young people , like my husband and me .
Life in our tiny home is characterized above all by shabbiness . Like the apartment 's pervasive , undomesticateable dust bunnies , the threadbare feeling grows and grows simply because it already exists .
No one warns you that everything is more concentrated in a tiny house , that the natural life cycle of objects accelerates .
Our things are aging faster than they did in their previous homes . We sit on our lone couch more hours a day than in any previous dwelling . The cushions are fading , the springs sagging , the corners fraying . Our rug is balding along our daily paths , starkly revealing repetitive routines : back and forth to the coffee machine , to the couch , to the sink , to the couch . The denudations look like cow paths cut through sage brush — invasive affronts on the landscape . Everything in our tiny house is worked over more , used harder .
Here , even smells take up space . We once made a meal that called for caramelizing three pounds of onions . For hours the onions melted in their pan . Technically they were taking up less and less space , but somehow they intruded more . In a tiny house , the smell of slowly sweated onions is an inescapable , cloyingly rich aroma ; a scent to drive men — and women — mad .
The eau de onion spread to everything . It clung especially to the moist bathroom towels , and to the laundry drying in the bedroom . We were never clean again . Fresh from the shower , we immediately smelled of onions — of tiny house . For weeks , smelling like old onions became one of our micro lives ' certainties . The scent 's preferred repository , I eventually learned , was my New Age , polyester sports bra .
The Wizards are playing on Christmas Day ( against the Boston Celtics , no less ) , so the team wo n't have much time to celebrate the holiday . As a result , John Wall , who provides gifts to his teammates every time they take the court , decided to do the old Santa Claus thing a few days early .
That 's a brand-new Rolex for all the Wizards players .
🎶 I just wan na Rolly Rolly Rolly 🎶 @ JohnWall just gave one of these to each of his teammates ⌚ # SeasonOfGiving # DCFamily # WallWay pic.twitter.com/b83BXdBn1g — Washington Wizards ( @ WashWizards ) December 22 , 2017
Now , you might think a Rolex is a mere drop in the bucket for somebody on an NBA max contract , and you 'd be right about that . But assuming he bought one for each of the 15 other players on the roster ( not including himself ) , that gets pricey very quickly .
As somebody who admittedly knows close to nothing about watches , much fewer watches that cost four or five digits each , this is going to be a struggle . But based on a quick browsing of the Rolex catalog , the watches Wall bought are part of the Day-Date line , let 's say the Day-Date 40 .
Rolex does n't allow the prices of many of their models to be listed online , but a quick search of eBay finds them routinely going for $ 25,000 or more . Even the other Day-Date models tend to go for north of $ 8,000 on eBay .
Now , I 'm going to go out on a limb and assume Wall did not buy his Rolex watches on eBay . It also appears , based on what is said in the video , that there might be an inscription of some kind on the back of the watch . That probably did n't come cheap .
All this is to say : This was not a cheap holiday present from the Wizards star , no matter how much money he 's making . And do n't forget , there are nine players on the team with less than $ 10 million guaranteed to them , and six players with less than $ 5 million . That 's nowhere near the almost $ 170 million Wall is getting on this contract , and a gift of that value has a much bigger impact on the other players .
So good on you , John Wall . It might not have helped on Friday night , but it 's got to be good for morale , right ?

The very first parameter to measure individual football players performances is still the most wide spread . Every single league has an award for it : a simple count of the number of goals scored . But it is a flawed metric . It favours players playing on superior teams , it does n't take into account whether the goals were scored against decent opposition , whether they were scored at home or away , or whether those goals actually contributed to winning matches or were scored when already leading comfortably .
There is a workaround for this . 11tegen11 has previously presented a metric to account for the importance of goals scored in terms of how many points they won for the team that scored them . This metric factors in the quality of opposition and the venue by looking at the average bookie odds presented and it corrects for the timing of the goals , with dying seconds winners being rewards much more points than early opening goals .
Now , straight to the data for goals scored . Much like last season , the chart is led by Vitesse 's Wilfried Bony . The striker has scored just two goals in the first four matches , but as one of them was the injury time winning goal over Feyenoord , he scores high in this ranking . The nominal top scorer chart is led by AZ 's Jozy Altidore , with four goals from four matches , but his two goals against Heracles at home hardly scored any points .
The assists chart is led by Vitesse 's Marco van Ginkel , with only a slight lead over Dusan Tadic , who provided no less than five assists in Twente 's first four matches .
Adding both charts leads to the Most Valuable Player chart with respect to points won for them respective teams by goals and assists . This shows a top-3 consisting of Bony , Chevalier ( ADO ) and Schaken ( Feyenoord ) , while nominal top-2 players like Tadic ( 7 ) , Mertens ( 6 ) won less points with their goals and assists .
Obviously , no metric is perfect . But correcting for ‘ easy goals and assists ' seems a reasonable thing to do when looking at scoring charts . We 'll revisit these charts regularly during the season and see which players show up when it counts !
Nav Canada is going ahead with rate reductions and a $ 60 million refund to customers after it made too much money in 2016 . Customers will see an average 3.5 percent reduction in base fees along with a .4 percent temporary rate reduction . Such rate reductions have happened before but the refund is noteworthy . “ Higher than expected traffic growth this year has put us in a position to be able to refund $ 60 million to our customers , ” said Neil Wilson , president and CEO . “ In the past , Nav Canada has spread the return of previous years ' surpluses , when applicable , by temporarily reducing rates for the coming year . With the unusually high traffic growth , we decided to implement a refund , which will enable our customers to fully benefit sooner . ”
Commercial customers will see their rate reductions Sept. 1 but the billing cycle for GA customers begins in March and the rate cut will be on the 2018 bill . It would appear no one 's bill will actually change from last year . Nav Canada did a temporary 3.9 percent reduction in rates last year and the most recent action makes 3.5 percent of that permanent while .4 percent could expire in 2019 .
CHENNAI : ​Tipped to be the new defence minister in the Sirisena cabinet , former Sri Lankan army chiefsaid the new regime will never allow the Pakistani spy agency ISI to use Lankan soil to mount attacks on southern India . In an exclusive and wide ranging interview to TOI , Fonseka said he was prepared to face any international inquiry into his role as the army chief during the operations against the LTTE . Rajapaksa was largely ignorant of ground operations conducted by the army against the LTTE and in his election manifesto in 2005 had even proposed peace talks with Prabhakaran Fonseka : Rajapaksa was politicizing the military , judiciary , police , government administration and everything . There was never good governance at all . His family members were largely involved in the administration . Corruption was very high . All cross-sections of people in the country thought he should be sent away from the government . So people have thrown him out from power.Fonseka : I will play a major in the security aspect . I like to work with the President on the national security . Though I am not a parliamentarian right now I am expecting a political post . ( Indicating defense ministry ) Fonseka : When I came out the prison in 2012 , I made a public statement that we will chase him before 2015 . The main opposition parties decided to join together and fight against Rajapaksa . Senior leaders like Chandrika Kumaratuge , Ranil Wikramasinge and I expressed desire for a stronger opposition and Maithripala Sirisena left Rajapaksa . We strongly believed the united opposition can defeat him . The support of Tamil National Alliance and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress was crucial . The minorities played a very important role.Fonseka : Nobody from the international community gave me directions or encouraged me . We did it on our own . If international community really wanted to end Rajapaksa 's government then they would have done it even before since this man antagonized many countries . He was only friendly with China and ignored the rest of the world . His relationships with other countries were not correct . His foreign policy was not correct . There were no human rights in the country during his regime.Fonseka : We have not signed any agreement with any country for any probe . If there are any allegations of human rights violations or war crimes then the rest of the international community will be interested to probe . We ca n't accommodate everyone . We ca n't permit everyone . But our military court would conduct inquiries . Whenever there was mass killing our military did inquire into it . The government can take action against the military.Fonseka : If there is a legitimate inquiry then as a member of the country we have to face it . As far as the military is concerned I have to face it . If there is a legitimate inquiry then I am ready to face it since I was doing the ground operations . Rajapaksa was trying to get political mileage by saying I will not allow war heroes to face inquiry and all that . He made many nonsensical statements like this . But he knew only little about the war and what happened in the war field.Fonseka : He gave only orders as a President which is what the previous Presidents did . But operations were not successful . He does n't know tactical and strategical operations . Every President wanted to finish the war . But in the 2005 election manifesto , Rajapaksa said he will have peace talks with Prabhakaran . When the army was chasing the LTTE , he did n't even know what was happening on the ground in 2007 . He did not even allocate money for ammunitions . I was recruiting additional 85,000 army men . When I became commander I recruited 4,000 men in a month . Earlier only 3,000 people joined the army for a year . I planned the entire operation and I was communicating with all levels of army persons.Fonseka : Everybody saw the dead body . We found the bodies of Prabhakaran and his elder son Charles Antony . We never found bodies of his wife Mathivathani and daughter . I saw one of the interviews of Kumaran Padmanapan who had said both of them were front liners in the war . We believe they were in the war field . Prabhakaran 's wife helped the militants with logistics support and his daughter was a female cadre of LTTE . No body would have escaped from the war field.Fonseka : We do n't know . We never captured him alive . I have seen the pictures of his body only through media . If the army had killed him , I would have been informed.Fonseka : We only found their bodies after the war was over.Fonseka : They have to face the legal action . They were hardcore terrorists.Fonseka : Kumaran Padmanapan ( KP ) has the large part of the money and gold . That is why he has been spared by the Rajapaksa government . Tons and tons of gold have been taken by Rajapaksa family through KP . There will be an inquiry in this regard.Fonseka : We have to maintain the army there . Not only for internal security , but also in the view of security threat externally.Fonseka : As long as we are in power , we would not allow it to happen.Fonseka : The military has far been positioned in the country . If people in North say you ca n't keep the military in their area then people in South will repeat the same.Fonseka : We will follow a non-aligned policy . We will not be friendly with only one country . We will maintain good relations with all.Fonseka : If it is happening we ca n't allow any such kind of terror activities in a country which is a sovereign nation . We will not permit any kind of terror activities .

Something in me knew I was n't ready . Something in me knew that for all the games I 've watched , I was not prepared to witness . I had come back to Seattle expecting to be blown away by the experience . I now realize how absurd that expectation was . It was a woeful underestimate of what was coming . I was ready for a great football game . I soon realized I bought tickets to an execution .
I imagine most long-time displaced Seahawk fans fight the exact same internal battle I have fought for some time . `` One of these days I 'll make it to a game . '' turns to `` HD is just like being at the stadium . '' which devolves in to my favorite fallacy , `` Watching the game on TV is probably better than being there . Think of all the time and money I 'm saving '' . Sad .
Last Wednesday something boiled over in me . Decades of quiet fanaticism suppressed by real world justifications had pushed its way to the surface , forcing me over the edge . There was no rationalizing with this thing . It had become irrepressible . `` What if '' suddenly became `` Why not ? '' . `` Someday '' was now `` Sunday '' . THIS was the game . THIS was the week .
This fit of fan rage would have a large toll to pay . Since the schedule came out , week two Seahawks-Niners was immediately the most expensive ticket of the regular season . I 'm not rich . I work for a living and that living is by no means extravagant . There would be no flight . There would be no hotel . There would be gas station `` meals '' and a couch on the other end of 11 hours straight to Seattle the night before the first biggest game of the year . This was a business trip , bitches .
I had a plan . Sleep in Sunday after the trip out . Recoup . Make ready to scream my lungs out , blow my ears up and ( fingers crossed ) celebrate the win by running to the car to consume copious amounts of caffeine to survive the 11 hours back in time for work on Monday . I know what you 're thinking . Bulletproof .
I got to the stadium at 3pm to have plenty of time to soak in the Clink for the first time , visit the pro shop , get fleeced by the food vendors and then find my seat . So far so good . I had arrived . I found my seat in the south end zone regaled in my new Kam jersey , anxious to size up our team in person . My first `` Holy shit '' moment was as the Legion came out running around the edge of our end zone . Earl looked as I expected . Sherm looked long and lean . Then there was Kam . My hell , he looks like he was drawn up in a comic book to kick the world 's ass . Death Backer indeed .
I watch each position group warm up . Our skill group 's talent seems obvious . They move effortlessly and pluck each perfect pass out of the air like someone is passing them the salt at the dinner table . Our lines are enormous . Beast looks fast even when he 's just messing around . This is what elite looks like . My confidence grows .
The 49ers are in the opposite end zone and to be honest , I do n't care to size them up . I get a good look at their faces as they saunter back to the locker room . I get my first real chance to warm up the vocal chords in their direction . Vernon is trying hard to act distracted and aloof while talking to a teammate . The inactives are huddled together and walking slowly , doing their best not to show fear . Harbaugh jogs briskly into the tunnel , careful never to raise his eyes above the barrier . The only member of the enemy that is n't obviously covering up with extreme bravado or utter avoidance is Joe Staley . Staley walks purposefully with his eyes to the crowd . He looks as if he is making mental notes of who he 's going to kill after the game . He 's storing fuel . He 's going to need it .
My first taste of the noise I had come all this way to experience is during pre game intros for the offense . The Seahawks know how to get the crowd warmed up as expertly as they do their athletes . The crescendo rises and falls with each intro . It builds through the lineman . It rises noticeably with Zach . It elevates again with Sid and Golden . It swells louder with Beast . Everyone has saved something extra for Russ . This was first gear for the 12s . It was jarring .
As captain 's meet and the coin toss gives us the chance to defer , we rise again . We 're getting our first shot at Kap and the record right out of the gate . Pete puts his defense on the field first on purpose . When our boys are on defense , the 12s are on offense .
We 're ready now . We 're idling . I 'm waiting for the 12-man flag to be raised by some semi Seattle celebrity when it happens . I see the screen playing Shaun Alexander highlights and I get the chills . I get louder . So do my 68,000 friends . He raises the flag and bounds to the railing and waives his towel . It 's in this moment that I think we all suddenly remember how much we love him . We have n't been kind to his memory since his sudden decline , heaping praise on Hutch and Walt to explain his gaudy production . But in that moment we all remembered his greatness . He is family and he deserves this roar for all he 's done for us . We oblige in ernest . This is second gear . I am in awe , awash in emotion between the memories of greatness and the shock of the crowd 's power . I compose myself and finish my roar . It lasts as long as Shaun waves his towel . He waives it until his arm goes dead . I turn to see the kick in mid air and we 're under way .
As Kap takes the field , we find third gear . This is the start of our power band . Its a constant drone of contempt . It is a weaponized noise like an LRAD and the 12s wield it expertly . At that moment , the first moment I felt discomfort , I realize I left my ear plugs in the car . Fuck it . I 'm all in and I 'm going to enjoy it . The niners go three and out and we swell louder in celebration .
The game ebbs and flows as we trade possessions . When John Ryan 's punt is blocked I cringe and gear up to yell louder towards the far end zone . The crowd readies as the defense gets set to fight with it 's back against the wall . The drone rises in pitch and volume . I can hear the gear changes now . This is fourth and it 's devastating . The niners inch closer to pay dirt . It 's third down and Kap looks for room between the boom . He does n't find it . WTIII crashes down and pops the ball into the air . We all know what is about to happen and we 're already shrieking in celebration as Earl cradles the night 's first offering to the Legion .
At some point durning a roll out by Russell , I see and hear the first lightning bolt split and crash . We 're soon told to find shelter until it 's safe for the game to resume but as a large faction heads to the concourses ( mostly wearing red ) I take the chance to get to know my neighbors . No one can remember a weather delay during a game . There was the storm in '06 that put bubbles in the turf `` but that was before the game started , was n't it ? '' . We all laugh about the absurdity of rain delays in Seattle .
The Niners had been in this situation before . It worked to their advantage in the SuperBowl ( almost , anyways ) but this was going to be different and we all knew it . Ray Lewis believes the League caused that blackout to give the Niners a chance to get back in the game ( That shit cray , Ray ) . The fans used it as a chance to lube up and I thought it had a noticeable effect on the volume when the game resumed . After that , we were consistently in fourth gear pre snap and our excited cheers would spike louder with each big play from the defense .
I heard later that It was some point in the third quarter that we spiked to 136 decibels to decimate the reading in the first quarter to best the record . I 'm sure it was during a celebration . As much power as the 12s have to disrupt on a constant level , the effort to celebrate is n't effort at all . We were dominating and it only empowered us to go for the throat ( That was a pun . I intended it ) .
The game hit it 's stride as we celebrate each pivotal turnover and each big play on offense with the same zeal and even more so after we see the niners want no more . When Beast caught his touchdown in the red zone and stopped to toy with the defense , we went ballistic . The glee on every fan 's face was priceless . What a huge `` Eff You '' to a team that spent the entire offseason making sure week 16 would never happen again .
Despite the long drive that awaited , I stayed to the end . I watched it all , celebrated as long as possible , thanked the fans around me , made sure to wave goodbye to the Niner fans sadistic enough to stay . It was glorious . I walked to the car surrounded by chant 's of SEA ! HAWKS ! using the last of my broken voice to join in . I smiled all the way home as I relived the dominance of our secondary , the great flashes from our free agent pass rushers , and the merciless power of the fans I had finally seen and heard for myself .
Today is Tuesday . I still can not speak . I still can not hear . I still can not stop smiling . I will always remember my first trip to Century Link Field . I will always hear the noise in my mind when watching from afar . I now know what it means to be a 12 . We are mercenaries . We are to be feared and respected . We are Terrible .
The obese American is not just a person ; it 's also most US cities . Most cities here sprawl over way too much land for their number of inhabitants . Compare that footprint to Old World cities that are much more compact .
While we say “ footprint , ” the more accurate term would be “ tire track . ”
Our cities take up so much land not for humans , but for automobiles . Cars like wide streets , parking lots , driveways , parking garages for rest , gas stations for sustenance , repair shops and parts stores for health , dealer lots to show off , junkyards for final repose , plus highway patrol stations , parcels zoned commercial for insurance offices etc . Add it all up , cars take up as much surface area as do people in American cities .
Old World cities grew up in the era of muscle power , when trips were limited by the legs of humans , donkeys and oxen ; hence , the old centers of old cities are quite compact . American cities grew up in the era of mechanical power , enabling people to transport themselves over greater distances ; hence , the “ broad shoulders of Chicago. ” We 're spoiled by automobiles , but there is a regimen that would shape up both our waistlines and our skylines , one that 's worked wherever tried : land dues .
A few modern cities have put themselves on this regime and are somewhat more compact than neighboring towns of similar attributes . The trim towns were n't trying to become firm but rather raise revenue , attract investment and generate jobs . The in-fill was a welcome byproduct .
What these cities did – notably Pittsburgh ( twice voted America 's Most Livable ) – was shifted their property tax off buildings , onto land , turning the property tax into land dues . When owners must pay for land on an ongoing basis , they quit withholding prime sites from productive use ( whether they were speculating or just forgot they owned the land ) and get busy putting up buildings . All the new construction is what requires inputs of labor and capital , and the resultant busier city raises the tax base , so econo-man is happy .
But environmentalists have reason to cheer , too . Owners in-fill cities from the center out . Land dues are heaviest for the pricey sites , which usually are downtown . Those owners are the ones most eager to redevelop their vacant lots and abandoned buildings . So , they absorb the demand for new development , leaving little or none leftover to sprawl onto the fringe , while Mayor of Harrisburg ( Pennsylvania 's capital ) Steve Reed credited their levy on land for sparing the suburban land .
Alan Durning ( formerly of WorldWatch ) calls land dues “ the sprawl tax. ” Joseph Dimasi calculated that shifting the property tax landward would shrink Boston 's radius a half mile ( National Tax Journal , 1987 December ) . Recall the blessings of density : less heat leakage from contiguous buildings , less fuel consumption from shorter trips , less smog and oily runoff , fewer fatalities , less bowling alone , more bus riding and bike riding . Residents can get in as good shape as their cities , and become more neighborly .
If you 've been in the Sierra Club long , you might have heard of the tax on land , since John Muir endorsed it ( “ The American Conservation Movement ” by Stephen Fox ) . The key element is not the tax , but the idea that we have a right to some earth , to all Earth in good shape and to a share of her value , since none of us made Earth , all of us need Earth and all of us make her valuable ; location value rises with population density . The tax is just a way to recover our commonwealth with which we could then fund any desired social programs or pay ourselves a share , à la Alaska 's oil dividend , or do a mix of both .
The property tax shift is part of the larger Green Tax Shift ( see Durning 's book , “ Tax Shift ” ) , which is the mate of the Green Subsidy Shift – quit subsidizing sprawl , fossil fuels , logging etc. , ( see Friends Of the Earth 's Green Scissors campaign ) and instead disburse government support equitably . These policies , in turn , dovetail nicely with the insights coming out of ecological economics ( I abbreviate it to “ geonomics ” ) , such as Nobel laureate ( 2009 ) Elinor Ostrom 's work on the commons .
Such thinking is spreading . Which is good . Because if the public does not recover the socially-generated value of sites and resources , it leaves that immense value – trillions in the US each year ( derived from data at the US BEA web site ) – to a few speculators and growth promoters to pocket by wasting land and leaving behind waste . People who want to reverse the human assault on the planet have no choice but to come to grips with money made via eco-ploitation .
Fortunately , to shift the paradigm , we can do so in winnable steps , starting locally . While a few Pennsy towns have already shifted their property tax , more could by jazzing up the proposal . Combine it with axing unpopular taxes , and , as carbon tax proponents have , combine it with the dividend , similar to the Aspen , Colorado , housing assistance from a land tax .
Add local revenue reform to your to-do list . Money is where the rubber meets the road . Doing so , you 'll make your city – and its residents – fit , svelte and low impact .
What some scholars believe could be the world 's oldest known Jewish prayer book is now part of a private collection founded by an evangelical businessman .
The identification of the very rare prayer book , dated to the ninth century , was announced Sept. 26 by Steve Green , president of the arts and crafts retailer Hobby Lobby . Green facilitates his family 's array of biblical texts and artifacts , the Green Collection . The text was purchased from a collector .
Measuring about 11-by-10 centimeters , the 50-page , tan-colored book is written in an archaic form of Hebrew with Babylonian vowel markings , according to the Religion News Service . The fact that that book appears to still have its original binding makes it very special , according to Dr. Jerry Pattengale , director of the Green Collection 's research arm , the Green Scholars Initiative .
`` It is certainly the earliest copy of such a book that has been known , '' Pattengale told The Huffington Post .
Predating the earliest known copies of the Torah by several hundred years , the prayer book -- also known as a siddur -- could prove to be an important link to religious scholarship of the era .
`` This artifact may very well be the earliest connection today 's practicing Jews have to the roots of their rabbinic liturgy , ” Green announced at the Religion Newswriters Association conference , according to Forward . Jewish tradition dictates that holy texts be buried or hidden when they wear out , Green notes , which has led to very few surviving before the 15th century .
The book 's codex appears to have been created first , followed by the inside text , Pattengale noted . The inside of the book is broken into six unique sections relating to topics as diverse of the End Times and the Passover Seder . The first of the sections include a set of 100 benedictions , or blessings , that could have been recited by observant Jews of the day .
`` This was a liturgical set of prayers , hymns and poems used for various occasions , '' Pattengale told HuffPost . `` The prayer book is really what most of the Jewish community would be in touch with on a daily basis , [ creating ] a connection between the Bible and their daily worship . ''
Researchers from the Green Scholars Initiative used carbon-14 dating to ascertain the book 's exact age , Pattengale said . The text 's origins are more mysterious , however . While the markings imply the text is from the Babylonian region , Pattengale said it may take another year for Green Institute researchers to confirm from which region it came .
The prayer book , along with other artifacts from the Green Collection , are scheduled to be part of an inaugural display at a yet-to-be named biblical museum , slated to open in March 2017 in Washington , D.C .

Clarification : A previous version of this article implied that worn out prayer books are often destroyed . In fact , generally prayer books are hidden away or buried when they become damaged or are no longer needed .

But as Em 's behavior becomes increasingly erratic , the couple fears the presence of a malevolent force in their midst , only to discover that the box was built to contain a dibbuk , a dislocated spirit that inhabits and ultimately devours its human host .
Some Local Businesses Hurting Without NBA Assist

From Los Angeles to New York City and Miami to Dallas , professional basketball fans face November without the NBA . The league keeps canceling games because of the ongoing lockout as players and owners squabble over future contracts .
Most NBA cities have other professional sports to turn to with hoops on hiatus . But some markets , like downtown Oklahoma City , only have one game in town .
It 's lunchtime at Coach 's , a popular sports restaurant and bar attached to the Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City . Customer Maria Allen says it 's busy here — but nothing like nights when the Oklahoma City Thunder plays .

`` I know what Bricktown looks like when it 's a game , and so I can just imagine that these restaurants down here are hurting not having that business , '' Allen says .
Coach 's sees about a 15 percent jump in sales when the Thunder plays home games .
Chad Vesper , sitting a few tables away , has been watching more college football to fill the basketball void . Vesper says all he ever hears in the media is what players or owners are losing .
`` What you do n't always hear about is the hot dog vendor and the person taking tickets and the restaurants down here — that 's a huge impact , '' Vesper says , `` and certainly to the tax revenue for the city . ''
In Oklahoma City , economists estimate each lost game is a million-dollar hit to the economy . Even with that , Mayor Mick Cornett says he 's not as worried about the loss of money ; he 's more concerned about the way the games boost the metro 's image .
`` The idea of having Kevin Durant out there playing with 'Oklahoma City ' on his chest and being in sports magazines and the team being on national television , '' Cornett says , `` those are very positive elements for the community , and there 's an indirect economic development to all of that . ''
What you do n't always hear about is the hot dog vendor and the person taking tickets and the restaurants down here — that 's a huge impact , and especially to the tax revenue for the city .
So far , the NBA 's monthlong cancellation will mean the loss of seven home games in Oklahoma City . Officials book other events in the 18,000-seat arena around the team 's expected season . But on canceled game nights , the center will likely stay empty , further hurting the regional economy .
Tim Linville , the Chesapeake Energy Arena 's marketing director , says the arena employs about 100 full-time employees and 500 part-time employees to help with things like ticket sales , concessions and security .
`` We 're ready no matter what , so if they tell us tomorrow that they 're ready to play , we 're ready to go , '' Linville says . `` The big impact on us running the building is the fact that until they come back , we do n't have as many hours for our part-time people . ''
If the lockout ends soon , the first game would be on Dec. 4 against the New Orleans Hornets . But back at Coach 's restaurant , Vesper says it 's too soon to say if fans — and their money — will return .
`` If they try to squeeze in too many games in a season that 's already shortened , that may have an impact on how the fans treat the players and the owners , that type of thing , so we 'll have to wait and see probably , '' he says .
The Thunder moved to Oklahoma from Seattle three years ago , so the state is n't dependent on the team . But in a sluggish economy , any money lost is money that ca n't be used in a recovery .

Then George W. Bush decided to seek the office his father once held , echoes of another fatherson presidential family sounded : John Adams , second president of the United States , and his son , John Quincy Adams , sixth president of the United States . This Adams family achieved what the Bush clan dreams of.I got to wondering if any fatherson combos ever appeared in the papal line . Since 262 popes span close to 2,000 years -- and since priestly celibacy , contrary to popular opinion , was not a mandate of Jesus -- I thought the chances good.Sure enough , the Roman pontiffs currently outdo the American presidents in this regard . Of course , they have been at it much longer . Pope Innocent I ( 401-417 ) immediately succeeded his father , Pope Anastasius I ( 399-401 ) . And Pope Silverius ( 536-537 ) was the son of Pope Hormisdas ( 514-523 ) , with five popes serving in the intervening 13 years.These four popes , all recognized as saints in the church , are not exactly household names today.Innocent I , the 40th pope , was an early proponent of centralized papal authority , declaring the bishop of Rome `` the head and summit of the episcopate . '' In 410 , Alaric the Visigoth sacked Rome when Innocent was away and kept this pope from returning home for two years . His daddy , Anastasius I , whose reign was short , was well-connected and well-respected . He condemned the famous theologian Origen even though he was reputed not to have read one word Origen ever wrote . Saint Jerome , upon the death of Anastasius , suggested that his reign had been cut short because Rome was undeserving of such a quality bishop ! Pope Silverius reigned little more than a year and was one of only a handful of popes to resign , but not until after he was deposed by an emperor 's general . He died a month later and was buried on the Italian island of Palmaria , where he was exiled . His daddy , Pope Hormisdas , did much better , reigning for nearly a decade and establishing some peace between the Eastern and Western church . In death as well , he fared better than his son . Hormisdas was prominently buried in the portico of St. Peter's.In addition to these two legitimate father-son teams , there 's John XI ( 931-935 ) , the illegitimate son of Pope Sergius III ( 904-911 ) . John was elected the 125th pope in his early 20s . As pope he was imprisoned by a half brother and later lived under house arrest in the papal palace . His father 's papacy was even more bizarre . Sergius first knocked off his predecessor and then several others during the course of his reign . No wonder his tomb has not been preserved . Not surprisingly , neither of these two rogues were ever canonized.After this year 's election , will we see another presidential father-son combo ? It has taken 175 years for this possibility once again to arise here in the United States . We 'll know soon.Will we ever again see another papal father-son combo ? Time -- lots of it -- will tell.PETER GILMOUR ( Pgilmou @ wpo.it.luc.edu ) teaches at the Institute of Pastoral Studies of Loyola University Chicago .

New home sales fell 3.3 % last month in another sign that the housing market weakened amid extreme winter weather .
Builders sold homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000 in February — a five-month low — down from January 's 455,000 , which was revised lower , the Census Bureau said Tuesday . Census initially estimated that homes were sold at annual rate of 468,000 in January , which would have been a five-year high .
However , home sales for November and December were revised up by 14,000 , offsetting January 's downward revision .
For February , economists had estimated that new homes were sold at a 445,000 rate .
Adverse winter weather has been partly blamed for a decline in several housing market indicators recently , including housing starts and existing home sales .
But other forces may also be holding down new home sales , including mortgage rates that have drifted higher since last summer and an unusually low inventory of new homes . Last month , 189,000 homes were for sale , a 5.2 month supply . That 's somewhat higher than in previous months but lower than the normal six-month supply . Low inventories have pushed up prices which dampens sales .
The median sales price of new home sales rose to $ 261,800 from $ 260,100 .

1 . A World of Monsters
Ultron stands over Thor 's body , holding Loki 's staff above him in victory .
Thor is still conscious , just barely . But he is fading fast . Ultron taunts Thor about his delusions of godhood . Underneath it all , Thor is just as flawed and corrupt as the rest . He 's not a god . He 's a monster .
Speak of one and he shall appear .
Just then , Banner strolls onto the scene in slacks and a hoodie . He 's alone . His eyes are bright green , seething with quiet rage . He 's right on the precipice of hulking out . Scarlet Witch attempts to subdue him but Hawkeye comes out of nowhere to take her down with an electric arrow .
Banner ominously warns all three of them to leave . In response , Ultron taunts him . Banner may have gained some control over the Hulk but everyone knows that he 's one bad day away from another catastrophe . In fact , Tony Stark himself created a weapon to put Banner down like a rabid dog . Ultron tells him to take a trip to the shore to see for himself . Ultron then blasts a hole in the hull , causing the ship to start sinking . He uses the distraction to escape with the twins , taking the sceptre and the vibranium . They board Strucker 's jet and fly off .
We cut to the town where the pod has crash landed in the middle of the city . It unfolds and transforms into the Hulkbuster suit just as Tony lands . It lunges at the civilians but Tony intervenes and the battle begins .
Meanwhile , the Avengers evacuate the sinking ship with a comatose Thor . Mjolnir is left to sink with the freighter to the bottom of the ocean . They fly towards the town where they see Iron Man taking on the Hulkbuster – and getting the absolute crap beaten out of him .
Only Hawkeye and Banner are still functional but Banner does n't trust himself to Hulk Out in a populated area . However , just as it looks like the Hulkbuster is about to crush Tony into scrap metal , Banner drops from the Quinnjet .
He lands as the Hulk and stares down the Hulkbuster , which tosses aside the battered Iron Man like a piece of trash . The Hulk roars and the two titans charge at each other .
After a brutal brawl , the Hulk finally gains the upper hand and then rips the armour to pieces . However , he works himself up into such a rage that he almost attacks the nearby civilians and is only stopped by Hawkeye dropping from the Quinnjet and standing in his path . He transforms back into Banner and is horrified at the surrounding destruction .
The Avengers fly off in the Quinnjet , looking like they all just went through hell . Banner confronts Tony about the Hulkbuster , who again tries to justify his actions . Banner seems disappointed rather than angry . He 's not at all opposed to the idea of the Hulkbuster but he 's saddened by the fact that Tony did n't trust him enough to include him in his plans . The Avengers spend the rest of the trip in silence .
2 . A Vision of the Future
Once the twins and Ultron return to Sokovia , we find that the Ultron drones have kidnapped Dr Helen Cho and have stolen her healing cradle . Dr. Cho is defiant and refuses to help Ultron , who simply laughs . She does n't have much of a choice . He uses the sceptre to make her his slave . He laughs , asking her how it feels to be someone else 's puppet .
With Ultron 's guidance , she uses the cradle to begin creating another body , incorporating Vibranium with biological matter and then using the Infinity Stone to stabilise the process . Wanda sees this and is becoming more and more suspicious of Ultron . She demands to know what he 's planning . Ultron cryptically replies that he 's giving evolution a kick up the ass .
3 . The Farm
With Ultron 's eyes everywhere , the Avengers fly to Hawkeye 's farm to regroup . Thor is still comatose with his hammer still stuck in Africa , though his condition has stabilised . They hide out on the farm while they try to figure out Ultron 's next move .
There are a couple of key scenes in this sequence . Just like in the real movie , this is where a lot of the meaty character stuff lies . They meet Hawkeye 's family and then start to piece together what has happened in the last few days . Tony wants to go after Ultron again but Cap tells him that they need to bide their time and recover . Tony 's suit is damaged and Thor is out of commission . They need to put themselves back together or Ultron will finish them off once and for all . Tony reluctantly agrees .
We 're treated to an assortment of character interactions , including but not necessarily limited to :
Cap and Tony argue about their actions . This scene was great and remains unchanged .
Natasha and Clint both discuss how they have left their lives as agents and assassins behind to be heroes . Natasha confesses that she no longer knows who or what she is . Clint puts it bluntly that for the first time in a long time , she can be Natasha Romanoff .
Banner also has a quiet scene with Thor , who drifts in and out of consciousness . Thor manages to stay conscious for a few minutes and deliriously confesses his fears about his mortality . Bruce poses the idea that acceptance of this weakness may make him stronger . It gives him a reason to fight . In turn , Thor suggests that Banner accepts his own strength – both as the Hulk and Banner . He passes out again but leaves Banner with something to think about .
4 . Family
While this is happening , Scarlet Witch continues to express her doubts to Quicksilver about following the orders of a mentally unstable machine . Quicksilver dismisses her concerns and snaps at her , telling Wanda that she needs to focus on their mission . This is about justice . This is about making sure that what happened to their family does n't happen to anyone else again .
As they venture deeper into his lair , they find the now completed body of Vision , still lying dormant . Wanda again asks what Ultron is planning and Ultron simply says that he plans to be the Father of a new age – and every father needs a first born .
Ultron explains that when he came to life , he destroyed another AI who was just another victim of Stark 's manipulation . It 's something he still feels genuinely guilty about . He plans to make amends in his own way . He uses JARVIS ' destroyed code mixed with his own to activate Vision , filling in the destroyed parts of JARVIS ' code to create a new consciousness .
He does n't place the Infinity Stone in Vision 's forehead yet , that will come into things a little later . Instead , he charges Vision 's gem with the sceptre 's power to bring him online . Finally , Vision bursts from the pod – and promptly attacks everything in sight .
Vision starts ripping apart Ultron drones left and right until Scarlet Witch manages to calm him down . Vision apologises though he is still confused , even as Ultron embraces him . Ultron seems genuinely happy as Quicksilver and Wanda start to look more and more uneasy . Vision enquires about his purpose , to which Ultron replies that he is the beginning of a new age .
5 . Sins of the Son
That night , dinner with the Family Barton is interrupted by the arrival of Nick Fury . He reveals that Ultron has been searching for nuclear launch codes and seems to be based in Sokovia . He says his agents ( implying Skye/Daisy had a hand in it ) have been able to keep Ultron from getting the codes . However , it 's clear that Ultron 's goal is to wipe out humanity .
Shortly after Fury arrives , Ultron , Vision and the twins invade , having used satellite cameras to track them down . They fly in on Strucker 's jet and fire a missile at Barton 's house much to Wanda 's horror . Cap is able to intercept the missile with his shield before impact . This lessens the damage but a gaping hole is still blown into the house , leaving all inside shell shocked and disoriented .
The jet lands and Ultron saunters out .
Hawkeye and Widow attempt to get Hawkeye 's family out of harm 's way while Cap , Tony and Banner make their stand against Ultron . Banner hulks out and lunges at Ultron but is intercepted by a red blur that sends Hulk flying .
The red figure descends and stands at Ultron 's side . He stares at the Avengers , studying them curiously .
Tony asks what the hell that thing is and Ultron gloats like a proud father . He tells Tony that the creation has become creator . Vision is the first in a new race that will claim this world for their own – a race that will save the world .
Having had his fill of Ultron 's monologuing , Iron Man lunges at Ultron but is intercepted by the Scarlet Witch . This leaves Ultron unimpeded as he begins blowing apart the farm in search for Hawkeye and Widow . Cap tries to take him down but Quicksilver cuts him off and engulfs the super soldier in a tornado of fists from all sides .
Wanda has the clear advantage against Tony in his heavily damaged suit but she seems to be holding back . She 's clearly uneasy as she watches the chaos unfold . She wanted payback against Stark but she clearly did n't sign up for this . She uses her powers to rip the arc reactor out of Iron Man 's suit and leaves him laying .
In the meantime , Quicksilver continues to wail on Cap , far too fast to be hit by any of Cap 's strikes . However , Cap keeps getting back up after being beaten down and Quicksilver seems to be tiring . Finally , Cap catches Quicksilver 's fist mid-punch and knocks him out with a single blow .
As Cap runs to intercept Ultron , Hulk continues to battle Vision . Hulk seems unable to touch Vision , who phases through all of his attacks while at the same time continually draining his gamma energy . Vision seems to treat the Hulk as a curiosity and seems to be more focused on studying his opponent rather than fighting him .
Finally , Hulk manages to get the upper hand by knocking Vision through the barn side . However , the gamma drain took its toll and leaves him open to Scarlet Witch . She gets in his head and puts him to sleep . Vision picks himself up , shaken but still standing . He moves to finish off Banner but Wanda stops him . He questions her actions but she does n't seem to have an answer for him .
Ultron finds Hawkeye 's family and closes in with vile intent . He easily shrugs off Widow and Fury 's sneak attack and incapacitates them . This just leaves Barton in his way .
Hawkeye desperately pulls out every trick he has in his arsenal to hold off Ultron and unloads every arrow imaginable into Ultron to no effect whatsoever . Before Ultron can eviscerate Barton , Cap arrives with a timely shield throw that knocks Ultron for a loop . They start slugging it out and Cap actually holds his own with his superior speed and skill .
However , Vision arrives and quickly subdues Cap without batting an eyelid . He dumps Banner and Stark at Ultron 's feet just as Wanda and Quicksilver arrive . Wanda tries to talk to Ultron and tell him that he is going too far for his revenge . Ultron just ignores her . With all of the remaining Avengers at his mercy , Ultron takes the time to gloat . He says that he will teach the Avengers true pain . He wants them to witness his new world because he wants them to feel the pain of losing the old one . Starting with Barton 's family . Without warning , he launches a blast at Hawkeye 's child .
The blast bounces off a wall of scarlet light that appears out of thin air . There 's silence for a moment as Ultron seems shocked at what has happened . He turns slowly to Scarlet Witch and comes the realisation that he has been betrayed yet again . Wanda herself seems shocked at what she has done . Quicksilver is uncharacteristically speechless and seems unsure of what to do . Even Vision is at a loss for words .
Inexplicably , we cut back to the bottom of the ocean where Mjolnir lies dormant inside the sunken ship . Suddenly , the hammer begins to shake before shooting up into the sky .
Wanda tries to reason with Ultron once more but he flies into a murderous rage . She holds Ultron off by herself while Quicksilver watches , dumb founded . Ultron seems genuinely heartbroken that she has betrayed him . He wanted to save her , to welcome her as part of his new age .
But now she can die with the rest .
Before he can attack again , there is a flash of lightning and a deafening clap of thunder . Ultron turns around and if there was ever the question of whether a machine could feel fear , it is answered right then and there .
Thor is back .
And he would have words with thee .

Poring over facts about milk : cow 's , goat 's , soy , almond , rice and hemp
Some are richer in protein , others in essential fatty acids . There are pros and cons to all .
Whole cow 's milk packs 150 calories per cup , and about half of those calories come from fat . ( See the related chart for a nutritional breakdown of all these different milks . ) The 8 grams of fat in a cup of whole milk includes 5 grams of saturated fat , which can raise blood cholesterol . The American Heart Assn . recommends limiting saturated fat intake to 7 % or less of daily calories : An adult consuming 1,800 calories per day would get more than one-third of that in an 8-ounce glass of whole milk .
Here 's a look at the nutritional pros and cons of standards and newcomers in the dairy case . See Page E3
Cow 's milk is a good source of protein but can be high in saturated fats . Hemp milk offers little protein but is rich in certain essential fatty acids . For some , an allergy is the main concern when choosing milk . For others , digestibility drives the decision . `` There are dozens of differences in all of these milks , '' says Alexandra Kazaks , professor of nutrition at Bastyr University in Kenmore , Wash .
Each has its fans : those who swear by goat 's milk 's creamy texture or who love almond milk 's subtle , nutty flavor . But when it comes to nutrition , there 's no clear winner .
Full-fat , low-fat or skim ? Used to be , there were n't many choices to make over what to pour on your cereal . But the number of alternatives to cow 's milk -- soy , goat 's , hemp milk , more -- has steadily grown .
Skim and reduced-fat milks provide the same amount of protein without the high levels of saturated fats or the cholesterol whole milk also contains . They also retain all of the calcium found in whole milk -- up to 300 milligrams , about one-third of the recommended daily intake . According to the Institute of Medicine , adults require between 1,000 and 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day for optimum bone strength . And cow 's milk has long been promoted by nutritionists and dietitians as a good source of this important mineral , as well as the vitamin D needed to absorb the mineral .
But `` there 's a fair amount of controversy in that whole area , '' says Larry Kushi , associate director for epidemiology in the division of research at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland . The issue is just how important calcium -- and milk as a source of calcium -- truly is for bone health .
Scientists increasingly began to question the relationship after several studies , including two unusually large ones , failed to find evidence linking increased milk consumption to a decreased risk of fractures , a sign of bone health .
A 12-year study of more than 77,000 women , conducted by Harvard researchers and published in 1997 , found that women who drank two glasses of milk a day had roughly the same risk of hip or forearm fractures as women who drank one glass or less per week . A 2003 investigation of the same population found that although vitamin D intake reduced the risk of hip fractures in post-menopausal women , high calcium and milk intake did not .
The science on the relationship between cow 's milk and cancer is also somewhat murky , and researchers are working to clarify this . Population studies have produced good evidence that increased dairy consumption , including that of milk , may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer . But studies also suggest that the risk of prostate cancer may increase with increasing milk consumption .
The evidence for female cancers -- including breast , ovarian and endometrial cancers -- is more mixed . Studies conducted several decades ago were less likely to demonstrate a link between dairy consumption and female cancers than more recent ones , and some nutrition experts think this difference may be linked to industrial practices that have increased the levels of the hormone estrogen in cow 's milk .
Then there 's the issue of milk allergy , an immune-system reaction to any of the several types of casein , whey or other proteins in milk . About 2.5 % of children develop cow 's milk allergies in their first year , according to the National Institutes of Health , and 80 % outgrow it in adulthood .
Other individuals suffer from lactose intolerance , the inability to digest the dominant sugar found in milk . The intolerance ( which causes gas , bloating and diarrhea ) stems from a lack of lactase , the enzyme required to break down the milk sugar lactose . It is far more common than milk allergy . `` Most of the world 's population ca n't digest milk , '' says Dr. Scott Sicherer , professor of pediatrics at the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , and co-author of the 2009 book `` The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Dairy-Free Eating . '' `` Our bodies are not made to drink this stuff . ''
Goat 's milk
The popularity in the U.S. of cow 's milk makes us a bit of an anomaly : Globally , goat 's milk is a far more popular drink .
OAKLAND — Every Saturday like clockwork , the caterers , musicians , DJs , port-o-potties and shuttle vans full of wedding guests slowly wind up narrow Panoramic Way , negotiating tight hairpin turns before reaching a scenic hilltop estate called Skyfall .
Labeling the activity a public nuisance , the city has ordered David “ Sandy ” Boyd not to hold weddings and other commercial events at his residentially zoned property located high above UC Berkeley 's Memorial Stadium . Yet brides , grooms and their guests continue their matrimonial march up the hill , clogging the lone , steep road in and out .
Neighbors are upset over the noise and traffic but mostly fear the potential fire hazard they say endangers their vulnerable Panoramic Hill neighborhood . The community barely escaped the 1991 Oakland Hills firestorm .
“ If , God forbid , summer comes around after another dry winter and some drunk clown goes out the side ( of Skyfall ) and lights a cigarette , there could be another Oakland Hills fire , ” said Jonathan Miller , a resident of the community that straddles the Oakland-Berkeley border . “ Does ( Oakland Mayor ) Libby Schaaf know what 's going on here ? If they want to commercialize these hills , what 's her plan ? ”
But Boyd , the former owner of the Fresh Choice restaurant chain , which went bankrupt in 2012 , says he is no different from the average Oakland Airbnb or short-term rental landlord . He insists his operation , which has hosted weddings for more than a year , is not commercial , and he receives only a rent check and a deposit .
Now Boyd , facing mounting financial pressures , is seeking a conditional use permit to turn the hilltop complex into the nonprofit Skyfall Meditation and Community Center .
“ I think the highest and best use of it is to share it with the community , ” Boyd said in a phone interview . “ The bottom line is I have neighbors in Berkeley at least a mile away complaining . They are the same ones who complained about Paul McCartney playing at Memorial Stadium . ”
Weddings
On a recent Saturday , a wedding party snaked its way up Panoramic Way , past signs warning “ Critical Fire Area. ” Bluegrass music could be heard from neighboring trails , as the celebrants enjoyed a view of all five Bay Area bridges and the San Francisco skyline .
Skyfall is booked through at least November 2016 . The stunning setting consists of low-slung , circular or curved-roof shingled and brick buildings that blend into the surroundings , a la the Shire in “ The Hobbit. ” Its website boasts a banquet hall built with “ old world brick , ” a “ man cave ” and —‰'50 Shades of Gray ' room ( cuffs included ) . ”
Neighbors alerted Oakland officials about the events more than a year ago . A city zoning inspector determined Boyd was hosting an unpermitted assembly and issued a cease-and-desist order on April 15 , 2014 . Boyd appealed , arguing that the venue is a short-term rental but lost .
This August , Greg Minor , an assistant in the city administrator 's office , declared Boyd 's property a public nuisance , fined him $ 3,500 and gave him 30 days to abate or face daily fines of $ 500 . Boyd appealed that ruling too , and a hearing date is pending .
Tom Miller , Boyd 's friend , neighbor and attorney , says that the city has allowed Boyd to “ honor the contracts he signed ” for weddings , but Minor said that is not true , citing an October email where he told Tom Miller and Boyd the “ unpermitted activity should cease until it is legalized . ”
Tom Miller also said Boyd “ registered with the city and pays taxes ” on his short-term rentals , but city spokeswoman Cathy Kenny said the Skyfall owner has no required business license with the city . City Councilman Dan Kalb , who represents that Oakland neighborhood and has talked to neighbors about their concerns , calls the Airbnb comparison “ lawyer B.S . ”
“ Bringing a wedding with hundreds of people there is not like a rental of a small little cottage , ” Kalb said . “ It 's insulting that they think we 'd buy that crap . ”
Neighbors
According to neighbors , the devastating 1991 conflagration jumped Claremont Avenue into Claremont Canyon and came within a half mile of Skyfall , which sits where Panoramic Way dead ends . Residents constantly coordinate disaster responses with fire officials and , in the event of a fire , they know to flee on foot , avoiding traffic bottlenecks and leaving the narrow road open to emergency responders .
Michael Kelly , president of the Panoramic Hill Association , wrote the city in September saying the number of events at the property was increasing . The letter explains Skyfall 's “ remote and vulnerable ” location on Panoramic Hill , surrounded by wild grasslands or woods . It also cites Berkeley Fire Department estimates that it would take a fire truck more than 20 minutes to reach the estate in a best-case scenario .
” … It is into this uniquely hazardous location that we now have large parties with hundreds of guests a month who are generally unaware of the severity of fire dangers surrounding them , ” Kelly wrote .
Boyd said he has n't been told by fire agencies that there is a hazard . And Berkeley fire Interim Chief Avery Webb said that weddings by themselves do not necessarily create a problem .
“ The size and type of activities at any property can create fire hazards , ” Webb said .
The road
Boyd has had issues with his neighbors before .
After a winter storm in 1997 , the last stretch of Panoramic Way leading up to Skyfall was partially washed out . Boyd said he unsuccessfully urged Oakland officials to repair it , then bulldozed a 600- to 700-foot dirt road from his home , down the hill and through his neighbors ' property and public open space , without surveys , permits , engineer reports or permission from neighbors . Instead , he used a map and measuring tape , according to a 2002 appellate court ruling . The neighbor who owned a parcel of land he bulldozed through sued and won $ 250,000 .
Boyd kept bulldozing after the neighbor sued , leading Oakland officials to issue a cease and desist order . The judge called Boyd “ a determined individual who would continue to engage in conduct undermining the property rights of others , in relation to this roadway , if not otherwise restrained . ”
Lance Montauk owned land impacted by the illegal road .
“ I believe Boyd frequently tests the limits of the law and his neighbors ' tolerance — kind of ‘ cowboy ' approach to life , ” Montauk wrote by email . “ What he did with the road was gross , impolite , unacceptable , for him costly and in the end totally useless . ”
Boyd said his wife was pregnant at the time and that he barely encroached on others ' property .
“ It was never malicious , ” he said , adding that the dirt road remains and is a hiking “ asset ” to the neighborhood .
Finances
One of Boyd 's arguments during his appeal process was the large amount of property taxes he pays . However , tax records show he owes $ 91,000 in delinquent property taxes on Skyfall , and $ 23,000 on a lower , separate portion of the estate where he lives . He is in similar straits on other properties he owns He also owes millions in past due mortgage payments for apartment buildings near the campus .
After the bankruptcy , Boyd 's Fresh Choice chain was left with less than $ 700,000 in assets and more than $ 10 million in debt , according to court records , and owes the IRS $ 1.6 million in unpaid taxes .
Boyd personally owes more than $ 1.36 million in federal taxes and $ 472,000 in state taxes , according to numerous liens.Adding to his woes , a hilltop property of Boyd 's made the East Bay Municipal Utility District list of excessive water users , slurping more than 3,100 gallons of water a day . He was fined $ 344 .
Boyd said his tenuous economic position led him to start renting Skyfall , which was vacant .
“ I probably would never have rented out the house if I did n't need the money , ” Boyd said . “ I owe property taxes on it , yes I do . Is that a sin ? ”
To keep the property operational , Boyd plans to team with Tom Miller 's Green Cities Fund nonprofit and convert the 5,000-square-foot residence into a meditation center , donating 10 percent of gross receipts , his attorney said . Boyd would manage the center , which would host charitable and fully paid events .
Kalb is having trouble finding any inner peace with such a plan .
“ Noise , fire safety , there are all sorts of issues with this , ” the councilman said , “ and they do n't seem to give a hoot about it . ”

CHICAGO ( Feb. 21 , 2015 ) – U.S. Women 's National Team head coach Jill Ellis has named a 25-player roster that will travel to the 2015 Algarve Cup in Portugal . It will be the USA 's 20th trip to the Algarve Cup . Before the competition begins , Ellis will name 23 players to the tournament roster to face Norway , Switzerland and Iceland in Group B .
The roster includes 22 of the 24 players that were in Europe for the USA 's recent matches against France and England , with midfielder Megan Rapinoe , defender Christie Rampone and goalkeeper Hope Solo . After a formal review by U.S. Soccer , Solo was reinstated to the squad after serving a 30-day suspension last month .
This year 's tournament will run from March 4-11 , and the U.S. team will depart for Europe on Feb. 22 . The majority of the games will be played at small venues across the Algarve region on the southern coast of the country , with several matches at the 30,000-seat Algarve Stadium . The placement matches will take place on March 11 .
The USA will face 2015 FIFA Women 's World Cup participant Norway on March 4 ( 2 p.m . ET ) at the Municipal Stadium in Vila Real de San Antonio , which sits right on the border with Spain . The USA then takes on Switzerland , which will play in its first Women 's World Cup this summer , on March 6 ( 12 p.m . ET ) , also in Vila Real de San Antonio . The U.S. finishes group play on March 9 against Iceland at Municipal Stadium Lagos ( 1:30 p.m . ET ) , which is in the western part of the Algarve region .
The USA 's first two matches and its placement match on March 11 ( time TBD ) will be shown live on FOX Sports 1 . Fans will be able to follow the U.S. matches on Twitter @ ussoccer_wnt and @ ussoccer_esp . Highlights will be available ussoccer.com . For the entire tournament schedule , please visit the Algarve Cup tournament page on ussoccer.com .
Six of the world 's top-10 ranked teams are in this year 's Algarve Cup , including the top five . Brazil , which is currently ranked eighth , will be participating for the first time . Eleven of the 12 participating countries are ranked in the top-20 in the world .
“ The value of the Algarve Cup is of course great games against top teams in a tournament format without much rest , ” said Ellis . “ In any year , this tournament presents great challenges , but as we continue to progress towards the World Cup , we want to get tested at the highest possible levels . Our opponents at this tournament give us another opportunity to gauge our depth and fitness . ”
Group A features Germany , Brazil , Sweden and China PR . Group C features host Portugal , Japan , France and Denmark .
This will be the 22nd edition of the Algarve Cup and for the first time in 14 years , it will undergo a change in the competition format . When the Algarve Cup expanded from eight to 12 teams in 2001 , a Group C was created that generally consisted of lower-tier teams that were eligible to compete only for spots in the placement matches for seventh , ninth and 11th place .
This year , for the first time , all 12 teams will be competing for the tournament title . The final will be contested by the two group winners with the most points ( or if all three group winners are tied on points , the top two will be determined by a series of tiebreakers ) . The third-place match will feature the third-best group winner against the best second-place team from the three groups .
In addition , the fifth-place match will be played between the two remaining second-place teams ; the seventh-place match between the two best third-place teams ; the ninth-place match between the remaining third-place team against the best fourth-place team ; while the 11th-place match will feature the remaining two teams that finished fourth in their groups .
The U.S. Women have won the Algarve Cup a record nine times , including an unprecedented three straight championships from 2003-05 . The USA made the championship game for nine consecutive years from 2003-11 and most recently won the tournament in 2013 , defeating Germany 2-0 in the final on two goals from Alex Morgan . Last year , the USA had its worst finish ever , taking seventh place with a 3-0 win against Korea DPR .
Eighteen players from last year 's Algarve Cup roster return , many of whom have played in numerous Algarve Cup tournaments .

History of Food Safety :
A Commentary
Not What You 're Looking For ? Try Our Customized Food Safety Search
The desire to make our food last longer and keep better stems back before Biblical times ! Yet we have had refrigerators for only roughly 150 years . The History of food safety is a story that bridges all civilizations together .
Centuries ago , the major part of your life would have been spent gathering , hunting , finding , or preparing food to keep you going ! I 'm sure it did n't take Adam and Eve long to realize that the fruit from that tree was only delicious if eaten soon after being plucked ; let it sit on the ground a few weeks and it was sure to smell and look awful , not to mention giving them a tummy ache ! ( To review our article on why and how food spoils , click here ) .
Let me divide food history into two informal epochs , with refrigeration as the watershed . To make it easy , you can jump to certain sections . We 've also included links if you want more information on particular individuals , but be aware that they will take you to new web sites .
The Pre-Refrigeration Era

Other Changes in Food Safety History
The Pre-Refrigeration Era
Since commercial refrigeration as we understand it today did n't come into use until the 1800s , there is a lot of history to cover , so I 'm just going to focus on some basic ideas . Any means of keeping food cold – from the stream by the back door to the cooler in the supermarket – is refrigeration . Doing it by scientific means changed food safety so significantly that it is good to know what came before .
People of all times and cultures have recognized that bad food can make you sick . Even Confucius , in 500 B.C. , warned against eating “ sour rice. ” Such practical advice from a spiritual leader illustrates how important healthy food was .
Ancient Egyptians were possibly the first to develop the silo , a storage tank designed to hold grain harvested from the fields . Storing grain in a silo kept it cool , dry and able to last into the non-harvest months or longer .
The Bible speaks of the Hebrews receiving manna from heaven every morning . Manna would have been similar to a flat wafer or cracker – quick to gather every day , nourishing , and easy to carry as they traveled around in the wilderness . We 're told that it tasted like wafers made with honey or like cakes made with oil . We 're also told it spoiled ( “ bred worms and stank ” ) after twenty-four to forty-eight hours . They just could n't make it last any longer – but that 's another story .
Ancient Rome was the first recognized society to focus on freshness in fruit and other food . The rich Romans would often have fresh food delivered to their homes , where the cooks ( probably slaves or servants ) would prepare the meals . Without a doubt one would want to stay on the cook 's good side ; poisoning has been a weapon from time immemorial ! Do n't you wonder if the masters realized how much power their slaves had over them when it came to food ?
The Romans were also famous for salting their foods to preserve them – a practice still used today in some cultures . The salting process dries out the food ; one of the things we know now , although the Romans may not have , is that most germs need moisture . In addition to salting , there are other methods of drying food , many of them still used today .
People have long recognized that keeping some foods cold could make them last longer . Some people put meat or fish in the creek or waterfall to try to keep it fresh . Others recognized that snow and ice were natural refrigerants , and would leave food outside to let the weather chill it . So the fish you had to salt in the summer you could just freeze in the winter . In addition , your great-great-grandma may have had a fruit cellar or root cellar where she stored not only fruit but veggies , jams , jellies , pickles , and other foods that needed cool storage without becoming frozen .
In the early 1800s Napoleon Bonaparte , ambitious for territory and power , offered a reward to anyone who could figure out how to keep the food his soldiers needed from spoiling as they traveled about warring against other European countries . The solution of Nicolas Appert was to put the food into jars with lids on them , and boil the food until he thought it was cooked . It was the first version of canning , and it worked – although Appert may not have realized that what the cooking was doing was killing any germs that may have been on the food .
Actually , it was not until the 1600s that scientists isolated germs as a source of illness . Even then , it was unclear what actually caused people to get sick .
Before the microscope changed the way we looked at the world , many scientists believed that living things could arise spontaneously from non-living matter . Well , that 's the way it looked to them . In 1668 , Francisco Redi , an Italian physician , was among the first to demonstrate that life actually came from other life – that maggots ( fly larvae ) were not created by decaying meat itself but rather by flies that laid their eggs in the meat . He did this by putting out raw beef in several jars , some that were covered and some that were n't . The uncovered meat had fly larvae growing in them within a few days ; the covered did not . This might also be the first demonstration of why you do n't want flies landing on your hamburgers ( see our picnic food safety section for more information ) .
There was still great debate about this matter , however , until the latter part of the nineteenth century , when the experiments of Louis Pasteur , Ferdinand Julius Cohn , and August Gartneu began to demonstrate that , although people could n't see them , there were organisms in the air , soil , animals and water – we call them microorganisms – that can and will make us sick .
Parasites were already known ; in 1835 James Paget and Richard Owen described the pig parasite Trichenella Spiralis , which we know as the cause of Trichinosis today .
In the 1860s Louis Pasteur began his work on pasteurization and fermentation , which has made an enormous impact both on the medical world and on food safety to this day . In 1888 , August Gärtner diagnosed a food-borne illness bacteria , Bacillus Enteritidis . Fifty-seven people had eaten beef from a cow slaughtered while it was ill , and became ill themselves . He studied the symptoms of all the people who were sick , and concluded the bacteria must have come from the diarrhea of the cow . This was a window into how carefully and safely meat must be handled when being processed .
Probably one of the most dedicated scientists of the era , M.A . Barber , gave himself food poisoning in 1914 by purposefully spoiling milk . He and two associates drank it and recorded similar symptoms . Hopefully , he paid his associates extra for the subsequent sick days . At any rate , the connection between spoiled food and illness was becoming clearer .
The Refrigeration Era
Combining common knowledge about making food safer by keeping it colder with the understanding of germs and bacteria that scientists were gaining , inventors began to look for ways to keep foods cold anywhere . The change in society from an agricultural to an industrial one , plus a greater taste for beef and other meat in the U.S. , created both a desire for freshness in shipped food and a need for safe cold food storage in the home . This led to the refrigeration technology we have today . Without reliable refrigeration , your favorite fast-food restaurant could never have been .
The first home coolers were metal-lined , insulated boxes filled with ice… thus , the term “ icebox. ” These were filled with blocks of ice provided by vendors who had developed ways to transport ice from rivers and streams to cities . Packing ice blocks with hay was one popular method for shipping ice without letting it melt . Ice became such a big business in the nineteenth century that ice-making companies developed , making `` clean '' ( non-polluted ) ice with refrigerants which were n't yet safe enough for domestic use . The `` ice man '' made house calls every day or two to keep the icebox working . ( The desire for fresh , safe food at home led to flourishing home-delivery businesses through the middle of the 20th century ; even when the ice man was a thing of the past , the milk man and the bread man were still in the safe food delivery business . )
In 1805 , Oliver Evans had come up with the idea of an icebox cooled with vapor rather than ice , but never developed it . However , John Gorrie , a physician , came up with the idea to treat patients with respiratory illnesses by putting them in rooms that had been artificially made cold . This idea became the first work of mechanical refrigeration ; in fact , Gorrie quit his practice and dedicated his time to developing this technique .
Alexander C. Twining noted Gorrie 's work and began to experiment with commercial refrigerants that would eventually be used in refrigerators for both meat processing plants and trains . He was successful , and from the 1860s on , refrigerated train cars transported food around the country . This led to new standards in the food processing industry , as meat and other foods were processed at large plants and then shipped all over the country .
In the U.S. , mechanical refrigeration ( in a safer form ) was brought home , literally , as refrigerators began to supplant iceboxes ( and ice men ) in the 1930s . Today , of course , most households in the United States and Canada – as well as much of the rest of the industrial world – have refrigerators . Can you imagine life without a fridge ? ( Of course , I can remember a time when home computers and cell phones did n't exist so I guess it 's possible ! )
Other Changes in Food Safety History
Food supply became a big business as more people moved to cities , buying food from markets , farmers and grocers instead of producing it or hunting for it themselves . Business owners began to develop ways to process the food and deliver it to the stores .
These ways were not always good ones . Canning was a popular method of preserving meats , but it was often so poorly done that , while only 379 soldiers died in combat during the Spanish American War , 1,000 or more soldiers died from eating the spoiled canned meat supplied to them . But you did n't need to be a soldier to suffer ; just buying food for your family was a risky business , especially if you were poor . Foods were often bug-ridden , adulterated , and advertised with exorbitant ( read : lying ) claims .
During this time there were few standards or regulations for either processing or selling food . Meat processing plants were filthy , and more than just food would get into your mouth ! Upton Sinclair went undercover into one such plant to write his book The Jungle , which brought these conditions to light . While Sinclair 's focus was the preaching of socialism , his descriptions of plant conditions impelled U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to order a full investigation of the meat-packing industry . This led to the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 , beginning the thrust of the regulations that the U.S. ( and , in their own versions , Canada and the rest of the world ) follows today .
Forty years before Roosevelt 's presidency , in 1862 , Abraham Lincoln had established the Department of Agriculture and its Bureau of Chemistry . This was the beginning of what came to be known ( in the 1920s ) as the Food and Drug Administration .
A very brief history of the FDA is here for your entertainment .
Today we still worry about food safety . While we know more about why food is good –or bad – for us , there undoubtedly will be more and more challenges to face in keeping the fuel for our bodies from being our “ last meal . ”

How to retrieve a script Resource from vRO via curl
I recently spent time with a customer doing a vRO workshop with them . During the course of the workshop , I was asked how you could retrieve a script that had been stored as a resource element on a vRO server using curl . Well , I had never done that before so I set out to figure it out and was able to provide the solution before I left ! Throughout this article , I will be using a vRA 7.2 embedded vRO . The biggest difference here is only the port that we use to access the API . For embedded , it is 443 and standalone vRO uses 8281 .
Check the API - resource-controller
Whenever calling vRO from any language , you must reference the API documentation to help identify the appropriate REST URL to call . So , my first stop was to visit the /vco/api/docs URL of the server and look for Resources .
Hmmm ... looking at the screenshot above , and the few other operations below , it seems that the /api/resources/ { id } is the closest I 'll get to retrieving the script . Unfortunately , nothing in that doc indicates the possibility of retrieving the actual file or the contents of the file . Not looking good right now .
Ok , well , we obviously need the ID of the resource element we wish to retrieve . Let 's launch our vRO Client and get the ID of our script .
vRO Client - Resource Element - setupCA.ps1
Hmmmm .... well , There does n't appear to be an ID visible for our resource elements ! Bummer !
I guess we go back to the API explorer - hopefully , we can filter by name ; )
Be sure to make note of the Mime type - we 'll be needing that later too !
API Documentation - Postman Verify
When you 're uncertain as to how to use the API , make sure to review the Developing a Web Services Client for VMware vRealize Orchestrator official documentation page . In particular , the page I need is the Apply Filters page as it shows you how to query vRO for the particular resource you are looking for . In my case , it is the setupCA.ps1 Resource Element so , my GET URL needs to be :
https : // { { vra-fqdn } } /vco/api/catalog/System/ResourceElement ? conditions=name~setupCA.ps1
As we can see in the image above , the query works ! and we can see the id for that Resource Element is : 2706d28b-e6ca-45da-acd9-8ccff2228252
Moment of Truth - Postman Results
Ok , we now know the following :
ID of the Resource Element we wish to retrieve
The Mime Type of the script
The script name
The REST API URL and Method ( GET ) to retrieve the script
Let 's see if this works ! Use Postman for your quick testing ...
Set the URL to https : // { { vra-fqdn } } /vco/api/resources/2706d28b-e6ca-45da-acd9-8ccff2228252/ where { { vra-fqdn } } is your vRA/vRO server 's FQDN and port ( if vRO standalone ) , and that string after resources is the discovered id of the script you wish to get from the server Set the Operation Method to GET Set the header : Accept : application/octet-stream < -- this should be the Mime Type of the Resource element as we saw in the vRO client . Click SEND Success should be expected as seen in the returned body , we have the script contents !
Putting it all together as a curl command
Ok , we should be all set now ! We 've done all of the exploratory work needed to discover the correct URL , Methods , ID , etc ...
So , based on the information we retrieved above , this is the following curl command you would use :
curl -k -- header 'Accept : application/octet-stream ' -- header 'Authorization : Basic REDACTED ' 'https : // { { vra-fqdn } } /vco/api/resources/2706d28b-e6ca-45da-acd9-8ccff2228252 ' -o setupCA.ps1
Now , for those of us that may not be as familiar with curl , let 's break down the call ....
curl - > the command we are issuing
-k - > tells curl to ignore invalid/self-signed certificates
-- header - > sets the headers as needed . In this case , we use the switch twice . Once to set the Accept Header and once to set the Authorization header . ( TIP : You can easily get your Authorization header in Postman ! ! )
After specifying the headers , you specify the URL you wish to query
-o -- > sets the output file name
setupCA.ps1 - > the name of the output file ( Ideally , you would use the same name as the script name defined for the Resource Element , but you can actually use whatever name you like ! )
Summary
Even though the vRO Client does not provide the ID for resource elements , it only takes a tiny bit of research and a quick call with Postman to get the needed info . Once you have it , you can code your curl command into scripts , vRA software components , etc ... as needed !
St. Brigid of Kildare is my homegirl . I love her so much that I chose her name for my Confirmation name a few years ago . That 's right , my name is Maureen Teresa Brigid O'Leary Wanket . Better recognize .
I based a whole series of books on Brigid , who is in fact an ancient Celtic fertility goddess , as well as one of the three patron saints of Ireland . Her lore is vast and complex , way more than can be handled in a single blog post , or even a single blog site . My laptop would explode if I tried . I had to write three novels in order to express even a smidge of my fascination for this mythological figure of yore .
So today I 'll just settle on one aspect of Brigid that speaks to me particularly today as a woman of modern times , which is her ability to shape shift . One story tells of when a young Brigid was going to be forced to marry a king who had heard of her great beauty . She did n't feel like marrying this guy , but nobody was listening to her . So when she went to his castle to present herself to him , she turned herself ugly . Oozing sores covered her skin . The king , grossed out , turned her away . By the time she returned home , she was cute again and that was that .
Brigid is the goddess of metalwork , artistry , archery , fertility , among many others . She has so many aspects that she is frequently depicted as three women , in three stages of life .
I love the idea of controlling who you are and how you appear based on your audience . And I honor the notion of one person encompassing many different aspects in one life . In my novel The Arrow , the modern incarnation of Brigid has many roles to fill , as do most people in the modern age . She is a daughter , a professional , an academic , a lover , a warrior , a healer , a sister and a friend . As a writer , academic , leader , teacher , wife , mother , daughter and friend , I look to Brigid for inspiration . I am all of these things , shape shifting into each role as needed .
Brigid says to you that you have many talents , strengths , and powers . She says that there are few limits to what you can achieve . Your very life is of service to so many . Appreciate and celebrate all aspects of your gifts . The world is better because of them .
THE ARROW is for sale now .
A BRITISH man has been sentenced to four years and four months in jail for manslaughter after he killed a friend who poked his girlfriend on Facebook .
Scott Humphrey , 27 , got into a fight with his friend , 29-year-old Richard Rovetto , in a taxi saying , “ If you 're such a good friend why did you poke my missus ? ”
Humphrey repeatedly punched Rovetto , a father of one , in the taxi as they made their way home from a buck 's night , the Mirror reports .
The taxi driver told Nottingham Crown Court during Humphrey 's trial that Rovetto told Humphrey he did n't know the woman was his girlfriend .
Buzz Feed reports that after exiting the taxi , Humphrey punched Rovetto again , knocking him to the ground where he hit his head against the pavement .
Humphrey fled the scene and Rovetto was taken to hospital , where he died a few hours later from his injuries .
Humphrey 's lawyer said that his client was “ devastated ” .
“ When you and him went out that evening , violence and death were the furthest things from your mind , ” the judge said during the sentencing . “ You did n't intend to kill him . Part of the tragedy is that it 's left to chance what happens . ”
Robert Egbuna , defending Humphrey said : “ The defendant is genuinely remorseful about his actions . He will never forget that day . As soon as Scott Humphrey heard about what had happened to Richard Rovetto , he was devastated .
“ He has been very candid and admitted this offence from the very start . ”
After the sentencing Rovetto 's brother-in-law , Jason Burley-Evan , said that the sentence was n't adequate .
“ This was a waste of a life , ” he said . “ We feel the sentence was n't the justice we wanted for Richard . He was a much-loved person and it will be hard for us all to move on . ”
Weekly PUG nights starting at 8pm EST on Saturdays .
Posted by Fixious on Apr 7th , 2015
Download Legions Join Steam Group PUG - Pick Up Game
TL ; DR : Download game , join TeamSpeak around 7:30pm on Saturdays , and wait for the fun to begin !
A pickup game is type of competition that is casually started within a voice chat server like Ventrilo or Teamspeak 3 . There are typically no specific times when they start ; it 's more so a spur of the moment event .
First : A sufficient amount of players is needed . 5 vs 5 is the bare minimum but we like to do 7 vs 7 or even 8 vs 8 at times . It all depends on how many people are online at the time .
Second : Finding 2 people who would be captains . Once 2 players decide to suck it up and become captains , they start to pick teams one by one . The first player pick or map pick is decided by a coin toss by a mutual party . The winner of the toss chooses what map and side he or she would like or what player they choose first .
Third : A server is determined by all the players in the game and everyone parties up on that server .
Fourth : Once everyone is in the game and both teams say that they are ready , the game is started by the host .
The objective is the first to get to 10 flag captures or to have the most captures within the decided timelimit ( 20-25 minutes ) . It is unacceptable to leave a PUG early . If there is an emergency for you to leave , then find someone to substitute for you and wait for his/her arrival .
Remember , when playing a PuG , it is essential to play the position that the captain assigns you .
General term : Standoff . A standoff is a time period when both teams have the other team 's flag .
LO- Offense . Light or Medium is suitable for this position . Go to the enemy base , attack and distract . Listen for `` E '' or `` E-grab '' when playing LO . Those terms mean that you need to get to the enemy flag , and either try to get back to your base with it , or throw it away from the enemy base . If you have good cappers , they will call out their incoming time for you . Your main job is to distract the HoF as the capper comes in , and put a hit on the chaser if possible . When your defense loses the allied flag , it is your job to return that flag once it reaches the enemy base . Kill whoever has it , and return it . LO should mainly practice their dueling skills .
Capper- Offense . Light is the more popular pick , but Medium is a viable choice . Grab the enemy flag , and return to your base with speed . When playing capper , know your routes , and call out your time . Your time is how far you are away from the enemy base . This is called out in seconds . Call out your time so the LO can start clearing the HoF for you . Cappers should mainly practice their skill with skiing , the two cores , and flag play .
LD/Stay D- Defense . Medium or Light is good for this position . Stay at your base , and kill incoming LO . Listen and communicate with your HoF and chaser . The chaser should be making the incoming calls for the HoF , but if you see a capper headed for your flag , or setting up a back-route , call it out so your defense is aware . During standoffs , communicate with your HoF . If he needs to pass , get open and call for the flag . If he does n't need to pass , kill enemies at your base . Stay D should mainly practice dueling skills and flag-catching at short range .
Chaser- Defense/Offense . Most people prefer Light , although Medium can be viable . Kill the enemy flag carrier . When your flag is home , stay at base , and call out incoming cappers for your HoF . This includes how far out they are , and from what side . If the capper grabs your flag , kill him and either hold the flag , or return it to your base . In standoffs , you pretty much turn into LO until your flag is returned or captured . A chaser should mainly practice his skiing , flag returning , and high-speed gunning .
HoF- Defense . For this position , heavy armor is a must . Block incoming cappers , and be the main hub for your defense on standoffs . Listen for calls on cappers from your defense . Use the Overdrive Core , and activate it so that you will swipe across or collide with the incoming capper in such a way to block him . On standoffs , you will be passing the enemy flag with your Stay D until your offense returns your flag . A HoF should practice his flag play at short to medium range , and his blocking skills .

Flora Célestine Thérèse Henriette Tristán y Moscoso Lesnais ( 1803-1844 ) was a French writer of Peruvian descent . Little known in official historiography , probably intentionally forgotten because of the rebellion and desire for freedom that emanates from her writings . Among her works were Peregrinations of a Pariah ( 1839 ) , Promenades in London ( 1840 ) and the booklet The Workers ' Union ( 1843 ) . [ Castellano ]
Flora Tristan : precursor of feminism and proletarian emancipation
`` Experience and facts tell you well enough that government can not or will not deal with your lot when it comes to improving it . It depends solely on you , if you wish it strongly enough , to get out of the labyrinth of misery , pain and submission in which you languish '' .
Flora Tristan , 1843
Flora Célestine Thérèse Henriette Tristán y Moscoso Lesnais ( 1803-1844 ) was a French writer of Peruvian descent . Little known in official historiography , probably intentionally forgotten because of the rebellion and desire for freedom that emanates from her writings . Among her works were ( 1839 ) , ( 1840 ) and the booklet ( 1843 ) .After the sudden death of her father , an exiled Peruvian colonel , she remained with his mother in the most abject poverty , forced to become part of the daily lives of working people . This experience led her afterwards into a deep commitment to those whom the social progress promised by capitalist modernity had abandoned to their fate.In her time , although there was already a certain theoretical tradition that demanded equality for women , thanks to the philosophy of the Enlightenment and the movements that took place during the French Revolution , there was still no comprehensive systematization of the ideas that would later give rise to feminist thinking as a doctrine . However , during the first half of the 19th century the demand for women 's equality had already appeared and the notions of patriarchy were already beginning to be challenged more strongly , thereby contributing to the formulation of feminist theory , which was still in an embryonic state and its margins still quite blurred poorly delimited . Tristan was a pioneer who inserted herself into this trend , vehemently rejecting the false principle that affirmed the inferiority of the female nature , questioning the institution of marriage and the lack of civil , educational and economic rights for women.The search for bridges between the concern for overcoming social inequality and the situation of oppression that women live under patriarchy , were a constant in the work and life of Flora Tristan . She was the first woman to try to merge the proto-feminist and social discourses into a critical synthesis , opening the way leading for the future shape of feminism of a proletarian class character , which finds it inconceivable that there exist oppressed women who are capable of oppressing other women.During the period in which Tristan was working , radical changes in the European continent came about , due to the implementation of the capitalist mode of production , the resulting modernization and industrialization of society and the spread of egalitarian-democratic ideology by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution . However , expectations of well-being generated at first collided head-on with reality . The imminent material progress that would come to everyone and the end of scarcity and poverty advocated by the modern discourse vanished into the air and , conversely , even greater inequality and exploitation for large masses of human beings was created . Women were excluded from the most basic rights and the proletariat , increasingly numerous , fell completely outside of the wealth produced in factories and workshops.Against this background various social reformers began to create ideal social systems to correct the ills of this society ; Cabet , Owen , Saint Simon and Fourier were some of the first theorists to call themselves `` socialists '' . Marx would later add the adjective `` utopian '' to them , due to the almost blind confidence they possessed in the regenerating power of education , to their extreme pacifism , and to their naive confidence of redemption of the bourgeois class.Flora , a daughter of her time , was strongly influenced by this stream of social thought . But despite this , she managed to go a step further - she was the first to say that the proletariat must unite as a class and free itself , that is to say , rely on its own strength . It was an idea that Marx would later incorporate in the famous slogan of the First International : `` the emancipation of the workers will be the task of the workers themselves '' and that would be claimed by the international anarchist movement to the present day.Undoubtedly , Flora Tristan was a vital link in the modern struggle against patriarchal domination and capitalism . That is why we remember her . Her thinking was key to the birth of the revolutionary-tinted feminist movement that emerged forcefully in an organized way in the late 19th and early 20th century . Today in the 21st century , women are still struggling for their autonomy and reproductive rights and , with other social forces , continue in the gigantic task of building the new society.Article published in , March-April 2015 , No . 27.is a Libertarian Communist journal published in Chile .

The SpaceShipTwo carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo takes off in an April 20 , 2009 flight test , a 4-hour endurance trip that marked its longest flight
The mother shipfor a commercial suborbital spaceliner fleet made its longest flight yet Mondayin a test apparently marred only by some slight damage to thevehicle ? s tail .
The large WhiteKnightTwocarrier aircraft ? Eve ? took off from the Mojave Air and Spaceport inCalifornia , flying to some 20,000 feet on a successful four-hour flight ? the longest sofar and a good initial endurance test , noted Will Whitehorn , President ofVirgin Galactic .
While theflight test expanded the flight regime of the WhiteKnightTwo , an incidentcaused a heart-stopping moment for ground watchers when an apparent crosswind duringa landing strip maneuver pitched the vehicle up steeper than expected , causingslight tail damage , according to a SPACE.com source .
Virgin Galacticis the spacetourist travel firm backed by U.K. adventurer and billionaire RichardBranson and his Virgin Group . Eve is named after Branson ? s mother . TheWhiteKnightTwo is the mother ship for SpaceShipTwo ? also built by a workforceat Scaled Composites in Mojave , California .
Whitehorn saidthat the aircraft ? s gear was successfully retracted and extended in flight , with the craft running up in speed in both the gear up and down configuration.Furthermore , the aircraft ? s flightenvelope was expanded in the areas of gross weight , as well as G-loadbroached , he said .
? We are delighted with the programso far and are meeting every milestone we are setting , ? Whitehorn told SPACE.com . ? Sir Richard Branson is looking forward to flying in Eve this summer and thenseeing SpaceShipTwo attached later in the year , ? he added .
The WhiteKnightTwo waspublicly unveiled at the Mojave Air and Spaceport on July 28 , 2008 .
Pucker factor
While details remain a tad murky , thetail damage was apparently caused during a touch-and-go runway approach by WhiteKnightTwo , which created a ? pucker factor ? in eyewitnesses watching the flight .
According to a SPACE.comsource , during the maneuver , the WhiteKnightTwo appeared to have been caught bya cross wind and pitched up steeper than expected . The result was a tail strikeby both rudders of the large craft , according to one observer .
However , the damage appeared to beminimal , with the WhiteKnightTwo later making a smooth touch down on thetarmac .
Following a roster of testevaluations of the WhiteKnightTwo at the Mojave Air and Spaceport , the craftwill carry the now-under-construction SpaceShipTwo - the two pilot/sixpassenger suborbital rocket plane .
Virgin Galactichas ordered fiveSpaceShipTwo rocket planes and two of the carrier craft , with options onmore .
The buckle-up pricetag per seat for a suborbital trek onboard SpaceShipTwo is $ 200,000 .

At this point we will need to upload the vCloud Director Installer as we need to run prerequisites checker as this also installs the relevant tools to create the certificates . You need to download the ISO via your VMware Partner Portal and upload this to your vCloud Director cell . The easiest way I find to do this is to use WinSCP to transfer the file . I have uploaded mine to the /media directory as you can see in the screenshot below –
You will now need to make sure that the file is executable by running the below command as per the installation guide –
chmod u+x installation file name – In my example it would be
chmod u+x vmware-vcloud-director-distribution-8.10.0-3880025.bin
Now run the installation by running the below command –
./vmware-vcloud-director-distribution-8.10.0-3880025.bin
You need to make sure you select No here ( N ) as we need to continue with setting up the vCloud Director cell before we run this script .
Untrusted Certificates –
I will not be covering this section as I will be using Trusted Certificates requested from my CA in my Lab Environment .
HTTP Service –
keytool -keystore certificates.ks -alias http -storepass passwd -keypass passwd -storetype JCEKS -genkeypair -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -dname “ CN=vcd1.example.com , OU=Engineering , O=Example Corp , L=Palo Alto S=California C=US ” -ext “ san=dns : vcd1.example.com , dns : vcd1 , ip:10.100.101.9 ”
Console Proxy Service –
keytool -keystore certificates.ks -alias consoleproxy -storepass passwd -keypass passwd -storetype JCEKS -genkeypair -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -dname “ CN=vcd2.example.com , OU=Engineering , O=Example Corp , L=Palo Alto S=California C=US ” -ext “ san=dns : vcd2.example.com , dns : vcd2 , ip:10.100.101.10 ”
Confirm the certificates are now in the certificates.ks keystore
keytool -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -keystore certificates.ks -list
Trusted Certificates –
You will need to change directory to the following directory as this is where the keytool that we will be using to create the certificates is installed .
cd /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/jre/bin
HTTP Service –
Configure these variables for your environment –
CN=FQDN of your vCD Cell
OU – Organisational Unit
O – Organization
L – Locality
S – State
C – Country
SAN=FQDN of your vCD Cell
DNS – DNS Shortname of your vCD Cell
IP = HTTP IP of your cell
./keytool -keystore certificates.ks -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -genkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -alias http -dname “ CN=JACOB-vCD01.JACOB.local , OU=Information Technology , O=JACOB , L=Northampton S=Northamptonshire C=GB ” -ext “ san=dns : JACOB-vCD01.JACOB.local , dns : JACOB-vCD01 , ip:172.16.0.231 ”
Fill in the relevant certificate information .
Console Proxy Service –
./keytool -keystore certificates.ks -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -genkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -alias consoleproxy -dname “ CN=JACOB-vCD01-RC.JACOB.local , OU=Information Technology , O=JACOB , L=Northampton S=Northamptonshire C=GB ” -ext “ san=dns : JACOB-vCD01-RC.JACOB.local , dns : JACOB-vCD01-RC , ip:172.16.0.232 ”
HTTP Service Certificate Signing Request –
keytool -keystore certificates.ks -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -certreq -alias http -file http.csr
Console Proxy Service Certificate Signing Request
keytool -keystore certificates.ks -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -certreq -alias consoleproxy -file consoleproxy.csr
You will now need to submit these .CSR files to your certificate authority and save the responses as .CER files . These will be in the following directory /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/jre/bin I recommend you use WinSCP as this is an easy method .
Navigate to your certificate authority web browser , usually http : //CAFQDN/certsrv or https : //CAFQDN/certsrv – This is references a Windows CA .
You will initially need to download the CA Certificate , Click Download a CA certificate , certificate chain or CRL .
You should name this certificate root.cer
Now you should navigate back to the previous page and Select Request a Certificate
Submit an Advanced Certificate Request
Open the http certificate file and copy the contents
Paste this in to the Advanced Certificate Request Box and select the Web Server template .
Select DER Encoded and Download the certificate . Rename this to http.cer as this makes it easier for us to determine the correct certificate for each service .
Repeat these steps for the Console Proxy certificate .
You should now see these two certificates and the root certificate in the directory .
You should now upload these .CER files to the vCloud Director cell . Again this can be completed easily using WinSCP .
I recommend uploading this to the same directory as this is the directory that keytool is installed .
We initially need to import the root certificate , this can be completed using the following command –
keytool -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -keystore certificates.ks -import -alias root -file root.cer
Import these to the certificates directory we created earlier than run the below commands –
Import HTTP Service –
keytool -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -keystore certificates.ks -import -alias http -file http.cer
Import Console Proxy Service –
keytool -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -keystore certificates.ks -import -alias consoleproxy -file consoleproxy.cer
Confirm the certificates are now in the certificates.ks keystore
keytool -storetype JCEKS -storepass passwd -keystore certificates.ks -list
Remember you will need to repeat these steps on any other vCloud Director cell you will be adding to vCloud Director .
Configuring NFS Transfer Storage for vCloud Director Cells
We now need to setup the transfer storage on the vCloud Director Cell . I have a NFS server that I will be using for this , but you can setup a NFS share on a Synology box If you have one or another NAS device such as FreeNAS . You can find my guide for setting up a NFS server on Ubuntu 14.03 here
We need to navigate to the following directory as this is where we will be mounting the NFS share .
cd /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/data/transfer
Mount the NFS share to the /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/data/transfer directory using the below command –
mount -t nfs IPofNFS : /Share /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/data/transfer
We now need to edit the fstab file so we can start this NFS mount when the vCloud Director Cell starts .
vi /etc/fstab
Press I to change to Insert mode inside the text editor .
Enter the following to the file so that this starts the NFS mount on boot . Change the relevant share to your NFS share .
172.16.0.13 : /media/transfer /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/data/transfer nfs rw 0 0
Press Esc and then press : wq ! To save the file .
We can confirm this is mounted by running the below command –
df -h
vCloud Director Installer
We can finally start the vCloud Director Installation ! We will need to navigate to the correct directory using the below command –
cd /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/bin
./configure
Select the IP for the HTTP Service and select the IP for the Remote Console Proxy .
Enter the path to the keystore we created earlier called certificates.ks – Enter the directory below and type your keystore password ( Default was passwd ) .
/opt/vmware/vcloud-director/jre/bin/certificates.ks
At this point you can configure a syslog host name or IP address If you have one on your network .
We now need to configure the SQL Database . Specify the following information –
Hostname of SQL Database/SQL Cluster Listener DNS Name/IP Address .
Default Port – 1433
vCloud Database Name , if you used the scripts above it will be called – vcloud
Database Instance – This will be default unless you have multiple instances on your SQL Server .
Enter the Database Username – vcloud
Enter the Database Password – Default as per the scripts above was – vcloudpass
The vCloud Director installer will configure the database as you can see below and then ask you if you want to start the vmware-vcd service .
When the service is started you can navigate to the web site as specified below –
You will now be able to navigate to the vCloud Director website as specified above .
Enter your vCloud Director License Key after agreeing to the License Agreement .
Specify an account name and password and also specify the contact Info .
Select Next and Finish
You will now be presented with the vCloud Director Login page !
Adding Additional vCloud Director Cells
To add additional cells to the deployment we will need to copy the responses.properties file , this is stored in the following location –
cd /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/etc
When you are in this location you can run the below command to copy this file to the vCloud Director Transfer storage .
cp responses.properties /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/data/transfer
You will now need to repeat the steps for the vCloud Director cell and when you reach the vCloud Director installation stage you need to run this command instead of the usual ./configure command that we used for this cell .
./configure -r /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/transfer/responses.properties
This will add an additional cell to vCloud Director !
Configuring CentOS Routing For Two NICS When Using Same Subnet ( Thanks to Matt F )
Way back when Splinter Cell : Blacklist first leaped into the spotlight , it did so in a fairly strange fashion by , well , leaping into the spotlight . Instead of methodical skulking , we saw fast-paced hulking – in broad , nearly blinding daylight , no less . It felt bizarre , as though Sam had suddenly become some hard-charging young gun in his old age . Recent videos , however , have eased my fear the teensiest of bits on that front – first with some admittedly takedown-heavy stealth , and now by showing us just how much time and effort is going into getting various forms of light and darkness just right .
Clearly , the details are what count here . Different light sources , how they play off the camera , how they affect visibility , etc . Also unsurprising but still nice to hear : all light sources are hand-placed . In this age of procedural generation , a light human touch goes a long way , I think .
But yes , I 'm still far from sold on Blacklist ( that introductory daytime E3 demo looked like everything I despised about Conviction multiplied by ten ) , but I ca n't in good conscience write it off entirely either . I tried squinting really hard at this trailer and also offering my ability to tip-toe to the pagan stealth gods , and a couple scenes looked kind of Chaos-Theory-ish . So maybe it 'll surprise us like the Splinter Cell of yore . Maybe we 'll never even know what hit us . But probably not .
I 'll cross my lithe ledge-gripping fingers regardless . Blacklist will be out sometime next year . Do you plan on giving it the time of day ?

Screenshots of The First Application That Supports ISO/IEC 29500 Blogosphere has been full of speculations about when and if ever Microsoft will support ISO/IEC 29500 format in MS Office . Some people believe and wish that OpenOffice.org with ISO/IEC 29500 support will be released earlier than MS Office . But do n't get fooled , the first application conforming to ISO/IEC 29500 is out , it is neither MS Office nor OpenOffice.org , it is coming from Free Software Foundation and you can see screenshots here .
OOXML is just bunch of XML files stored inside ZIP archive . Conforming OOXML document must be valid against schemas provided in ISO/IEC 29500 and must follow few other rules which ca n't be directly expressed in schema ( like conforming to packaging rules defined in OPC ) .
Murata Makoto kindly provided me with RELAX NG schemas for ISO/IEC 29500 . Having those schemas it was just matter of minutes to turn my good old Emacs into superb OOXML editor .
First I have to instruct Emacs to treat OOXML files with WordprocessingML as ZIP archives :
( setq auto-mode-alist ( cons ' ( `` \\.docx\\ ' '' . archive-mode ) auto-mode-alist ) )
After this change , I was able to browse packaged file and open any part inside it .
Figure 1 . Browsing OPC package in Emacs
There is a nice XML editing mode nxml from James Clark for Emacs . I have associated OOXML schemas with corresponding namespaces in nxml configuration ( schemas.xml ) :
< namespace ns= '' http : //schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main '' typeId= '' WordML '' / > < typeId id= '' WordML '' uri= '' …/WordprocessingML_Main_Document.rnc '' / >
From this point Emacs automatically validates each opened XML piece of package and provides me with autocompletition of element and attributes .
Figure 2 . Editing WordprocessingML inside Emacs
At least on this simple sample document Emacs is completely interoperable with MS Office as you can see on the following screenshot .
Figure 3 . Roundtripping of document between MS Office 2007 and Emacs
Now , when neither Microsoft nor OpenOffice.org team could be the first to provide ISO/IEC 29500 support I hope their focus will be on quality and conformance of their implementations .

District Court of Guam Chief Judge Frances Tydingco Gatewood has issued a decision in Arnold Davis ' lawsuit against the Guam Election Commission . The case was heard in her courtroom in September 2016 . Davis was prohibited from registering to vote on Guam 's political status .
Guam law only allows native inhabitants or a descendant of one who was naturalized under the Organic Act in 1950 to register and vote in a plebiscite . Davis argues that his constitutional rights were violated . He claims the prohibition from registering to vote , is a violation of the Voting Rights Act , the Organic Act of Guam and his Fifth , Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights . He subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment .
In a 26 page decision and order issued this afternoon , Judge Gatewood concluded that although the court recognizes the long history of colonization of this island and its people , and the desire of those colonized to have their right to self-determination , the court must also recognize the right of others who have made Guam their home .
Judge Gatewood granted Davis ' motion for summary judgment . “ The court permanently enjoins the government of Guam and its officers , employees , agents and political subdivisions from enforcing the Political Status Plebiscite that specifically limits the voters to “ Native Inhabitants of Guam ” and any laws and regulations designed to enforce the Plebiscite law insofar as such enforcement would prevent or hinder Plaintiff and other qualified voters who are not Native Inhabitants of Guam registering for and voting in the Political Status Plebiscite , ” the Judge ordered .

A coworker asked me if i was going to our local pride “ they 're doing a drag thing before the Rocky Horror showing ''
I , quite calmly , went . The fuck . Off .
Told her exactly what I thought of Drag , RHPC , and cis peoples fascination with them both . Surprisingly only dropping one F-bomb .
She was shocked af , I 'm usually all smiley happy upbeat girl , even on the worst days i can usually fake positivity .
She came back and tried to “ It 's not that bad ” and “ is all in fun ” and crap . I shut down everything she came up with . I would like to take this opportunity to thank tumblr for prepping me for that moment . : )
It 's always weird trying to transition between real-world LGBT spaces and tumblrized LGBT spaces .
In the rest of the world , Rocky Horror is a thing which has been a clearly positive transformative influence on probably a majority of the LGBT people I 've known , does a lot to undermine gender assumptions , and is the specific thing that got at least some people I know to realize that they were trans .
On tumblr , it 's “ problematic ” .
In the rest of the world , drag undermines the gender binary and drag communities are where a lot of trans women first find some kind of acceptance or comfort , and are generally well-regarded .
On tumblr , drag is horrible and drag communities are horrible and the people who found those communities to be safe and welcoming do n't count because their narrative does n't fit some academic theory about the right way to be trans .
In the rest of the world , the stuff being done at pride events is usually understood to be at least predominantly organized by and catering to the LGBT community .
On tumblr , that 's “ cis people 's fascination ” , and the LGBT people involved with it are completely erased .
In the real world , you 're a fucking asshole .
On tumblr , you imagine that you “ shut down ” everything she came up with by being ignorant of LGBT history and being rude . But I suspect that anyone else who 'd overheard the conversation would have thought of it rather differently .
Gosh , I sure hope we can progress towards the idealized utopia you envision where nonbinary filmmakers do n't get to make the films that they want to , and we can always judge every work of art by the very latest cutting-edge standards , and never consider how our history got us where we are today .
How the fuck can you be in your 30s and not know better than this ? It 's one thing when it 's the 16-year-olds who genuinely have no idea what life was like in the past , but you ought to be old enough to remember this . I guess maybe not ; the point at which the people I mostly talk to were going to RHPS woulda been the late 80s , and back then , “ two hours a week where you are n't worried about being killed for dressing to the wrong gender norm ” was a pretty amazing thing .
The lofty motto of the Environmental Protection Agency is �protecting people and the environment.� In practice , however , EPA bureaucrats faithfully protect their own people and preserve the government�s cesspool of manipulation , cover-ups and cronyism .
Just last month , Mark Levin and his vigilant Landmark Legal Foundation went to court to ask federal district Judge Royce Lamberth to sanction the EPA �for destroying or failing to preserve emails and text messages that may have helped document suspected agency efforts to influence the 2012 presidential election.� The motion is part of a larger Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit to force the EPA to release emails and related records from former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and others �who may have delayed the release dates for hot-button environmental regulations until after the Nov. 6 , 2012 , presidential election.�
Thanks to Levin and Landmark , Jackson and other EPA officials admitted in depositions that they used personal , nongovernmental email accounts to hide communications about official EPA business sent and received on their government-issued BlackBerries and smartphones . The agency has continued to drag its feet for two years in response to Landmark�s FOIA requests .
Levin minced no words : �The EPA is a toxic waste dump for lawlessness and disdain for the Constitution.� Not to mention disdain for the public�s right to know . As Levin added : �When any federal agency receives a FOIA request , the statute says it must preserve every significant repository of records , both paper and electronic , that may contain materials that could be responsive to that request.�
The agency is legally obliged to notify all involved in the suit to preserve everything in their possession that could be discoverable in the litigation . But the feds have bent over backward to delay and deny . �The people at the EPA , from the administrator on down , think they�re above the law , that no one has the right to question what or how they do their jobs , � Levin blasted . �Well , they�re wrong . The laws apply to everyone , even federal bureaucrats.�
That�s a bedrock principle the EPA has defied over and over again . As I first reported 13 corruption-stained years ago in 2001 , former EPA head Carol Browner oversaw the destruction of her computer files on her last day in office under the Clinton administration � in clear violation of a judge�s order requiring the agency to preserve its records . Browner ordered a computer technician : �I would like my files deleted . I want you to delete my files.� In 2003 , the agency was held in contempt and fined more than $ 300,000 in connection with another email destruction incident under Browner�s watch .
It was Levin�s Landmark Legal Foundation � upheld by Judge Lamberth � that held the corruptocrats accountable then , as they are now .
As President Barack Obama�s energy czar , Browner went on to bully auto execs �to put nothing in writing , ever� regarding secret negotiations she orchestrated on a deal to increase federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards . She was also singled out by Obama�s own independent oil-spill commission for repeatedly misrepresenting scientists� findings and doctoring data to justify the administration�s draconian drilling moratorium .
Browner previously had been caught by a congressional subcommittee using taxpayer funds to create and send out illegal lobbying material to more than 100 left-wing environmental groups . She abused her office to orchestrate a political campaign by liberal groups , who turned around and attacked Republican lawmakers for supporting regulatory reform .
The names might change , but the politicized rot stays the same . The GOP staff of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently issued a detailed report on the secretive �Billionaires� Club� behind the EPA . The analysis exposed how a massive network of left-wing foundations , activists and wealthy donors exploits IRS-approved �charitable� status and tax-deductible donations to lobby illegally on behalf of the EPA and operate a �green revolving door� between government and far-left groups .
Among the key players : the Environmental Grantmakers Association , which coordinates green grants and refuses to divulge its membership list to Congress , and Democracy Alliance , the dark-money outfit led by Philip Gara LaMarche that does not disclose its members or donor-recipients .
�These entities propagate the false notion that they are independent citizen-funded groups working altruistically , � according to the report . �In reality , they work in tandem with wealthy donors to maximize the value of the donors� tax-deductible donations and leverage their combined resources to influence elections and policy outcomes , with a focus on the EPA.�
Saving the planet ? Ha . The leftist-controlled Environmental Corruption Agency is in business only to serve its pals and subvert its political enemies while endangering resource security and sabotaging the deliberative process . Real environmental protection starts with draining this fetid swamp .
Priorities USA releases a new video mocking Mitt Romney for coming up with new number every time that he claims to have created jobs as CEO of Bain Capital :
When you ask , the question 'How many jobs did you create at Bain Capital ? ' the truth , is we invested in businesses that created the jobs . We did n't create them ourselves . They did . [ 3/13/12 , KMOV , St. Louis , Mo . ]
Yeah , yeah , I know you 're just so shocked to learn that Mitt Romney is so full of it on his claim to be a jobs creator that he ca n't even keep his numbers straight ... but you actually might be surprised to learn that in Mitt Romney 's own words , he 's blowing smoke : That 's a rare moment of candor for Mr. Bain—and it 's a tremendously important point . Romney 's job creation number relies on giving him credit for every single job created at every single company in which Bain invested money , no matter how much or how little . That 's like buying Apple stock and claiming to have created the iPad .
Take the case of Staples , at which Romney claims he created 90,000 jobs . Bain invested $ 2.5 million in the company in the late 1980s—and cashed out for $ 13 million in 1989 . By all means , give Romney credit for having seen an opportunity early on and having made a profitable investment . But give him credit for creating 90,000 jobs ? Are you kidding me ?
To be fair , Bain was n't always a passive investor . As the Priorities USA and the Obama campaign have been pointing out , there are numerous examples of Bain bustouts—cases in which Bain bought a company and took over its management , loading it up with debt , extracting millions , and letting it crash . And maybe there are some examples of Bain taking an active role and helping to manage companies into a stronger position . But if so , Romney is n't talking about them .
Well , you ca n't say she did n't have this one coming .
In the age of online dating , it 's not uncommon to hear of well-intentioned users being taken advantage of by skilled con artists . However , it 'd be pretty hard to argue that that 's the case here , because this woman immediately sent $ 120,000 to a guy who had only texted her “ hello ” and had n't even asked her for money or anything .

Yep , it seems like this major fuckup is pretty much on her part .
While most scammers have to work for months before they 're able to convince their targets to send them money , Stephanie Monson did all the work for the scammer in , like , two seconds by immediately emptying her bank account the moment his one-word message showed up in her inbox . While it 's certainly tragic that she lost her entire life 's savings in one fell swoop , you 've got to admit that the blame ultimately lies with Stephanie for Western Unioning $ 120,000 to a phone number she did not recognize and had only written “ hello. ” Her scammer did n't even have the opportunity to try and emotionally manipulate her with poetic texts and fake pictures of himself before she cleaned out her 401 ( k ) and sent it his way .
Any way you slice it , she 's only got herself to blame for this one .
Instead of being slowly lured into an emotional and psychological trap of ever-increasing complexity , Stephanie really jumped the fucking gun and wasted no time liquidating her daughter 's college fund . In a mere matter of moments , she completely destroyed her life , forcing her home into foreclosure by falling for a scam that , if we 're being honest , really had n't started at all . Super sad she does n't have a home anymore and now her daughter hates her , but , Stephanie , come on : At least let him send flowers to your house and promise you a getaway to an Italian villa before falling for this one . Get it together .

While our hearts go out to Stephanie for the incredible loss she sustained , there 's really no two ways about it : She should have seen this one coming from a mile away .

FLINT , Mich. — A pair of dog owners here have filed a federal lawsuit against a state investigator , alleging he shot their 15-year-old dog in the face while raiding the wrong house .
According to the lawsuit , a team of officers was trying to catch a fugitive but ended up at the wrong house with an innocent bystander getting shot : an old mixed-breed pooch named Chloe .
Chloe survived , but has had three surgeries and lost part of her tongue and one canine tooth . Her breed is not known . Her owners claim their constitutional rights were violated : The officers unreasonably destroyed or seized their property — in this case , Chloe — which is prohibited under the Fourth Amendment .
Here is what triggered the legal action , according to the lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court :
Flint residents Erica Morena and Katti Putnam were sitting in their house June 18 when police suddenly raided their home . They were looking for a fugitive , who was actually next door .
A Michigan Department of Corrections investigator went in their backyard .
Chloe heard commotion and the dog came down the stairs of the house and ventured out the back door , which was open , and made her way to the backyard .
A state investigator shot Chloe , 15 , right below the nose and she has had three surgeries so far . ( Photo11 : Courtesy of Erica Morena and Katti Putnam )
That 's when the investigator shot her right below the nose , according to a neighbor who witnessed the shooting . She had on a collar . She was n't barking . And she has no history of biting anyone .
Chloe 's owners heard the shot and ran to her rescue . They also heard the troopers say they were at the wrong house .
The officers told Chloe 's owners to take her to the vet and said , `` We 'll take care of this . ''
The owners went to the vet , then got a lawyer : Lawyer Christopher Olson of Royal Oak , Mich. , who has filed several similar dog-shooting lawsuits .
`` They really had no right to be there , '' Olson said of the officers . `` The police went to the wrong house and shot these folks ' dog in their own backyard . ... They turned the situation into a violent one . ''
And , he added , `` They recognized there was a mistake . ''
Corrections officials were not available for comment .
Olson , who is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages , said this is not an isolated incident . He has several dog-injury lawsuits pending against police , including one written about in Time magazine .
“ They turned the situation into a violent one . ... They recognized there was a mistake. ” Christopher Olson , Royal Oak , Mich .
Police nationwide are mishandling dog encounters because they have `` zero training '' in this area , he said , noting such video training is available for free online .
`` Had they followed the protocols in these training videos , this would not have happened , '' Olson said of Chloe 's shooting . `` It 's too bad not only for my clients and the dog , ... but this is something that is a nationwide epidemic . It 's a big problem and it 's something that does n't necessarily have to happen . ''
In Chloe 's case , he said : `` There was time , and when there 's time , you need to isolate the dog . ''
Olson also said the officers have not made good on their promise to `` take care of this . '' He said Chloe 's veterinary bill still has not been covered . And when his clients call the police or state officials about it , he said no one returns their calls .
June 18 proved to be a tough day for Chloe 's owners on a number of levels . Olson noted that when Morena and Putnam drove Chloe to the vet , a state trooper pulled them over for speeding .
However , they avoided a ticket , and the trooper gave them an escort to the veterinary clinic .

Fair criticism of Tesla is one thing , and I 've engaged in my share . Poisonous political attacks are another , especially when they come from the black , self-serving lungs of a coal company executive . Robert Murray released a cloud of calumny and obfuscation on CNBC 's “ Squawk Box , ” calling Tesla a “ fraud ” that had taken $ 2 billion in taxpayer subsidies while failing to turn a penny of profit . Murray is the chief executive of Murray Energy Corp. , the nation 's largest underground coal company , which extracts 65 million tons of bituminous coal a year from 12 active mines in the U.S. and Columbia . You might think that Murray would have no issue with people buying electric Teslas and connecting them to a carbon-fired teat , at least in states like Kentucky , West Virginia and Ohio that generate at least 70 percent of their electricity from coal . But it did n't take long to see what was really eating Murray , or `` Squawk Box '' co-host Joe Kernen , who regularly argues that man-made climate change is a myth , and has called environmentalists the `` Eco Taliban . '' Murray tried to link red-meat names like Warren Buffett and J.B. Pritzker with Tesla 's Elon Musk , darkly hinting that Hillary Clinton wants to subsidize her cabal of supporters for reasons “ that have nothing to do with supporting the environment. ” ( About the only names he did n't mention were Vince Foster and the Rothschilds ) . Oddly , the Pritzker family earned its fortune in Hyatt hotels and real estate , not energy . More strangely , as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway , parent company of Nevada natural-gas utility NV Energy , Buffett has tangled with Musk over electricity rates for solar customers , and has tweaked Musk over “ big time ” tax breaks for Tesla 's battery plant . So much for energy conspiracy theories .

But logic really went out the window with Murray 's smiling insistence that “ ... you could close down every coal-fired plant in the United States today and you would not affect the temperature of the earth at all . Not at all ! ” Host Kernen eagerly took the bait : “ Just the temperature in that lady 's house , er , you might affect that temperature , but not the temperature of the planet . Thanks for making the case. ” Wow . I 've heard of Coal Miner 's Daughter . Kernen is apparently Coal Miner 's Talker . Is it just me , or is cheerleading for a notoriously polluting , life-snuffing industry an especially rich vein of bullshit for a purportedly objective business journalist ? Kernen 's “ case , ” of course , is that climate change is a fraud or a conspiracy that the world 's scientists have somehow managed to keep secret , even though most scientists will confess their geek love of cellos and Miyazaki on a first date . And , that any rational response to this `` phony '' crisis , aside from extracting and burning fossil fuel to the planet 's literal last drop , is a symptom of government overreach or collective madness . Musk saw through CNBC 's smokescreen , and tweeted back : The “ Real fraud going on is denial of climate science . As for 'subsidies , ' Tesla gets pennies on the dollar vs. coal . How about we both go to zero ? ” Murray did n't mention that coal power plants are America 's ( and the world 's ) number-one source of carbon-dioxide emissions—about 25 percent in America , roughly 44 percent around the globe—and the leading contributor to climate change . Coal plants are also directly implicated in smog , acid rain and toxic air pollution , including more than half the nation 's mercury emissions and the most sulfur dioxide . Now , there 's nothing wrong with clear-eyed debate over the best strategies to reduce reliance on fossil fuels . We can acknowledge stark realities—including Americans ' current dependence on natural gas and , yes , coal—wasteful practices or misguided avenues . Hey , the ethanol boondoggle that mainly benefits corn-growing agribusiness—there 's a good one . I 've personally criticized the government for subsidizing production and sales of six-figure EVs , including Teslas , for wealthy buyers who do n't need or deserve huge tax breaks .
While the Obama Administration making the claim that it has the power to use drones inside the United States to target and eliminate potential threats , a Fox News poll released on Monday shows that Americans are not at all comfortable with this prospect :
The poll finds that 32 percent of voters think that yes , the president should be able to authorize the use of deadly force domestically against an American terrorist . Still , about twice that many — 63 percent — disagree and want checks on the president . Again , agreement is bipartisan , as most Republicans ( 70 percent ) and independents ( 70 percent ) and a majority of Democrats ( 54 percent ) oppose the president having the sole power under these conditions .
There were actually two different questions in regard to President Obama and drone strikes , one of which was a general question about the policy . The other was a more specific question about giving the power to determine who should be targeted to the president .
Here are the two questions :
Do you approve or disapprove of the United States using unmanned aircraft called drones to kill a suspected terrorist who is a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil ?
Do you think the president of the United States , on his own , should be able to authorize the use of deadly force , such as a drone strike , to kill a suspected terrorist who is a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil ?
On the first question , the divide was n't that wide . According the poll , 45 % — including 44 % of Democrats and 47 % of Republicans — approve of using drones to kill an American citizen suspected terrorism inside the United States . Only 50 % disapprove .
The second question reflected a deeper partisan divide , one that is reflective of today 's politics . While only 32 % of respondents the president having the sole discretion to an American citizen suspected of terrorism , 41 % of Democrats are perfectly fine with this . Only 26 % of Republicans supported the idea .
The poll also found that 74 % of Americans approve of drone strikes against suspected terrorists in other countries . Only 22 % disapprove of these targeted killings , which often kill innocent civilians .
According to a study by the law schools at Stanford and New York University , as many as 881 innocent Pakistanis — including 176 children — were killed in drone strikes over the course of an eight year period . The study also found that drones have had a profound psychology impact , “ giving rise to anxiety and psychological trauma among civilian communities ” due to the fact that “ [ d ] rones hover twenty-four hours a day over communities in northwest Pakistan , striking homes , vehicles , and public spaces without warning . ”
The numbers on the homefront are good news , but unfortunately , too many Americans do n't see the bad side of drones overseas , which is a failure of the media for not reporting on these incidents when they occur . It 's not a sexy as the latest pop-culture news or the scandal of the day .
H/T : Hot Air
Cold temperatures kill about 20 times as many people worldwide as hot temperatures do , say Canadian and international researchers who challenge conventional wisdom that extreme weather events cause the most deaths .
In a study published Wednesday in the medical journal The Lancet , researchers analyzed data on 74 million deaths across countries with climates ranging from cold to subtropical between 1985 and 2012 .
After examining temperature , humidity and air pollution measurements , the team used a statistical model to estimate how a specific temperature contributes to mortality risk during the following days . The team then calculated how many deaths on foul-weather days exceeded what occurred during optimal temperatures for each location .
`` This study indicates that cold kills 20 times as many people as hot weather , with 7.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent of the number of deaths that occurred in the 13 countries within the study period being due to cold and heat , respectively , '' said lead author Antonio Gasparrini from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the U.K .
`` These results challenge the conventional wisdom that the health effects of temperature are limited to extreme weather events , '' he added in an email interview .
Overall , about 90 per cent of the deaths attributed to cold occurred on mildly cold days . Extreme temperatures accounted for less than one per cent .
The Canadian findings showed nearly 4.5 per cent of deaths in this country over the study period were due to cold compared with 0.5 per cent for heat .
Most of the deaths in Canada were during mild hot or cold days , while the contribution of days with extreme temperature is relatively smaller , said study co-author Eric Lavigne , a professor at the Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences at the University of Ottawa .
`` Given much attention has been emphasized on heat-related impacts , public health policies that focus on the prevention of temperature-related health effects should ensure that appropriate measures are undertaken to prevent cold-related health impacts , '' Lavigne said .
There were substantial differences between countries . Deaths attributed to non-optimal temperatures ranged from 3.37 per cent in Thailand to five per cent in Canada and 11 per cent in China .
The other countries included were Australia , Brazil , Italy , Japan , South Korea , Spain , Sweden , Taiwan , Thailand , U.K. and U.S .
One of the limitations of the research is that factors such as age , socioeconomic status and some air pollutants were n't included .
Keith Dear and Zhan Wang from Duke Kunshan University in Jiangsu , China , wrote a journal commentary published with the study .
Although deaths attributed to cold are substantially more common , they attract far less public attention than heat waves , the commentators said .
Since high or low temperatures affect susceptible groups such as the unwell , young and elderly the most , they suggested attempts to mitigate the risk associated with temperature would benefit from in-depth studies of the interaction between mortality and socioeconomic factors .
Gasparrini said it is hoped the study will contribute to how policies can be designed to prevent deaths attributed to different temperatures .
Researchers plan to expand the data set to include more regions of the world .
The study was funded by the U.K. Medical Research Council .
One of the world 's most iconic paintings could become the most expensive painting sold at auction when it goes under the hammer Wednesday
Oli Scarff / Getty Images Edvard Munch 's iconic painting , The Scream , is on auction at Sotheby 's New York Tuesday . It is expected to fetch in excess of 50 million GBP .
UPDATE : The Scream has sold for a record $ 119,922,500 . Read the full story here .
Edvard Munch 's The Scream is expected to become the most expensive painting ever sold when it hits the auction block at Sotheby 's today . Now that 's something to yell about .
The famed painting by the Scandinavian artist is expected to sell for $ 80 million , but some experts believe it could bring in far more than that — as much as $ 150 million — during Wednesday 's auction . If it hits that mark , it would smash the record set in 2010 when Pablo Picasso 's Nude , green leaves and bust sold at auction for $ 106.5 million .

Why the disparity between sales estimate and prediction ? It 's something that lies in the nature of art auctions . David Norman , worldwide co-chairman of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby 's told Reuters , “ $ 100 million feels like it might be a barrier , but pictures like this — where they end up going is a matter of momentum . It really is hard to predict . You 're working at determining the price for one of the most unique and rare images of the past 150 years . ”
The painting has an enduring popularity among at least one group of connoisseurs : art thieves . Two versions of The Scream were stolen from museums in 1994 and 2004 . While both were eventually recovered , it is something that the art world is n't soon to forget . In preparation for the sale of the famed work , Sotheby 's has gone to extraordinary lengths to safeguard the work . Munch 's masterpiece sits in a specially constructed mini-gallery behind a tension wire at the auction house 's New York headquarters and is under 24-hour guard , according to Reuters .

The painting heading to the auction block is an 1895 version of the masterwork , and is the only privately owned version of the piece . The owner , Petter Olsen , whose father was a friend and neighbor of Munch 's , is planning to fund a museum with the proceeds , according to Reuters .
Even if it is auctioned for its highest estimate , however , The Scream would still be far from the most expensive artwork ever sold . That title currently belongs to Paul Cézanne 's The Card Players , bought in 2011 by the royal family of Qatar in a private sale for an estimated $ 250 million .

NEW BRITAIN , CT—Calling a strong independent press “ absolutely vital ” to a democratic society , the staff of The Recorder , Central Connecticut State University 's student-run newspaper , confirmed Friday they know exactly how they would respond if their freedom of expression were ever challenged . “ We would refuse to back down even one inch if a situation ever arose in which our responsibility to inform the students of this campus was threatened by censorship , ” said editor-in-chief Hannah Lowry , adding that the paper would move quickly to publish an open letter to school administrators—or whoever might attempt to infringe on their First Amendment rights—bearing the signatures of all the publication 's editors and reporters . “ Any editorial we run would definitely include a quotation from Thomas Jefferson about the importance of a free press , and we would continue to cover the story on the front page for as long as necessary . We at The Recorder provide an important and necessary public service as journalists , and we must always strive to give a voice to the members of the Blue Devil community who have none. ” The staff confirmed their response would also include a scathing editorial cartoon drawn by sophomore applied arts major Brian Thatcher .

Esteban Ocon says he is `` 100 per cent ready '' to go head-to-head with Max Verstappen yet again .
In 2014 , the teenage Frenchman actually beat Verstappen to the European F3 crown , but it was the younger Dutchman who went onto to make his meteoric F1 debut .
Ocon , however , is not far behind . He won the GP3 championship last year and is now on loan by Mercedes to Renault 's works F1 team , where he stands a chance of making his grand prix debut next year .
Mercedes ' Toto Wolff calls Ocon `` one of the stars of the future '' .
`` Did Toto really say that ? '' the 19-year-old excitedly told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf .
Asked if he feels ready for F1 , Ocon answered : `` Yes , 100 per cent . I 'll do anything to reach the highest level .
`` I know where I came from and how many sacrifices we have made and I do not want to miss my opportunity if it comes , '' he added .
Ocon says his relationship with Verstappen is now good , but admits that when they were fighting for F3 spoils , there were difficult moments .
`` During the season we said nothing to each other and sometimes we seemed to hate each other , but after the season we forgive and forget .
`` He 's doing a great job , '' Ocon said , still referring to Verstappen . `` I never doubted he would . He deserves it .
`` That Max is doing so well now is good for young drivers . It means we might get more of a chance in F1 , because it shows that age does not matter . ''

Here 's what jumped out at you in 2014 about Teddy Bridgewater : No impressive rookie passer in recent memory has generated less buzz around the league . And for someone who probably should have received much more credit -- with the Adrian Peterson mess , where would the Minnesota Vikings have been without Bridgewater ? -- it appears his doubters still outnumber the believers .
`` He played the position better than the other [ rookie quarterbacks last season ] , but he 's not especially talented , '' one NFC offensive coordinator wrote in a text message the other day , summing up the NFL 's less-than-enthusiastic evaluation of Bridgewater . `` [ He ] has a very average arm and is undersized . ... The ceiling is n't as high '' as it is for some other quarterbacks .
OK , so it 's unlikely Bridgewater will ever be compared favorably to Andrew Luck . Or Russell Wilson , for that matter . But instead of harping on Bridgewater 's shortcomings , let 's focus on what he does well . There 's a lot to see there , too .
On the eve of training camp , the Vikings are relying on their sharp second-year signal-caller to bring stability to the game 's most important position . Supremely confident , Bridgewater , 22 , displayed poise that belied his age while shouldering the weight of the Vikings ' offense last fall without Peterson . The All-Pro running back missed all but the season opener after he was charged with child abuse in Texas in September .
The return of Peterson ( who 's happy after having his contract restructured this week ) and the addition of deep-threat wide receiver Mike Wallace could be just what Bridgewater needs to make another strong statement after his surprising opening act . The numbers told the story .
With bitcoin gaining popularity and acceptance among masses , the debate about its actual definition and legal status has also become fierce .
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service considers bitcoin as a property ; a federal judge perceives it as a currency and recently , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) has declared it as a commodity . That means the regulator can now levy charges against any wrongdoer trading digital currency futures and options .
Bloomberg spoke to the leading members of the bitcoin community for their views on the matter .
Mike Hearn , software developer specializing in Bitcoin , said :
“ There are so many regulators in the U.S. , and they all want more jurisdiction , which leads to a constant stream of bizarre rulings . None of them has much work to do because there 's not a whole lot of financial innovation happening in the States . So when they find a small one-man startup they ca n't resist giving themselves work to do – so they go in and whack it , especially in California .
“ I 'm not terribly surprised and not terribly worried . I think the CFTC has a very weak case here and it 's a very creative reinterpretation of what the word commodity means . The ruling will be challenged and judges will apply common sense and decide it to be a currency '' as happened in the Silk Road case . ”
Preston Byne , co-founder and COO of Eris Industries , said :
`` If you 're using Bitcoin as a remittance tool you 're not going to like this , but if you 're using it as a business this regulation gives you a framework that 's predictable . However a lot of the value proposition of Bitcoin is tied up in the non-compliance aspect . With the cost of compliance can company stay competitive ?
“ Regulation of Bitcoin is necessary and premature at the same time . It 's the fault of the federal system . If you 're in England , everything happens in one city – regulators can easily visit the Chancellor , Bank of England and the companies . In the U.S. there 's a patchwork of inconsistent agencies who do n't coordinate their different fiefdoms . ”
Gareth Grobler , founder of the IceCUBED Bitcoin exchange , said :
“ In the U.S. there are regulators that look at Bitcoin from their own perspective and just arbitrarily make up a rule or guidance . New York regulates it as a currency , for example . It 's just not sensible . If this ruling does affect anyone , they 'll just move to offshore jurisdictions .
“ Bitcoin has many uses – sometimes it 's used , traded as a commodity but it 's also used as a currency and a technology . ”
Mark Lamb , CEO of Coinfloor Bitcoin exchange , said :
“ Regulators need to be talking with each other and engaging with industry . The CFTC does n't seem to have done either of those . Just claiming a platform is illegally offering bitcoin options is n't helpful if they 're trying to have a relationship with these companies .
“ There 's a lot more collaboration in the U.K. between the Treasury , the FCA , HMRC and the top Bitcoin companies . To date the government has n't taken a public position that they 've had to take back .
“ Having said that I 'd rather Bitcoin were regulated as a commodity because commodity regulations are the lightest . ”
'Time And Casualties ' : Gen. Dempsey On Cost Of Sequester
Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP
It 's been about a year and a half since Gen. Martin Dempsey left his job as chief of staff of the Army and became President Obama 's top military adviser as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Dempsey is now responsible for reshaping the U.S. military after 10 years of war , which means scaling the forces down . At the same time , he 's fighting to stave off across-the-board cuts to the defense budget — the so-called sequester — that could happen in a couple weeks if Congress fails to reach some kind of budget deal .
Dempsey sat down with NPR 's Rachel Martin to talk about the kind of impact these cuts will make and the recent cultural shifts in the U.S. military .
Interview Highlights
On the risks of sequester :
`` Two words : time and casualties . The way this plays out , when you hollow out readiness , it means that when the force is needed , when an option is needed , to deal with a specific threat ... it would take us longer to react to those . So time is the issue . Some people would say , 'So what ? ' Well , time generally translates into casualties in my line of work .
`` We will weather this . The military is never going to fail to answer the call when the nation is threatened . So we will weather this , but shame on us all if we weather it at the expense of those who choose to serve in uniform . ''
On cultural changes in the military :
`` The reason that we have taken these steps is that we actually do foresee a military that has to adapt to a changing world , [ and ] not just a socially changing world but literally a demographically changing world .
`` I think it 's fairly common knowledge that our population of military-age young men who qualify for the military is declining . So as a very practical matter , we decided [ that ] if in 2020 we 're going to need these young ladies , and we 're going to need to attract as much diversity and as much talent as we can possibly attract , if that 's going to be the case , then what are we waiting for ? ''
On updating military standards :
`` There are currently 66 military occupational specialties that are not open to women . So what you 've seen us do is invert the paradigm . The paradigm was : 'These are closed to women so we do n't need to explain why . ' Now the paradigm is : 'These could be open to women , so we 'd better explain why not . ' ... What that 's done is that it will actually make us wrestle standards to the ground and figure out if we 've got them right .
`` There are existing standards , many of which have n't dusted off in a very long time , [ and ] many of which have been narrowly focused just on physical standards , but without the companion piece of potentially psychological and intellectual standards . All I 'm suggesting is taken holistically ... I think this will be a very healthy thing for the institution . And it will also have the added benefit of allowing a greater part of the population to compete . ''
1 . Breast-feeding is natural .
It depends on how you define “ natural. ” True , breast milk is produced organically by the human body , and for most of human history , feeding infants at the breast was a fact of life . “ Natural ” also implies a process that is untainted by civilization and society , yet infant feeding practices have changed throughout history and vary by culture . When we think about breast-feeding , we imagine an infant at her mother 's breast . But in previous eras , mothers who could afford to do so enlisted other women ( poor women , slaves , immigrants ) to breast-feed their babies . This was the “ natural ” order of those cultures .
Also , when breast-feeding advocates say it is natural , often what they mean is that breast milk is wholesome . Yet it 's only as nutritious as the foods mothers eat , the air they breathe and the substances they consume . There are concerns that breast milk is tainted by environmental contaminants that nursing mothers can not control , and women have been arrested for feeding their infants this “ natural ” substance after consuming drugs , alcohol and even prescription medications .
2 . Formula is just as healthy as breast milk .
Infant-care experts made this claim throughout the 20th century . Some midcentury doctors even touted alternatives — made of cow 's milk whey or soy , along with oils , vitamins and minerals — as more nutritious than breast milk.It is not a coincidence that these alternatives are known as “ formula , ” a term that connotes scientific sophistication .
We now know that breast milk , with its unique balance of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , confers a range of health benefits , including lessening the chances of ear infections , asthma , gastrointestinal ailments , diabetes , allergies , obesity and sudden infant death syndrome . But it is not clear that breast-feeding makes a substantial difference for children in developed countries . ( There is no doubt about its advantages in places that lack access to clean water and adequate health care . )
Since scientists ca n't assign women to randomized groups of breast-feeders and formula-feeders , they are forced to work backward from data , making it difficult to firmly establish whether breast-feeding improves a child 's health . For example , mothers who breast-feed are also more likely to adopt other wholesome behaviors : They eat less junk food , they 're less likely to smoke , and they see doctors . So studies have trouble determining whether children who were breast-fed are less likely to be obese because they received breast milk — or because their mothers cooked healthier foods .
3 . One year is the optimal age for weaning .
Your average new mom will probably tell you she 's aiming to breast-feed for one year . That 's the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics . But there 's nothing special about the one-year mark . In fact , there is no optimal age for weaning . Breast milk confers most of its advantages in the first three to four months of life , and some babies lose interest before their first birthday while others are happy to breast-feed well into toddlerhood .
The one-year goal reflects ambivalence about the breast in our hyper-sexualized culture : It is both a symbol of maternal care and the epitome of a woman 's sexuality . As babies grow teeth , begin to walk and talk , the sexual overshadows the maternal . Just witness the firestorm created by the recent Time Magazine cover that featured an almost-4-year-old at his mother 's breast .
4 . Most American women breast-feed their babies .
Statistically , this is true . In 2011,75 percent of American mothers tried to breast-feed , and 35 percent continued to breast-feed exclusively at three months . But these numbers mask class and racial divides .
Among U.S.-born women , white , educated , older and married mothers are more likely to breast-feed . Low-income and minority mothers have fewer breast-feeding resources in their communities . And among some African Americans , breast-feeding has negative connotations dating to slavery , when slaves were purchased as wet nurses .
There are also economic barriers . Low-income women are less likely to get paid maternity leave and ca n't afford lengthy unpaid leaves . Pumping — the magical solution to working mothers ' breast-feeding woes — is often not a viable option because it requires access to a clean , safe and private space ; the opportunity to pump frequently ; and a refrigerator to store breast milk . A little-known provision in President Obama 's health-care law requires most employers to provide breaks and a private room for nursing mothers , but implementation has been sluggish .
5 . Breast-feeding rates dropped in the 20th century because more women entered the workforce .
In truth , U.S. breast-feeding rates began rising just as women entered the workforce in large numbers in the early 1970s . Since then , rates of breast-feeding and working women have grown in tandem .
Breast-feeding did decline dramatically after formula was introduced in the early 20th century . But women did n't stop breast-feeding because they were too busy working . Formula 's early and enthusiastic adopters were white , middle-class mothers who did n't work outside the home . And once formula was so closely associated with middle-class status , poor women were eager to embrace it .
Some women were ambivalent about breast-feeding , and pediatricians assured them that formula was an acceptable alternative . Others stopped because they were diagnosed with “ insufficient milk syndrome , ” a 20th-century epidemic largely created by doctors who recommended that mothers breast-feed according to a strict schedule ( all the rage from the 1920s to the 1950s ) . We now know that adequate milk supply is attained when babies are fed “ on demand , ” though plenty of mothers have difficulty achieving and maintaining this equilibrium .
The women 's movement , which facilitated women 's entry to the workplace in the 1970s , was also instrumental in the resurgence of breast-feeding . “ Our Bodies , Ourselves , ” one of the movement 's best-known manifestos , celebrated breast-feeding as a subversive practice that affirms the natural capabilities of women 's bodies , defying doctors who discourage mothers from nursing .

I started feeling the need of automating my developement environments when i started contributing to several django projects run by the community , each project uses a different django version and several dependencies , thoses dependencies can be found or not on the Ubuntu version i use for my daily work . Vagrant is a great tool for those situations , it allows you to create and manage custom virtual environments to your needs using automated configuration technologies such as Chef , Puppet and Shell scripts .
Installing Vagrant
Vagrant works with VirtualBox , and support Vmware Fusion and AWS via plugins
Install Virtualbox
$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox
Install Vagrant
$ sudo apt-get install vagrant
Make sure Vagrant is installed correctly
$ vagrant -- version Vagrant version 1.2.0
Get your first VM up and running
start a vagrant config file in an empty project folder . this will create Vagrantfile $ mkdir project $ cd project $ vagrant init edit Vagrantfile to add the boxname Vagrant : :Config.run do |config| config.vm.box = `` devserver '' end add a base image or box to quickly clone a virtual machine . this will create a folder .vagrant with an ubuntu box $ vagrant box add devserver http : //files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box then you are ready to go $ vagrant up [ default ] Importing base box 'precise32 ' ... [ default ] Matching MAC address for NAT networking ... [ default ] Clearing any previously set forwarded ports ... [ default ] Forwarding ports ... [ default ] -- 22 = > 2222 ( adapter 1 ) [ default ] Creating shared folders metadata ... [ default ] Clearing any previously set network interfaces ... [ default ] Booting VM ... [ default ] Waiting for VM to boot . This can take a few minutes . [ default ] VM booted and ready for use ! [ default ] Mounting shared folders ... [ default ] -- v-root : /vagrant [ ... ]
Wait for the command to finish , then you will have a VM ready for you to connect . the VM can be accessed via SSH :
$ vagrant ssh
Provisioning
Vagrant allow you to use different Provisioners to easily setup your VM with everything it needs to run your project :
Chef Solo
Chef Server
Puppet Standalone
Puppet Server
Shell
I do prefer Puppet for provisioning , because it 's easy and it allows you to easily create a manifest to control the package , file or service with a few lines of code .
Here is the Vagrantfile i use , i needed to forward the port 8000 because i want to access the webapp using my browser , i also increased the memory of the VM to 1GB , and made the project folder accessible to the VM :
# - * - mode : ruby - * - # vi : set ft=ruby : Vagrant : :Config.run do |ltp| ltp.vm.box = `` ltp-devserver '' ltp.vm.box_url = `` http : //files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box '' ltp.vm.forward_port 8000 , 8000 ltp.vm.network : hostonly , `` 33.33.33.10 '' ltp.vm.customize [ `` modifyvm '' , : id , `` -- memory '' , 1024 ] ltp.ssh.max_tries = 50 ltp.ssh.timeout = 300 ltp.vm.share_folder ( `` v-root '' , `` /home/vagrant/ltp '' , `` . '' ) ltp.vm.provision : puppet do |puppet| puppet.manifests_path = `` puppet/manifests '' puppet.manifest_file = `` vagrant.pp '' end end
here one of the classes i use on my dev environement :
class init { group { `` puppet '' : ensure = > `` present '' , } # Let 's update the system exec { `` update-apt '' : command = > `` sudo apt-get update '' , } # Let 's install the dependecies package { [ `` python '' , `` python-dev '' , `` libjs-jquery '' , `` libjs-jquery-ui '' , `` iso-codes '' , `` gettext '' , `` python-pip '' , `` bzr '' ] : ensure = > installed , require = > Exec [ 'update-apt ' ] # The system update needs to run first } # Let 's install the project dependecies from pip exec { `` pip-install-requirements '' : command = > `` sudo /usr/bin/pip install -r $ PROJ_DIR/requirements.txt '' , tries = > 2 , timeout = > 600 , # Too long , but this can take awhile require = > Package [ 'python-pip ' , 'python-dev ' ] , # The package dependecies needs to run first logoutput = > on_failure , } }
You need to specify one manifest file in your Vagranfile , if you need to split it , you can use something like this :
$ tree . └── manifests ├── classes │ ├── init.pp │ └── ltp.pp └── vagrant.pp
I use vagrant.pp to define my project variables , and to make sure all the classes are executed in the order i want :
import `` classes/ * .pp '' $ PROJ_DIR = `` /home/vagrant/ltp '' Exec { path = > `` /usr/local/bin : /usr/bin : /usr/sbin : /sbin : /bin '' , } class dev { class { init : before = > Class [ ltp ] ; ltp : ; } } include dev
The ltp class is only used to run some django commands :
class ltp { file { `` $ PROJ_DIR/loco_directory/local_settings.py '' : ensure = > file , source = > `` $ PROJ_DIR/loco_directory/local_settings.py.sample '' , replace = > false ; } exec { `` db_download '' : cwd = > `` $ PROJ_DIR/loco_directory '' , command = > `` /usr/bin/wget http : //people.ubuntu.com/~daker/ltp/ltp.db '' , creates = > `` $ PROJ_DIR/loco_directory/ltp.db '' ; } exec { `` managepy_syncdb '' : cwd = > `` $ PROJ_DIR/loco_directory '' , command = > `` /usr/bin/python manage.py syncdb -- noinput '' , } exec { `` managepy_migratedb '' : cwd = > `` $ PROJ_DIR/loco_directory '' , command = > `` /usr/bin/python manage.py migrate '' , } }
Now all i have to do is vagrant up and let Vagrant do all his magic tricks :
$ vagrant up [ default ] Importing base box 'ltp-devserver ' ... [ default ] Matching MAC address for NAT networking ... [ default ] Clearing any previously set forwarded ports ... [ default ] Forwarding ports ... [ default ] -- 22 = > 2222 ( adapter 1 ) [ default ] -- 8000 = > 8000 ( adapter 1 ) [ default ] Creating shared folders metadata ...

After i started using Vagrant , my workflow imporved a lot i start focusing on writing code rather than resolving packages conflicts , i do use a VM for each bug fix/feature i need to work on , and once the fix is merged i simply delete the VM without thinking about breaking anything .
[ NB ] : Ubuntu now officially supports Vagrant , and provides official Ubuntu boxes for 12.04 , 12.10 , 13.04 and 13.10 .
This is the first of a series of articles about the transition to grazing for Jonathan and Maryann Connor of Providence Dairy in Addison , VT. We will cover the farmers ' decision making process , their goals , the planning process , funding , and implementation , along with successes and challenges faced . We look forward to readers ' comments and shared experiences along the way .
In October 2015 , the Natural Resources Conservation Service ( NRCS ) and the University of Vermont Extension hosted a soil health field day with well-known agronomist and soil health guru Ray Archuleta . If you 've ever seen Ray speak , he has a way of getting people pretty excited . One of the farmers in attendance that day was Jonathan Connor of Providence Dairy . I knew of Jonathan through other farmers in the area , but did n't know him personally . The next day I decided to drive out to his farm in Addison to see how he and Extension might be able to work together more . He greeted me enthusiastically and started talking about the ideas he had for no-till , cover crops and grazing on his farm . He told me the previous day 's workshop was inspiring and then said , “ The plant and the soil are one. ” Whoa . This guy is quoting Ray Archuleta . Ok , I thought , he 's serious . Let 's get to work .
Jonathan and Maryann Connor both grew up on dairy farms in Vermont . They have been operating their farm for 23 years and have been on the Addison farm since 2001 . Over time , their herd size grew from 60 to 110 milking cows with 279 tillable acres . The Connors operate a well-managed Holstein herd , producing high quality milk and are part of the Ben & Jerry 's Caring Dairy program with the St. Albans Coop . Caring Dairy provides additional premiums for farmers who achieve designated ‘ sustainability indicators ' . Over their five years of enrollment in the program , Jonathan and Maryann were able to focus on energy efficiency , animal care , water quality and soil health improvements . In 2015 , they had also enrolled in Vermont 's Farm Viability program which provides business planning services and assists farmers in exploring possible management or enterprise changes that could increase net profitability . For the Connors , grazing was one area to explore further .
As a traditional tie-stall operation , the cows were essentially confined at Providence Dairy . There was a bit of fence in place for an NRCS CREP project which fenced out the Dead Creek and the adjacent small heifer pasture . So basically , we 'd be planning a grazing system from scratch . I have to admit , these projects are always so exciting to work on , especially when the farmers involved are as energized and receptive as the Connors are .
One of their grazing goals was to save money on tillage , planting and harvesting annual crops . Jonathan wanted to seed down some of his corn ground near the barn to high quality pasture , so that all the acreage closest to the barn was able to be grazed . Another goal was to reduce the herd 's cull rate by promoting herd health with cows on grass . A neighboring organic pasture-based farm had disclosed that their cull rate was around 8 % . That was another motivator in the decision-making process . Jonathan says , “ I 'm concerned with cows on cement all the time . I believe that by turning them out and letting them graze , they will last longer. ” Additionally , organic production was never off the table , so adopting grazing now could open the door for transitioning down the road .
However , when planning the system Jonathan and Maryann did n't want to go too crazy or bite off more than they could chew during a year when milk prices were low and the risk would be that much higher . So while it would be totally feasible to fence the entire farm for grazing , we started conservatively . We chose enough acres near the barn that would provide 30 % of the cows ' daily dry matter intake from pasture . These were hay and corn fields , so we 'd need fence – lots of it . We 'd also need laneways for the cows to get back and forth to the barn for milking . Those would be the big ticket items . Additionally , we 'd need water pipeline , water tubs , temporary fencing materials , and good pasture seed for that corn field . We sat down last winter and started the process of writing up a grazing plan to include the amounts of infrastructure needed , in line with the farmers ' vision of how grazing would unfold on their farm . We 've spent a lot of time talking about good grazing management and have visited a neighboring pasture-based farm to see things up close and personal . Jonathan says , “ I 'm used to harvesting my crops 2 inches from the soil and putting it in a silo . It will be hard to see grass waving around out there and not feel like I 'm wasting it . I know I have to change my mindset . ”
As of this publication , Jonathan has experimented with turning some dry cows out on to his newly fenced fields . Click here for the next article , where we talk about his experience with that and the logistics of the planning process for this project . Stay tuned… .

Child detention : end this shameful bipartisan policy
Posted
This is not about politics ; it is about saving vulnerable children from the severe harm done to them in detention , which is proven and undisputable , writes Nick Talley .
The new report by the Australian Human Rights Commission , The Forgotten Children : National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention , provides overwhelming evidence once again of the terrible health impacts Australia 's detention policies are having on children .
It 's a depressing read , replete with stories of children crying themselves to sleep at night , illustrated with children 's drawings of bars , tears and upturned faces , and containing testimony from expert paediatricians that the physical , mental and emotional harm being done to children may in many cases be irreversible .
In short , it shows successive governments have clearly failed to uphold their duty of care towards an extremely vulnerable group of people that has no voice to defend itself , and in so doing have breached the United Nation 's International Convention for the Rights of the Child .
Almost as sad as the report itself has been the response from the Federal Government , which has had the report since November but only tabled it at the last possible moment , in the closing hours of Parliament on Wednesday , the day of its deadline .
Instead of engaging with the report 's horrific content , the Government has attacked the Commission and its president , Professor Gillian Triggs , suggesting that in highlighting the suffering of these children she has engaged in a `` blatantly partisan ... stitch-up '' , in the Prime Minister 's words .
This response is deeply disappointing . The commission engaged some of Australia 's most distinguished paediatricians to examine conditions in detention and the data relating to health impacts . Forty-one witnesses gave evidence , under oath , during five public hearings . Many of these experts are my colleagues , fellows of The Royal Australasian College of Physicians . To suggest their professional medical opinions are part of some political hatchet job is simply shameful .
The Government 's response discounts an overwhelming consensus that holding children in detention is unacceptable , outlined in submissions made to the inquiry by over 200 organisations and individuals .
My own organisation provided evidence to the inquiry and I take great offence at any suggestion its evidence was influenced by partisanship . This is not about politics ; it is about saving vulnerable children from the severe harm done to them in detention , which is proven and undisputable .
The facts - of children refusing to speak or eat , crying through the night unable to sleep , wetting their beds in fear - are indisputable and beyond politics .
Our opposition to holding children in detention has been sustained during Liberal and Labor Governments , as has this harmful policy , sadly .
Indeed , as Professor Triggs highlighted this week , detaining children is one of the few areas of political bipartisanship in recent years , with both sides complicit in this reprehensible policy .
As a doctor and a medical researcher , I have no doubt that this report is robust . It draws on qualitative and quantitative research methods to reach evidence-based conclusions that highlight the devastating impact the policy of mandatory detention has on children and their families . Scientific rigour is not subject to partisan politics , and it shows ignorance to suggest otherwise .
Instead of attacking the Commission and its president with the tired lines it has been parroting in the months leading up to this report being tabled , the Abbott Government should take this opportunity to fully adopt the report 's recommendations .
Once and for all , Australia 's leaders must put a stop to the detention of children in immigration facilities .
Professor Nick Talley is president of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians .

This week 's Nature has a fascinating essay by anthropologist Pascal Boyer discussing the quirks of spiritual belief and how they may result from the evolution of our mind and brain .
Boyer is best known for his book Religion Explained : The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought where he argued that religion can be understood as where the cognitive abilities we 've developed through evolution are applied to things like group identity , ritual , or the explanation of otherwise mysterious things , such as weather or disease .
Essentially , Boyer argues that there are cognitive restraints on religious practice and belief , which he illustrates by pointing out some interesting inconsistencies in our intuitive ideas about spiritual agents . According to Boyer , this suggests that our mental capacities define what are supposed to be all-powerful or all-knowing entities .
This clip of Boyer being interview by Jonathan Miller is fascinating because he points out , contrary to popular belief , what most religions are concerned with . He notes most religions do not concern themselves with the creation of the world or the afterlife , while the presence of unseen agents is almost universal .
There is now a growing interest in the cognitive science of religion and one of my favourite articles is by psychiatrist Quinton Deeley who discusses how different form of religious ritual may influence specific cognitive functions to pass on religious teachings and commitments ( full disclosure : Deeley is a friend and research collaborator ) .
Deeley argues that the well-known distinction between ‘ doctrinal ' rituals which are frequent and low intensity ( such as everyday prayers or practices ) , and ‘ imagistic ' high-intensity , less-frequent rituals ( such as exuberant religious celebrations ) serve different psychological purposes .
‘ Doctrinal ' rituals help create semantic memories of key concepts and emotional response through associative learning , while ‘ imagistic ' rituals help create episodic memories of specific situations that may involve altered states of consciousness and the experience of other realities .
Deeley also did a fascinating talk on ‘ Ritual , Possession Trance , and Amnesia ' where he discusses some of the neuropsycholgical mechanisms that might underlie trance and possessions states .

Aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide used as a synthetic nonnutritive sweetener in over 90 countries worldwide in over 6000 products . The purpose of this investigation was to review the scientific literature on the absorption and metabolism , the current consumption levels worldwide , the toxicology , and recent epidemiological studies on aspartame . Current use levels of aspartame , even by high users in special subgroups , remains well below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority established acceptable daily intake levels of 50 and 40 mg/kg bw/day , respectively . Consumption of large doses of aspartame in a single bolus dose will have an effect on some biochemical parameters , including plasma amino acid levels and brain neurotransmitter levels . The rise in plasma levels of phenylalanine and aspartic acid following administration of aspartame at doses less than or equal to 50 mg/kg bw do not exceed those observed postprandially . Acute , subacute and chronic toxicity studies with aspartame , and its decomposition products , conducted in mice , rats , hamsters and dogs have consistently found no adverse effect of aspartame with doses up to at least 4000 mg/kg bw/day . Critical review of all carcinogenicity studies conducted on aspartame found no credible evidence that aspartame is carcinogenic . The data from the extensive investigations into the possibility of neurotoxic effects of aspartame , in general , do not support the hypothesis that aspartame in the human diet will affect nervous system function , learning or behavior . Epidemiological studies on aspartame include several case-control studies and one well-conducted prospective epidemiological study with a large cohort , in which the consumption of aspartame was measured . The studies provide no evidence to support an association between aspartame and cancer in any tissue . The weight of existing evidence is that aspartame is safe at current levels of consumption as a nonnutritive sweetener .
Wolff : Only a matter of time before Ferrari reach us
Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff has tipped Ferrari to challenge his team 's dominance in 2015 , and is impressed with progress made by the Maranello outfit since last year .
Having struggled in 2014 , the fabled Italian team proved in Melbourne that it has leapfrogged Red Bull and Williams to be ‘ best of the rest ' so far this year .
“ Compared to where we were last year , ” Kimi Raikkonen told reporters , “ for sure as a team we did the best job over the winter . ”
Many experts are nonetheless predicting a lonely season of easy one-twos for Mercedes , but Wolff is refusing to write off Ferrari .
“ We won in Melbourne by about 30 seconds to Ferrari , ” he is quoted by Universo . “ If you consider where they were last year , that is quite impressive .
“ We can see from GPS that their engine is very powerful and the car is very good . I think it 's only a matter of time before they reach us , because Ferrari as a team has everything you need to do that , ” added Wolff .
Given Mercedes ' utter dominance in Australia , some might smirk at Wolff 's comments , but F1 veteran David Coulthard agrees it is far too soon to predict the outcome of an entire world championship .
“ You can see from what Ferrari has done that it is possible to move forwards , ” the former Red Bull driver told Austria 's Servus TV .
“ Red Bull is having problems and the same is obviously true of McLaren and Honda , but they are working on solutions .
“ You ca n't look at just one race , you also have to see the big picture , ” added Coulthard .
Those who have been longing to see The Book Of Mormon but have yet to make it to Broadway because they are laughably , detestably poor , take some solace : Trey Parker and Matt Stone have confirmed to Entertainment Weekly their long-rumored intentions to turn their award-winning satirical musical into a feature film , which can then be projected onto an upturned washtub or the broad flank of a cow , or however it is you get your entertainment . Unfortunately , while having some obvious experience with filmmaking already , plus the bonus of producer Scott Rudin being involved with the show , should make the adaptation process easy , do n't expect to see it anytime soon . The plan is to do it “ in several years , ” according to Parker , following the original show 's run , a prospective tour , and presumably a break ( permanent or otherwise ) from their South Park duties . By then , it 's entirely likely you will have succumbed to rickets , but do try to hang on .

Cityonfire.com received the above press release from Lionsgate .
Swiss voters resoundingly rejected a proposal to move the country to a single-payer system on Sunday . Instead , the country will keep its private health insurance system , which looks a whole lot like Obamacare .
Two-thirds of Swiss voters opposed creating a state-run health plan in the national referendum . The issue was put to a vote after Swiss campaigners gathered more than 100,000 signatures , the threshold for getting a national vote ; some initial polls in 2013 had shown strong support for a state-run system .
How Swiss health care works
For a country with a relatively small population ( 8 million ) , Switzerland comes up a shocking amount in debates over American health care . That 's probably because the Swiss health care system looks pretty similar to the one Obamacare sets up .
Since 1996 , Switzerland has required all residents purchase coverage through an individual mandate . `` If you move to Switzerland , you have three months to buy coverage and it 's retroactive to your arrival , '' Aaron Carroll explains in his excellent video primer on the Swiss health care system .
Swiss residents buy coverage from private health insurance plans , who compete for their business . The average monthly premium for adults , in American dollars , was $ 329 in 2013 . There are no pre-existing conditions in Switzerland ; insurers are only allowed to vary premiums based on age , charging different rates for children under 18 , young adults between 19 and 25 , and adults over 25 .
The Swiss system does have a relatively high amount of cost-sharing . Patients typically have to pay for 10 percent of their health care services out-of-pocket , even after they meet their deductible . And for prescription drugs , patients on average cover 20 percent of the medication 's cost .
Swiss health care has pros and cons
The Swiss health care system typically stacks up really well in international surveys . The Commonwealth Fund 's ranking of international health system — which uses metrics like access to care and costs — recently put Switzerland in second place of all the countries it looked at .
Switzerland 's health care system does the best at seeing patients quickly . Seventy-nine percent of Swiss residents say that , the last time they needed medical care , they were able to see a doctor that same day , more than any other country in the Commonwealth Fund survey . Only 3 percent of doctors there have had trouble getting their patients ' speciality tests like CT Scans and MRIs , the lowest number the same survey recorded .
That access comes at a price : the Swiss system is one of the more expensive in Europe .
Only the Germany , the Netherlands and France devote a larger share of their economy to paying for health coverage . The Swiss system suggests that regulated competition has n't succeeded at containing costs . Lots of access to doctors means more health care spending .
Some of this might also have to do with the fact the Swiss system is n't especially efficient . Sixteen percent of patients there report spending `` a lot of time on paperwork or disputes related to medical bills . '' Only the United States does worse on these metrics .
That explained much of the impetus behind the drive for single-payer , which was seen as a way to reduce the Swiss system 's administrative costs . As one advocate told the AFP , `` Over the past 20 years in Switzerland , health costs have grown 80 percent and insurance premiums 125 percent . This is not possible anymore . It has to change . ''
It 's not going to change now , though . The Swiss , perhaps unsurprisingly , like a system that provides really great access to care — and , at this point , do n't want to see it overhauled .
DIYARBAKIR , Turkey ( Reuters ) - Turkish tanks on Tuesday pounded Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) targets in Cizre , a southeastern town at the heart of a military operation that the army said has killed 127 Kurdish militants in a week .

Black smoke rose from buildings in the town after shelling from hilltops and the pro-Kurdish Peoples ' Democratic Party ( HDP ) said at least 23 civilians had been killed in the violence .
A 16-year-old boy was killed in Diyarbakir , the largest city in the region , from a gunshot wound to the chest during protests against the curfews , security sources said .
In the town of Sirnak further east , a police officer was killed after militants attacked his armed vehicle , they said .
Clashes have forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes in Sur , a historic district of Diyarbakir , which has been under curfew for three weeks , CNN Turk said , citing a report by the main opposition Republican Peoples Party ( CHP ) .
Security forces launched a new offensive in the mainly Kurdish region last week after President Tayyip Erdoğan pledged to root out militants .
Diyarbakir Mayor Gultan Kisanak criticised the tactics .
“ Tanks and heavy weaponry , which are only used in conventional warfare , are being used by the Turkish armed forces , in areas where hundreds of thousands of civilians live , ” Kisanak said in a statement .
A prosecutor opened an investigation against HDP leader Selahattin Demirtas , two other HDP lawmakers and two senior Kurdish politicians .
They are accused of violating anti-terrorism laws and encouraging criminal activity at a news conference last week where Demirtas urged Kurdish citizens to resist the operations . Turkish lawmakers can not be prosecuted unless parliament first strips them of their immunity .
The towns of Cizre and Silopi , bordering Iraq and Syria , have been the focus of the campaign . Images on state media from Sur have shown Turkish troops patrolling rubble-strewn streets among buildings riddled with bullet holes .
A two-year ceasefire between the PKK and Ankara fell apart in July , shattering peace talks and reviving a conflict that has afflicted Turkey 's mainly Kurdish southeast for three decades , killing more than 40,000 people .
The PKK , which launched its insurgency in 1984 , is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey , the United States and the European Union .
Traditionally focused on the countryside , the PKK has shifted to southeastern towns , setting up barricades and digging trenches to keep security forces away .
Demirtas said the campaign was targeting locals who were presented as “ terrorists ” .
“ We stand by our people who resist the tanks and shelling , ” he said before leaving for Moscow on a visit criticised by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu .
Turkey and Russia have been at odds since Ankara downed a Russian jet involved in operations against rebels in Syria last month , saying it had violated Turkish airspace .
“ TARGETS FOR BULLETS ”
Many towns are under curfew and electricity has been cut in many Silopi districts as transformers have been damaged . Food and water was running scarce in some Diyarbakir districts , while shopkeepers kept shutters closed in protest at the security operations , residents said .
Ferhat Encu , an HDP lawmaker for Sirnak , said on Twitter that the bodies of those killed in clashes in Silopi were being kept in houses due to the curfew .

The Kurdish Islamist party Huda-Par , usually sympathetic to the ruling AK Party , said security forces were taking positions inside civilian houses , including those of two party members , against the residents ' will , therefore making them a target .
“ Due to the curfew , our members and their families can not leave their house and move to a safer place and therefore have become targets for bullets , ” a party statement said . It added that entering people 's homes by force , whether by the state or the PKK , was trespassing and “ unacceptable ” .
On Tuesday , a Turkish soldier was killed in Bitlis , the army said , during an operation that killed two PKK militants .
Tablet carving : Stone Age update adds iPad support By Owen Faraday
Nothing sedentary about Campfire .
A new update to Campfire Creations ' Stone Age has addressed the game 's only significant shortcoming : it 's now a Universal app . The update also adds a new tougher AI caveman to match wits with and buffs out a few remaining dents . It 's a very inclusive patch : even the iPad 1 -- which actual cavemen used -- is covered .
Though the iPad version is n't massively different from the iPhone edition , there are a lot of man-hours that have gone into this update . `` We had three goals with the iPad version , '' Campfire 's John Meindersee told me today . `` Provide iPad Retina graphics , keep the same , simple user experience on the iPad that we had on the iPhone , and keep file size under 150-200mb . The iPad version of Stone Age has all the same functionalities that the original had . If you know how to play Stone Age on iPhone then picking it up on iPad will be a breeze . However , we have created all new Retina graphics and redistributed items on screen to give it a less `` cluttered '' look . `` Kelsey loved the adaptation of the famous Hans im Glück board game when he reviewed it back in December , and the game has been steadily improved ever since . Stone Age is one of the very best board game adaptations on iOS : the Universal update makes it indispensible.I 've been talking to Campfire recently and they 've got a very interesting project lined up for their next trick -- though not one that can be named just yet . Watch this space .
Miss Espersen has missed multiple high-level summits since March , including three meetings with Hillary Clinton , the US Secretary of State , and the Kabul Conference on the future of Afghanistan .
She has missed 13 key meetings in recent years and was this week called the “ world 's worst ” foreign minister by a German newspaper .
Luck appears to have deserted the 44-year-old mother of two . She missed the Kabul summit because her plane was diverted to Kazakhstan after a rocket attack closed Kabul airport . Uzbekistan then closed its airspace to her flight . She claimed she would speak to the Uzbek ambassador to Copenhagen but that role does not exist .
She once failed to attend a meeting of Arctic countries because she was on an Easter break in Majorca . She has previously defended missing meetings by saying it was typical practice in many cases to send another foreign representative in her place .
Miss Espersen is a party leader and deputy prime minister as well as being head of foreign relations . A poll showed that 52 per cent of Danes felt she should step down as foreign minister .
My column is here , one excerpt is this :
The benefits of driverless cars are potentially significant . The typical American spends an average of roughly 100 hours a year in traffic ; imagine using that time in better ways — by working or just having fun . The irksome burden of commuting might be lessened considerably . Furthermore , computer-driven cars could allow for tighter packing of vehicles on the road , which would speed traffic times and allow a given road or city to handle more cars . Trips to transport goods might dispense with drivers altogether , and rental cars could routinely pick up customers… The point is not that such cars could be on the road in large numbers tomorrow , but that we ought to give the cars — and other potential innovations — a fair shot so that a prototype can become a commercial product someday . Michael Mandel , an economist with the Progressive Policy Institute , compares government regulation of innovation to the accumulation of pebbles in a stream . At some point too many pebbles block off the water flow , yet no single pebble is to blame for the slowdown . Right now the pebbles are limiting investment in future innovation .
A few points :
1 . I could n't fit it in the column , but it is an interesting question why there is no popular movement to encourage driverless cars . Commuting costs are very high and borne by many people . ( Here is Annie Lowery on just how bad commutes can be . ) You can get people to hate plastic bags , or worry about a birth certificate , but they wo n't send a “ pro-driverless car ” postcard to their representatives . The political movement has many potential beneficiaries but few natural constituencies . ( Why ? Does it fail to connect to an US vs. them struggle ? ) This is an underrated source of bias in political outcomes .
2 . In the longer run a lot of driverless cars would be very small . Imagine your little mini-car zipping out and bringing you back some Sichuan braised fish , piping hot .
3 . If a traffic situation gets really hairy , the driverless car can be programmed to pull over and stop . Oddly I think that perfecting the GPS system might be a trickier problem than making them safer than driver-run cars . Computers do n't drink , but they will drive around the same block forever and ever if they do n't understand the construction situation . Even the best chess-playing computers do n't very well “ understand ” blockaded positions and perpetual check .
4 . This is n't a column about driverless cars at all . It 's about our ambivalent attitudes toward major innovations . It 's also about how the true costs of regulation are often hidden . A lot of potentially good innovations never even reach our eyes and ears as concepts , much fewer realities . They do n't have tags comparable to that of the driverless car .
5 . Via Michelle Dawson , here is a list of driverless trains . Here are links on robot-guided surgery .
A new poll conducted by McLaughlin & Associates for Secure America Now found that most Americans support strengthening interior enforcement , including ending sanctuary cities and catch-and-release . The online poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters during the first week of February .
The poll asked likely voters if they support blocking federal grants to jurisdictions that refuse to turn criminal illegal aliens over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement . 59 % of likely voters support blocking those grants , including 55 % of Independent voters . Only 29 % of likely voters oppose the policy .
The poll also gauged support for Pres . Trump 's Jan. 25 executive order that ended the existing catch-and-release policy and prioritized the removal of criminal illegal aliens . Under Pres . Obama 's catch-and-release policy , Border Patrol agents were ordered to release anyone they came into contact with who claimed to be in the country continuously since the start of 2014 . The poll found that 69 % of Americans support the executive order , including a majority of Democrats who support the order 50-37 .
The poll also asked likely voters if they supported Pres . Trump 's Jan. 27 executive order that paused visas for seven countries identified by Pres . Obama and Congress in 2015 as hot spots for terror . 57 % of likely voters supported the order compared to 37 % who opposed . A majority of Independents , 53 % , also supported the order .

What if you cashed out of your pricey pad and moved some place where you could get a house twice as nice for half as much ?
The average price of a home in Canada went up just over seven per cent in 2016 , according to the Canadian Real Estate Association . At only $ 489,591 , the price seems very affordable for those in big city centres like Vancouver and Toronto where average home prices are almost double that .
But elsewhere in the country , $ 500,000 can go pretty far .
In December , we took a look at what $ 1 million homes looked like in key Canadian cities . From a run-down home ready for demolition in a south Vancouver neighbourhood to a stunning and large lakefront home in Halifax , the discrepancies from coast to coast were remarkable .
Now we 're lowering the bar to a more affordable price point .
To keep it simple , we went searching for detached homes with at least three bedrooms . In some cases , it was n't possible to find one in our budget . For those , we had to go outside the city .
Here 's what you can get for $ 500,000 in cities across Canada :
Vancouver , BC
What you get for $ 500,000 :
With nothing in Vancouver-proper in the budget , there was this home in Langley . Listed at $ 545,000 , this 1920 's character home has three bedrooms and needs quite a bit of work .
Victoria , BC
What you get for $ 500,000 :
What used to be an affordable oasis a boat ride from Vancouver , Victoria 's home prices are now growing at a rapid pace . The cheapest detached home outside the city in Saanich is listed at $ 517,500 and needs considerable work – or a bulldozer .
Kelowna , BC
What you get for $ 500,000 :
As the increase in prices moves east , homes in Kelowna are still on the verge of affordable . This four-bedroom home in West Kelowna was built in 2003 and is listed at $ 519,000 .
Calgary , AB
What you get for $ 500,000 :
Who said real estate in Calgary came cheap ? In the Marlborough neighbourhood of Calgary , this renovated home is listed at just under $ 500,000 . It may be some distance from the city but it is close to the C-Train .
Edmonton , AB
What you get for $ 500,000 :
For just under $ 500,000 , you can buy a 2,200 square-foot home with four bedrooms right on the River Valley . Located in Beverly Heights , a neighbourhood east of Edmonton , the home is fully renovated and comes with an amazing view .
Saskatoon , SK
What you get for $ 500,000 :
This home , built in 1912 and updated to modern standards , is listed for $ 539,000 . Located in the Riversdale neighbourhood , it has five bedrooms but only one bathroom .
Winnipeg , MB
What you get for $ 500,000 :
You get a lot of bang for your buck in Winnipeg . This river-front home in North Kildonan has five bedrooms , four bathrooms and a large backyard backing on the river . It also has an elevator .
Toronto , ON
What you get for $ 500,000 :
Toronto prices certainly are n't getting cheaper . The city is feeling a real estate boom similar to Vancouver 's , meaning $ 500,000-homes are like finding a needle in a haystack . This one in West Hill , east of Toronto , sits on a 20-foot lot and has five bedrooms .
Hamilton , ON
What you get for $ 500,000 :

Montreal , QC
What you get for $ 500,000 :
A renovated “ cottage ” in Saint-Laurent can be yours for $ 479,000 . It has three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a solarium and a finished basement .
St. John 's , NL
What you get for $ 500,000 :
Most new construction in St. John 's is priced in the $ 500 , ooo range . This brand-new home in Kenmount Terrace is listed at $ 492,900 and includes three bedrooms , three bathrooms and an open-concept floor plan .

Just across the bridge in Dartmouth , this 1872-built home with modern updates is listed for $ 549,900 . It has four bedrooms and a large 14,000-square foot lot overlooking the Halifax harbour .
Reading the coverage of the Houston Texans ...
Jadeveon Clowney wo n't get much time away between now and training camp . But he 's using his sports hernia surgery as motivation , writes Jarrett Bell of USA Today . `` I want to live up to my reputation , '' said Clowney , who had n't had a surgical procedure since a high school ankle operation . `` I figure I 've got some extra motivation now , '' Clowney said . `` I could 've done anything I wanted this next month , if I had n't gotten hurt . No telling how I would 've acted if I had gone home . But this kind of brought me back . They always talk about nothing is set in stone . Well , you really see the light . I just need to get healthy so I can ball out . ''
Former Texans quarterback T.J. Yates has a new home . In the meantime , Battle Red Blog recounts the drive Yates led that helped the Texans clinch their first division title .
Andrew Goldberg of Fox Sports Southwest goes through the Texans ' roster , position by position , and gives his analysis on each position . Here 's what he has to say about the quarterbacks : `` The quarterback position has a nice mix of youth , talent and experience . Fitzpatrick was recently named the starter and will provide the Texans with experience at the quarterback position while O'Brien grooms Savage for the future . Savage has all the physical traits you want in a quarterback as he stands at 6-5 and 230 pounds and has rocket arm but he did n't exactly dominate college football . Meanwhile , Keenum started eight games as a rookie and started off hot before cooling down later in the season . The bottom line here is that Fitzpatrick has never led a team to a winning record since coming into the league . His best record in Buffalo was 6-10 and he went 3-6 last season for the Tennessee Titans in relief for Jake Locker . None of these quarterbacks scream franchise player , at least not yet . ''

In a bizarre incident , a woman identified a dead boy to be her brother 's and cremated it as per Hindu rituals only to find , hours later that her brother was alive
Representational pic
In a bizarre incident , a woman identified a dead boy to be her brother 's and cremated it as per Hindu rituals only to find , hours later that her brother was alive .
The woman allegedly identified her brother through a hazy picture published in a local daily . Then , to confirm that he was dead , she called his cell phone which was switched off , leading her to believe that the dead body was , in fact , that of her elder brother .
The woman , a resident of Goluwala city in Rajasthan 's Hanumangarh district , claimed the body and cremated it . But hours after the cremation one of the man 's relatives called the dead man 's cellphone in order to investigate the reason for his death . To their surprise , the man they thought was dead , answered the phone as per reports in the Hindustan Times .
It was later found that the cremation was a case of mistaken identity . The police , on the other hand , are now trying to identify the man who was cremated by mistake and his cause of death .

As per the police , a photograph of the man was published in a local daily on Sunday , for identification . Mahavir Singh , head constable at Lalgarh police station , said , “ The body had been found hanging from a tree in Dalianwali village under Lalgarh police station area on Saturday . ”
When the lady saw the photo , she thought it was her elder brother who had been living separately . As per the police , the man was a vagabond and the siblings did not have a very cordial relationship . On dialing his mobile number and hearing that it was switched off , the lady assumed that the dead body was that of her brother . She then reached Sri Ganganagar 's Lalgarh police station the next day , along with dozens of her family members and claimed the body .

The body was handed over to her after the postmortem , and she subsequently cremated the body by 2pm . A head constable said , “ Several relatives of the woman who came with her had also identified the body . Also , some public representatives too had come . Devi also alleged that his brother was going out with a nomad woman and it was possible that she had got him killed. ” He added
After the cremation , one of the relatives decided to call the dead man 's phone in the hope of finding some clues as to why he died , and to everyone 's shock , the man they thought was dead , answered the phone . The man was then asked to reach his sister 's home at the earliest .

Competitor Kathy Mocharnuk 's Cricket recently got caught in the chute when it detached from the barrel at a trial . Cricket was not hurt in the incident .
On August 17 , 2016 , UK Agility International made the following announcement regarding the use of the closed tunnel ( otherwise known as the chute ) at UKI trials :
“ Due to the overwhelming evidence of dogs getting entangled and tripping from the use of flat tunnels/chutes , UKI would like to announce that it is suspending the use this piece of equipment in all of its courses including the US & Canadian Opens . In the event that a safer design for the chute is released and tested , we will then re-evaluate the possible reinstatement of this obstacle , although as before , it would not be a required obstacle in any class . ”
UKI co-founder Laura Derrett says that the change was inspired by recent accidents in the chute :
“ Over recent months it 's become very apparent from both sides of the Atlantic that dogs getting tangled in cloth tunnels seems to be more frequently seen despite even straight approaches and exits . This past weekend has seen incidents in both countries and has been well publicized on social media . As an organization we wanted to be proactive and respond before a serious injury occurs rather than after . From the response from our announcement it appears that majority of agility competitors are in favor of this move . ”
UKI competitors seem quite happy with this change . Floridian Gail Lynch says , “ I am delighted that UKI has opted to suspend the use of the chute for the safety of our canine athletes . I compete in UKI trials and will continue to support the organization . It is very satisfying to see that the organization truly cares about our canine athletes. ” California competitor Deanna Fairchild adds , “ The announcement from UKI today about suspending the use of the chute is a breath of fresh air ! The chute has several scary components to it ( the hard plastic barrel and the loose fabric exit ) which can and have caused a multitude of injuries upon entry and exit in our four legged teammates . I was already a fan of UKI but now I will be enjoying it even more ! I hope AKC and USDAA also consider suspending the use of the chute . ”
The rule change may bring more competitors out to UKI agility trials . Marla Friedler-Cooper is one of them : “ I 'm so happy that UKI has taken the lead * in the US by discontinuing the use of the chute . The chute is a very dangerous obstacle and its use is one of the reasons I have done less agility this year than in the past . In the earlier days of agility , dogs were not as fast and courses were simpler . Even then , the chute ( and the tire ) are obstacles I considered to be riddled with safety issues . But now , with trickier courses and faster dogs , I consider these obstacles to be ones that should be obsolete . So although I have not done UKI in years , I am going to start entering UKI because I want to support them in this decision . I hope the other organizations will also make this decision to help keep our dogs safer . ”
Google has been accidentally gathering extracts of personal web activity from domestic wifi networks through the Street View cars it has used since 2007 , it said last night .
It was discovered as a result of a data audit demanded by Germany 's data protection authority , and is likely to inflame critics of Google concerned about the web giant 's use of private data .
As well as systematically photographing streets and gathering 3D images of cities and towns around the world , Google 's Street View cars are fitted with antennas that scan local wifi networks and use the data for its location services .
In a post on its European Public Policy blog on 27 April , Google stated that although it does gather wifi network names ( SSIDs ) and identifiers ( Mac addresses ) for devices like network routers , it does not gather `` payload '' data passed through those wifi networks .
But yesterday Google blogged that the audit had prompted it to `` re-examine everything we have been collecting '' and admitted its mistake .
`` It is now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wifi networks , even though we never used that data in any Google products . ''
Google said it amounted to 600GB , equivalent to a consumer hard drive , but that this data consisted only of fragments of activity from open wifi networks . Password-protected web services , such as banking or secure HTTP addresses , would not have been included , and neither would data from password-protected wireless networks .
Google blamed the mistake on a piece of legacy code from an experimental project that had been re-used to programme equipment on the Street View cars , and said it will ask a third party to oversee deletion of the data and its procedures .
`` As soon as we became aware of this problem , we grounded our Street View cars and segregated the data on our network , which we then disconnected to make it inaccessible . We want to delete this data as soon as possible , and are currently reaching out to regulators in the relevant countries about how to quickly dispose of it . ''
Google said the discovery highlighted the vulnerability of data in open wifi networks . It has previously said other companies , including Skyhook and Microsoft , already scan wifi networks and gather information in this way .
Google Street View has been introduced in more than 20 countries , and has also been extended outside the initial 21 major UK cities .
But it has faced regular concerns about privacy , which started in Britain on the day of the launch after users found images of a man throwing up in the street and another leaving a sex shop . In April last year , residents in Broughton barricaded roads to stop the Street View car entering the village , saying it would encourage crime and was an invasion of privacy .
Google is struggling with stricter privacy laws in Germany , where it has yet to launch the service , and Switzerland where it was introduced in August . Despite a flood of demands from the European Union , including wiping its Street View images after six months instead of 12 , Google has said it remains committed to Street View in Europe . It said reports that it would stop mapping streets in any more EU countries are inaccurate .
• This article was amended on 21 May 2010 . The original said : That the Google Street View feature currently displays images from cities in nine countries , including 21 in the UK . This has been corrected .
Our democracy is broken . How else to explain the depth of the divisions that scar our country , and were revealed in all their visceral rawness by this bleak and all too often bitter referendum campaign ? Yet if we are to start the process of healing these divisions and rebuilding our politics , we first need to understand the degree of people 's resentment and alienation in the face of economic and technological forces beyond their control .
Brexit brought democracy back – now we need to start listening to each other | Giles Fraser Read more
I know that many people who voted remain will be angry with those who opted to leave , but such feelings are misplaced . To dismiss them as bigots or racists would be a serious mistake . Instead what we should recognise from these results is a profound rage at a political and economic elite who have held power and wealth close to their chests for far too long . The leaders of the leave gang are about as anti-establishment as the Duke of Edinburgh , but we can not dismiss the fact that they tapped into something profound occurring in Britain , and the daily dose of fear from some remain campaigners was n't enough to sway people towards remain .
Immigration was a useful scapegoat for very real and legitimate anxieties about access to public services , affordable housing and secure jobs . Perhaps that 's no surprise , given that a cross-party consensus emerged at the last election that saw pledges and mugs promising immigration controls – at the very same time as agreement across the board on cuts to public services . While the Green party celebrated migration , and pledged to share the economic bonuses it brings , others raced to the bottom on rhetoric and failed to stand up to Ukip 's outrageous myths . A country ravaged by austerity and fed a daily dose of lies about migrants was always bound to kick back .
It 's now down to people who believe in multiculturalism to make a serious stand for it – we can not shy away . We need an urgent campaign to rebuild the infrastructure necessary to bind us all together , along with a plan to share the benefits of immigration more broadly . Key to this would be an “ immigration dividend ” paid specifically to areas under most pressure , and invested in local communities – in everything from libraries to leisure centres – so everyone benefits .
My city , Brighton and Hove , knows what a Tory handling of a financial crisis looks like ; and I shudder at the thought of further children 's centre closures , longer queues at doctors ' surgeries , and more jobs being lost in the public sector . Yet that seems likely , alongside the threatened bonfire of environmental and workplace protections – even though my city did n't vote to leave the EU and did n't vote for this government . It is vital that progressives unite to fight this .
And more than that , we need a political system that enables people 's voices to be heard . Giving people a genuine opportunity to shape their own futures via the ballot box is fundamental to addressing the disaffection that has brought us to this point . That 's why pressing for progressive reforms to the British constitution as part of the Brexit discussion is crucial . In the referendum every vote mattered , and that needs to be the case each time we go to the polls . And I say that as someone devastated by this result .
Five million votes , two seats : smaller parties demand a change in the rules Read more
Like the millions of other supporters of the European Union , my party is grieving today . We fought for a vision of a generous , confident and outward-looking country , committed to playing its part in making the world a better place . But we lost – and it 's crucial that we accept the will of the majority .
Perhaps it 's no wonder that leave 's message to “ take back control ” stuck . People do feel powerless . Not least the almost 4 million people who voted for Ukip at the last general election who have just one MP representing them . As the one MP for more than a million voters I know all too well how our electoral system is n't up to the task of representing genuine political differences that exist in Britain .
So here 's my challenge to Brexiters : if you 're serious about giving people back control , then join the campaign for a proportional voting system and for an elected second chamber in our parliament . Let 's have a constitutional convention – and take this conversation to the country . This could be the start of something truly cross-party , and genuinely exciting . If we can take anything from this referendum , it 's that the people want more of a voice .
Russian President Vladimir Putin , left , and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi visit the Black Sea Fleet 's missile cruiser Moskva in the seaport of Sochi on Aug. 12 , 2014 , during the Egyptian leader 's first official visit to Russia . ( Alexei Druzhin/Kremlin/Ria Novosti//AFP/Getty Images )
At a gathering of Arab leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh this weekend , Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi read a letter from Vladimir Putin . `` We support Arab nations in their effort to ensure a safe future and urge them to resolve all emerging challenges peacefully without any foreign involvement , '' the Russian president 's message read , according to Sputnik News .
These comments did not go down well with those in attendance . In particular , Saudi Arabia , which accused the Russian leader of hypocrisy . `` He speaks about the problems in the Middle East as though Russia is not influencing these problems , '' Prince Saud al-Faisal , the Saudi foreign minister , said immediately after the letter was read .
In the increasingly complicated web of alliances in the Middle East and farther afield , Faisal 's comments highlight a noteworthy split . Egypt and Saudi Arabia are important allies ; right now , they are partners in a joint Arab military intervention in Yemen , where Iran-backed Shiite rebels have toppled the government . And under the leadership of Sissi , Egypt has become increasingly close to Moscow and moved away from Washington .
But for Saudi Arabia – a stalwart U.S. ally and a powerful Sunni-led Arab state – relations with Russia have faced a distinct chill in the past few years . It 's an important fault line in a coalition formed by Sunni states to counter the influence of Iran , the region 's Shiite superpower – and it 's probably not the only one .
Saudi Arabia and Russia 's strained relationship
Historically , Saudi Arabia has always sided with Washington over Moscow . That relationship was cemented when President Franklin D. Roosevelt met the first Saudi king , Abdul Aziz ibn Saud , in 1945 as World War II ended . Meanwhile , Russia and Saudi Arabia had no diplomatic relationship after Joseph Stalin closed the Soviet Union 's embassy in Saudi Arabia in 1938 .
Diplomatic relations were restored after the Soviet Union collapsed , and in 2007 Putin became the first Russian leader to make an official visit to the Saudi kingdom . But in the past few years , Russia 's iron-clad political support for Bashar al-Assad 's regime through the Syrian conflict has led to a serious disagreement between the two nations .
The most obvious evidence of the conflict between the two nations may be oil prices . Many outside observers have suggested that Saudi Arabia could be using its power to flood the market with oil as a means of hurting the economy of Russia , another oil-producing giant , with the aim of loosening Moscow 's support for Assad . “ If oil can serve to bring peace in Syria , I do n't see how Saudi Arabia would back away from trying to reach a deal , ” one Saudi diplomat told the New York Times last month .
Putin himself sees a political factor behind the low oil prices , which experts say have hit Russia harder than economic sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies . `` A political component is always present in oil prices , ” Putin said in November . “ Furthermore , at some moments of crisis , it starts to feel like it is the politics that prevails in the pricing of energy resources . ”
There might be an interesting historical precedent here . During the nadir of relations between Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union in the late 1980s , some say the Saudis flooded the markets with cheap oil at the request of U.S. President Ronald Reagan . The veracity of that account has been questioned , but , if true , it would suggest that Saudi Arabia is willing to use its economic leverage for political ends – especially if the United States is on board .
Meanwhile , Egypt 's relationship with Russia is blossoming
Egypt has had a much longer relationship with Russia , with Russian czars supporting Orthodox Christians in Egypt as far back as the 16th century . The Soviet Union was a key backer of Gamal Abdel Nasser 's neutralist , anti-imperialist government , providing military and political support . As WorldViews wrote at the weekend , Nasser-led Egypt actually had its own intervention in Yemen in the 1960s – a Soviet-supported intervention so disastrous that it has been dubbed `` Egypt 's Vietnam . ''
After Nasser 's death , relations grew more strained , with Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak leading the country toward a more pro-Western stance . When Mubarak was overthrown in 2011 , things got more complicated . In 2012 , Mohamed Morsi was elected president of Egypt with the backing of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood . Then , a year later , Sissi ousted Morsi in what was widely called a coup and violently cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood .
Relations with the United States became tense , with the Obama administration halting a third of its military aid to Egypt and withholding delivery of military equipment . Egypt instead looked to alternative allies , and Russia – whose relationship with the West was just souring – was an obvious choice . Since then the kinship between Putin and Sissi has been made obvious in a couple of official visits .
Russia was n't just an economic lifeline for Egypt . As The Post 's Erin Cunningham noted , the way that the Kremlin had crushed its own Islamist uprising in Chechnya may have appealed to a newly nationalistic sentiment in Egypt . Conversely , Moscow 's handling of Islamic minorities is one of the many issues between Russia and Saudi Arabia .
When partners disagree
After this weekend , Saudi Arabia and Egypt have become two of the most important members of an Arab military force designed to intervene in neighboring states . The coalition is widely seen as a Sunni response to Shiite intervention across the Middle East , with Saudi Arabia leading the charge against Tehran 's international efforts .
However , the Sunni-Shiite split is just one of a number of factors this Arab force will have to consider . The alliances and rivalries in the Middle East currently have grown increasingly complicated – and increasingly dangerous . The threat posed to Arab governments by Sunni extremism is another big factor , and so are relationships with Russia and other outside powers .
Saudi Arabia has become a major financial backer for Egypt in recent years , and some have suggested that Sissi 's unbridled support for military action in Yemen stems from a sense of indebtedness . But Saudi Arabia is n't Egypt 's only ally , and Sissi may not be willing to give up his relationship with Putin just yet .

As an early member of the Senate Budget Committee , when a billion dollars was a very great deal of money , I find the current Congressional approach to the national budget baffling on several levels . At the center of the fiscal showdown is one element of one major party refusing to acknowledge and pay for United States government obligations until major health-care legislation , passed by Congressional majorities and signed by a duly elected president , is repealed .
Back in the relatively saner twentieth century , once a law was passed it generally stayed passed , at least until it was proved unworkable . Today , nothing is considered final . Everything is subject to recall , re-litigation , and challenge , including efforts to refuse to pay for programs enacted by the majority .
James Madison would not be amused . If anyone can find any precedent for the current Tea Party rejection of majority government in the Federalist papers , I 'd like to hear about it . It is one thing to observe and protect minority views and interests . It is quite another thing for a minority to refuse to acknowledge government by a majority of Americans .
But , of course , this is n't merely about the Affordable Care Act . It is about government itself and , essentially , whether we should have one . We all know the tug and pull between Federalists and Republicans in the founding era over governmental reach and power . To my knowledge , supported by a lifetime of research and writing , not one of the Founders disputed whether there should be a government .
Anarchism comes and goes in democratic societies ( see G.K. Chesterton 's The Man Who Was Thursday ) . But the neoanarchism prowling the halls of Congress these days is of a different color . How much government we want and how to pay for it is always on the table of American democratic debate , as it should be . But eliminating government by refusing to pay its legitimate debts is not debatable . It makes no political or economic sense and is the desperate tactic of a minority , which refuses to recognize the rights of a majority of their fellow citizens .
The closest anti-government forces have come to produce any fiscal blueprint , the Ryan budget , was never taken seriously by those who understand federal finance and mainstream priorities .
The largest majority of Americans has made it repeatedly clear that they do not choose to return to a Herbert Hoover , pre-New Deal , laissez faire society .
Many would argue there is a strong majority consensus that long-term restructuring of entitlement programs is required . Many would also argue—quite convincingly—that tax cuts for the top one percent of the wealthiest Americans are unsustainable . Clearly wars of choice fueled by dreams of “ regime change ” are not affordable . Many economists point out that a growing economy producing higher revenues will be the biggest contributor to debt reduction .
Sooner or later , hopefully sooner , Americans will clearly reject the obstructionists tactics of the minority and we will then return to majority government , where laws are passed and stay passed until their purpose is achieved , where those who do n't agree with majority consensus are required to put forward more plausible alternatives , and most of all where the national interest , not ideological or political sideshows , is preeminent .

New algorithm will quickly and accurately identify extremist content on Internet and social media platforms , including images , videos , and audio clips
( New York , NY ) — The Counter Extremism Project ( CEP ) announced today the development of a technological solution that will allow Internet and social media companies to quickly remove extremist content from their platforms , coming on the heels of President Obama 's remarks Tuesday that online extremist propaganda is pervasive and easily accessible . The application of this new technology will greatly reduce the ability of extremists and terrorists to weaponize online platforms to radicalize , recruit , and incite to violence .
“ If we seize this opportunity and have partners across the social media spectrum willing to fight the extremist threat by deploying this technology , extremists will find Internet and social media platforms far less available for their recruiting , fundraising , propagandizing , and calls to violence , ” said CEP Senior Advisor Dr. Hany Farid . “ It is no longer a matter of not having the technological ability to fight online extremism , it is a matter of the industry and private sector partners having the will to take action . ”
“ President Obama is correct , ISIS videos and postings on the Internet are much too pervasive and accessible . We have known this for a long time , and despite the good intentions of social media companies , the problem has only gotten worse , ” said CEP CEO Ambassador Mark D. Wallace . “ We believe we now have the tool to reverse this trend , which will significantly impact efforts to prevent radicalization and incitement to violence . The technology now exists to quickly and efficiently remove the most horrific examples of extremist content . We hope everyone will embrace its potential . ”
Dr. Farid , a Professor and Chair of Dartmouth College 's Computer Science Department , worked previously with Microsoft to develop photoDNA , a robust hashing software to combat child exploitation online . PhotoDNA can eliminate the redistribution of known child pornography by extracting a distinct digital signature from an image and comparing this signature against all images encountered online .
CEP developed new robust hashing technology to encompass video and audio , making it particularly impactful in combatting the widespread proliferation of extremist propaganda .
To operationalize this new technology to combat extremism , CEP proposes a National Office for Reporting Extremism ( NORex ) , which will house a comprehensive database of extremist content . The new tool will be able to immediately identify this content online and flag it for removal for any technology company utilizing the hashing algorithm .
Tech companies try to take down heinous content that violates their terms of service , but the process is manual and reactive , which hampers speed and effectiveness . CEP 's new technology will streamline and accelerate the process .
Since launching in 2014 , CEP has led a rigorous research and crowdsourcing online campaign , called # CEPDigitalDisruption , which is designed to identify , expose , and report extremist content on social media platforms . The development and application of this new technology is the logical next phase of CEP 's existing work to combat extremists ' online presence .
Insurance bureaus north and south of the border say Canadians who own property in U.S. areas hit by Irma need to get on the phone and learn whether their homes have been damaged .
In 2015 , the Bank of Montreal estimated that 500,000 Canadians owned property in Florida , parts of which were walloped by the hurricane Sunday and Monday .
Amanda Dean , vice-president Atlantic of the Insurance Bureau of Canada , said it may be too soon to travel to the region , but it 's not too soon to contact your insurance company .
`` The last thing you want to do is get in the way of first responders , '' she said .
Both the Insurance Bureau of Canada and the American Insurance Association have tips for what property owners should do in the days ahead .
Call your caretaker
Whether it 's a caretaker , property manager or neighbour , ask someone who is already in the area to visit your property as soon as it is safe to do so .
`` Have them take some photographs in the wake of a storm , so they can give you an idea of whether your house is generally in good shape or if you need to make a claim , '' said Mike O'Malley of the American Insurance Association .
Contact your insurance provider
Both Dean and O'Malley said it 's important to be clear with the insurance provider that you are not in the country , and ask specifically what steps they need you to take .
O'Malley said emergency adjusters will be sent to the area to help sort through the thousands of claims and they will want to visit the property . You do n't have to be there to move ahead with the process .
`` Most policies are going to require you to report as soon as reasonably possible , '' said O'Malley . `` You need to have somebody with keys to your house down there . They 're not going to break into your house to see interior damage . ''

Clarify your coverage
In the United States , hurricanes fall under two different plans for homeowners .
Most plans generally cover damage from wind . But storm surge is covered by a secondary policy sold by the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
Make sure you are in contact with the appropriate insurers if you have different policies .
`` Get that claims process started as quickly as possible , '' said Dean .
Hire someone to fix immediate issues
It 's your responsibility to do any quick fixes , such as cover a hole in the roof .
`` A homeowner 's insurance policy generally has some duties that are placed upon the policyholder upon the event of a loss , '' said O'Malley .
`` If you have damage to your property , it is your duty to make sure that if there are things you can do … that would prevent further damage to the property . You have a duty to do those things . ''
Plan for next time
If you were one of the fortunate ones who did n't experience any damage , this is a good chance to review policies and plan ahead .
Call your insurance company and ask direct questions about scenarios to make sure you 'll be covered the next time a storm hits . Snap a few photos on your phone to keep on hand if you experience any kind of damage .
`` You really need two different policies , especially if you 're in a flood-prone area if you have storm surge , '' said O'Malley , who suggests calling soon so `` you would n't be faced with the unfortunate prospect of trying to figure that out after the fact . ''

The above mentioned text is a part of Rockstar 's attempt at cleaning the internet , which might ruin a players gaming experience .

Those who ca n't get enough Trump books have some good news to celebrate — another one is in the works . This one , however , comes not from the presumptive Republican nominee , but from his daughter Ivanka , the Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development for the Trump Organization and founder of the Ivanka Trump brand .
The book , Women Who Work : Rewriting the Rules of Success , will be published next spring . In a video announcement , she refers to the book as a “ labor of love , ” one that sets out a vision for working women and teaches them how to achieve work-life balance .
“ Today 's generation of working women is the first to be able to unabashedly embrace the fact that our lives are multidimensional , ” she said in a statement . “ We 're deeply invested in our careers , but they do n't solely define us . For us , it 's about working smarter , not harder ; integrating our personal passions and priorities with our professional goals in order to architect lives we love . ”
The book is named after the Ivanka Trump brand 's signature initiative , whose official website gives working women pointers on a multitude of topics , from tips on wearing spring prints to the office to how to craft a last will and testament . It also features contributions from high-powered female entrepreneurs and executives .
It 's her second foray into the literary world , with the book The Trump Card : Playing to Win in Work and Life , published in 2009 . That self-help book received a respectful review from the Publisher 's Weekly , saying “ she owns her privilege , acknowledges her advantages and then sets about disabusing readers of their presumptions with intelligent , well-conceived , positive advice . ”
What does this mean for Donald ?
It certainly ca n't hurt for the Trump name to be associated with the promotion of working women . Despite The Donald 's claim that he “ was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women , ” the public perception of him as a champion of women 's rights is not widespread . In fact , one could say that his reputation among women in general is in critical condition , thanks to multiple incidents that have taken place over the years , including most recently his on-again , off-again feud with Megyn Kelly .
According to a recent analysis conducted by the Boston Globe , women on his campaign staff are paid one third less than the men , while the campaign of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pays its male and female staffers equally . It all adds up to a presidential candidate whose unfavorable rating with women is 70 % , according to a poll conducted by the Gallup organization .
Time will tell whether this will have any effect on votes cast in November , but right now it 's a good thing for the Trump brand to have a highly placed woman in the family organization , particularly one whose poised , disciplined demeanor contrasts sharply with that of her somewhat less polished father .
“ She carefully considers her words when she speaks ; she 's measured and thoughtful , ” environmental planner Suzanne Hill told the Chicago Tribune after meeting with Ivanka to discuss a hotel project in Washington , D.C. “ She is very different from her father . ”
Not just the boss 's daughter
It 's tempting to characterize Ivanka as a little rich girl with a cushy , inconsequential job at daddy 's company , but it simply is n't the case . In fact , that 's a talking point that she 's been squashing like a mosquito for years , through her words and actions .
“ If people think I 'm just the boss 's daughter , they 're deceived , ” she told the New York Times in 2007 . At the time , the then-26-year-old 's resumé included appearances alongside her father on his reality show , “ The Apprentice , ” modeling for magazine covers and fashion shows and , of course , real estate development . That would have been enough for a lot of people , but she was just getting started .
In 2007 , she founded the Ivanka Trump brand and launched Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry , whose target demographic is professional , self-made women who like to treat themselves , not just the men who like to buy them gifts . Next she founded her eponymous fashion label , whose look is professional and appropriate for the office , without ever losing its panache .
The 34-year-old mother of three has since grown her brand into what it is today . According to its official website , it 's “ a lifestyle concept dedicated to women who work , ” and it 's easy to see that she 's in the process of methodically building it into something of her own .
The struggle is real
Ivanka Trump is not alone among those who have taken the Martha Stewart route to found their own lifestyle brands . However , those waters can be choppy , even for the most poised and articulate . In April , the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced that 20,000 Ivanka Trump-branded scarves would be recalled for violating the U.S. Federal Flammability Standard .
Worse yet , the scarves had been manufactured in China , the country that her father has characterized in less than flattering terms in his stump speeches . But hey , as the currently beleaguered Honest Company 's Jessica Alba can tell you , even the success stories have their share of bumps in the road .
Time will tell if Ivanka Trump has what it takes to take the Trump name and transform into one that appeals to women , minorities and millennials . After all , Dad 's not getting any younger , and someone will have to navigate the 21st century 's emerging markets when the time comes . And who knows ? If her father is elected president in November , she 's been rumored to be the one who will run the Trump Organization while he 's in the Oval Office .
Whatever happens , she 's uniquely positioned to carry the Trump name into the future , long after the 2016 election is a memory .

A coalition of gun owners and gun rights groups are suing the governor of Connecticut and other state officials , contending that sweeping gun control laws passed in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary school are unconstitutional .
The new gun legislation , among the strictest in the country , requires universal background checks on all gun purchases , broadens the state 's ban on assault weapons and expands the list of banned weapons , including the Bushmaster AR-15 , the semi-automatic weapon used in the Sandy Hook killings .
It also prohibits the sale and purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds . The state will also create a dangerous weapon offender registry and has implemented new registration procedures for people who already own large-capacity magazines and semiautomatic assault weapons .
“ We feel that the law that was passed by the Connecticut State Legislature and then signed into law by Gov . [ Dannel ] Malloy is unconstitutional and we seek to have the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution supersede the law that was passed , ” said Scott Wilson , president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League , a 7,600-member gun rights group , which is part of the suit .
When Wilson was 14 years old , he was accidentally shot by a friend of the family who was showing off his father 's handgun . The bullet struck him in the neck and then twisted through an artery until it lodged against his spine . He survived , but doctors said he nearly bled to death that day . And it took more than a year of painful rehab to regain his strength and to regain full use of his right arm .
“ At the end of the day I never heard anyone say that they blamed the gun or that they hate guns , ” Wilson told msnbc .
The plaintiffs in the suit filed on Wednesday are an intentionally if not unusually motley bunch . The group includes gun rights groups and gun sellers ; an 80-year-old widow from a rural part of the state ; a former Navy SEAL with Multiple Sclerosis ; a woman who lost an arm to cancer ; a rabbi whose synagogue was broken into .
“ We wanted to find plaintiffs that exemplified the very different ways that this law is going to have a negative impact , ” Brian Stapleton , the lead attorney for the plaintiffs , told msnbc . “ We also wanted to find people from different walks of life to put as varied a face on our plaintiffs as we could . I think there 's a misconception that gun owners are a certain kind of person , and that 's not true . ”
The state legislature passed the Connecticut law about 100 days after the mass killing in Newtown . Family members of the victims , gun control groups and lawmakers rallied to push through the legislation , fueled largely by the emotional surge and wide appeal for firearms restrictions in the aftermath of the shooting . Gun control advocates vowed to craft some of the toughest gun laws in the country , and succeeded in a bi-partisan effort
In addition to banning particular weapons , the legislation calls for $ 15 million to be allocated for school safety and mental health programs .
“ Nobody will be able to say that this bill is absolutely perfect , but no one will also be able to say that this bill fails the test when it comes to being the strongest in the country and the most comprehensive bill in the country , ” Don Williams , president of the state 's Senate Democrats .
Provisions of the new law unfairly impact “ women , the elderly , and anyone of a smaller physical stature–individuals who typically lack the strength to operate older style , heavier , or difficult to use firearms and yet who need to be able to protect themselves in challenging home-invasion and other self-defense situations , ” the Connecticut Citizens Defense League argued in a statement .

Last month , Disabled Americans for Firearms Rights filed what was the first lawsuit against Gov . Malloy challenging the new laws . “ The AR-15 , due to its ease of handling , low recoil , adjustable features and customizability , is particularly suited to disabled persons in order to engage in lawful use of firearms , ” the group said in a statement .
This week 's lawsuit , filed in the U.S. District Court in Bridgeport , accuses the legislature of rushing through the legislation without thorough examination or public hearings .
“ The act irrationally bans pistols , rifles , shotguns , and magazines that are commonly used for lawful purposes by countless law-abiding citizens in Connecticut and throughout the United States . The act violates plaintiffs ' fundamental rights under the Second Amendment and is unconstitutional , ” the suit reads .
Opponents of the new laws say the rush to ban weapons in the wake of recent tragedy is not only unconstitutional but impractical . Wilson said the state has blood on its hands , and blames it for “ leaving people unarmed and unprotected . ”
“ I think everyone , gun owners and non-gun owners alike in Connecticut were really affected by the tragedy in Newtown . Sometimes people forget that just because you own guns and that 's a primary weapon of choice for mass murderers , we somehow must be oblivious or blind to what the family and the loved ones went through , ” Wilson said . “ It 's not lost on us . ”
The legal pushback in Connecticut is part of a larger wave of reforms in the states , both for the expansion of gun rights and for further gun control , born in the wake of the Sandy Hook killings .
Related : In the South , a love of guns and a loss of life
And as federal gun control efforts have largely failed in Washington , D.C. , states including Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland and New York have recently passed some of the strictest new gun laws in the country . A handful of other state legislatures , mostly in the South and Midwest , including those in Louisiana , Kansas and Missouri , have introduced legislation that would loosen firearms restrictions .
“ The community of shooting enthusiasts , of gun owners , of law enforcement personnel , military persons , these individuals and these groups are outraged by this law , ” said Stapleton , the lawyer . “ Now , to be certain , Sandy Hook was a terrible tragedy , and it was an awful awful thing and everyone agrees to that , but this reaction to Sandy Hook is not the way to solve the problem that Sandy Hook presents… I do n't know how you prevent a madman from going out and killing someone . I do n't know how you can prevent that . ”
The wooden vessel drifted upon the glassy stillness , suspended above and below twinkling stars . They brought no comfort , and served no guide . Only creaking timbers broke the silence.Eyes stared unto the horizon , as if by force of will another could be seen . Months had passed without sign . Still she searched , each night digging its talons further into her bones.The crew still served as in mourning , following her ever-more desperate orders . She had heard whispers , though nopony would have directed them to her face . Whispers of madness . Of a futile quest . Shushed as she entered the galley , their eyes avoiding contact.She took her meals alone in their cabin , now . Where the whispers would n't reach her . Where she could see the candy locket and bloodshot eyes staring back from the mirror . Even they were filled with accusation , with reflection . She should not have sent them on a foolish errand , should have gone instead , should have overruled her protests , should have listened . And now there was nothing to listen to save her ragged breathing and the creaking timbers.She started at hoof-falls on the deck , the night-watch making its rounds . With a sigh , she tore herself from the mirror . Oneiros eluded her again . She found the patrol and bid them goodnight . At the very least , another would find peace.Another night at the wooden railing , another silence alone with her thoughts . The black waters against the hull refused to claim her , and Thanatos turned his back . The moonlight poured upon her , the deck spry as a stage . She looked down at her flank , old and worn . The dancing lights and red carpet were so long ago ; what she would n't give to see her smile again . With a gentle probe from her horn , the instrument floated forth from her cabin into waiting hooves . She tested the strings , and they responded true.Melody glided among the rigging , danced along the masts , filled her sails . These were the notes she remembered , formerly played for crowds of thousands . Or one . Now simply her , the stars , and the creaking timbers.Softly at first , her timbered voice joined the strings as she wailed her frustration into the night . The still waters suffered this offering , carrying to the ends of the rose . The music was her constant companion , and had n't left , even now . But with no audience to feed , no smile to find , and no hope at the end , where could it go ? There was no home without her , and the fire 's will all but deplete . In desperation she clutched at the lyre , its strings snapping as the tears began to fall.What is a captain without her first mate ? What is music with no-one to play for ?

What Is Storm The Gate ?
Storm the Gate is a high-quality tabletop dexterity game . It is handcrafted locally from solid woods .
An Ode To Unfortunate Felines
In medieval times , townsfolk enjoyed a game in which tokens were launched back and forth in a furious attempt to rid their side of all pieces . Unfortunately , no bungee cords or rubber bands existed during this period , so creative measures had to be taken to find a suitable instrument with which to launch the tokens . This suitable instrument was found in the form of ...
Cat intestines .
The cat intestines , when wet , would provide the elastic spring that the townsfolk needed to propel the tokens toward their opponent .
Thankfully , Storm the Gate takes a much gentler approach . We 've modified the design , dimensions , rules , and , luckily for kitties everywhere , we do not require any organs .
How Is It Played ?
We suggest watching the video above first , as it demonstrates the overall concept of the gameplay nicely .
Storm the Gate is a two-person game , with each player sitting at opposite ends of the board . Each player begins with 8 tokens on their side .
The object of the game is to get rid of all tokens on your side of the board ( your camp ) by shooting them onto your opponent 's side ( opponent 's camp ) through the gate in the center of the board . This is accomplished by pulling the tokens against the cord in your camp and releasing .
Once a player no longer has any tokens in their camp , the game is over .
However , this is just a portion of the rules . There will be many twists and additional gameplay options revealed as the project develops .
Special thanks to Revolve who provided us with a dolly to shoot our video .
Who Is This For ?
Everyone . Since putting together the first prototype of Storm the Gate , we 've had countless friends , family members , coworkers , and strangers test it . Their responses have been unanimous - they absolutely love it .
We believe that Storm the Gate brings a charm that immediately intrigues anyone who sits down and plays for a minute or two .
What Are The Funds For ?
We will be using the $ 6,000 to purchase the tools and equipment needed to allow us to mass produce Storm the Gate . The funds will also go toward completing the artwork that will be included in the rulebook , as well as purchasing the materials for the game .
You can see the rewards we 've put together below or on the right :
Stretch Goals
While we are already overwhelmed at the support you Stormers have shown us , we can bring you all even more awesome rewards if we are able to push past our primary goal of $ 6,000 . Below are some stretch goals we 've set - as we reach each of the funding goals , the reward will be unlocked for all backers who have pledged $ 59 and above .
The expansions add new gameplay modes on top of the traditional battle mode by including additional ( styled ) tokens that come with a new set of rules . They 're basically two more reasons to never stop playing STG .
The iPad/iPhone app is currently being developed by a professional app developer , and will be a virtual incarnation of STG ( for those times when you ca n't fit the standard game in your pocket ) .
Where Are We In The Process ?
For the past six months , we have been prototyping to make sure that the final version of Storm the Gate is just right . We 've tested different measurements , materials , wood species , and wood stains , and are confident that the result is the best product possible .
Now that we are out of the prototyping stage , we are in the midst of the artwork and packaging design phase . We have hired on a local artist to create the artwork that will be present in the rulebook of Storm the Gate , and are currently working with local printers in preparation for the official packaging .
We will be releasing more artwork throughout the duration of the project , but here 's a small sneak peek into some of the Storm the Gate characters ...
A majority of the artwork has now been completed , which means that the next step is to begin mass producing Storm the Gate so that we can get it into your hands . That 's where we 're asking for your help .
When Will Storm The Gate Begin Shipping ?
If all goes according to plan , we are looking at a ship date of early May . The moment we are fully funded , we will be ramping up production to ensure that rewards are sent out as quickly as possibly . We 're just about as excited as anyone could be to begin shipping these out !

Journalists . Bless their hearts . As a rule of thumb , any time we read a news story about a subject or incident we already know a lot about , it turns out that about 25 % of what 's reported is simply wrong .
This is why knowledgeable gun owners distrust many news stories involving guns : because too many “ journalists ” display an ignorance of firearms that would be laughable if it were n't so appalling . If they ca n't get their facts straight about gun technology and shooting , then we do n't trust them on much else .
For over 24 years as a patent attorney , I 've taken pride in my ability to explain stuff effectively . I 'm known as “ The Firearms Patent Attorney ” because I represent more firearms companies than any other patent attorney or law firm in the world ( by a wide margin ) . That means I spend lots of time explaining how guns work . And I have to keep it simple because I 'm not just writing for specialized patent examiners , but for juries and judges , in case there 's ever a lawsuit .
The best compliment I ever get from inventors about a patent application is “ Wow ! You really understand my invention ! ” So maybe if I 'm good at making gun tech understandable , I might be the right guy to help out the technically-illiterate journalists . Here we go :
Lesson # 1 : They 're “ Cartridges , ” Not Bullets
Bullets are little lumps of lead . Inert , harmless little pieces of soft metal . They 're a component of ammunition , but they 're not ammunition .
What you journalists are almost always talking about when you mistakenly use the term “ bullet ” is “ cartridge . ”
Cartridges ( or “ rounds ” ) are little units of ammunition that go “ bang ” when they 're hit just right . The gunpowder burns , the bullet flies away , and the case stays behind with the gun .
Here are some correct ( ed ) usage examples :
“ … a bill to limit magazine capacity to 10 bullets rounds… ”
“ …a bill to limit purchasers to no more than 50 bullets cartridges per day… ”
“ …bullets have been recovered as far as a mile from the rifle range… ”
One classic example of how this issue can confuse the ignorant is the case when a neighbor objecting to a gun range nearby “ salted ” her home 's roof gutters with a few “ bullets ” to make it appear that they were unsafely escaping the disputed range . She foolishly had tossed live cartridges onto the roof to roll into the gutters , and the responding deputy Sheriff rolled his eyes , knowing the guns do n't expel live rounds of ammunition .
Michael Bloomberg 's well-funded anti-gun “ Every Town for Gun Safety ” group created a laughable propaganda image showing a rifle cartridge shooting out of the muzzle of a gun barrel . '
Lesson # 2 : They 're “ Magazines , ” Not Clips
When you journalists write about “ clips ” you 're always wrong . Always .
Magazines are containers that hold a bunch of cartridges , and are inserted into a gun to load it all at once , making reloading quick . Unless a gun looks like an old-time cowboy or a bird-hunter might use it , it probably has a magazine . A magazine itself is just a little sheet metal or plastic box with a spring insode ( much like a Pez dispenser ) , and presents no danger of any kind . For pistols , they 're contained entirely in the grip , and for rifles , they usually stick out below the bottom , in front of the trigger .
If you 're curious , “ clips ” are archaic devices known only to gun enthusiasts , and are essentially never used by modern police or military , or by people who use guns for self-defense or sport . They 're used with old-style military rifles ( like the WWII “ Garand ” they carried in Saving Private Ryan ) .
If you must know , clips are for loading rifles that do n't take magazines . They 're little strips of metal that hold a set of cartridges by their rear ends so they can be shoved into the rifle all at once . But they never come up in the news , so you can simply delete the word from your journalist dictionary . I can assure you that over all my years in the gun industry , I 've never heard anyone use “ clip ” as slang for magazine . Maybe Hollywood gangsters and anti-gun reporters still do , but no one else does .
Incidentally , worrying about large magazines giving criminals firepower is pretty silly , because the whole point of magazines is how quick and easy it is to change them . I 've seen live demos in which a shooter changed pistol magazines so fast it was a blur . And rifle magazines can be changed almost as fast with a little practice .
So , if you 're writing a story that involves magazines and are still confused , my advice to journalists is to drop by any gun shop and tell the guy behind the counter that you 're working on a story , and would like to see how magazines work . Trust me , you 'll learn all you need to know .
Lesson # 3 : Calibrating Your “ Caliber ”
This one confused me back when I started learning about guns . All you need to know is that caliber usually refers to the diameter of the bullet ( and of the barrel of the gun that fires it ) .
There 's no clear rule , so do n't even bother trying to explain it . If a cop tells you the caliber of a gun used in a crime , just report it , and we 'll know what it means even if you do n't .
The cartridge designation will give you a good idea of the caliber , but can lead to confusion . 357 Magnum has a 0.357 inch diameter bullet . But so does a 38 Special . A kid 's 22 squirrel rifle has the same bullet diameter as the M16 military rifle but they 're otherwise different in almost every other respect .
Incidentally , there 's no such thing as a “ high caliber ” anything . Those are meaningless words used by anti-gun writers to make some gun sound fearsome . Same for “ high power. ” That M16 and the AR-15 fire the same round , but they 're anything but high powered . The cartridge they fire is considered borderline weak and inhumane for a thin skinned little deer , and is actually less powerful than just about every other cartridge used by ordinary hunters . Those 22 caliber bullets are much smaller caliber than 30 caliber ( 0.300 inch diameter ) hunting bullets . They 're way smaller than the 50 caliber ( half inch ) bullets used in hotdog-sized cartridges that cost $ 5 a pop , and are used on those big belt fed machine guns on aircraft and by wealthy target shooters ( who Dianne Feinstein worries are practicing to shoot through her armored limousine ) .
Lessons # 4-11 : Random Thoughts You Need to Know About Guns
# 4 . Guns are n't required to be “ registered ” in most jurisdictions . Please do n't write that a gun was “ unregistered ” if there is no law requiring it to be . To those of us who know ( there are lots of us ) an “ unregistered gun ” sounds as absurd as an “ unregistered baseball bat . ”
# 5 . No self-respecting gun owner uses the phrase “ packing heat. ” It 's called “ carrying ” , whether concealed or open . “ Packing heat ” is old-time gangster slang with biased connotations . Avoid it unless you 're writing an anti-gun op-ed or a bad detective novel .
# 6 . Machine guns are legal ( under federal law , and in most states ) . To buy one , a person must pay a $ 200 tax , undergo a background check , and wait maybe a year or more for the paperwork to process . But only a limited number of specially registered ones may be bought and sold by people . These are all older than 1986 and there are so few that what should cost $ 1000 new in a free market costs $ 10,000 or more . ( There 's something like 1 legal machine gun per 1000 adult American males ) . That means that they 're only for wealthy collectors like Steven Spielberg , which explains why they are n't used in crimes . Ever .
# 7 . Silencers are legal in most states . They 're properly called “ suppressors ” and we also use the slang term “ can. ” “ Silencer ” is OK to write , but it bothers a few gun geeks because they do n't make a gun literally silent ( maybe as annoyingly loud as an air nailer – not the “ phffft ” or “ ptew ” of Hollywood movies ) . In Hollywood , only bad guys use them . In reality , it 's only good guys who passed a background check and paid a $ 200 tax just to make their guns a little easier on everyone 's ears .
# 8 . Sinister gun collections . When you 're reporting on some backwoods kook who was raided by a SWAT team , remember that all those guns and ammo you 're breathlessly reporting on are probably perfectly legal . The cops know that , but they know you 'll ignorantly imply that there 's something illegal about all the guns and ammo they 've laid out on the table for you to photograph for the evening news . It 's actually quite normal for upstanding gun enthusiasts and hunters to own dozens of firearms ( or to wish they did ) . It deceives your readers and amuses gun enthusiasts when we read that “ the arsenal included over 1000 rounds of ammunition. ” That 's because when we spend a weekend taking a shooting course , or just out having fun shooting at targets , we can easily shoot 1000 rounds ( no it 's not a cheap hobby ) . 5000 rounds might sounds like a lot , but that much 22 ammo can easily be hand carried in a shoe box by a strong boy .
Also , a personal gun and ammo collection is n't an “ arsenal ” unless you 're trying to demonize the owner , and strike fear in the hearts of your readers . It 's an “ ample collection , ” and for most gun owners , never ample enough .
# 9 . Ammunition in a burning building is no danger to firefighters . When the powder burns , the case just pops off the bullet . Firefighters with heavy suits and eye protection are in no danger . An excellent online video by SAAMI ( one of my clients , and the organization that sets technical standards for ammunition ) titled “ Sporting Ammunition and the firefighter ” shows how surprisingly safe ammunition is in a fire and subject to other extreme stresses ( and it 's cool to watch truckloads of ammo get shot up and burn up ! )
# 10 . An “ assault rifle ” is a military rifle that can shoot full auto .
“ Semi-automatic ” means that a single shot is fired for each trigger pull , and the gun automatically loads the next round . Most pistols carried by police officers are semi-automatic .
An “ assault weapon ” is a term made up by people trying to ban semiautomatic rifles , by falsely implying that they 're full-auto assault rifles .
“ Modern Sporting Rifle ” is the industry standard term for the popular AR-15 and similar rifles with a military appearance . I prefer “ Sport Utility Rifle . ”
# 11 . The NRA is n't the “ gun industry lobby. ” They may have millions of individual members whose interests they represent when lobbying lawmakers and pursuing civil rights lawsuits . But the real “ gun lobby ” is the National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) that represents all the gun companies ( I 'm their trademark attorney , too ) . The NSSF has the mission : “ To promote , protect and preserve hunting and the shooting sports. ” They also publish an excellent booket that not only educates journalists , but is a goldmine for gun enthusiasts looking to sharpen their firearms knowledge .
So , that 's about all a journalist who 's seeking to report the facts clearly and accurately needs to know about guns . However , if they 're looking to “ change the world ” like a bunch of “ community organizers ” then this might not do much good .

OTTAWA—A room devoted to the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike will be excluded from the renovated Canadian Museum of History , but officials promise the labour movement will still have a home in its halls . According to a document obtained by the Star in response to access to information request , the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau , Que. , saw there were few risks surrounding the decision to shut down the exhibit .
The Labour Temple at the Canadian Museum of History was modelled on the main meeting room of the James St. Labour Temple in Winnipeg , which was an important meeting place for workers leading up to the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike . ( Canadian Museum of History )
“ Changes can be made to the module with few political or institutional risks , ” reads the summary of a draft renovation risk assessment , revised Aug. 22 , 2014 . “ Some comments by academics cite the closure as evidence of the museum 's lack of interest in working class history . . . . The removal of this module represents minimal risk to the museum , though it will entail communications challenges to the academic community , ” says the document . The exhibit , which opened in 1999 , was modelled after a meeting room in the Labour Temple on James St. in Winnipeg , where union members met to debate , organize and vote in the months leading up to , and during , the massive strike .

It was included in a recreated prairie-town streetscape — also featuring a print shop , a Chinese hand laundry and a reassembled Ukrainian Catholic church — in the main permanent exhibition space at the museum that has since been dismantled to make way for the new Canadian History Hall , which is scheduled to open July 1 , 2017 . The Canadian Museum of History has come under public scrutiny in the past couple of years , following a controversial change in name — it was formerly known as the Canadian Museum of Civilization — and mandate that had critics accusing the Conservative government of using the Crown Corporation to rewrite history in its image . The museum is clearly sensitive to suggestions of political interference and rejected any notion that the disappearance of the Labour Temple is connected to how the Conservatives feel about organized labour . “ Government is certainly not telling us what to put into the hall . Nor do they know what we are putting into the hall . We are not reporting to them and they are not telling us what to do . There is a very high level of cynicism and paranoia out there , ” said David Morrison , the director of research and content for the Canadian History Hall project . The Canadian Labour Congress , which has not yet been consulted about the changes , expressed concern and called on the museum to include the history of organized labour in its future plans .
“ What is critical for the curators of the museum to recognize is this is an important aspect of Canada and the development of Canada , ” Hassan Yussuf , president of the Congress , said by telephone Thursday . “ If they did n't adequately design the room to allow traffic to appreciate the contribution of workers in this country , then this is an opportunity to fix that — not get rid of it , by the way . Quite the opposite , ” said Yussuf , who added the Canadian Labour Congress had not been consulted on any of the changes .

New Democrat MP Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre ) was disappointed to learn the room no longer exists . “ The old James St. Labour Temple was torn down in the ( 1960s ) to make room for a new city hall so this is the last and only tribute to the historic role it played in the history of Canadian working people and the quality of life we enjoy today , ” said Martin . Martin said the exhibit was created using a photograph that belonged to the Manitoba Carpenter 's Union , where he was a business manager at the time , so he feels connected to it personally . “ I would be very concerned if they 're trying to minimize or downplay the contribution that unions have made in our social history and development and I 'd be disappointed and I would be very upset if they trivialize it or minimize it in any way , ” said Martin . The new hall is still in the planning stages , but Chantal Schryer , vice-president of corporate affairs at the museum , said labour history will be included in it . “ Although we have not completed the selection of content yet , we know that the history of the labour movement in Canada and the Winnipeg General Strike will be highlighted in the new exhibition , ” Schryer wrote in an email Friday , adding the virtual version of the exhibit will remain on the museum website . Morrison noted the entire streetscape that the Labour Temple was part of has been dismantled and that the union exhibit was never one of the most popular destinations in the old hall . “ It got very poor attendance figures and whenever we did surveys of how well it was doing , it tended to rank towards the bottom in terms of visitor appreciation for what was happening , ” Morrison said in an interview at the museum Thursday .

The latest Sons of Norway magazine Viking had a very nice article about Norwegian bunads . One thing I found interesting was that it said it is fine for someone to wear a bunad from any region , even if they do not have ancestors or family tied to that particular region . I think it 's a little odd to wear a bunad from a region to which you have no connection , but if it does n't bother Norwegians in Norway then it certainly does n't bother me . However , while this might be fine for Norwegian bunads , I do not feel it 's true of all cultural clothing .
A very significant part of my identity is being Norwegian ; almost all of my ancestry comes from Norway . Then in 2014 I learned I am also Sámi . Like many descendants of Sámi immigrants , I did n't know this until I went looking for it . That is because many Sámi who came here decided to leave that identity behind . They are a colonized minority , and of all the countries that colonized the Sámi ( Norway , Sweden , Finland , and Russia ) , the process of Norwegianization was the harshest . Children were forced into residential schools ; lands and basic rights were stripped ; they were marginalized , disenfranchised , and exploited ; their language and music were banned . In some Norwegian churches , joiking is still banned . The Sámi women 's hats were banned in some places by the church ; in others wearing the gákti made Sámi a target for abuse . It has a very different history than the bunad and that is why I feel it needs to be treated with as much respect as the bunad , and more . Many Sámi have literally risked their lives to wear it .
The Sámi fought hard for recognition of their rights , lands , language , and culture . It is an ongoing struggle . The gákti is as much a representation of Sámi culture , faith , and region , sometimes all the way down to specific family , as a bunad is to a region of Norway . Every part of a gákti has meaning : the color of the fabric , the colors of the stripes , the ribbons and what order they go in , the shape and colors of the hats , the colors and designs of the leg bands , which are not just for decoration but have a very practical purpose ; all of this has meaning . Cheap knock-offs of gákti in Finland sold to unwitting tourists are a real problem . Imposters profiting off something sacred are costing business from actual Sámi duodjar and craftsmen . Cultural appropriation is real , it is insulting , and it is harmful .
People ask me for patterns for Sámi hats because they think they 're cute or for the dresses because they like the way the skirts twirl . Even if I had those patterns to give , I would not give them . I feel it is absolutely not my place to do so . Most Americans of Sámi descent have a difficult time not only finding photos or records of specifics about their Sámi ancestors but also figuring out which gákti our ancestors wore , and for many of us it is something we feel we must know more about before we would presume to wear one . Many of us would n't wear it even then because we feel it is something that must be earned . These items are sacred , and although many Sámi wear their gákti more often than Norwegians wear bunads , gákti are no less significant in meaning or in cost . The financial cost of a gákti easily matches that of a bunad . The personal cost of wearing one is often greater still .
I truly understand that those who asked for patterns or items did n't mean to be disrespectful , but I feel the lack of trying to learn about the history or meaning of what it is they want to wear is disrespectful . I know individuals who are not Sámi but were given gákti or other meaningful items by Sámi , and that 's different . That 's wonderful . I love it when people ask me questions and are curious about the Sámi ; I love sharing as much as I can . I love learning from others . I love that people like the look of the Sámi and are curious about both the Sámi in Sápmi and those like me who are learning where and who we came from . I feel there is a huge difference between someone who is coming to the culture and learning about it and someone who was raised in it and lives with both the honor and the struggle of what it means to be Sámi . It is not my place to be handing out designs , which are so personal .
The gákti and Sámi clothing are not a costume . They are an integral part of a cultural identity and should be worn only by those who understand and appreciate them .

A celebratory atmosphere floated over miSci in Schenectady Wednesday morning , as local officials and museum leaders gathered to celebrate Neil and Jane Golub .
Surrounded by a small crowd and standing in a steady drizzle , the Golubs made their way to the welcome sign at the miSci entrance that now bears their names .
“ This museum would not exist if not for the Golubs , ” said Sen. Hugh Farley , R-Schenectady .
The Golubs were recognized for their years of contributions to the museum . Many leaders at Wednesday 's event credited the Golubs with the museum 's resurgence in recent years and helping to turn it into a regional attraction .
The event took place amid rumors that Price Chopper , which is owned by the Golub Corp. , might be sold to an Idaho-based grocery holding company , though Neil Golub downplayed reports of the deal after the ceremony .
[ Report : Albertsons in talks to buy Price Chopper ]
Neil and Jane Golub 's financial support helped the museum transition from the Schenectady Museum to miSci , with a focus on technology , science and innovation .
Jane has served on the miSci board for more than 14 years , including a term as co-president . She also led fundraising efforts as a member of the museum 's Gala Committee .
Neil , who is chairman of the Golub Corp. , spearheaded a fundraising drive that led to the installation of miSci 's Challenger Learning Center , which opened in 2015 . He also helped establish the partnership between miSci and the San Francisco Exploratorium , which brought several hands-on exhibits to Schenectady .
Wednesday 's event culminated with the unveiling of new signage at the building 's entrance . Under the miSci logo , the words “ ... as envisioned by Neil & Jane Golub ” have been bolted to the brick facade .
“ Once a teacher , always a teacher , ” said Jane Golub , who added that she enjoys seeing the reaction on kids ' faces when they come into the museum and see something new . Golub taught in the Niskayuna Central School District for more than 20 years .
“ What we tried to do is to bring focus and bring some attention to detail about what are the possibilities , ” Neil Golub said .
Tony Farah , chairman of miSci 's board , said the increase in annual visitors over the past five years is evidence the Golubs ' investments have paid off . In 2011 , 30,000 people visited the museum , Farah said . So far this year , about 100,000 have visited .
In recent years , miSci has become a destination for surrounding communities , as well , Farah said .
Neil Golub said the museum 's revitalization paralleled the resurgence of Schenectady itself .
“ You look at the number of people who have come through this museum ; it 's gone from a few thousand to a hundred thousand , ” he said . “ That says a lot about what miSci has meant to the community . ”

A handful of Minnesota state lawmakers joined activists for a cross-border liquor run in protest of a state law banning alcohol sales on Sundays .
State Sen. Dave Osmek was one of the lawmakers who joined liquor store owners and beer advocates in the caravan some 20 miles from the capitol in St. Paul to Hudson , Wisconsin . `` I am tired of sending our tax revenue and our commerce every Sunday to Wisconsin , '' Osmek said , according to NBC station KARE in Minneapolis-St. Paul .
About 50 people made the trek , hoping to draw attention to legislative efforts to repeal Minnesota 's so-called `` blue law , '' which has been on the books for 80 years . Restaurants , hotels and bowling alleys are exempt from the law , because they sell for consumption on site .
Some vehicles that made the drive displayed flags depicting the state of Wisconsin saying , `` Thanks , Minnesota ! See you next Sunday ! ''

Editor 's note : Kelly Askin is senior legal officer for international justice at the human rights organization Open Society Justice Initiative . She is an expert on war crimes against women , served as a legal advisor to the judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda from 2000-2002 and has also worked on post conflict justice in Congo , East Timor and Sierra Leone .
( CNN ) -- The raw courage demonstrated by Eman al-Obeidy in persisting in telling her story of alleged repeated gang rape and torture in Libya is helping to change the dialogue in Libya and the Middle East about the use of sexual violence as a weapon of repression .
Since Obeidy burst into a hotel filled with journalists last week and told them of being raped by loyalist militia , Gadhafi supporters have deployed a range of vile tactics in a bid to undermine her that are painfully familiar . They called her a drunk , a prostitute , a pornographer , a liar , mentally unstable -- impugning her honor and that of her family .
When those tactics failed , they implied it was all somehow her fault , claiming she was scheduled to meet one of the men she says attacked her . Others threatened to sue her .
They are no doubt frustrated and surprised that the ways commonly used to silence women have not silenced Obeidy , who has been tenacious in her desire to tell her story . She is fortunate that her family is supporting her , reportedly rejecting offers of money , property or security if they would only denounce her .
In other cases , survivors of such treatment in this region of the world have found themselves shunned by their families and communities because of the resulting social stigma .
Rape has historically been used as a tool of war . Beyond Libya and the Middle East , rape and sexual violence have been used in conflicts in Bosnia , Rwanda , Burma , Guatemala and Bangladesh to sow terror and destruction .
It 's hard to speculate on the scope of this sort of sexual abuse in Libya , or whether it is being deployed in a systematic way while the armed conflict is under way -- there have only been a small number of reports so far . But al-Obeidy did put her attack into a familiar context : She told CNN 's Anderson Cooper that her captors `` would say , 'Let the men from Eastern Libya come and see what we are doing to their women and how we treat them , how we rape them . ' ``
How one voice can tell the story of an entire movement
The intentional , calculated use of rape as a strategy of oppression is for some a favored way to stigmatize and demoralize not merely the victim , but entire families and communities .
The international community has recognized this . Since the early 1990s , in the aftermath of the brutal conflict in the Balkans , in which an estimated 20,000 women were raped , newly established international war crimes tribunals have repeatedly recognized various forms of sexual violence as war crimes and in some cases instruments of genocide .
When committed on a widespread or systematic basis , which is almost always the case in conflict situations , they may amount to crimes against humanity . This , at least , delivers some measure of justice to the victims .
Nowhere has this need been more hideously manifest than in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which has been wracked by conflict since the 1990s . Last year , the U.N. recorded some 11,000 rapes , but the true figure is believed to be much higher . It was enough to prompt the U.N. 's special representative on sexual violence in conflict to call the country `` the rape capital of the world . ''
Justice is being delivered now in eastern Congo , where the Open Society Justice Initiative has supported the development of mobile gender justice courts that can hold court sessions in remote towns and villages in the east of the country where many of the atrocities have occurred .
In February , I watched as hundreds of villagers in Baraka clapped and cheered as a mobile court handed out sentences on four army officers found guilty of rape as a crime against humanity for their part in a mass rape attack in the smaller settlement of Fizi on New Year 's Day . The court sentenced the leaders to 20 years imprisonment .
The Congolese judges , prosecutor , defense counsel and lawyers worked tirelessly for nearly two weeks to adjudicate this joint trial in a remote village without access to running water or regular electricity . Millions more await justice , but this trial has given a glimmer of hope for the future .The raped women in Congo still live in mud huts , still struggle daily to survive , and many will still be rejected by their husbands . But now they have received something fleeting but incredibly precious : justice .
Last month , the U.N. Security Council referred the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court , which is now investigating reports of attacks on civilians and other violations of international law .
If Gadhafi and his supporters are found to be responsible for not only failing to protect women like Obeidy , but also for policies that explicitly or tacitly encouraged , or simply ignored , the use of rape warfare , she could find herself receiving some measure of justice for the heinous crimes allegedly committed against her .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kelly Askin .
1 . James Troisi ( Melbourne Victory , midfielder )
Rejoining Victory on a one-year contract after it did n't work out for him in Saudi Arabia and China has been a great move for Troisi .
His form has been excellent , leading to a national team recall and significantly increasing his bargaining power .
Victory coach Kevin Muscat was asked after Saturday 's 4-1 win over Perth Glory where things stood with negotiations on Troisi 's future :
`` If you 're asking me right here and now do I want him to stay , yes , of course I do . Are we working on it , yes , of course we are . But apart from that I ca n't tell you anything because we do respect the players ' privacy , '' he said .
2 . Roy O'Donovan ( Central Coast Mariners , striker )
Scoring goals for anyone is a good look .
Scoring goals for a struggling side is even better because it makes you wonder what the player would be capable of in a stronger team , receiving better service .
It would be a heartbreaker for the Mariners if they were n't able to hang on to O'Donovan after this season , but they have n't been able to re-sign him at this stage .
It is obviously a real threat with Newcastle Jets , Western Sydney Wanderers and Adelaide United among the clubs interested .
3 . Diego Castro ( Perth Glory , midfielder )
Castro turns 35 in July , but that is not an issue . He won the Johnny Warren medal as the competition 's best player last year and is in the running to win it again this season .
He has got the ball on a string at the moment . The Glory want him to go around again . The question is whether he wants to stay .
Last year , it took a couple of months of thinking it about back home in Spain before Castro re-committed .
Glory owner Tony Sage was quoted in Perth media on Friday saying they 're happy to let him take his time again :
`` In the end , it 's just about his desire and what he wants and what 's best for his family , '' Sage said . `` We 're not going to push him . It 's his decision . ''
4 . Milos Ninkovic ( Sydney FC , midfielder )
The favourite for the Johnny Warren Medal is not one of Sydney 's two marquee players - Filip Holosko and Bobo fill those spots - but surely after the brilliant season he has had , Ninkovic will be seeking marquee-level wages for next season .
That means the Sky Blues will have some very important decisions to make regarding their priorities .
5 . Jamie Maclaren ( Brisbane Roar , striker )
Contract negotiations between him and the Roar broke down some time ago and it appears there is no chance he will still be there next season .
Maclaren is keen to try his luck in Europe and after missing out on the latest Australia squad that may be where he needs to be to give himself the best chance of getting back in .
6 . Mitch Nichols ( Western Sydney Wanderers , midfielder )
Getty Images
It has been tougher for him this season because he no longer has genuine wingers like Romeo Castelen and Mark Bridge to combine with , but he is still working hard to try to make something happen .
It would n't surprise if his old club , Brisbane , had a crack at him for next season , particularly with Thomas Broich now 36 and no guarantee to still be there .
7 . Eugene Galekovic ( Adelaide United , goalkeeper )
Getty Images
It has been reported Central Coast goalkeeper Paul Izzo will leave at the end of the season to rejoin his home-town club Adelaide , and having established himself as the No.1 goalkeeper where he is he would n't be going back there to play second fiddle .
The rumours have been around for months that Melbourne City are interested in signing Reds captain Galekovic and a player with his reputation would be likely to have something on the boil somewhere if he 's not staying where he is .
He would n't want to be going anywhere to play second fiddle either .
8 . Andrew Hoole ( Newcastle Jets , winger )
Getty Images
Newcastle had him at the top of their retention list , but recently withdrew their offer after the two could n't reach an agreement on a proposed buyout fee if Hoole received an offer from overseas that he wanted to accept .
Hoole is seeking a contract in Europe . If he does n't get the right opportunity and switches plans again to stay in the A-League there is no guarantee it will be at the Jets because by then they may have bought another player to fill his role .
9 . Roly Bonevacia ( Wellington Phoenix , midfielder )
Getty Images
The talk for a while now has been that he would n't be re-signing and with no news coming out of the club on a player whose signature would be a priority - it appears his stint at the Phoenix has run its course after three seasons .
The question is : Where will he go ? If he 's to remain in the A-League , there have been rumours for a while now that Western Sydney are interested , but they would n't be the only club .
10 . David Carney ( Sydney FC , winger )
Getty Images
Carney is not getting much game-time off the bench for the Sky Blues and that 's not healthy when you 're 33 and trying to extend your career .
He was n't used at all in the 1-0 win over the Mariners on Friday night .
It 's not that Carney has lost it . When he does get on , he invariably plays well . Sydney simply has a red-hot front four and Bernie Ibini ca n't get into the starting side either .
Sydney apparently want to keep Carney , but he may have to look elsewhere to play more often .
The buzzword surrounding running back Marcus Lattimore is clearly `` shock . ''

Over the weekend , NFL Network 's draft analyst Mike Mayock shocked some by ranking running back No . 5 in his position grades even though the former University of South Carolina Gamecock is just four months removed from a gruesome knee injury .
On Monday , Lattimore told South Carolina 's weekly radio program that doctors who evaluate him at this week 's 2013 NFL Scouting Combine `` will be shocked , '' via WACH in Columbia , S.C .
The running back is n't expected to participate in any drills at the combine , but said he planned to start running the Monday following .
`` It 's game on '' from there , he said .

If these projections are right , Lattimore could do a whole lot more shocking as the league year progresses .

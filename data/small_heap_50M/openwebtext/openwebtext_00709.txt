Gay police officers have been investigated for drug use based on a complaint that they were “ promiscuous ” and had “ loose morals , ” a court has heard .
The police officers – Chris Sheehy , Steven Rapisarda , Shane Housego and former officer Christian McDonald – want compensation and an apology from New South Wales Police .
They have told the court in Sydney that the complaint – and therefore the investigation – was false and homophobic .
The six-month-long investigation included drug testing for the four men , all of whom were cleared of taking drugs .
Brett Eurell , the men 's counsel , read from the partially redacted complaint .
He told the court it accused the officers of being “ notorious for their promiscuity ” .
The complaint also noted that “ drug use is thought to be fundamental in such indiscriminate sexual encounters , ” he said .
“ They frequent the Stonewall Hotel , ” Eurell read .
“ Stonewall is a gay venue .
“ At best it is guilt by association based upon the anecdotal group 's loose morals and reckless behaviours . ”
This complaint and the ensuing investigation in 2015 was the result of the homophobic culture which was fostered by senior management at Newtown Police Station , the men said .
The identity of the complaint 's author has not yet been revealed , but the court heard that it was made by a superior officer .
The NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled that the name of the complaint 's author would be revealed at a later date .
JJ Fernon SC , representing the police , rejected claims the complaint was intended to be malicious .
He said it was “ just a document that reasonable people can interpret ” .
The men 's allegations of discrimination based on their sexuality would , if proven , contradict the police 's stated approach to its LGBT people .
The latest policy document speaks of “ a commitment to NSW Police Force employees to be inclusive of diverse sexuality , gender and intersex status , thereby creating a more harmonious workplace . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) is launching a new project to harness grassroots resistance to President Donald Trump .
The project , People Power , will officially kick off Saturday . It will commence with a livestreamed resistance training to engage volunteers around the country `` and take the fight against Donald Trump 's policies not just into the courts , but into the streets , '' the organization wrote on its preview website .
Its first effort will be to help cities use their local-level authority to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation and become a network of `` freedom cities '' capable of withstanding Trump 's ongoing immigration crackdown .
The initiative will give activists a set of `` ordinances '' to help them pressure local law enforcement to use more lenient immigration policies .
`` As Donald Trump does what he does , the greatest political power is in the cities and towns across America , '' Faiz Shakir , ACLU 's national political director , told the Guardian on Friday . `` Because constitutionally , cities have sovereignty rights unto their own . ''
The Guardian 's Adam Gabbatt writes :
The ordinances resemble a pledge that could be made by local sheriffs or police commissioners . They include a commitment to `` require a judicial warrant '' before detaining people at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , and to not `` authorize or engage '' in surveillance of a person or group based on their perceived immigration status .

`` We will be asking people to arrange a meeting with their sheriff or their police commissioner or their local precinct commander and raise these draft ordinances at that meeting , '' Shakir said . `` And have them discuss what their policies are with respect to immigrants . That would form the basis for follow-up meetings and follow-up policy advocacy . ''
`` Essentially we want people to think of their cities as cities of resistance , '' Shakir said .
At least 2,300 viewing parties have already been arranged throughout the country to watch the People Power training and kickoff .
The project represents a new venture for the ACLU , which typically focuses on legal cases and has not been historically involved in grassroots organizing . But as activism become increasingly common in response to Trump 's policies , and with mayors around the country declaring their support for undocumented immigrants—plus an influx of post-election donations—the group has sought to recognize the potential of that power .
In a memo to the Washington Post , the ACLU said it plans to recruit volunteers to implement `` a plan to fight the Trump administration lawfully and systematically , not just by defending each individual as they are detained , harassed , or deported . ''
Future initiatives will also focus on women 's equality , LGBTQ rights , police surveillance , and other similar issues .
COMPANY TOWN Take your royalty checks , SoundExchange begs
Money is piling up from digital music streams , and the nonprofit has to track down artists who do n't know . Then it has to convince them it 's not a scam .
Boydston 's money came from royalties that SoundExchange has squirreled away on his behalf since 2001 , when Congress created the nonprofit to collect royalties from digital music streams on Internet , satellite radio and cable television . So far , the group has distributed about $ 360 million to more than 45,000 artists and copyright holders .
`` Sure enough , they had a sizable amount of money for me , '' said Boydston , 51 , whose band Daddy a Go Go includes his two teenage sons . `` It was several thousand dollars . That 's not a ton of money . But for a guy who makes CDs in his basement , it was enough to finance my next album . ''
But then he got the message again six months later . Curious , he called SoundExchange .
To the rock musician from Atlanta , `` money for nothing '' meant a song by Dire Straits , not a stranger contacting him out of the blue promising to cut him big checks .
When John Boydston got an e-mail from SoundExchange saying he had several thousand dollars in unclaimed royalties , he did what most sensible people would do . He ignored it .
But at any given time , about 25 % of the money SoundExchange gets from online music services such as Pandora , XM Radio and Last.fm ca n't be distributed because the artists ca n't be tracked down . Currently , that amounts to about $ 50 million . And with the rising popularity of Internet radio , the cash pile has been growing , said John Simson , SoundExchange 's executive director .
The problem stems from what Simson calls `` bad data . '' Music services have been required by law since 2001 to send royalty payments to SoundExchange for the songs they stream online . But they often provide scant details . Stations routinely get promotional discs in the mail that are n't properly labeled , so the performers often go uncredited . Other times , music services keep sloppy records of the songs they play . Some tunes , for example , are titled `` Unknown '' and performed by `` Various Artists . ''
`` We have this inside joke that if you want to make millions in the music business , just form a record label called Unknown and a band called Various Artists , and before you 've even recorded a track , you can collect millions of dollars , '' Simson said .
The problem primarily hits niche artists and older performers whose works are less widely recognized . Boydston , for instance , has self-published six children 's rock albums over the last decade . He estimates that he 's sold 30,000 discs in total .
`` I 'm a niche within a niche , '' he said . `` People like me fall below the radar . ''
The `` dirty data '' phenomenon hampers the collection of royalties by other groups as well .
`` This affects everyone , '' said Patrick Sullivan , chief of RightsFlow , which helps track a separate set of royalties . `` Without proper data , we ca n't get the money out to the license holders . We have to do it better , because ultimately if we do n't get paid , no one gets paid . ''
To fill in the blanks , SoundExchange has a campaign to scour social networks such as Facebook and MySpace Music , to work with companies that provide independent artists with services such as CD Baby and ReverbNation and to hit music festivals and events .
Next week at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin , four or five SoundExchange employees will fan out , armed with a list of 450 artists who collectively are owed about $ 250,000 . The vast majority do n't know about the money they are owed , so it will be up to SoundExchange to look for them by attending their shows or camping out at the registration desks .
If they are like Lexi Street , lead singer for the Lexi Street Band in Atlanta , they will be highly skeptical .
`` Someone tracking you down and giving you money ? It just does n't exist , '' Street said , describing how she reacted when SoundExchange called her in April . `` I was like , what do I need to do ? Give them my soul ? As an independent artist , you get so many pitches that try to nickel and dime you for one gimmick or another . ''
lytro light field camera now available
the eponymously named light field camera by lytro
California-based startup lytro has begun mass production of their eponymously-named light field camera , creating a device that automatically captures all parts of a scene in detail so that the image can be focused on one or multiple sections after being taken . the camera eliminates the need for focusing during image capture , and offers the freedom to choose in post-processing whether to create shallow depth of field or focus-stacked images , and which parts of the picture should be in focus .
the backlit touchscreen display on the ‘ lytros ' measures 1.46-inches ( 33 mm ) , on a device that is altogether 1.61-inches square by 4.4-inches deep ( 41 x 41 x 112 mm ) . the camera features 8x optical zoom on a constant f/2 lens . exposure may be set manually via touch control . pictures ( ‘ .lfp ' ) can be interacted with on the camera itself , as well as any supported computer , smartphone , or tablet , without the need for dedicated software or applications . uploading via microUSB and processing is available via an application for macOS , with a Windows version in development .
camera in ‘ electric blue ' ( 8GB ) , ‘ red hot ' ( 16 GB ) , and ‘ graphite ' ( 8 GB )
additional view
a light field consists of all light rays traveling in all directions in a scene , thus fully defining every aspect of how it appears . traditional camera sensors ‘ tabulate ' all the light rays and record them as a single amount of light . by contrast , the lytro sensor captures the colour , intensity , and vector direction of all rays of light . it relies primarily on software algorithms rather than mechanical parts , increasing the speed of picture capture and improving image-taking in low light conditions .

Consider the following lead paragraph from a front-page article in yesterday 's New York Times entitled “ From Amateur to Ruthless Jihadist in France ” :
In the year after the United States ' invasion of Iraq , a 22-year-old pizza delivery man here could n't take it anymore . Sickened by images of American soldiers humiliating Muslims at the Abu Ghraib prison , he made plans to go fight United States forces . He studied a virtual AK-47 on a website . Then he took lessons from a man , using a hand-drawn picture of a gun .
The sentence was referring to Cherif Kouachi , one of the people who committed the terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris .
Do you see anything about hating France or the United States because of its freedom and values in that sentence ?
Or do you see the inevitable outcome of empire and interventionism ?
The only thing that surprises me about the Paris attacks is that people are surprised about them . I just do n't get it . How can anyone be surprised over this sort of thing , after decades of death , destruction , torture , maiming , humiliation , and partnerships with dictatorial regimes on the part of the United States , France , and other members of “ coalitions of the willing ” put together by the U.S. government as part of its imperialist and interventionist campaign in the Middle East and Afghanistan ?
Let 's not ignore the obvious — they did n't attack Switzerland , whose mind-your-own-business , anti-imperialist , anti-interventionist foreign policy mirrors the type of foreign policy that the United States had for the first 100 years of our nation 's history .
Prior to the 9/11 attacks , The Future of Freedom Foundation was publishing articles warning about the likelihood of a major terrorist attack on American soil . We were n't the only ones . Most notable was Chalmers Johnson in his book Blowback : the Costs and Consequences of American Empire , which was published prior to the 9/11 attacks .
We were n't Nostradamuses or rocket scientists . We were just pointing out the obvious : that if the U.S. government continued maintaining military forces in the Middle East , continued killing countless people , especially children , with the sanctions against Iraq , and continued foreign aid to the Israeli government , there would be some people who would become so angry and full of rage that they would retaliate with terrorist attacks .
Is n't that just logical ?
And we had evidence to support what we were saying . There was the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 — eight full years before the 9/11 attacks . One of the terrorists in that attack specifically had told the federal judge who was sentencing him that he had committed the attack out of anger and rage resulting from U.S. foreign policy , including the killing of Iraqi children from the sanctions . There were also the terrorist attacks on the USS Cole and the U.S. Embassies in East Africa motivated by the same things .
But the attitude of U.S. officials was : We are the U.S. national-security state and the world 's sole remaining empire . We have the authority and the power to go wherever we want , including the Middle East , and to bend any recalcitrant regime to our will , even replacing it in a regime-change operation that entails killing and destroying whoever and whatever stand in our way .
After all , do n't forget that the Cold War was over . If the Cold War-era national-security state was to continue in existence , it would need something to do . What better way to ensure longevity and the continuation of ever-increasing revenues than going into the Middle East and stirring up hornets ' nests that would end up producing a perpetual war on terrorism , one that will be much more lucrative and long-lasting than even the 45-year-long war on communism ?
After the 9/11 attacks , we heard the same nonsense coming out of the mouths of U.S. officials that we hear coming out of the mouths of French officials . That the terrorists just hate us for our freedom and values . And how the government now needs to clamp down , reluctantly of course , to defend ourselves from the terrorists .
After the 9/11 attacks , here at FFF we continued to maintain that doubling down with more imperialism and more interventionism in response to those attacks would be the worst thing that could happen to the United States . The U.S. government would effectively become a perpetual terrorist-producing machine . That 's precisely what the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the death and destruction within those two nations have done . Every time they killed , maimed , abused , or humiliated one person , ten more people were motivated the join the ranks of the terrorists .
The root of all this ? Empire and intervention . If it had n't been for empire and intervention , there would be a lot of dead people who would still be alive today , including U.S. soldiers , countless people in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East and Afghanistan , and the people at Charlie Hebdo .
One of the worst parts of all this was that every single person killed , tortured , abused , or maimed in Iraq , including every U.S. prisoner at Abu Ghraib , had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks or with any other attack on the United States . In the Iraq War , which got Cherif Kouachi so angry , the U.S. government was the aggressor and Iraq was the defending nation .
Yesterday , at my church parishioners were asked to pray for an end to terrorism . That 's like praying that thunder will no longer follow lightning . Or like praying that people who jump off a 50-story building wo n't die .
Terrorism — at least anti-American terrorism — comes with empire and intervention just as thunder follows lightning and death follows jumping off a 50-story building .
If American Christians want to stop terrorism , the more appropriate prayer is : We pray that our government bring all its troops home and discharge them , dismantle its Cold War-era national-security state apparatus that has been grafted onto our governmental structure , and end its foreign policy of interventionism .
That 's the only way to end anti-American terrorism and restore a sense of peace , prosperity , and harmony to society . Otherwise , be prepared for more of the same , including right here in the United States .
NEW DELHI : An unnamed Islamic cleric based in Europe has issued a ban on women touching fruits and vegetables resembling the male sexual organ to avoid `` sexual thoughts '' .The Egyptian news website Bikya Masr on Wednesday quoted the cleric whose diktat featured in an article on el-Senousa , a religious publication . The cleric has said that women should not even get close to bananas or cucumbers . `` If women wish to eat these food items , a third party , preferably a male related to them such as their a father or husband , should cut the items into small pieces and serve , '' the cleric dictated.According to the cleric , bananas and cucumbers `` resemble the male penis '' and therefore could arouse women or `` make them think of sex . '' The cleric also added carrots and zucchini to the list of forbidden foods for women.The news about this latest diktat against women went viral on the web with liberal Muslims feeling enraged and embarrassed . Repression of women in ultra-conservative Islamic societies has been an intense subject of debate throughout the world .
Strike Industries used their Facebook page to announce a potential New Year 's treat . Apparently they are developing a drop-in aluminum H & K MP5 receiver that will work with standard trigger housings . The new gun will also use standard H & K barrels , charging handles and magazines . No word on if the signature MP5 delayed roller lock action will find its way into the Strike variant , but we still have a few weeks before the 2017 SHOT Show .
Dubbed the SI 2017 , the pistol or rifle has a full length top rail and modular attachment points on the forearm . It also appears to be ambidextrous , with the option to switch the charging handle to the right side . The rifle prototype sports a Sig Sauer MPX/MCX folding stock , with a rail attachment point for other stock options .
Strike CEO Garrett Keller graciously responded to an email request for additional information . He writes :
First and foremost we are keeping the system true to the standard MP5 being one of the most widely used platforms for LEO/MIL worldwide . We do n't want them to have to retrain to new operating procedures so still no bolt lock back . Compatible with the already widely available MP5 Lower Receiver , Bolt and trigger pack , what we are aiming to provide is an updated modular upper with , barrel , handguard , and stock configurations for pistol , sbr and rifle options “ user choice ” . It will feature continuous top rail , MLOK rail system , integrated flip up front and rear sights on all length options except the shortest length due to structural limits and feature an ambi charging handle . More updates coming soon !
Keller also shared some design drawings :
After seeing the mock ups and getting a few details from Keller , I have to say I 'm pretty excited . The rest of the details are under wraps at this time . Interested ? Keep an eye on the Strike Industries Facebook page ( and TFB ) for more information .
Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky 's , an allegorical science fiction film like his earlier , was adapted from the novel Picnic by the Roadside by brothers Boris Strugatsky and Arkady Strugatsky . The film follows three men -- the Scientist ( Nikolai Grinko ) , the Writer ( Anatoliy Solonitsyn ) , and the Stalker ( Alexander Kaidanovsky ) -- as they travel through a mysterious and forbidden territory in the Russian wilderness called the `` Zone . '' In the Zone , nothing is what it seems . Objects change places , the landscape shifts and rearranges itself . It seems as if unknown intelligence is actively thwarting any attempt to penetrate its borders . In the Zone , there is said to be a bunker , and in the bunker : a magical room which has the power to make wishes come true . The Stalker is the hired guide for the journey who has , through repeated visits to the Zone , become accustomed to its complex traps , pitfalls , and subtle distortions . Only by following his lead ( which often involves taking the longest , most frustrating route ) can the Writer and the Scientist make it alive to the bunker and the room . As the men travel farther into the Zone , they realize it may take something more than just determination to succeed : it may actually take faith . Increasingly unsure of their deepest desires , they confront the room wondering if they can , in the end , take responsibility for the fulfillment of their own wishes .
Kohei Uchida finally launched the first chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy : Galaxy Rush earlier this week . The series is based on James Gunn 's films , and fans can read up on the series with DeNa 's Manga Box app . Sadly , the series is only available in Japanese at the moment , but fans will get translations sooner rather than later.Guardians of the Galaxy : Galaxy Rush is set after the franchise 's second film . The original story follows the team as they enter a content called Galaxy Rush , a battle-royale style race that takes place on Vanaheim . Rocket and Groot appear to to be manga 's main players as of right now , but the ensemble team will get their chance to shine as the series continues.Here is a quick steal from one guardian of the Galaxy 's Mangas in Japanese for your viewing pleasure ! If the name Vanaheim sounds familiar to you , then you have most definitely seen Thor : The Dark World . The MCU introduced the world in the Thor sequel . As one of the Nine Realms , Vanaheim is home to the Vanir , but it was invaded by the Marauders not too long ago . Thor and his Asgardian army were sent to free the wooded planet . Thor : The Dark World did n't get a lot of time to explore Vanaheim , so fans can look forward to the Guardians of the Galaxy manga doing so now . Fans are already keeping their eyes open for any hidden Easter eggs.Of course , Guardians of the Galaxy is n't the first Marvel franchise to get a manga . Marvel Comics even had the Marvel Mangaverse at one point which featured heroes like the Hulk , Iron Man , Namor , and more .

LAKE ODESSA , Mich. – On a typical day at the Lake Odessa Cattle Auction , the only audible sounds you can hear once the selling gets underway are the moos and neighs of the livestock and the `` Going-once-going-twice-sold ! '' calls of the fast-talking auctioneer .
But January 19 , Kendall Tobias , a longtime seller and buyer at the auction , heard something that did n't quite belong , and it 's a good thing he did . What he found led to a dramatic feline rescue .
“ We could n't believe it , ” said Kendall . “ I come out here , I look down , here are two eyeballs sticking through that drain . ”
Those eyeballs belonged to the kitty now known as Bubbles . The feral cat had climbed through nearly 80 feet of pipe and managed to get her head stuck through a small opening in a drain cover , the rest of her body left dangling , possibly for days .
Kendall and a few others removed the pipe – Bubbles still inside – and gently pushed her head free through the bottom .
“ It laid there for a few minutes , like it was dead , '' Kendall said . `` About 15 minutes later , we take another look at it ; it was breathing . ”
So the rescuers rushed Bubbles to nearby Thornapple Veterinary Clinic in Wayland . Amazingly , Bubbles suffered only a few scrapes and some swollen eyelids , but nothing serious .
“ All in all , she 's doing great , ” said Leslie Lettinga , the veterinary technician who cared for Bubbles . “ She lost probably five [ lives ] with this , I think , or maybe even seven , so she 's got a couple left . ”
The clinic will hold on to Bubbles for another week , so they can monitor her recovery and administer a few more vaccinations . After that , the clinic will begin seeking a forever home for this lucky cat .
If you 're interested in adopting Bubbles , you can contact the Thornapple Veterinary Clinic .
The vets will be sad to see Bubbles go , but they 're happy and grateful Kendall and his fellow do-gooders took the time to save her life .
“ You 're not going to leave an animal in distress , ” said Lettinga . “ It does n't matter if it 's somebody 's kitty or not , you 're going take care of that cat and not leave it in that tube to let it die there and suffer . I 'm very glad they took time out of their day . They have a very busy schedule over there with all that cattle coming through but they took time to help this animal in distress . ”
11 January 2013 | PSCC , Bab Alshams , Occupied Palestine
250 men and women from across Palestine establish this morning a new Palestinian village named “ Bab Alshams ” ( Gate of the Sun ) . Tents were built in what Israel refers to as area E1 and equipment for long-term living was brought .
The group released the following statement :
We , the sons and daughters of Palestine from all throughout the land , announce the establishment of Bab Alshams Village ( Gate of the Sun ) . We the people , without permits from the occupation , without permission from anyone , sit here today because this is our land and it is our right to inhabit it .
A few months ago the Israeli government announced its intention to build about 4000 settlement housing units in the area Israel refers to as E1 . E1 block is an area of about 13 square km that falls on confiscated Palestinian land East of Jerusalem between Ma'ale Adumim settlement , which lies on occupied West Bank Palestinian land , and Jerusalem . We will not remain silent as settlement expansion and confiscation of our land continues . Therefore we hereby establish the village of Bab Alshams to proclaim our faith in direct action and popular resistance . We declare that the village will stand steadfast until the owners of this land will get their right to build on their land .
The village 's name is taken from the novel , “ Bab Alshams , ” by Lebanese writer Elias Khoury . The book depicts the history of Palestine through a love story between a Palestinian man , Younis , and his wife Nahila . Younis leaves his wife to join the Palestinian resistance in Lebanon while Nahila remains steadfast in what remains of their village in the Galilee . Throughout the 1950s and 1960s , Younis smuggles through Lebanon and back to the Galilee to meet his wife in the “ Bab Alshams ” cave , where she gives birth to their children . Younis returns to the resistance in Lebanon as his wife remains in Bab Al Shams .
Bab Alshams is the gate to our freedom and steadfastness . Bab Alshams is our gate to Jerusalem . Bab Alshams is the gate to our return .
For decades , Israel has established facts on the ground as the International community remained silent in response to these violations . The time has come now to change the rules of the game , for us to establish facts on the ground – our own land . This action involving women and men from the north to the south is a form of popular resistance . In the coming days we will hold various discussion groups , educational and artistic presentations , as well as film screenings on the lands of this village . The residents of Bab Al Shams invite all the sons and daughters of our people to participate and join the village in supporting our resilience .
Ted Genoways at Mother Jones has an excellent cover story on the growing number of `` ag gag '' laws that criminalize documenting animal abuse at factory farms .
Amanda Hitt , director of the Government Accountability Project 's Food Integrity Campaign , explains why these laws are so dangerous :
`` This is a bigger , broader issue . '' She likened activist videos to airplane black-box recorders—evidence for investigators to deconstruct and find wrongdoing . Ag gag laws , she said , do n't just interfere with workers blowing the whistle on animal abuse . `` You are also stopping environmental whistleblowing ; you are also stopping workers ' rights whistleblowing . '' In short , `` you have given power to the industry to completely self-regulate . '' That should `` scare the pants off '' consumers concerned about where their food comes from . `` It 's the consumer 's right to know , but also the employee 's right to tell . You got ta have both . ''
Mother Jones has an interactive map ( screenshot above ) that details which states have passed these ag gag laws . Already in 2013 , 14 of these laws have been introduced .
Genoways goes on to tell the history how these laws came to pass , as well as interviewing two farm employees that were affected by undercover video .

Introduction In June 1922 the Tyrrenhia took her maiden voyage from Glasgow to Canada . She was an elegant vessel with two masts and a single funnel , and throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s was a ship of peaceful pleasure . No one liked her name - she quickly became known as the 'Soup Tureen ' - and in early February 1924 she changed it to the Lancastria . What the fates made of the change , only time would tell - it is supposed to be very unlucky to change a God-given name , and sailors feel that the naming of a ship is as good as a christening . She was an elegant vessel with two masts and a single funnel , and throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s was a ship of peaceful pleasure . This is an account of what befell the ship that changed its name , seen partly through the eyes of two survivors of the bombing raid which would sink the Lancastria , taking an estimated 5,000 people to their deaths . The eyewitness accounts are taken from the BBC South documentary 'Lancastria - a Secret Sacrifice ' . The programme includes War Office archive film of the wounded returning home , which was top secret at the time of the disaster . RMS Lancastria became HMT Lancastria when she was commandeered for war , and her sleek Cunard lines were lost under a coat of battleship grey . During the first few months of war she was busily engaged in cargo and transport duties in the North Atlantic , her massive cargo capacity proving ideal for the task . When the Norwegian campaign began , the Lancastria was set aside for troop-carrying but was kept back until needed to evacuate troops from Harstaad . She returned to Britain with her public rooms crammed with dejected weary soldiers . En route , she was spotted by a high-flying German aircraft and , although they attacked , the bombs missed and she sailed safely home . Was she a lucky ship after all ? The troops disembarked at Glasgow and , after transporting men to Iceland , the Lancastria returned to her home port of Liverpool for a much-needed refit . Top
Red Alert The crew had already been paid off when the telegram came ordering the Lancastria to be ready to sail with Operation Aerial and , together with other vessels , she made for Plymouth where the vessel was given orders to sail for western France . She was guided into the sea lanes of the Loire estuary , and anchored some 10 miles off St Nazaire at about 06.00 hrs on Monday 17 June . It was a beautiful misty summer morning . Those on the deck of the 'Lancastria ' feared the worst ... Almost immediately , exhausted troops and some civilians began to arrive and were given little tickets , like bus tickets , with their cabin and deck number . Some were given spaces in the vast holds of the ship , where they laid down to rest and were asleep in just a few minutes . Throughout the morning troops arrived and seemed to fill every available space . Some had their first hot meal in weeks ; some remained on deck watching still more people come aboard . There were units from the Army and RAF as well as civilians - men , women and young children . At about 13.00 hrs the red alert sounded and a dive bomber was seen to attack the Oronsay which was some distance off . The bomber scored a direct hit on the bridge area , but it did not render the ship unseaworthy . Those on the deck of the Lancastria feared the worst : the enemy was sure to return . By this time the ship had taken some 6,000 people on board and more kept coming . At around 15.00 hrs Captain Sharp decided that enough was enough , but that to sail straight away would court disaster - he would rather wait for an escort . Top
The final moments At about 15.50 hrs the enemy returned . Bombs were seen to straddle the ship , one bomb exploding close to the port side , rupturing her almost full fuel tanks . The black oil oozed into the sea , creating a dark , deathly cloud . They sang in defiance at the tops of their voices 'Roll out the Barrel ' and 'There 'll always be an England ' . Immediately , the ship began a perilous roll from port to starboard and back again , further bombs struck home , one penetrating the holds that were crammed with troops . Of the RAF personnel aboard - from 73 Squadrons and 98 Squadrons - very few survived . The ship rolled onto her port side , down by the bow . Those who could , took to the water to try and swim though the black cloud of oil that here and there showed licks of flame . Non-swimmers took to the water with whatever seemed to be able to keep them afloat . Some lifeboats were lowered but , on many , the davits could not be released because of the angle of the ship . Those still on board what was now an upturned hull watched as the enemy returned to strafe both those struggling for life on the hull and those in the sea . They sang in defiance at the tops of their voices 'Roll out the Barrel ' and 'There 'll always be an England ' . The ship 's siren wailed and by 16.10 hrs , in just 20 minutes , the Lancastria slipped beneath the waves . Top
News blackout Then there was the silence , a silence louder than the clamour of exploding bombs and guns . So ended the life of a beautiful ship and the lives of thousands of men , women and children . No one will ever know the exact number who died that day - some say there were as many as 9,000 on board by the time the Lancastria was bombed , others estimate 7,000 . All we do know is that around 6,000 were on board by 13.00 hrs , and that many more arrived after that . Only 2,447 arrived home . The rescue began with all kinds of vessels - from small fishing boats to destroyers of the Royal Navy - picking up survivors , more like oily flotsam than people . The bodies of those who died that day were washed up along the French coast during the coming months and were given Christian burials by the French people , who bravely ignored the German presence and cared for the victims as their own . Churchill immediately hid the news from the public . Churchill immediately hid the news from the public . In 1940 , after Dunkirk , to reveal the truth would have been too damaging for civilian morale . He said , 'The newspapers have got quite enough disaster for today , at least . ' Since that time the disaster has never been recognised for what it was - the greatest maritime disaster in Britain 's history . More people were killed on the Lancastria than on the Titanic and Lusitania put together . Top
Survivors In many ways the survivors feel that their sacrifice and the ultimate sacrifice of those that share the Lancastria as their final resting place is not valued , simply because it is not recognised . Slowly but surely that sacrifice is becoming known and more widely recognised . Harry Pettit from Hampshire , who was then a 24-year-old private , and Welshman Henry Harding , who was 19 at the time of the disaster , both survived the catastrophe . Henry , who still has the watch he was wearing as the bombs fell , which stopped at five minutes past four ( the time he decided to jump into the water ) , talks emotionally about his memories of the ship sinking . He describes seeing thousands of men cling desperately to the hull of the ship which sank in just 20 minutes , saying : ' I remember there were thousands of voices singing `` Roll Out The Barrel '' and `` There 'll Always Be An England '' , and for years afterwards I could not stand the sound of those two songs . I was turned around in the water and the next that I saw , nothing . Thousands had gone to a watery grave and I will always remember it , I ca n't ever forget it . ' Top
The struggle for recognition Although some photographs appeared in the American press late in the summer of 1940 , and were then published in the UK , the full story of the Lancastria never came out . Harry Pettit and Henry Harding , who both served in the Royal Army Service Corps , are angry that there has never been any official recognition of the sacrifice and bravery of their comrades . A Hundred and hundreds , possibly thousands , of people lost close relatives in that tragedy and nobody told them what had happened . Harry says : 'What I feel strongly about is that hundred and hundreds , possibly thousands , of people lost close relatives in that tragedy and nobody told them what had happened . It should n't have been left to someone like me to go out and help these people in this way . It 's a bad show . ' Harry has worked hard to publicise the story , and has been successful in filling in the gaps for up to 200 people about the fate of their loved ones . In the summer of 2000 , Harry and Henry , 24 other survivors and many more relatives of victims made a last pilgrimage to St Nazaire and back to the site of the wreck , which is now an official war grave .

Remembering the lost Of the 2,477 men rescued from the Lancastria , about 100 are still alive today . There are many families in England who never knew of the fate of their loved ones in western France in June 1940 , only that they died with the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) . The original HMT Lancastria Association was founded by a survivor , Major C V Petit . After his death , the Association was later renewed in its current form by some of the other survivors , and children of survivors . Today , it continues under the leadership of a Committee with the aim of remembering and honouring all those who lost their lives in the Lancastria disaster , and helping those survivors who did return . The Association has in some cases been able to confirm to some families that their family member was indeed on the Lancastria , and has accompanied that family to a grave in western France , so that at last they are able to say their farewell . On the first Sunday after 17 June , each year , an annual remembrance service takes place in St Katharine Cree church , in Leadenhall Street , London . This article is based on an account of the Lancastria 's sinking , by Raye Dancocks , Chair of the HMT Lancastria Association . Top

Two fresh mysteries have arisen in the wake of the recently announced “ Yet Another Bailout ” for Greece deal and they are both worth exploring . The first , of course , is why Europe is still bothering with pouring money down that rathole , but it will take a more learned European economics expert than I to tackle it . The second , however , has much broader implications , and deals with the way in which enthusiastic supporters of liberal policies around the world are outraged at the terms and pushing the # ThisIsACoup hashtag in response . Business Insider has the details .
Greece finally reached a deal with its creditors to receive a much-needed bailout , but a lot of people are unhappy with the deal . The hashtag # ThisIsACoup is trending on Twitter , and commentators are lashing out at what they see as an unfair deal for Greece . The big issue is that all the signs coming out of negotiations so far suggest that the reforms the Eurogroup has asked for will be more austere than those rejected by the Greek people in the country 's recent referendum . That 's because the country 's economy has deteriorated even more in the interim , meaning greater action is required , and Greece is close to running out of cash , meaning it is desperate for a deal and in a weak negotiating position .
The parade of tweets flying this hashtag are angry , outspoken and for the most part wrong . Still , they do provide a look at the thinking going on here .
Zero talks about the debt , it 's all about austerity , privatisation & humiliation . Varoufakis said 'terrorism ' . It 's a mild word # ThisIsACoup — Philippe Marlière ( @ PhMarliere ) July 13 , 2015
Greek citizens no longer have a voice . Sad day for democracy # ThisIsACoup — Brad Doswell ( @ BradDoswell ) July 13 , 2015
Remember , these are n't just Greek citizens getting up in arms here . There are liberal cheerleaders all over the world who are watching this spectacle and rebelling against the idea of the Greek government having to suffer under any form of “ austerity ” or make cuts to its spending habits to save itself from economic implosion . One of the common themes you are seeing is the accusation of how Germany and the rest of the surviving Euro neighborhood is trying to punish or humiliate Greece with their overbearing demands . That sort of thinking is truly revealing of the mindset that we 're dealing with not only in Greece , but in the United States as well .
Nobody is trying to punish anyone . This is a business deal and it comes with all of the caveats which surround any such financial negotiations . The Greeks have put themselves in the position of needing a huge favor and they have very little to back up their promise of making good on returning said favor in the future . In fact , given the results of their recent referendum , any creditor would be justifiably dubious about sending more money their way since they clearly have no national inclination toward paying back their saviors . The base problem here probably comes down to the national attitude of not only the Greek citizens but their elected leaders as well . They have managed to go for a very long time expecting the government to pay their way and care for them with little or no concern for where the money is coming from . And now that the piggy bank at home has run dry , they would like the rest of the members of their relatively recently formed European community to continue to support them so they do n't have to take responsibility for their actions . Unfortunately for them , the world does n't work that way .
As to the charge of humiliation , it 's not being done intentionally but the result is understandable . I 'd be pretty embarrassed if I were Greece . For that matter , speaking strictly as an American , if any Europeans were unsportsmanlike enough to come over here and point out how we 've racked up this many trillions of dollars on our national credit card in such a short period of time I 'd be pretty embarrassed myself . It 's nothing to be proud of .
And in that regard , we come to the lesson our American liberals might take away from all this . Greece is looking for a parental figure to pull them out of the hole they 've dug for themselves . If that happens to an economy the size of America 's ( which is currently unfolding before our eyes ) there is no father or mother figure big enough to rescue us . Food for thought .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) — Land , air , sea , space — now cyberspace . The Department of Defense Thursday released its first-ever “ Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace , ” and private companies are being called to service .
“ Everybody is on the frontline , ” Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III said at an official announcement detailing the new cybersecurity plan at the National Defense University .
Bob Spoerl/Medill News Service Gen. James Cartwright ( left ) and Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discuss the new cybersecurity plan of the Defense Department .
The strategy , called the first unified plan incorporating DOD 's military , intelligence and business operations , lays out five pillars for defending against cyberattacks . Several of those pillars specifically address civilian help . Defense contractors and Internet service providers are expected to play an integral role in cyber defense .
Gen. James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , called the strategy a way “ to build a layering for defense strategy awareness . ”
As part of the strategy , the Pentagon created a 90-day pilot program involving AT & T T , +0.29 % , Verizon Communications VZ , -0.25 % and Century Link CTL , -1.44 % , the Internet service providers to a handful of defense contractors . They are given access to classified defense information to help protect against attacks by cyber hackers . After the program ends this summer , the Defense Department would like to expand its civilian cybersecurity base to allow dozens of companies to participate .
The pilot program comes after a March 24 cyberattack against an unnamed defense company . Some 24,000 of that company 's files , ones that contained military secrets , were hacked into . The Defense Department wo n't say who or what group was responsible .
In May , defense industry company Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT , -0.03 % faced a cyberattack of an undisclosed magnitude .
The Center for Democracy & Technology , a surveillance security watchdog , is optimistic that the information shared with defense-related companies will lead to more thorough Internet security .
“ It breaks a logjam that has been in place and that could have led to Department of Defense monitoring networks itself , ” center lawyer Greg Nojeim said .
As a result of the Defense Department pilot program , Internet providers now have access to classified signatures , which would better defend networks , Nojeim said . The only concern is how the private companies will share information with the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security .
“ The flow back to the government has n't been described , ” Nojeim said . “ You want to avoid a back-door wiretap . ”
Cyber exploitation in the form of fraud and intellectual property theft has cost the nation some $ 1 trillion , according to the Defense Department .
“ Blunting our edge in military technology and enabling foreign competitors to copy the fruits of our commercial innovation has a deeply corrosive effect over the long-term , ” Lynn said .
Thursday 's cybersecurity announcement may spur defense technology innovation . The Defense Department announced it would commit $ 500 million to research . However , it does n't know how Defense will fund long-term cybersecurity initiatives , especially the part of the plan that mixes private and public safety concerns .
“ The legal policy framework as well as the business model here are challenges , ” Lynn said .
The belief that the Earth is at the center of the universe and that the sun circles our planet went out the window in the mid-1500s , after Nicolaus Copernicus published On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres . It became completely discredited when Johannes Kepler added in his two cents a century later . Copernicus , by the way , came 1,800 years after Aristarchus of Samos , who posited a similar theory : that the Earth circles the sun , not the other way around . In that regard , there 's nothing new under the , em , sun .
That is , unless you 're Katheryne Thomas , the director of The Principle , a soon-to-be-released Christian documentary that promises to turn the current knowledge of our galaxy on its head by allegedly returning to the old saw that our sun circles the Earth .
According to Raw Story ,
A new documentary film , narrated by a former Star Trek actress , promotes the long-ago disproven idea that the sun revolves around the Earth . … The film , which is set to be released sometime this spring , was bankrolled in part by the ultra-conservative and anti-Semitic Robert Sungenis , who maintains the blog Galileo Was Wrong .
Here 's the trailer . You 'll hear Sungenis himself claiming that “ You can go on some websites of NASA to see that they 've started to take down stuff that might hint to a geocentric universe . ”
The website for the film says that The Principle is “ destined to become one of the most controversial films of our time , ” because it will present
unexpected evidence of a preferred direction in the cosmos , aligned with our supposedly insignificant Earth .
Whatever that means .
“ The Principle ” features narration by Kate Mulgrew ( “ Star Trek Voyager ” , “ Orange Is The New Black ” , and “ Ryan 's Hope ” ) , stunning animations by BUF Compagnie Paris ( “ Life of Pi ” , “ Thor ” ) , and commentary from prominent scientists including George Ellis , Michio Kaku , Julian Barbour , Lawrence Krauss , and Max Tegmark . Tracing the development of cosmology from its inception ( Stonehenge , the Great Pyramid at Giza ) , through the great revolution of Copernicus , to the astonishing new discoveries of Earth-oriented alignments in the largest structures of our visible universe , “ The Principle ” leads us face-to-face with the question , and the challenge — what does this mean for the future of mankind ?
Forget Captain Kathryn Janeway . The presence of known skeptics like Krauss ( pictured above ) and Kaku should really raise some eyebrows . Were they tricked into doing interviews with Sungenis ' crew and made to look silly with selective editing ? That 's hardly an unknown tactic for some Creationists .
Krauss has called the movie “ nonsense ” and said on Facebook yesterday that he did n't give permission for footage of himself to be used , adding ,
The good thing is that I am hoping that journalists contact me , in the rare chance that more than 3 people actually want to watch this garbage .. and I can tell them it is not worth watching .
I sent Krauss a message , asking if he willingly participated in the movie . Absolutely not , he replied .
Either they used footage of me from other documentaries out of context , or someone interviewed me about other things and cobbled together something to look like it supports this garbage . In any case , I have no involvement with this kind of nonsense .
More as this develops .
* * * Update , Tuesday 1:30 EST * * * : Krauss has a piece up at Slate now , in which he says he will take no legal action and prefers to kill the movie with silence .
US claims employ a pseudo-grammar that has its own rules . If you do n't know those rules , you 're going to get yourself and your clients in trouble . That 's the lesson from this case , not whether or not SW is patentable .
All of the claims begin with an uppercase letter , and yet they all are read to include the introductory “ I claim . . . ” etc . The direct object of the “ I claim ” clause is the preamble of each independent claim as modified by the rest of the independent claim and its dependents . Everything else in a claim set acts as a limitation on the preamble of the independent claim – including structural elements ( if there are any ) and steps ( if there are any ) .
No matter how complex the preamble , somewhere in there there is a noun , which is the subject of the preamble clause , if it is a clause . Otherwise the noun is the direct object of “ I claim. ” That noun is the key to the 101 analysis . That 's what this case is really about .
It stands to reason that all one has to do to avoid a 101 punch-up is to be sure that the subject of the preamble of each independent claim clearly and unambiguously falls within the four statutory categories OR improvements thereon . Pick that noun out , look at it , and be sure it is something that would clearly be considered a process , composition , machine , or manufacture ( whateverthehell those last two terms mean ) .
AV botched it when they claimed in Claim 60 an “ interface ” instead of an “ interface device. ” In the broad view of the courts , there is no doubt that “ interface device ” would avoid any 101 challenge , whether as a machine or manufacture I 'm not sure . But when Claim 60 was written as “ I claim an interface . . . “ it makes no difference what else the claim says , it 's 101 road kill . And it should be . Maybe Phillips could save “ interface ” from a 112 rejection , but forcing the public to dig through the spec to determine what statutory class the noun “ interface ” was meant to convey is nuts .
Claiming an “ interface ” was a daft mistake made by someone who probably should have been better supervised by someone who knew what they were doing . Allowing the claim was equally daft , again , probably by someone who should have been better supervised by someone who knew what they were doing .
It 's a simple rule : The subject matter of what you claim is what the preamble of your independent claim says you claim , therefore make sure the preamble says you claim something that is clearly and unambiguously within the statutory classes . Avoiding 101 conflicts is so simple it amazes me that these issues ever reach the courts .
Sometimes I wonder whether there is n't a class of patent lawyers who set up their claims to fail on examination and/or to attract litigation – it 's got ta ' be good for the bottom line .
I think , as Lauren stated , it has a lot to do with Mao and the Cultural Revolution . I have encountered dozens upon dozens of situations where mainland Chinese have been quite rude .
Several times in the store people would just jump in front of me in line . ( They think selfishly , as one 's own well-being being the most important ) On the train , sometimes the attendant/stewardess would just open the cabin door without knocking . ( They do n't care to be polite , just to do the bare minimum ) People constantly spit on the ground , sometimes even indoors . I have seen people throw litter out the windows of the building I live in . People here often are willing to do whatever it takes to make money , even at the expense of the planet and the well-being of humanity ( Think of all of the factories without pollution controls , etc . ) People are willing to do whatever it takes to have faced/for the admiration of others . ( People will buy a car even when they practically never drive it , only to show off for driving friends or for special events ) I used to say please , thank you , and excuse me all the time . My assistant teacher told me everyone thought I seem too weak and foolish since I was too polite . Since then , I try not to be overly polite any more . In the gym , Chinese guys will always say how foreigners are weaker than them and how I am ugly , have a gut , etc . The funny thing is , I am probably the only competitive powerlifter in the entire gym I go to , yet they just love to bad-mouth me for being a foreigner . In larger cities I do n't think this is as common . I chalk it up to insecurities on their part . They do n't realize I can understand their Chinese . People do n't typically value honesty here . They believe it is foolish to be too honest , and that you will never become successful this way . People love to yell stuff at me when I walk by , not expecting an answer . They might say `` Hello '' , but it 's not for the purpose of conversation , moreso it 's like they are looking at a monkey in the zoo . Some people working in the store will keep an extra close eye on me here , even though I am a pretty clean cut looking guy , just because I am a foreigner . They act as if foreigners are all criminals or something .
Of course , not all of these apply to all Chinese , but I believe it is good to bring these things to light so Chinese people may learn how to become more polite in future generations .
Regular people are cutting back on watering their lawns and heeding those adorable water conservation commercials with an anthropomorphic State of California as our epic dry times rage , but many of the state officials who are preaching water use cutbacks are the biggest offenders , reports the Center for Investigative Reporting , which took a look at the water bills of all the officials who work for water agencies.Turns out , `` nearly half of the officials who supervise the state 's biggest water agencies used more water than the typical California household . '' But the absolute worst serial soaker is a Riverside City Councilmember Mike Soubirous , whose annual usage totaled more than one million freaking gallons of water last year . That 's eight regular households ' worth of water .
`` Do I have to sell my house to set that example , or do I have to just abolish all my shrubs ? '' ( Yes , that last one is a good start , actually . ) `` I do n't know what to do . I do n't know how I can reduce my water rate , '' complains Soubirous , whose one-acre property on a hilltop in Riverside has `` cascades of flowering shrubs and a weeping willow tree . '' He was also reported to be watering his lawn seven nights a week last month , after voting in July to forbid Riverside residents from watering more than four times a week . Is this just a very clever way to promote water conservation ? Is a state official going to call a press conference and walk hand-in-hand across the yard with Soubirous , pointing out all the missed opportunities for conservation and writing down multiple government websites where he could have found this information out on his own ?
Unfortunately , it 's probably not a guerrilla advertising campaign ; actually , it 's likely that this guy is going to keep flooding his lawn while legislating that others do something very different . CIR found that 60 percent of water officials used more water in 2013 ( the driest year on record in California ) than they had in 2012 . One of them was Randy Record , chairman of the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , `` which recently launched an advertising blitz to persuade 19 million people to save water '' and which warned in May that if voluntary restrictions were n't enough to meet goals , the district could start rationing water . ( They also produce the aforementioned cute water-saving commercials for their website about conservation . ) Record used as much water in both 2012 and 2013 as about four families would need ; this year , he says , he 's cutting back by turning off sprinklers for a `` big part of our lawn . '' And so only a mere 1,300 gallons a day flowed onto his property , just about double the SoCal average . That 's progress !

Baseball left Montreal in 2004 , but since then , Expos fans have wanted to get it back . And if they do , it could be a great thing for the Boston Red Sox and the rest of the American League East .
The Expos failed largely because their home field at Olympic Stadium was inconveniently located , unsafe and had poor playing conditions , all of which turned fans away . But with the Tampa Bay Rays boasting the worst average attendance in Major League baseball since 2012 , many are wondering if the league should pack them up and move them to a new stadium in downtown Montreal .
If baseball returned to Montreal and joined the AL East , Red Sox fans could have their own “ Fenway North ” to go with “ Fenway South ” at Baltimore 's Camden Yards . Boston fans in Northern New England and New York Yankees fans upstate would be able to catch games there basically whenever they want . And a move could spark a rivalry with the MLB 's only other Canadian team in the Toronto Blue Jays .
So , should the MLB make the move ? Listen to NESN 's Tom Caron and WCAX Burlington 's Mike McCune discuss it in the video above .

More than half of Donald Trump 's supporters believe a massacre that never happened is evidence his Muslim ban is needed .
Last week , Trump spinner Kellyanne Conway - who coined the phrase 'alternative facts ' complained the media had n't given enough coverage to the `` Bowling Green Massacre '' .
Rightly so , because it never happened .
And yet , a new poll published today found that for 51 % of Trump voters , the Bowling Green Massacre is all the evidence they need that the Muslim ban is necessary .
Overall , just 45 % of Americans support the Executive Order , according to the poll by US firm Public Policy Polling .
And 48 % believe the intention of the Order was to stop Muslims coming into the country .
Do you think the intent of Donald Trump 's order was to stop Muslims entering the country ? Public Policy Polling
While attempting to defend the ban last week , Ms Conway began talking about an apparent mass killing in Bowling Green , a city in Kentucky .
`` I bet it 's brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country , were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre , '' she told MSNBC 's Chris Matthews .
`` Most people do n't know that because it did n't get covered , '' she claimed .
While it is true - and widely reported - that Obama reviewed visa procedures for Iraqi refugees for six months in 2011 , there was no outright ban and it was n't because of a massacre .
Conway was likely referring to the arrests of two Iraqis in Bowling Green six years ago that prompted those temporary restrictions .
Today 's poll also found support for impeaching the president is now evenly balanced among the US public - with 46 % for and against .
Some 58 % of those polled believe the President should release his tax returns - which he promised to do repeatedly during the campaign , but has failed to do .
He has blamed an `` audit '' by the US Internal Revenue Service for his refusal to publish the documents as promised , but the IRS say there is nothing to stop someone being audited publishing their tax returns .
A whopping 62 % of Americans think Trump should fully divest from his businesses . Trump has refused to sell or divest from his property empire , insisting handing it to his two sons puts enough distance between the White House and his money-making enterprises .
The New York Times , which Trump refers to as `` failing '' on an almost daily basis , comes out of the poll very well , with 52 % of those polled saying they found the Grey Lady more credible than President Trump .
Who do you think has more credibility ? Public Policy Polling
And Saturday Night Live , which has lampooned the President with increasingly vicious comedy skits in recent weeks , is considered `` more credible '' than the Leader of the Free World .
Who do you think has more credibility ? Public Policy Polling
The poll also took in a string of Trump 's headline-grabbing policies and pronouncements - all of which had a negative response from voters .
The Wall on the Mexican border ? 56 % disapprove . A 20 % import tax on Mexico ? 55 % oppose .
Some 65 % of those polled thought the Affordable Care Act should be kept and improved , rather than torn up and replaced - and 49 % supported it as-is .
Trump 's overall approval rating continues to be historically low for a new President , with just 43 % approving and 53 % disapproving .
It will make worrying reading for Republicans . Some 49 % of those polled said they would vote Democrat if there were an election tomorrow , compared to just 41 % Republican . And both Senate leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have negative approval ratings .
While the next Presidential election is n't until 2020 , Congress faces a mid-term election in May next year .
The public do n't believe Trump 's claim that millions of illegal voters swung the popular vote in November 's election , leading him to lose by nearly 3million votes , the worst popular defeat for a winning candidate in US history .
And as Trump continues to pick fights with the US judiciary over his Muslim ban , the poll found voters were a lot more likely to trust judges than the President .
Generally speaking who do you trust more to make the right decisions for the United States ? Public Policy Polling
The poll found some 64 % of Americans do not think Donald Trump should be able to overturn decisions by judges he disagrees with .
Public Policy Polling surveyed 712 voters by phone and online on February 7th and 8th . Of those , 45 % said they voted for Hillary Clinton and 43 % for Donald Trump - which is roughly the same as the result of the election .
Windows Azure 's storage service hit a speed bump Thursday , with a full disruption reported across several regions on the company 's status page .
Microsoft ( s msft ) said the issue surfaced at 2:22 p.m. PDT and as of 3:37 p.m. the status post said :

Unemployment in the eurozone hit a fresh high of 18.2 million in August , the EU statistics agency has said .
The number out of work rose by 34,000 , but after the July data was revised up , it meant the unemployment rate remained stable at a record high of 11.4 % .
The highest unemployment rate was recorded in Spain , where 25.1 % of the workforce is out of a job , and the lowest of 4.5 % was recorded in Austria .
The unemployment rate in Germany was 5.5 % , Eurostat said .
'Lost generation '
Last week , the European Commission warned of the existence of `` a real social emergency crisis '' due to the fall in household income and growing household poverty .
Youth unemployment remains a particular concern , with the rate among under-25s hitting 22.8 % across the eurozone , and 52.9 % in Spain .
The commission repeated its call to governments and businesses to act to try to avoid the `` disaster '' of `` a lost generation '' .
In Greece , the most recent figures recorded in June show that more than 50 % of the young workforce has no job .
These two countries have by far the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone , as both governments look to cut spending and raise taxes to try and cut high debt levels .
August unemployment rates Spain : 25.1 %
Portugal : 15.9 %
Ireland : 15 %
Italy : 10.7 %
France : 10.6 %
Germany : 5.5 %
Eurozone : 11.4 %
US : 8.1 %
Japan : 4.1 % Source : Eurostat Euro manufacturing slump 'eases '
These actions , which are needed in Greece to meet the terms of two huge bailouts and in Spain to restore confidence among international investors in Madrid 's ability to repay its debts , have exacerbated the unemployment problem .
The eurozone as a whole is also struggling to generate the economic growth needed to stimulate employment . Its economy shrank by 0.2 % between April and June , with Italy and Spain stuck in recession and France registering no growth for the past three quarters .
The notable exception is the German economy , Europe 's biggest , which grew by 0.3 % in the second quarter .
Across the wider 27-nation European Union , unemployment rose by 49,000 to 25.5 million people , Eurostat said , with the unemployment rate stable at 10.5 % .
A commission spokesman said the total was `` clearly unacceptable '' .
Compared with a year earlier , the unemployment rate rose in 20 countries , fell in six and remained stable in the UK .
By way of comparison , the unemployment rate in the US was 8.1 % in August and 4.1 % in Japan .
Child poverty fears
The European Commission said last week that disparities between the best and worst performing economies had continued to widen in the second quarter of the year .
It also expressed concern about the social situation , which remained `` very serious '' .
The number of people experiencing financial stress remains historically high , it said in its latest quarterly review of the jobs situation across the European Union .
Household incomes had declined dramatically in Greece , where disposable incomes had dropped by 15.7 % between 2009 and 2011 , the commission said . Households in Ireland were living on 9 % less .
Child poverty was also becoming an issue for an increasing number of households , particularly in countries where child benefits are inadequate .
Almost a fifth of families is at risk of poverty in Spain , Greece , Italy and Portugal , the review said .
Have you ever had one of those moments where a completely random thought enters your mind and you think , “ Would n't it be funny if… ” ? This happened to me one day as I walked past a co-worker 's cubicle and pondered what playful thing I could do that might poke at him in the right way to make him laugh .
For any chance of success at something like this you need to have an idea of what your target – for lack of a better word – loves . Said coworker had mentioned his former Lego collection with fondness enough that it immediately came to mind , and I decided that one day he would arrive to find some piece of his computer had been replaced with one made of Lego Bricks .
The peripheral of choice : a keyboard . It seemed like something that would lend itself well to the medium and I was sure somebody on the web had done this already that could provide some pointers . Unfortunately that assumption appeared incorrect . I found case mods , mouse mods , and USB mods , but no keyboard . I found an entire Lego computer , but none of the parts were functional and I wanted mine to actually work . So I set out on the project knowing there were two huge strikes against me :
1 ) Any Lego building I ever did was according to the assembly instructions included with my brother 's spaceships
2 ) I did n't know how a keyboard worked and , unless you count the one I tossed out a 5th story dorm window , had never taken one apart .
Yep , this was going to be one heck of a project . Here 's how I tackled it .
Step 1 : Understand the Keyboard
It seems every keyboard out there these days has extra buttons all over it to control music and launch applications . After visiting a few of the chain stores I picked up a Manhattan Enhanced PS/2 keyboard at a small shop in the local mall for about $ 12 .
I could n't wait to crack it open , and when I finally did a bunch of little pieces flew at me.It looked like I had three main components to work with - the touchpad , the plastic bubble things ( yes , that is a technical term ) , and the cord .
Next I visited my friendly neighbourhood Toys ‘ R Us in search of blocks and a building surface . I came home with a red Lego tub and one grey base plate . I put all of the plastic bubbles into a container and placed the touchpad on the Lego base . It was n't wide enough , but was longer than I needed and could therefore be cut to fit . The two pieces would then be attached using other Lego bricks . The thick row of blocks in the picture below served as my guide while cutting the board .
The touch pad did n't line up exactly with the bumps on the plate.I found the red and yellow roof pieces were the perfect shape for locking securely to the board while still holding the keypad down so it did n't slip .
I also built a few sample keys and balanced them on the bubbles .
Once I convinced myself that this thing might actually work I constructed all of the keys to make sure I had enough pieces . Square keys received a single for a base as shown above . When I ran out of those pieces I used cylinders and , in the final case , three round flat red pieces stacked onto each other . Larger keys received 1x2s or squares .
When I placed them on the original keyboard I had a colorful mess . I decided to color code the keys according to the following schema :
Letters – Blue
Numbers – White
Punctuation – Green
F-keys and Arrows – Yellow
Windows – Black
Others – Red
At this point the only part I had n't figured out was the cord . In the original keyboard a black backing piece sandwiched part of the touchpad between itself and a small circuit board , then was fastened to the top of the case with a pair of screws .
I had hoped I could attach these using the Lego flowers , but soon discovered that the sensors on the board and the touchpad have to be pressed together tightly for all of the keys to work.My next failed attempt was to remove the plastic pieces from the original board for the screws to be put into.The final solution was the 68 cent purchase of a pair of screws , nuts , and bolts from the local hardware store .
Step 5 : Initial Assembly
To keep the touch pad level a hole needed to be cut into the Lego base wide enough to fit the bar screwed into the circuit board .
It is at this point that I cut the excess grey plate away from the bottom of my assembly and decided to attach it to the back.This gave the base a bit more strength and , coupled with the hole , provided a natural crevice for the bar to rest in.I placed the touchpad back on the plate and built up the shell to hold it in place , cutting into one brick to allow the cord to pass through.The result looked like this :
Placement of the keys is important as there 's a limited area on the touchpad where a press will be registered . I plugged the keyboard into my desktop so that I could test each key as I created it . I began by gluing the plastic bubbles to the touch pad .
Next , I applied glue to the bottom pieces of the keys and attached them to the bubbles.I ran into a few different problems at this stage .
1 ) Something about the 2x2 squares did n't register the key press . Once I swapped them for a pair of 1x2 rectangles they seemed to work fine .
2 ) The return key did n't work when pressed on the top portion of the ‘ L ' . I added more Lego bricks to the bottom so that if pressure is still applied after it has hit the board the stroke will register .
3 ) The space bar was wobbly . Attaching a spring to one side of it helped make it more stable .
4 ) The light for the scroll lock does n't work , though it 's clear something happens when the key is pressed . I managed to freeze myself out of a number of Linux terminals during testing .
Leaving the brown circuit board exposed did n't look quite right . The Lego pieces I attached to it and put over the lights are the only other ones in the project to be glued .
I also took advantage of the bumpy surface of the plate section I had attached to the bottom and used it to connect a pair of fences to prop up the entire board . The pictures do n't quite do it justice , but the final product looks something like this :
Final Parts List :
1 Manhattan Enhanced PS/2 Keyboard
1 Lego X-Large Grey Plate ( # 628 )
1 Lego Special Edition Creative Building Tub ( # 6092 )
1 Tube Krazy Glue
1 X-Acto Knife ( # 2 blade )
2 Machine Screws
2 Nuts
2 Washers
Other Notes :
- Most serious Lego builders will not use glue on their creations . I tried to keep to that as best as I could , but it was unavoidable in some cases . Lego blocks on top of other Lego blocks have not been glued . Lego blocks on top of original keyboard components have been .
- The current construction of the keys is a bit flimsy and they tend to flex as fingers are slid from one to the next . It would take some careful placement and cutting , but I think this could be fixed using a second grey plate . If the holes were in the right locations it could be snapped into place around the support pieces before the key caps ( the part the fingers rest on ) are attached . This would prevent them from moving side to side and only allow an up/down motion . It would also better protect the touchpad .
- A spring might be more useful on the Enter key than the thick stack of blocks I used .
- When the warnings on the glue bottle say to use it in a well ventilated area , they are n't kidding .
- SAFETY TIP : Some Lego pieces can be cut into easier than others . The clear 1x2 rectangle was the most difficult to take a chunk out of and the grey plate was the easiest . I somehow managed to get through this without cutting myself , though a few times I did conclude that people who live alone should not play with extremely sharp knives . The more detailed cutting will also pop up a lot of little plastic fragments . I recommend safety glasses just in case .
Conclusion :
I dubbed myself a total loser when I initially took this on , but I think it may be the coolest random project I 've done to date . It 's not perfect , but it does work and most of the bricks are reusable . Given the strikes I mentioned before I consider both of these things a huge accomplishment .
Unlike services for disabled children , programs for gifted children have no single federal agency to track them . A survey by the National Association for Gifted Children found that 22 states did not contribute toward the costs of programs for gifted children , and five other states spent less than $ 250,000 .
Since that survey , released in 2002 , the outlook for programs for the gifted has grown harsher . In Michigan , state aid for gifted students fell from more than $ 4 million a year to $ 250,000 . Illinois , which was spending $ 19 million a year on programs for fast learners , eliminated state financing for them . New York was spending $ 14 million a year on education for the gifted but has now cut all money earmarked for gifted children , saying districts should pay for them out of block grants . Nearly one in four school districts in Connecticut have eliminated their programs for gifted students .
The new federal education law , known as No Child Left Behind , `` has almost taken gifted off the radar screen in terms of people being worried about that group of learners , '' said Joyce L. Vantassel-Baska , executive director of the Center for Gifted Education at the College of William and Mary .
'' In a tight budget environment , '' Ms. Vantassel-Baska said , `` the decisions made about what gets dropped or not funded tend to disfavor the smaller programs . ''
Missouri was reimbursing districts for 75 percent of the cost of educating gifted children but has reduced the contribution to 58 percent . In Mountain Grove , an aging base of voters rejected a proposed tax levy in February . Schools are now planning to cut seven teachers in the elementary grades , public financing of team sports and transportation service within the town 's boundaries .
'' There are some mandates that you must do from the feds and the state , '' Mr. Tyrrell said , citing programs for disabled children as an example . '' Those will be the last to go . ''
No Child Left Behind is silent on the education of gifted children . Under the law , schools must test students annually in reading and math from third grade to eighth grade , and once in high school .

Schools receiving federal antipoverty money must show that more students each year are passing standardized tests or face expensive and progressively more severe consequences .
As long as students pass the exams , the federal law offers no rewards for raising the scores of high achievers , or punishment if their progress lags .
Eugene Hickok , acting deputy secretary for elementary and secondary education at the federal Education Department , called the closing of programs for highly intelligent children an unfortunate , `` unintended consequence '' of No Child Left Behind . '' Laws by definition are rather blunt instruments , '' Dr. Hickok said .

He said he did not believe that No Child Left Behind alone was responsible , adding that some districts blamed the law unfairly . '' It 's running for cover to say we ca n't deal with your needs because our fundamental requirement is to serve these other kids , '' Dr. Hickok said .
He said the administration was not considering revising the law to protect programs for gifted children , calling such programs a matter of `` state and local control . ''
The tough choices , in Mountain Grove and districts around the country , are fueling emotional debates about educational fairness and where districts should focus limited resources . Among some educators and parents , special consideration for gifted children appears to attract resentment , and here in Mountain Grove , the parents of gifted children , while concerned , seem reluctant to demand extra enrichment .
Bridget Williams , the principal of Mountain Grove Middle School , maintains that very bright children do not deserve specially tailored classes , especially when the district is focusing on bringing all children up to a minimum standard of competence .
'' Are they more important than a special-ed kid ? '' Ms. Williams asked in an interview with other administrators . Some teachers did not like to release their smartest students from regular classes , and one perennial dispute involved whether or not students who attended the classes for the gifted should have to make up homework from their regular classrooms .
Ms. Williams said it was not so much the education , but merely status , that gifted children lost when their program was cut in September . '' They lost the title , '' she said .

Others contend that cutting programs for such students threatens the nation 's future by stunting the intellectual growth of the next generation of innovators . Not only do gifted children learn faster , but often they learn in a different way , experts say .
'' Many of them will never , ever achieve their potential without some type of advanced learning opportunities and resources , '' said Joseph S. Renzulli , director of the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented at the University of Connecticut . '' Equity goes both ways . It means we 're going to accommodate the needs of students , whether they 're struggling , average or above-average learners . ''
Carolyn Groves , who taught gifted education here for seven years , fashioned creative projects intended to stretch the critical thinking of her students . One unit put `` Nursery Rhymes on Trial , '' while in another , middle-school students created the government of Utopia . '' Mind benders '' gave students systematic rules for deconstructing challenging mathematical questions .
'' People say , 'These kids are smart . They 're going to make it anyway , ' `` Ms. Groves said . But experts say that gifted children can easily grow bored and alienated .
'' These are the kids who are either going to turn out to be nuclear scientists or Unabombers , '' said Ms. Groves , who now teaches high school remedial students at the vocational school . '' It all depends on which way they 're led . ''
Some parents of Mountain Grove 's brightest children try to make up for the elimination of programs for the gifted . Mr. Walker and his wife , Marilyn , shuttle Audrey to dance and Spanish lessons . They encourage her interest in filmmaking by helping her develop ideas for movies she shoots on the family 's video camera . Mr. Walker said he worried , though , about other promising children whose parents were too poor or overworked to offer their own children similar enrichment .
These days , Mr. Walker said , Audrey no longer enjoys school and frequently asks to stay home .
In small towns like Mountain Grove , Mr. Walker said , `` a tremendous amount of frustration can build up in these kids , because they 're different , but they do n't know why . '' When she participated in the classes for the gifted , Audrey felt less isolated for her bookishness and learned to manage frustration that used to crush her , when her efforts did not live up to her vision .
On a deeper level , Mr. Walker said he worried about the message Mountain Grove was sending to its most promising students . '' Yes , they may achieve great things , '' Mr. Walker said . '' But I do n't think they 'll achieve the greatest things that they 're capable of . It 's saying it 's all right to aim for mediocrity . ''

USA Network is investing in original scripted programming on Sundays , but it is n't for the reasons you 'd imagine .
Two months after premium cable network Starz shifted its entire lineup of originals from Saturdays to Sundays to be part of the `` prestige '' conversation , USA Network is moving into the crowded filed but looking to draw a different kind of audience .
Already home to repeats of Law & Order : SVU on the night , USA announced Wednesday that its forthcoming drama Eyewitness would debut Sunday , Oct. 16 at 10 p.m. and creating a night of procedurals .
To hear USA and Syfy Entertainment Networks president Chris McCumber tell it , USA 's move to replace Canadian import Motive on Sundays with crime thriller Eyewitness has nothing to do with being part of a night of programming that is home to critical favorites including Game of Thrones , Billions , Shameless , Outlander , The Walking Dead and Girls , among others .
`` We decided to put it on Sunday . It 's not exactly about opening up a Sunday night ; it was because we 've had Law & Order : SVU as a stack there the past few years , '' he told THR . `` That does consistently well on Sunday nights . If we have a crime drama audience there already , why not put one of our new crime dramas in there among that stack and program directly toward that audience ? ''
Picked up straight to series in January with an eye on landing in the Sunday night procedural slot , the drama is based on the Norwegian crime thriller Oyevitne . It centers on two innocent teenage boys who secretly witness a shooting in the forest and barely escape with their lives . Desperate to keep their relationship a secret and in fear of being found by the shooter , they remain silent , but soon learn that what has been seen can not be unseen and witnessing such a horrible event changes everything .
Julianne Nicholson stars as Helen Torrance , a former big-city homicide detective who left her harrowing career to become a small-town sheriff and loving wife . However , a gruesome crime thrusts her back into the traumas of her past — just as she 's begun her hardest case yet : being a foster mother to a teenage boy .
Helping USA 's strategy for the show is the fact that its procedural audience is already familiar with Nicholson , who starred on Law & Order : Criminal Intent — repeats of which used to air on the cable network .
Eyewitness will take over the 10 p.m. hour currently occupied by Canadian import Motive with SVU repeats serving as the lead-in for the drama , with more of the Dick Wolf procedural running afterward .
`` The Sunday night SVU stack has been one that we 've consistently promoted — for example , we do stuff around different themes , whether it 's hairstyles or whatever it is , '' McCumber said . `` You 've got an audience there leaning in to this kind of stuff . The way we schedule , we look at where can you find an audience that 's already leaning in on that night . Mr . Robot on Wednesday when we launched it there last year paired well with Suits and we still see that now . The opportunity is you have an audience that 's already leaning in , let 's put the other show in there . ''
Asked specifically if he hopes Eyewitness would help open a night of prestige programming that in success could see the drama paired with other originals vs. syndicated repeats , McCumber was optimistic .
`` Possibly . We 'll see what happens . The only way you can tell is once you start programming it in and seeing how people react to it and being patient with it , '' he said . `` If you look at the ratings for the USA on a Sunday when we do stacks like that , you can see the build of the audience — starting at 5 or 6 p.m. and building all the way into the 10 p.m. hour and sometimes beyond that . We run SVU after midnight as well . We 'll see how it performs there and if it works , great , and if it does n't , we 'll figure out another place for it . '' For the USA , the Eyewitness strategy is similar to how the network originally scheduled critical darling Mr . Robot . McCumber notes the Emmy-nominated drama brings in the richest and youngest audiences of all of USA 's originals and is paired with recently renewed Suits for a specific reason .
`` We saw great crossover between Suits . If you look at different pockets of the audience , Robot is one of the richest audiences we have , bar none , across the network with the highest income , '' McCumber said . `` Suits is the second-highest income that we have . So we have a type of audience that already is leaning into this type of sophisticated drama . That 's why that pairing worked for us and continues to work for us . ''
As for Mr . Robot 's lackluster linear ratings , McCumber is n't worried .
`` It has done amazing things for the USA Network across the board and for our studio as well , '' he said . `` The way we look at every original series now is how do you build a franchise out of that original series and do that across the network and with the studio . Those young and rich audiences are n't watching live TV the way that they used to ; they 're watching it on every other platform . Every piece of research we have — VOD ratings , all of last year — you can see that far and beyond of any show that 's on the USA Network is an ultra-time shifted show . When I look at Robot , I look at a big picture : We built and are continuing to build a franchise that 's profitable , that 's prestigious , that audiences love and we know they 're really dedicated to . We keep building from there . The linear rating is one very small sliver , especially in this case . ''
Intelligence and ignorance have never learned how to coexist .
A prime example of this is technology business magnate Elon Musk and our President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe : report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort 's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE . These are two men whose extremely different views about the earth 's future will eventually lead them into an unavoidable fight .
ADVERTISEMENT
It is highly unlikely that the two will duke it out one-on-one in a ring , but we can definitely expect things to heat up a bit , resulting in strong language , criticism and maybe even a power struggle in the upcoming years .
Musk does not appear to be the one picking a fight . Even before the election , he was very careful not to make any direct candidate endorsements . His most opinionated statement about Trump in the past year has been , “ I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy . ”
The statement , expressing whether or not Trump should become president , was made a few days before the election in an interview where Elon commented on how the electoral outcome would affect Tesla as a company .
In his defense , he attempted to express his general disappointment with the candidate choices by saying , “ I do n't think this is the finest moment in our democracy , ” in the same CNBC interview .
The news outlet might have made it sound like he was saying , “ do n't vote for Trump , ” but those who listened to the recording know that he kept his opinion neutral . The only acknowledgment Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders : ' I fully expect ' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed ' 2016 primary Sanders : 'Damn right ' I 'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes ' Former Sanders campaign spokesman : Clinton staff are 'biggest a -- holes in American politics ' MORE ever got from Elon was when he agreed with her economy and environmental policies , which probably was n't even worth mentioning .
This brings us to the narrow-minded “ if you are not with us , you are against us ” attitude that some Trump supporters have . There have already been provocations by the political action committee ( PAC ) Citizens for the Republic , which is starting a propaganda against Musk and his businesses .
The PAC , which supports Trump , is very eager to vilify renewable energy and has made a special effort to target businesses that are owned by Musk .
Fake news and propaganda against Tesla Motors , SolarCity and SpaceX are so widely disseminated that they 've begun to form clusters like the website Stop Elon From Failing Again . This hateful collection that someone had the audacity to call a “ database ” contains heaps of nonsensical content of ill-informed or purposely misleading writers .
What it calls opinion are just baseless accusations that Musk 's companies have been living on our government 's back sprinkled with wildly untrue information about renewable energy .
As chief executive officer of an energy consultancy and someone who has worked in the energy sector for a decent portion of my life , it was hard for me to read those concoctions aimed to brainwash our less informed fellow men and women .
How has our President-elect acted in the meantime ?
Well , he 's neither supporting nor speaking against the work of Citizens for the Republic . Same as Elon , he seems to be reluctant to meet his opponent head-on and just allows the hatred to simmer .
Musk has already done the math and believes that a Trump presidency will not impede his company 's success and Trump still does n't see Musk as any kind of real threat to his presidency . Still , this passive-aggressive bubble is getting bigger and will have to burst sooner or later . How will all of this affect us ? Who knows .
Here we have one man in power who does n't believe in climate change and another very powerful man who has devoted his life to prevent it from happening . Even though Musk is reacting calmly to the developments , many believe that it 's only a matter of time before he slides into one of his long argument-supported rants .
To Musk , someone speaking against him is probably way more tolerable than someone starting a slur campaign against renewable energy . Negating the effects of greenhouse gases and the importance of clean energy is going against life , or even worse , going against science and progress .
Since Trump is the policymaker , Musk will probably have to throw the first punch in this hypothetical fight . But as a well calculated man , he will not do it before he knows that he can win the battle . Fortunately , there are plenty of allies that can improve his odds .
Though the U.S is more divided than ever , the world has already decided to go renewable . Even countries that have historically been more stubborn to change have already decided to try and fight climate change . Those resisting progress will quickly find themselves on the wrong side of history , so I certainly hope our President-elect wises up .
A fight should always be the last resort and though one seems to be brewing , it should not mean that one needs to happen . Now that Trump has climbed the top , he should be able to see further and gain a better perspective of how things stand .
With a little luck , that will be enough to change his mind . At the very least , it should curb some of his more radical views about renewable energy .

Last November , Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) co-sponsored legislation along with Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart ( R-Fla. ) demanding that President Obama label the Muslim Brotherhood an official foreign terrorist organization . The Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act prefaces its conclusions with comprehensive research and historical precedent . `` Multiple countries have declared the Society of the Muslim Brothers ( commonly known as the ‘ ‘ Muslim Brotherhood '' ) a terrorist organization or proscribed the group from operating in their countries , '' begins the bill . The bill did n't make it through the winding roads of bureaucracy as a result of the Obama administration 's apparent sympathies for the Islamist group , but now , President-elect Donald Trump 's advisors are vowing to push through that same piece of legislation when the Republican victor assumes the oath of office in January .
According to foreign policy advisor Walid Phares , the Trump administration will work toward advancing legislation designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization . Phares shared the administration 's future plans with Egyptian news outlet Youm7 .
In late 2015 , the bill was referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where it now sits dormant .
Cruz 's bill should hardly be a point of contention . The text is plainly worded , speaking volumes to the notorious legacy of the Brotherhood . And yet , the Obama administration 's sympathetic perspective toward Islam as a political theology has led to concerted leftist efforts to obstruct Cruz 's sober-minded efforts against Islamic fascism .
The Left , in particular , can not reconcile the fact that political Islam poses a threat to national security domestically and international stability abroad ; the reality of Islamic fascism fails to resonate with a movement so invested in demonizing the West .
To be clear , the Muslim Brotherhood is unequivocally a terrorist organization . Those that defend its merits are terrorist sympathizers . The history of the self-proclaimed `` political group '' is marred by bloodshed , violence , and moral depravity . Like Boko Haram , al-Shabab , and ISIS , the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist death cult masquerading as a religio-political movement .
The most recognizable arm of the Muslim Brotherhood operates from the jihadist epicenter of Egyptian fringe politics . According to the BBC 's comprehensive profile , the group is plagued by underlying contradictions . `` Founded by Hassan al-Banna , the Muslim Brotherhood - or al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun in Arabic - has influenced Islamist movements around the world with its model of political activism combined with Islamic charity work , '' documents the BBC . `` The movement initially aimed simply to spread Islamic morals and good works , but soon became involved in politics , particularly the fight to rid Egypt of British colonial control and cleanse it of all Western influence . ''
The Brotherhood 's anti-West animus informs its violent political philosophies and Islamic supremacist doctrines . `` While the Ikhwan say that they support democratic principles , one of the group 's stated aims is to create a state ruled by Islamic law , or Sharia . Its most famous slogan , used worldwide , is : 'Islam is the solution , '' notes the BBC .
Grounded in the teachings of the Koran and the Hadiths , the Muslim Brotherhood is ambivalent about the modern nation-state and hostile to secular democracy . Operating from the underbelly of Egyptian society and undermining democratic reforms for several decades , the Brotherhood reached its zenith in 2012 when it helped oust Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and elect party loyalist Mohammad Morsi . After threatening to override the constitutionally-sanctioned safeguards of judicial checks and balances on the executive office of the Egyptian presidency , Morsi was deposed by a second people 's revolution . Fortunately , the crisis of a new Islamic theocracy in the Middle East was averted , and the Muslim Brotherhood again faded back into the shadows .
Nevertheless , the ideology and political influence of the Brotherhood has spread across the Middle East , especially after the failure of the Arab Spring . According to the Anti-Defamation League , `` Many of its members ... have engaged in terrorist activities and the group has spawned numerous terrorist groups , such as Hamas and Egyptian Islamic Jihad . '' As a collective , the group is suspected to be responsible for the 2002 suicide bombing in Grozny as well as the unprovoked shooting massacre of 50 Syrian artillery cadets at the military academy in Aleppo .
While the future Trump administration 's expected hands-off policy with Russia is unsettling , its plan to label the Muslim Brotherhood as a “ designated terrorist organization ” should be commended . Cruz got the ball rolling . Now it 's up to President-elect Trump to hold the Brotherhood accountable for its nefarious ideology and history of terrorism .
The chairman and ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee want answers from the Obama administration on cell-site “ simulators , ” which are reportedly used by law enforcement to track suspects but also have the potential to capture information on cellphones in their vicinity .
In a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson , Sens . Patrick J. Leahy , Vermont Democrat , and Charles E. Grassley , Iowa Republican , asked about federal policy and the usage of the simulators .
“ The Judiciary Committee needs a broader understanding of the full range of law enforcement agencies that use this technology , the policies in place to protect the privacy interests of those whose information might be collected using these devices , and the legal process that DOJ and DHS entities seek prior to using them , ” the senators wrote in the letter dated Dec. 23 and released Wednesday .
The senators cite a November article from the Wall Street Journal that reported the Justice Department is targeting criminal suspects using the devices , which mimic cellphone towers and can also snag information and general phone locations of innocent Americans .
While not confirming or denying the existence of such a program , a Justice Department official told the paper that agencies comply with federal law , including by seeking court approval , and that discussion of such matters would allow suspects or foreign powers to determine U.S. surveillance capabilities .
The senators also wrote that after briefings by FBI officials with staffers , the FBI changed its policy so that it now obtains a search warrant before deploying a simulator , with “ a number of potentially broad exemptions . ”

Those exemptions include cases that pose an imminent public safety danger , cases that involve a fugitive , and cases where technology is being used in public places or areas the agency determines there 's no “ reasonable ” expectation of privacy .
Among other things , the senators asked for details about the FBI 's use of the simulators since Jan. 1 , 2010 , through the effective date of the new policy , and then afterward , as well as the agency 's policy on retaining and destroying information collected by the simulators .
Beyond this specific issue , the debate over privacy and data collection has been front in center in Congress this year .
Earlier in December , the Obama administration said it renewed for 90 days the National Security Agency 's program that collects and temporarily stores information on the dates and durations of phone calls to see if there are any ties associated with terrorism .
Senate Republicans filibustered a bill to halt the program after a different version easily won passage in the House earlier in the year . President Obama says he has taken steps to limit the snooping , such as asking investigators to get a court 's sign-off , but opponents say the administration is relying on a faulty reading of the post-9/11 Patriot Act to justify the program .

In a self-described bold move , the security firm Internet Identity released a statement this week in which it prognosticated that the Internet will become a murder weapon by 2014 .
The predictions read like some kind of cyberpunk nightmare , with Internet Identity ( IID ) president and CTO Rod Rasmussen writing that the increased connectivity of vehicles and medical devices will eventually allow fiends to kill via their Internet connection . IID points to remotely operated pacemakers and self-driving cars that could be hijacked .
`` With so many devices being Internet connected , it makes murdering people remotely relatively simple , at least from a technical perspective , '' writes Rasmussen . He continues , `` if human history shows us anything , if you can find a new way to kill , it will be eventually be used . ''
The IID release goes on to outline a bleak vision of the near future . They believe that by 2014 we will see an increase in the use of malware in conflicts between nations ; that there will be a successful breach at a major piece of infrastructure , such as a power plant ; that military hardware , such as drones , will be hijacked with `` real-world consequences . ''
IID 's claims are grandiose , to say the least , but there is some truth to them . Cybersecurity is no longer an issue of hardened computer systems , but of an interconnected world of devices and services providing more potential points of entry – many of which go overlooked . Take , for example , Ang Cui who demonstrated how VoIP phones and networked printers could be used to remotely gather information .
The concerns over state-controlled cyberweapons , particularly those used by nations , is a very real one as the likely origins of Stuxnet 's revealed . Concerns about defending the computer networks at critical infrastructure has been echoed by high ranking officials and even grabbed some headlines . And though armed drones , for the moment , are limited to overseas operations , their computer systems struggle with a very real ( though as yet mundane ) malware problem .
Of course , the problem with IID 's claims about death-by-Internet is that there is far more incentive to steal and sell personal information via an Internet connection than , say , hacking someone 's pacemaker . After all , a dead man ca n't continue to send checks to various and sundry Nigerian princes .
In their statement , Radmussen comes close to explaining why IID 's predictions are the way they are .
`` Being bold is predicting the end of the world this week coinciding with the end of the Mayan long-count calendar as some people are , '' he writes . `` What is n't bold in cybersecurity is prognosticating the same old with more mobile malware , APTs giving cybercriminals backdoor access to their intended victims and even more data breaches of Fortune 500 companies as most industry pundits are . ''
More pedestrian , to be sure , but also more likely .
Following in the footsteps of IID my personal `` bold '' predictions for 2014 include surgical computer implants , cyber jockeys engaged in dangerous adventures on the net , electrowizards with mohawks listening to exotic computer generated music , and people with the entire text of William Gibson 's Mona Lisa Overdrive tattooed on their body .

Story highlights Veteran , 89 , seeks work to save him from 'dying of boredom '
Joe Bartley has been offered two jobs since posting the advertisement
London ( CNN ) When 89-year-old war veteran Joe Bartley placed an advertisement in his local paper in South Devon , England , last month looking for work he was n't expecting much .
`` Senior citizen , 89 , seeks employment in Paignton area . 20hrs+ per week . Still able to clean , light gardening , DIY and anything . I have references . Old soldier , airborne forces . Save me from dying of boredom ! '' the advert read .
He says his phone has been ringing off the hook ever since .
Joe Bartley 's job advertisement in the Herald Express newspaper .
`` I 've been flabbergasted . When I put the advert in I thought , 'Who is going to take any notice of a man seeking employment at age 89 ? ' '' Bartley told CNN over the phone .
Since Bartley took out advertisements in the Torquay Herald Express on November 16 , and again a week later on November 23 , he says he 's been on `` telly '' and `` online , '' interviewed by press as far afield as Sweden .

A correctional worker at the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility in Burnside has lost her job for allegedly kissing an inmate and other breaches of a code of professional conduct , CBC News has learned .
Documents obtained through the provincial Freedom of Information Act say the January incident happened in the jail 's library . The names of the male offender and female correctional worker have been withheld .
Another worker who said he witnessed the incident reported it to a supervisor .
In a report dated Jan. 27 , the witness wrote that he `` walked past the library door which was closed and looked in the window of the library and seen what appeared to be officer [ redacted ] and offender [ redacted ] kissing each other at the back area of the library . ''
In subsequent interviews with officials — including the deputy superintendent of operations — the inmate and correctional worker denied they had any physical contact with one another .
According to a written summary of the interview , she did receive items from the inmate .
`` When asked for specifics regarding offender [ redacted ] she said she had received hand drawn pictures , Christmas cards and letters from him that could be classified as personal , '' wrote Tracy Dominix , the deputy superintendent of operations .
`` When asked if she thought this should be reported to the captain , she acknowledged that it should have been reported and that she should have told the offender that he should not be writing to her . ''
'She had crossed the line '
According to the documents , the correctional worker admitted to taking the inmate to the library on `` several occasions and would stay for an extended duration '' but maintained they never had physical contact .
She said her peers `` advised her that she should not be spending so much time '' with the inmate and admitted that `` she had crossed the line . ''
Staff searched the inmate 's cell and found letters addressed to a correctional worker . It 's not known who they were addressed to because the worker 's name is redacted .
Staff also found notes indicating possible drug activity within the facility .
The inmate , who was also interviewed by officials , denied having any physical contact with the correctional worker but said `` he loved her and cared for her '' and `` planned on changing his life so they could be together in the future . ''
`` He truly has a bond with her and has never felt this way , '' the documents say .
Greg McCamon spent more than 25 years working in corrections , including almost three years as deputy superintendent of operations at the Burnside jail . He now teaches young correctional workers at a college in Lower Sackville .
He said personal relationships between inmates and correctional workers have always been prohibited .
Compromises security , says expert
`` It compromises security of the facility , it 's unethical for the correctional officer to do it , '' said McCamon .
`` If they 're breaking their ethics in that way , it raises a lot of concern among the rest of the staff in the institution when they find out it 's going on . ''
According to the written summary , the correctional worker admitted to not following proper protocol , including failing to pat down the inmate for contraband before leaving his cell .
McCamon said that may seem like a small thing , but it is n't .

`` An inmate could have contraband in their cell and they may want to move it to another unit so they 'll take it and hide it in the library . The person from the other unit — when they use the library — they 'll pick it up and move it to the other unit , '' he said .
The documents say the correctional worker was placed on administrative leave during the investigation .
`` What I can tell you is the correctional officer in question is no longer employed with the facility , '' said Nova Scotia Justice Minister Lena Diab .
Neither the union nor the Department of Justice will say whether the officer was eventually fired or resigned .
Editors note : Despite this being April 1 , or 'April Fools ' Day ' , this story is not a fabrication nor a joke . For background to this story , head this way .
Under new UK legislation , Internet service and broadband providers will be obligated to pass personal browsing , email and call data to the intelligence services for real-time processing .
`` Internet firms '' could also include social networks and search engines , such as Facebook , Twitter , and Google -- - all of which have a presence in the UK -- - along with broadband providers . Access to ISP logs will be opened up to the government on-demand .
The 'third ' UK intelligence service , GCHQ , the signals and electronics eavesdropping station based in Cheltenham , currently process call , web , and email data , such as when communications were made , but not the contents of such data .
ISPs , however , do process this data at their facilities and datacenters . These new plans would force ISPs to 'mirror ' all traffic through GCHQ allowing for more detailed inspection on a law enforcement level to quickly process information as it happens .
A Home Office spokesperson confirmed the upcoming legislation could be implemented as `` soon as parliamentary time allows '' .
`` It is vital that police and security services are able to obtain communications data in certain circumstances to investigate serious crime and terrorism and to protect the public , '' a spokesperson said in an emailed statement .
`` Communications data includes time , duration and dialling numbers of a phone call , or an email address . It does not include the content of any phone call or email and it is not the intention of Government to make changes to the existing legal basis for the interception of communications . ''
Currently under UK law , GCHQ along with police and other law enforcement agencies , would have to present a Home Secretary-issued or court-ordered search warrant to ISPs to force handing over the data for inspection .
The new legislation would still require a search warrant to access the specific details of calls , emails and Web activity . Such personal content can still be requested under a search warrant presented to the ISP , though GCHQ will not process this data automatically .
But it will allow the intelligence services to trace people 's communications with others , who they are contacting , and how often for .
The “ contact not content ” rule applies in that police , law enforcement and intelligence services are interested in who people communicate with , rather than the contents of the communication itself .
But the new measures would force ISPs to install routing hardware in their facilities to open up access to GCHQ as and when it is necessary .
The legislation is expected to be announced at the Queen 's Speech in May . The speech is the only communication the Queen gives that is not written by her . It is written by legislators , specifically at Downing Street , the home and office of the prime minister .
The previous Labour government pushed for similar legislation -- - a time post the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York , and the July 7 London bombings . In hindsight , it seemed like a breach of civil liberties , in an age where subjective anti-social behaviour ( ASBO ) injunctions could prevent individuals from doing certain things along with when and in specific places , and control orders would impose 'house arrest ' like sanctions on suspected terrorists .
The proposals were shot down by the then opposition Conservative government , but now in power seek to bring these plans into law by the end of the year .

Dustin Fletcher looks set to represent Australia one last time in the 2015 International Rules series
THE CAREER of Essendon champion Dustin Fletcher has one final chapter to play out with the 400-gamer set to represent Australia in November 's International Rules Series .
It is understood Fletcher was put through his paces in a secret training session two weeks ago by Australian officials including Alastair Clarkson , in the midst of Hawthorn 's quest for a fourth premiership under his reign .
Despite not adding to his 400-game tally after a groin injury suffered in round nine , Fletcher is understood to be fit to represent the team for the one-off Test against Ireland at Dublin 's Croke Park in November .
Clarkson was joined by Hawks fitness lieutenant Andrew Russell and selector Gerard Healy in the private session at a local park , just a day out from the Hawks ' do-or-die semi-final against Adelaide .
Fletcher was asked to prove his fitness for the tour , which will also include a week 's stopover in New York .
After representing Australia last year as goalkeeper , the 40-year-old is set to play in his fifth series between the sticks .
Fletcher did not return phone calls on Tuesday when contacted for comment .
Mitt Romney�s �exotic� tax problem
Posted by Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake
For years , President�s Obama�s political opponents have used his background � Kenyan father , Kansan mother , raised in Indonesia and Hawaii � to cast him as somehow exotic , someone whose life makes it hard for him to understand the average American .
And yet , it�s Mitt Romney , Obama�s general election opponent , who is now dealing with an �exotic� issue that is centered on his considerable wealth and being played out in the ongoing fight over whether he will release more than two years worth of tax returns .
�He is an extremely wealthy man , � Steve Schmidt , who managed Sen. John McCain�s ( R-Ariz. ) 2008 presidential campaign and was involved in the vetting of Romney for vice president , said during an appearance Sunday on NBC�s �Meet the Press� . �His tax returns do not look anything like the average American�s.�
Schmidt hit the nail on the head in assessing the political problem of Romney�s tax returns � and also lays out the most likely explanation for why the former Massachusetts governor and his campaign have been so stingy about releasing more .

Well , that clears it up , right ? Not exactly , insofar as ( 1 ) Schmidt earlier said he did�t actually review Mitt�s tax returns himself ; ( 2 ) he�s also said Romney�s wealth was indeed the big disqualifier ; and ( 3 ) he�s an operative for a political party that thinks rich folks pay too much in taxes .
Steve Schmidt is about as reliable an authority for �vetting� Romney�s financial and tax records for us as Mitt�s buddy Donald Trump . And maybe that�s the next figure the GOP will trot out to vouch for him .

CBS News
CBS News Poll analysis by the CBS News Polling Unit : Sarah Dutton , Jennifer De Pinto , Fred Backus and Anthony Salvanto .
Former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney holds a two-point lead against President Obama in a potential general election matchup , according to a new CBS News poll .
The survey found that Romney is the only GOP candidate to hold a lead over the president in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup , though Texas Rep. Ron Paul trails by just one point .
Both Romney 's lead over Mr. Obama - 47 percent to 45 percent - and Mr. Obama 's lead over Paul - 46 percent to 45 percent - are within the survey 's three percentage point margin of error .
The poll found Mr. Obama with leads of at least four points over the other major Republican presidential candidates . The president leads former Sen. Rick Santorum 47 percent to 43 percent ; he leads Texas Gov . Rick Perry 49 percent to 42 percent ; he leads former Utah Gov . Jon Huntsman 48 percent to 41 percent ; and he leads former Newt Gingrich 49 percent to 41 percent .
The survey was taken from Jan. 4-8 , in the wake of Romney 's narrow victory over Santorum in the Iowa caucuses .
Huntsman looks to gain on Romney in NH
Romney and Paul 's relatively strong showings are driven by support from independent voters . Romney leads Mr. Obama by six points among independent voters , 45 percent to 59 percent , and Paul leads the president by seven points among independents , 47 percent to 40 percent . Independents favored Mr. Obama over the other GOP candidates .
Romney had the most support among Republican voters , garnering 90 percent support . The worst performing candidates among Republicans was Huntsman , with 80 percent support , followed by Gingrich and Paul , with 81 percent support each .
Romney 's campaign has argued that Republicans should rally around the former Massachusetts governor in part because he is the most likely to beat Mr. Obama in November . His rivals , including Gingrich , have challenged that claim , with Gingrich pointing to Romney 's inability to win over more than 30 percent of Republicans in state and national polls .
Romney , who leads the field with 19 percent support in the new survey , is far more likely than any other Republican to be seen as a general election winner ; 49 percent say he has the best chance to beat Mr. Obama , followed by Gingrich at 13 percent .

Americans divided over Obama
Obama Approval Rating
Loading ...
The survey shows Mr. Obama 's approval rating at 45 percent , a two point drop from last month . Forty-seven percent disapprove of Mr. Obama 's performance on the job .
Eighty-four percent of Democrats approve of Mr. Obama 's performance , while 86 percent of Republicans disapprove . Independents are not enthusiastic about Mr. Obama 's performance : 49 percent disapprove , while 38 percent approve .
The president 's job approval rating has been below 50 percent for most of the past year and a half . Presidents typically win reelection when their approval rating is above ( or very near ) 50 percent , and lose when it is below that level .
On the economy - the issue voters overwhelmingly cite as the most important - Mr. Obama 's approval rating is just 38 percent , down two points from December . Fifty-five percent disapprove of his handling of the economy .
Mr. Obama fares better on foreign policy : There , 46 percent approve of his performance , while 37 percent disapprove .
Pessimism over the economy , Congress and the direction of the country
The survey finds that Americans are widely pessimistic about their economy , their country 's direction and their representatives in Congress . Eighty percent describe the condition of the economy as fairly or very bad , while just 19 percent call it at least somewhat good .
Meanwhile , while 25 percent say the economy is getting better , a larger percentage - 29 percent - say it is getting worse . ( Forty-five percent say the economy is stagnant . ) And sixty-five percent say the nation is on the wrong track , while just 29 percent say it is headed in the right direction .
Still , there are signs of an improved perception : The percentage that describes the economy as at least somewhat good is up nine points since September , while the percentage that say the economy is getting better is up 13 points since that month . And the percentage that says the country is headed in the right direction is up 10 points since September .
In addition , Americans are optimistic about the New Year : 40 percent expect 2012 to be better than 2011 , while just 11 percent expect 2012 to be worse . ( 46 percent said 2012 will be the same as 2011 ) .
Congress remains deeply unpopular : Just 12 percent approve of the job Congress is doing , while 80 percent disapprove . Democrats are most critical , with 85 percent disapproval , followed by independents at 82 percent and Republicans at 74 percent .

Stop and Frisk

Posted in WikinutWritingSociety & Issues
This article is about my reaction to the judge Shira Scheindlin 's decision that the New York City Police Department must end its Stop and Frisk Program last year .
The Criminalization of Ethnic Minorities in New York City
Yes , I agree with Judge Shira Scheindlin 's decision that the New York City Police Department must end the stop and frisk program because it violates a person 's constitutional right . In addition , stop and frisk targets predominantly young African-American and Hispanic males . It is a small victory for decent people living in New York City .
I somewhat think the Stop and Frisk policy was instrumental in the decline of crime in the city , but also driven apart the humane relationship within the community between police and the citizens . The policy has not made people in the high crime areas feel any safer or protected by those in law enforcement who are paid to protect them . If law enforcements , community residents , and leaders work together peacefully , they can identify the criminals and reduce the crime rate within the high crime rate areas .
I experienced stop and frisk four times last year for taking a walk within my community or just simply walking to the subway . These incidents happened in Harlem , the Upper West Side , and the Bronx . Innocent people should not have to be embarrassed , humiliated , or stopped by police for not doing anything menacing or threatening to raise suspicion for stop and frisk .
NAYPYITAW , Myanmar/UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday condemned rights abuses in Rakhine state and said violators would be punished , but she did not address U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing , drawing cool international responses and calls for action to help minority Muslims .
Suu Kyi made the remarks in her first address to the nation since attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on Aug. 25 led to a military response that has forced 421,000 Rohingya Muslims , more than half of them children , into neighboring Bangladesh .
Western diplomats and aid officials , hoping for an unequivocal condemnation of violence and hate speech , welcomed the tone of the Nobel Peace laureate 's message , but some doubted if she had done enough to deflect global criticism .
Long feted in the West as a champion of democracy in the Buddhist-majority country during years of military rule and house arrest , Suu Kyi has faced growing criticism for saying little about abuses faced by the Rohingya .
“ We condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence . We are committed to the restoration of peace and stability and rule of law throughout the state , ” Suu Kyi said in her address in the capital , Naypyitaw .
“ Action will be taken against all people , regardless of their religion , race and political position , who go against the law of the land and violate human rights , ” she said .
In a phone call to Suu Kyi , U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson welcomed the Myanmar government 's commitment to allow the return of refugees , but urged it to facilitate humanitarian aid to those affected by the violence and to address “ deeply troubling ” human rights abuse allegations , the State Department said .
Britain said it had suspended its military training program in Myanmar and French President Emmanuel Macron condemned “ unacceptable ethnic cleaning ” . He told the annual U.N. General Assembly he would start a U.N. Security Council initiative to ensure humanitarian access and an end to the violence .
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the General Assembly : “ The authorities in Myanmar must end the military operations , allow unhindered humanitarian access and recognize the right of refugees to return in safety and dignity ; and they must also address the grievances of the Rohingya , whose status has been left unresolved for far too long . ”
A European Union spokeswoman said Suu Kyi 's invitation to the diplomatic corps to visit Rakhine was “ a step forward , ” but added : “ Myanmar 's leadership needs to show that the democracy they fought so hard for can work for all the people of Myanmar , beyond ethnic , social and religious boundaries . ”
At the General Assembly , Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari likened the violence in Myanmar to genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda , while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan cited the international community 's failure in Syria .
“ Unless the tragedy taking place in Myanmar is brought to a halt , humanity will have to live with the shame of another dark stain in its history , ” Erdoğan said .
Twenty-two members of the U.S. Congress wrote to Tillerson calling for a “ strong , meaningful ” response to the crisis and the head of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Bob Corker , said Suu Kyi risked “ destroying ” her reputation as a force for positive change .
“ She had yet another opportunity today to stand up for the Rohingya minority ... but instead refused to acknowledge the military 's role in the ongoing atrocities , ” he said .
Amnesty International described Suu Kyi 's speech as “ little more than a mix of untruths and victim-blaming ” , saying she and her government were “ burying their heads in the sand ” for ignoring the army 's role in the violence .
Myanmar 's generals remain in full charge of security and Suu Kyi did not comment on the military or its actions , except to say there had been “ no armed clashes and there have been no clearance operations ” since Sept. 5 .

Right monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population . The U.N. rights agency said it was “ a textbook example of ethnic cleansing ” .
Myanmar rejects the charge , saying its forces are tackling insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who it has accused of setting the fires and attacking civilians .
Western governments that backed Suu Kyi 's campaign against military rule still see her as the best hope for Myanmar 's political and economic transition .
But she has to avoid angering the powerful army and alienating supporters by being seen to take the side of a Muslim minority that enjoys little sympathy in a country that has seen a surge of Buddhist nationalism .
Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch said satellite images showed about half of all Rohingya villages had been torched and it was time that Suu Kyi , the government and military faced the fact that the security forces “ shoot and kill who they want . ”
‘ READY TO EXPLODE '
Suu Kyi , 72 , said her government had been promoting harmony between the Muslim and largely Buddhist ethnic Rakhine communities . But a government official there did not share her optimism .

“ They have no trust for each other , ” the state 's secretary , Tin Maung Swe , told Reuters , adding that tensions were high .
“ The situation is ready to explode . ”
Suu Kyi said she was committed to recommendations made by the advisory team led by Kofi Annan , a former U.N. secretary-general , which last month suggested a review of a law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless .
On the return of refugees , Suu Kyi said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process and “ refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem ” .
Obama administration secretly preparing options for aiding the Syrian opposition
As the violence in Syria spirals out of control , top officials in President Barack Obama ‘ s administration are quietly preparing options for how to assist the Syrian opposition , including gaming out the unlikely option of setting up a no-fly zone in Syria and preparing for another major diplomatic initiative .
Critics on Capitol Hill accuse the Obama administration of being slow to react to the quickening deterioration of the security situation in Syria , where more than 5,000 people have died , according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights . Many lawmakers say the White House is once again `` leading from behind , '' while the Turks , the French , and the Arab League — which sent an observer mission to Syria this week — pursue more aggressive strategies for pressuring the Assad regime . But U.S. officials insist that they are moving cautiously to avoid destabilizing Syria further , and to make sure they know as much as possible about the country 's complex dynamics before getting more involved .
The administration does see the status quo in Syria as unsustainable . Bashar al-Assad ‘ s regime is a `` dead man walking , '' State Department official Fred Hof said this month . Now , the administration is ramping up its policymaking machinery on the issue after several weeks of having no top-level administration meetings to discuss the Syria crisis . The National Security Council ( NSC ) has begun an informal , quiet interagency process to create and collect options for aiding the Syrian opposition , two administration officials confirmed to The Cable .
The process , led by NSC Senior Director Steve Simon , involves only a few select officials from State , Defense , Treasury , and other relevant agencies . The group is unusually small , presumably to prevent media leaks , and the administration is not using the normal process of Interagency Policy Committee , Deputies Committee , or Principals Committee meetings , the officials said . ( Another key official inside the discussions is Hof , who is leading the interactions with Syrian opposition leaders and U.S . allies . )
The options under consideration include establishing a humanitarian corridor or safe zone for civilians in Syria along the Turkish border , extending humanitarian aid to the Syrian rebels , providing medical aid to Syrian clinics , engaging more with the external and internal opposition , forming an international contact group , or appointing a special coordinator for working with the Syrian opposition ( as was done in Libya ) , according to the two officials , both of whom are familiar with the discussions but not in attendance at the meetings .
`` The interagency is now looking at options for Syria , but it 's still at the preliminary stage , '' one official said . `` There are many people in the administration that realize the status quo is unsustainable and there is an internal recognition that existing financial sanctions are not going to bring down the Syrian regime in the near future . ''
After imposing several rounds of financial sanctions on Syrian regime leaders , the focus is now shifting to assisting the opposition directly . The interagency process is still ongoing and the NSC has tasked State and DOD to present options in the near future , but nothing has been decided , said the officials — one of whom told The Cable that the administration was being intentionally careful out of concern about what comes next in Syria .
`` Due to the incredible and far-reaching ramifications of the Syrian problem set , people are being very cautious , '' the official said . `` The criticism could be we 're not doing enough to change the status quo because we 're leading from behind . But the reason we are being so cautious is because when you look at the possible ramifications , it 's mindboggling . ''
A power vacuum in the country , loose weapons of mass destruction , a refugee crisis , and unrest across the region are just a few of the problems that could attend the collapse of the Assad regime , the official said .
`` This is n't Libya . What happens in Libya stays in Libya , but that is not going to happen in Syria . The stakes are higher , '' the official said . `` Right now , we see the risks of moving too fast as higher than the risks of moving too slow . ''
The option of establishing a humanitarian corridor is seen as extremely unlikely because it would require establishing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria , which would likely involve large-scale attacks on Syrian air defense and military command-and-control systems .
`` That 's theoretically one of the options , but it 's so far out of the realm that no one is thinking about that seriously at the moment , '' another administration official said .
Although the opposition is decidedly split on the issue , Burhan Ghalioun , the president of the opposition Syrian National Council ( SNC ) , earlier this month called on the international community to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria .
`` Our main objective is finding mechanisms to protect civilians and stop the killing machine , '' said Ghalioun . `` We say it is imperative to use forceful measures to force the regime to respect human rights . ''
Is the U.S. bark worse than its bite ?
Rhetorically , the administration has been active in calling for Assad to step aside and emphasizing the rights of Syrian protesters , despite the lack of clear policy to achieve either result . `` The United States continues to believe that the only way to bring about the change that the Syrian people deserve is for Bashar al-Assad to leave power , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Dec. 21 .
On Tuesday , Dec. 27 , the administration hinted at stronger action if the Syrian government does n't let the Arab League monitors do their work . `` If the Syrian regime continues to resist and disregard Arab League efforts , the international community will consider other means to protect Syrian civilians , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement .
The SNC , the primary organization representing the opposition , has been very clear that it is seeking more than rhetorical support from the United States and the international community . An extensive policy paper titled , `` Safe Area for Syria , '' edited by SNC member Ausama Monajed , laid out the argument for armed intervention by the international community to aid Syrian civilians .
`` The Syrian National Council ( SNC ) is entering a critical phase in the Syrian revolution whereby the hope of a continued campaign of passive resistance to an exceptionally brutal and unrestrained regime is becoming more and more akin to a suicide pact , '' the paper stated .
But Washington is uncomfortable acting in concert with the SNC : Officials say there is a lack of confidence that the SNC , which is strongly influenced by expatriate Syrians , has the full support of the internal opposition . U.S. officials are also wary of supporting the Syria Free Army , made up of Syrian military defectors and armed locals , as they do not want to be seen as becoming militarily engaged against the regime — a story line they fear that Assad could use for his own propaganda , officials said .
There is also some internal bureaucratic wrangling at play . This summer , when the issue of sending emergency medical equipment into Syria came up in a formal interagency meeting , disputes over jurisdiction stalled progress on the discussion , officials told The Cable . No medical aid was sent .
For now , the administration is content to let the Arab League monitoring mission play out and await its Jan. 20 report . The officials said that the administration hopes to use the report to begin a new diplomatic initiative in late January at the U.N. Security Council to condemn Assad and authorize direct assistance to the opposition .
The officials acknowledged that this new initiative could fail due to Russian support for the Assad regime . If that occurs , the administration would work with its allies such as France and Turkey to establish their own justification for non-military humanitarian intervention in Syria , based on evidence from the Arab League report and other independent reporting on Assad 's human rights abuses . This process could take weeks , however , meaning that material assistance from the United States to the Syrian opposition probably would n't flow at least until late February or early March . Between now and then , hundreds or even thousands more could be killed .
There is also disagreement within the administration about whether the Arab League observer mission is credible and objective .
`` This is an Arab issue right now , and the Arab League is really showing initiative for the first time in a long time , '' said one administration official .
`` [ The Arab League monitoring mission ] is all Kabuki theatre , '' said another administration official who does not work directly on Syria . `` We 're intentionally setting the bar too high [ for intervention ] as means of maintaining the status quo , which is to do nothing . ''
Andrew Tabler , a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , said that the administration was caught offguard by how the opposition became militarized so quickly . The administration 's message had been to urge the opposition to remain peaceful , but that ship has now sailed , he said .
`` We have a pretty strong policy of not engaging the Syria Free Army directly , because earlier it was agreed that peaceful protesters had the moral high ground over the regime and were more able to encourage defections , '' he said . `` But there was no clear light at the end of that peaceful protest strategy . We assumed , incorrectly , that the civil resistance strategies used in Egypt and Tunisia were being adopted by the Syrian opposition , but that did n't happen . ''
Most experts in Washington have a deep skepticism toward the Arab League monitoring mission . For one thing , it is led by a Sudanese general who has been accused of founding the Arab militias that wreaked havoc in Darfur . Also , many doubts that 150 monitors that will eventually be in Syria can cover the vast number of protests and monitor such a large country .
The Assad regime has also been accused of subverting the monitoring mission by moving political prisoners to military sites that are off-limits to monitors , repositioning tanks away from cities only when monitors are present , and having soldiers pose as police to downplay the military 's role in cracking down on the protesters .
`` It seems awfully risky for the U.S. to be putting its chips all in on that mission , '' said Tony Badran , a research fellow with the conservative Foundation for Defense of Democracies . `` There never was a serious mechanism for it to be a strong initiative . ''
Badran said that the Arab League monitoring mission just gives the Assad regime time and space to maneuver , and provides Russia with another excuse to delay international action on Syria .
`` Now you understand why the Russians pushed the Syrians to accept the monitors , '' he said . `` It allows the Syrians to delay the emergence of consensus . ''
Brian Katulis , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , said the administration is trying to balance the value of protecting civilians with the interests of trying to ensure a measure of stability in Syria .
`` The biggest thing is extensive consultation with as many international allies as possible . That 's another feature of this administration , '' said Katulis . `` And when change does come to Syria , the Syrians have to own it . ''
National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor did not respond to requests for comment .

While urban design has focused on the engineering of movement , it has ignored the issues of beauty , social engagement and livability that inspire emotional connections to the city . Who could be in love with the oceans of asphalt and the concrete canyons of Pembina Highway ?
Beasley described that since the Second World War , urban planning in cities like Winnipeg has been primarily an exercise in vehicle management , trading the human experience for the conveniences of modern life .
Marking the end of the 2010 Cultural Capital celebrations , the Winnipeg Arts Council invited former Vancouver senior community planner Larry Beasley to the City is Still Breathing Symposium to discuss how this type of urban love affair can be a defining factor in the image , physical expression and economy of a city .
The stars of the romantic comedy Sex and the City spent six seasons searching for love . Relationships came and went , Big , Aidan and the Russian , but the love affair that remained constant was the one they had with their city . Their emotional connection to the vibrancy , character and style of New York was the show 's consistent thread .

KEN GIGLIOTTI / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS ARCHIVES Once derided as a needless extravagance , Esplanade Riel is now a beloved civic icon thanks to its emotional connection with Winnipeggers .
The stars of the romantic comedy Sex and the City spent six seasons searching for love . Relationships came and went , Big , Aidan and the Russian , but the love affair that remained constant was the one they had with their city . Their emotional connection to the vibrancy , character and style of New York was the show 's consistent thread .
Marking the end of the 2010 Cultural Capital celebrations , the Winnipeg Arts Council invited former Vancouver senior community planner Larry Beasley to the City is Still Breathing Symposium to discuss how this type of urban love affair can be a defining factor in the image , physical expression and economy of a city .
Beasley described that since the Second World War , urban planning in cities like Winnipeg has been primarily an exercise in vehicle management , trading the human experience for the conveniences of modern life .
While urban design has focused on the engineering of movement , it has ignored the issues of beauty , social engagement and livability that inspire emotional connections to the city . Who could be in love with the oceans of asphalt and the concrete canyons of Pembina Highway ?
Beasley believes that with today 's fluid movement of people and capital , an urban competition to attract growth and investment is developing . The winners of this competition will not be the cities that manage their traffic most efficiently , but those that inspire an emotional urban relationship with its citizens and visitors .
The great cities of the future will be the ones that successfully reintroduce the human spirit into their urban environment . Cities that invest in creative architecture , public art , green space and the urban streetscape while promoting vibrancy through density and mixed-use development will be the ones that rekindle an urban love affair with its people . The modern transient economy will no longer settle for inhumane solutions to urban design .
Beasley maintains when people fall in love with their city , a snowball effect occurs .
The typical public malaise for issues of design quality fade away as people take greater pride and interest in their built environment . Neighbourhood design guidelines and review committees form as citizens re-engage in the dialogue of making their city a better place .
No longer is development accepted blindly , but scrutinized for its architectural quality and neighbourhood appropriateness . Architects and developers are forced to consider issues beyond their individual buildings and find solutions that respond appropriately to the public needs of the community .
Ask any Winnipegger which street they love most . The answer will probably not be Regent or Kenaston but more likely Broadway , Corydon or Wellington Crescent .
These streets possess the character and identity that evokes a personal connection to place . This emotional response can be a design objective for all areas of development , from new suburbs to the restoration of core-area neighbourhoods .
Our young people do not flock to cities like Vancouver looking for bigger roads and better parking . They are searching for a city to be in love with . Jogging along the sea wall , shopping on Robson or taking the Sky Train to work , are the types of experiences they are seeking and we must provide in order to compete .
Over the years , Winnipeg has been a difficult place to love .
Our civic leadership has generally been reactive to short-term gain , instead of working toward a cohesive vision for our city .
Our architecture has often met only the lowest standards of quality in materiality , composition and contextual relationship . We have long been content with development for development 's sake and have often ignored issues of beauty , style and personal engagement in the design of our communities .
Allowing cherished historic buildings to be demolished , the proliferation of windswept parking lots and the complete banishment of people from the corner of Portage and Main are all examples of this lack of consideration for the human experience in our urban planning . It is difficult to fall in love with those concrete barriers .
The results of incorporating elegance and beauty into what could have been a pragmatic piece of infrastructure can be seen with Esplanade Riel . When under construction , it was widely criticized as a needless extravagance , but the emotional connection we have to it today has established it as a beloved civic icon .
Larry Beasley has challenged us to follow the lead of projects like this , to look beyond zoning and transportation patterns and to view our urban design through the lens of human experience . By constructing places from the downtown core to the farthest suburbs that are beautiful , joyful and capable of inspiring an emotional response , we will reignite our civic passion for this city .
By promoting inspirational architecture , vibrant public spaces that foster social engagement , as well as efficient transportation systems , we will begin to see a social , economic and physical transformation of our city while revealing the true power of an urban love affair .

Columbus Crew SC Columbus Crew SC Portland Timbers 1 2 FT Game Details GameCast
Lineups and Stats
Portland Timbers won the MLS Cup final for the first time in their history as they claimed a 2-1 victory over Columbus Crew in an error-strewn clash .
The Oregon franchise , who only played their first MLS game four years ago , raced to a two-goal lead after just seven minutes having cashed in on goalkeeper Steve Clark 's mishap inside 27 seconds and then benefited from a glaring error from the officials in the build-up to Rodney Wallace 's second .
Ex-Middlesbrough striker Kei Kamara pulled one back following a mad goalmouth scramble and although Portland hit the woodwork three times in the second half , their one-goal advantage proved to be enough .
Less than 30 seconds were on the clock when Diego Valeri broke the deadlock by capitalising on Clark 's lax attitude .
The goalkeeper 's touch behind him from a Michael Parkhurst back pass was loose and Valeri closed him down and slid in to divert the ball home as Clark attempted to clear .
Portland smelt blood and were soon 2-0 up when Wallace headed home in controversial fashion .
Alvas Powell clearly received a pass that had gone out of play and Tony Tchani paused expecting a whistle when the ball came back on to the field .
However , that was not forthcoming and Darlington Nagbe robbed him and set up an attack which culminated in Wallace directing his diving header into the far corner from Lucas Melano 's cross .
The messy nature of the showpiece game continued when the Crew pulled one back in the 18th minute through Kamara .
Timbers keeper Adam Kwarasey flapped at a routine punch and , although neither Kamara nor Federico Higuain were able to stab the ball home at first , the latter pivoted and drilled home between Powell 's legs on the line .
Clark then turned Fanendo Adi 's shot into the side netting as a barmy 45 minutes drew to a close .
It was Portland who created the better chances in the second period and a slice of fortune and the woodwork twice saved Columbus in quick succession .
Parkhurst originally stopped a corner on the line before Kamara shanked a clearance against the crossbar , with the ball coming down and hitting Parkhurst 's arm , then the post , before the Crew 's captain eventually removed the danger .
Portland would then strike the post again through Adi 's header , with Clark almost fumbling the rebound into his own net in another gaffe .
Clark at least kept his team in it by using both of his legs to keep out Nat Borchers ' header on the line and then brilliantly pushing Adi 's shot over , but it was his original error that led to his own team 's downfall , and Portland 's historic success .
The title is the Timbers ' first in Major League Soccer , after joining the league five years ago . The city 's only other major professional sports title came in 1977 when the TrailBlazers won the NBA championship .
Things are moving fast and in what feels like every realm . The foreign element is very much tied to domestic control , where it feels internal legitimacy is connected to USG 's foreign muscle . If it seems to be in every sphere of interaction , it is by design . It is not just America 's NGO and dollar weapons . An incredibly interesting article on the new era of unrestricted warfare clues us into what is going on globally .
Unrestricted warfare is back , but not in the old notion of ‘ anything goes ' with regards to fighting on the battlefield . It now means all weapons on all battlefields that affect your opponent .
From the article :
Colonels Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui argued that war was no longer about “ using armed forces to compel the enemy to submit to one 's will ” in the classic Clausewitzian sense . Rather , they asserted that war had evolved to “ using all means , including armed force or non-armed force , military and non-military , and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one 's interests. ” The barrier between soldiers and civilians would fundamentally be erased , because the battle would be everywhere . The number of new battlefields would be “ virtually infinite , ” and could include environmental warfare , financial warfare , trade warfare , cultural warfare , and legal warfare , to name just a few . They wrote of assassinating financial speculators to safeguard a nation 's financial security , setting up slush funds to influence opponents ' legislatures and governments , and buying controlling shares of stocks to convert an adversary 's major television and newspapers outlets into tools of media warfare .
This makes sense , if you 've read some Sun-Tzu . Take a look at Chinese “ vendor financing ” of the American consumer through their reserve recycling process . Reserve recycling alters the interest rates of your opponent , giving you leverage . The American economy , being based on finance , becomes susceptible to the lender on the margin just as much as it is dependent on the borrower on the margin for expansion . The Reserves become a weapon . The Saudi Arabians are threatening to sell off reserves and cause market problems , but China holds a billion or so more than the nervous kingdom . This is from a 1999 paper by the Chinese , so the idea of them accumulating reserves and getting into a quasi-MAD situation with USG in economics offered protection .
There is no single battlefield .
This is being proclaimed as new , but that statement can only be made with willful blindness with regards to any hegemon and any modern war . The USG has been using the World Bank , IMF , media , rating agencies , etc . to impose its will on any challengers or defectors . The North Vietnamese won because of the Blue Empire 's control of American media , campuses , and congressional funding . The British before America used financial means to manipulate pieces on the global chessboard . Lord Cromer only served brilliantly because he was first put there to make sure Egypt could pay back the millions they had borrowed from large Continental European and British banks .
The element that is new is the amazing amplification of individuals that an interconnected world continuously feeds . The macro push for greater connection via globalization and the micro push for technological control and connectivity has created problems . From later in the article :
In 1999 , the ability to assault all elements of an opponent 's society seemed to require the resources or sponsorship of a powerful nation state . Now , an increasingly interconnected world allows adversaries at keyboards — from states to terrorist groups to disgruntled citizens — to instantly vault oceans and continents to strike at any element of another nation and society without ever having to encounter defending military forces . A basement hacker in Sarajevo can target the City of London 's financial networks one moment and a Brazilian municipal power grid the next — and never change out of her pajamas .
Thomas Friedman has discussed the idea in his books over a decade ago of a flat world with amplified humans . Friedman would not argue the negative side to this , as he has argued for decades that globalization is a boon to humanity . Adding in an increasingly paralyzed-by-fake-trauma Western leftist mindset , people like the hacker Weev can take advantage of open printers to broadcast a counter-progressive message of “ wow just wow ” hate through the Internet .
This is only going to grow and embolden not just rising sovereign states versus the current American hyperpower or possible defector states , but also grant immense power to individuals and small cabals . Russia is accused of funding nationalist parties in Europe . Google already plays this game with their aid in the Egyptian protests and even offers of aiding Syrian defectors to topple Assad . Google has immense resources . While economics and money will matter , it will not just leave men like George Soros , Mark Zuckerberg or the Koch brothers as billionaires playing with the world like a game of Risk . The flip side to those men and their power would be their fears if an individual just happened to arm a little drone with a simple rifle .
It would take time for that individual power level that Nick Land calls X-Risk Democratization . The point where individuals or even a small group of men could become Bond villains is in the distance , and right now the American Imperium is in a dynamic moment . The current chaos in the EU may have states not entirely onboard the suicide cult train thinking of alternatives . Rather than a nuke or a competent air force , pursuing strategic capabilities for weaponization need not involve massive capital involvement , nor be entirely of a military threatening manner . In the meantime as the USG imperial sands shift , expansion of the battlefield greatly helps current vassals of the USG system .

Ta-Nehisi Coates started blogging for The Atlantic on August 4 , 2008 . His first post was titled “ Sullivan… McArdle… Fallows… Coates ? ? ? ” and it laid down his terms from the start : “ My only rule , really , is simple , ” he wrote . “ Do n't be a jerk to people you disagree with. ” He 'd been hired to fill the slot left in the magazine 's roster of bloggers by Matt Yglesias , and he addressed how he 'd be coming at the role differently . “ Matt has a fairly amazing ability to comment , from a left perspective , on a wide range of issues… Knowing my own limits , I 'll take a different tack . On things I 'm not so sure on , I 'll state my opinion rather gingerly and then hope my commenters can fill in the gaps . ”
The blog would soon be widely lauded for the keenness and clarity of its ideas , the power of its language , and for its unexpected ability to host real , substantive conversations in the comments—an extreme rarity on big-name websites . Coates , then a relatively unknown writer , would go on to win a 2013 National Magazine Award for “ Fear of a Black President , ” an essay published in The Atlantic 's print edition , while a selection of nine posts from his blog would be named a 2014 finalist in the National Magazine Awards ' “ columns and commentary ” category .
So how did Coates foster a comment section in which—wonder of wonders—intelligent adults thoughtfully share ideas and knowledge , and where trolling , rudeness and bad faith are n't tolerated ? I asked Coates and other players in the blog 's success—editors , moderators and commenters—to look back on what makes it work .
* * *
Coates joined The Atlantic 's roster of bloggers in the heat of the 2008 election season , and the race between John McCain and Barack Obama was the focus of many of his early posts . Another blogger who was preoccupied with the battle was Andrew Sullivan , whose Daily Dish was still hosted by The Atlantic at the time , and many of Coates ' early commenters arrived by way of a link from his more established labelmate . Impressed by the quality of the writing and the comments , they came back again and again , enjoying not just the possibility of interacting in a sane , constructive way with each other , but with Coates too . He often appeared in the comments : clarifying his point of view , responding to criticism , and acknowledging when others had a point .
For Ta-Nehisi Coates , the nature of his forum was a deliberate choice from the outset . “ I wanted a comment section that I wanted to read , ” he told me . As an African American , he said , he was turned off by the naked racism that was routinely permitted to stand below most political blogs . His gaming background also played into his vision of the comments and the blog posts as a cohesive whole , an ongoing discussion . The comments , he believed , should be part of the content .
Beyond the ongoing political coverage , Coates quickly began to establish some of the blog 's secondary themes and enthusiasms : music , poetry , football , comic books and Dungeons & Dragons . All the while , the ranks of regular commenters were growing—and they were becoming an essential part of the whole project : Coates frequently highlighted particular insights , pulling them into blog posts of their own , and , as he 'd promised from the start , he increasingly turned to the commenters for information about areas he did n't know well—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , for instance . Blog posts sometimes consisted entirely of a request for input in the comments .
The rules of the space were evolving , too . Trolling was verboten , and commenters were discouraged from responding to people who were obviously looking to provoke ; he did n't want the discussion devolving into an un-resolvable argument . ( The blog 's homegrown etiquette was later codified in what became known as the “ dinner party rules. ” ) As the blog grew in popularity , Coates ' reminders about bad behavior became more frequent ; repeat offenders were banned , and sometimes , he had to resort to closing comments on a post entirely .
But the hard line was also part of the appeal . Commenter Stephen Matlock , who initially went by the handle “ BetweenTwoWorlds ” before reverting to his real name , recalled : “ Having an honest , adult engagement with Coates was bracing . So was the general sense that people told the truth , or were sent packing . People who came in to disrupt were reprimanded and then blocked , even banned , and their digressions deleted—along with all the people , including me , who jumped in to correct . Coates tried again and again to get us to leave the people posting in bad faith alone . I was a bad student , who took many lessons to learn , but eventually I got better . ”
By late 2008 , threads could stretch into hundreds of comments , and threadjacking and derailing was becoming an increasing problem ( although often , the digressions were as informative and worthwhile as the on-topic comments ) . To compensate for keeping people strictly on task in the regular threads , Coates started posting open threads—sometimes for a specific event , like an NFL game or the Mad Men season finale , and sometimes as a pure free-for-all . Those threads were where the regulars started to really get to know each other , and develop their own shorthand , nicknames , and inside jokes . Somewhere along the way , the commenters adopted the name “ Golden Horde ” for themselves , while Coates , in the group vernacular , became “ the Khan . ”
In April 2009 , the open threads were formalized into a daily event : the Open Thread at Noon , or OTAN for short . That 's when Bob Cohn , then the top digital editor and now The Atlantic 's president and COO , began to take note . “ I first clued in to the real power of his platform when he began writing posts at lunchtime headlined : ‘ Open Thread at Noon . ' The entire text of the post that followed was : ‘ It 's yours… . ' That 's all , ” Cohn says . “ Within minutes , the Horde began talking among themselves—about politics , about football , about hip hop , about race , about videogames , and , often , about Ta-Nehisi himself . He simply declared his comments thread open for business , and everyone flocked . He could get hundreds of comments in the first hour . That 's when I knew he had built something special . ”
* * *
The best proof of the caliber of comments and commenters that Coates ' blog attracted is probably the story of Cynic . “ Cynic ” was the handle adopted by Yoni Appelbaum , then a PhD student at Brandeis University , when he started commenting during the 2008 election run-up . His comments were unfailingly thorough , thoughtful and respectful , and Coates often flagged his contributions in follow-up posts .
Then , as Appelbaum recalls it , Coates contacted him “ because he had deduced that I was a historian , ” and he had some questions that related to his own historical work . They began to keep in touch outside the comment section , and in June 2010 , Coates asked Appelbaum to turn a long comment he 'd posted about Ulysses S. Grant into a standalone blog post . That one post was followed by a guest-blogging stint for Appelbaum—still identified only as “ Cynic. ” Not too long after that , Appelbaum was recruited right out of the comment section , and given a steady role—and a proper byline—as an online contributor to The Atlantic .
“ In March 2011 , my phone rang . And it was Bob Cohn of The Atlantic , ” Appelbaum says . “ That 's not a phone call you can really turn away . So I started contributing regularly then . ”
Last month , after nearly three years of writing for the site , Appelbaum got another promotion : once a pseudonymous commenter , he 's now the full-time Politics Editor for The Atlantic 's digital operation .

Throughout 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , the blog continued to grow in popularity and in profile . The OTANs were a fixture , and the group added other recurring items : a regular Mad Men thread , and an online book club focused on the history of the Civil War , dubbed the “ Effete Liberal Book Club. ” The longtime Horde members had also created a private forum for themselves elsewhere on the web ; meet-ups were occurring across the country , and “ meatspace ” —that is , offline—relationships were being formed .
The Atlantic published Coates ' “ Fear of a Black President ” in the September 2012 issue , and in May 2013 the essay won a National Magazine Award . In a blog post written the day after the awards gala , Coates gave partial credit to the Horde for the piece 's development and eventual success :
“ If you crawl back through the archives of early to mid 2012 , you will find me writing this story , on this blog , with some assistance from you . ( The Trayvon coverage , for instance . ) If you crawl even further back to the summer of 2010 , you can find me writing this story with some assistance from you . ( The Shirley Sherrod coverage , for instance . ) And if you crawl back to the archives of 2008 , you will see the same thing .
“ This space is my notebook . But in the borders and outside the margins you can see the added scribblings and post-its authored by The Horde . ”
“ Fear of a Black President ” was a turning point , both for Coates ' writing career and for the comment section on his blog . “ After ‘ Fear of a Black President , ' ” Coates told me , “ more people started coming , and that kind of ruined things , weirdly enough . It made it a lot harder to regulate. ” His success had made him a target not just for larger numbers of people unused to minding their online manners , but to a hard core of persistent trolls who surfaced on seemingly every race-related post . In February 2013 , Coates and The Atlantic brought on two longtime commenters , Sandy Young and Kathleen Bachynski , as moderators to help Coates keep the comments on track . It was an increasingly tough job .
“ The experience of being a moderator was complex , ” Sandy Young says now , “ since Disqus [ The Atlantic 's commenting system ] lacks the ability to simply moderate one writer 's posts . I had the power to delete and ban site-wide . I would have preferred not to have it—but when I encountered posts that were vile—racist , sexist , or just downright threatening , I 'd think ‘ Aw crap . I do n't want to be that guy who tries to fix the Internet , but people I know and care about are going to see this and be insulted or hurt by it . What should I do ? I have this power—should I use it or not ? ' ”
Coates , meanwhile , was blogging less and less . In contrast to the years when he posted three , four or five items daily , in 2014 he published fewer than 100 items , although many were long and heavily researched . ( 2014 also saw the publication , in the June issue , of “ The Case For Reparations , ” Coates ' monster follow-up to “ Fear of a Black President. ” It was a finalist in the essays and criticism category at the 2015 National Magazine Awards . )
He does n't sound optimistic about the future of the comment section . Instead , he sounds tired : of deleting and banning trolls , of trying to police and curb an online community 's worst—and , it often seems , most natural—instincts , all in the name of a goal he does n't feel he 's ever achieved . “ To be honest , I ca n't say how long this will go on for , ” he told me , addressing the possibility that he might someday close comments entirely , like his colleague James Fallows . “ It never quite became what I wanted it to be . I never really figured out how to get people from different perspectives in a place without defaulting to these usual conversations . ”
Sandy Young , who 's since turned in his keys to the “ ban ” and “ delete ” buttons and stepped back from moderation , agrees that the comment section 's golden era is likely in the past . “ I think ‘ The Horde ' as it might describe a bunch of us actively participating in public online discussions was a rare and wonderful moment in time , ” he said . “ I do n't think it will continue… [ and ] I do n't think it can be replicated easily . [ Coates ] has moved on to a wider audience , which he absolutely deserves . But the Horde had already begun to become a more private place . ”
For Yoni Appelbaum , there were two things that made the Horde so valuable . The first was the sheer range of backgrounds its members emerged from : the group spanned age , race , class , gender identity , occupation , education , and nearly every other variable . “ So some of its value and some of the potential of any comment section was its ability to get people talking to each other who might not otherwise inhabit the same spaces , might not share the same assumptions , and to see what happens when they engage each other in good faith. ” The second , he says , was the way in which Coates “ made himself genuinely vulnerable . It was n't a selfless act… He wanted to learn everything that he could and understood that admitting the limits of his own knowledge was perhaps the best way to encourage others to engage constructively with him and with each other . That 's something I ca n't do nearly as well as he does , but it may be the most valuable thing I learned there . ”
Comments are still open , occasionally , on some of Coates ' blog posts , but the longtime commenters now tend to refer to the comment section in the past tense . If there 's a lesson to be taken away from the story of the Horde , it might be—depressingly—that trying to build a comment section that truly adds value to a writer 's work will inevitably become more trouble than it 's worth . For years , the Horde gave me hope for a better internet , but these days I tend to believe that comment sections are just tumors on otherwise good journalism , and that we 'd all be better off without them .
Before it was undermined by its own success , though , this one helped to launch Coates as a national writer whose incisive work on race in America is built to last longer than any online community . As one commenter , Daniel Aaron Spivack , put it : “ The Horde on the steppes may not be the same as they once were , but the Khan is still going strong . ”

UN Calls For Greater Protection Of Whistleblowers

Report of the Special Rapporteur to the General Assembly on the Protection of Sources and Whistleblowers
The Special Rapporteur 's report to the UN General Assembly in 2015 is now online .
This report , the latest among several produced by the mandate over the past twenty years to consider rights of access to information , focuses on the protection of sources and whistleblowers around the world . It reviews national and international laws and practices and provides recommendations to improve available protections .
As part of the preparations for this report , the Special Rapporteur issued calls for submissions from Governments and Civil Society . The Special Rapporteur is pleased to acknowledge the many States and NGOs that responded to this call , which may be found below .
International and national protections
The right to access information as established by the two similar versions of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights underpins the establishment of norms protecting sources and whistleblowers , persons who bring to public knowledge otherwise undisclosed information .
Many States protect source confidentiality and whistleblowers as a matter of their domestic legal systems . Nonetheless , it is common for governments to restrict access to information and to penalize sources and whistleblowers , particularly in ( but certainly not limited to ) cases touching on national security and intelligence .
Article 19 ( 3 ) of the Covenant provides that restrictions on the freedom of expression must be provided by law and be necessary to achieve a legitimate interest , identified as the rights or reputations of others , national security , public order , public health or public morals . Mere assertions of such interests are insufficient ; to be lawful under the Covenant , the restriction must actually be necessary to achieve a specified interest , and it must be proportionate to that goal .
Recommendations to improve the protection of sources and whistleblowers :
The report draws a number of conclusions and urges States and international organizations to adopt or improve laws and practices – and to foster the necessary political and social environments – that provide genuine protection to sources and whistleblowers . Such protections should be adopted not only by governments but also international organizations such as the United Nations .
Ensure national legal frameworks provide for the right of access to information in accordance with international standards : National legal frameworks establishing the right to access information held by public bodies should be aligned with international human rights norms . Exceptions to disclosure should be narrowly defined and clearly provided by law and be necessary and proportionate to achieve one or more of the above mentioned legitimate objectives .
Adopt or revise and implement national laws protecting the confidentiality of sources : Laws guaranteeing confidentiality must reach beyond professional journalists , including those who may be performing a vital role in providing wide access to information of public interest such as bloggers , “ citizen journalists , ” members of non-governmental organizations , authors , and academics , all of whom may conduct research and disclose information in the public interest . Protection should be based on function , not a formal title .
Adopt or revise and implement national legal frameworks protecting whistleblowers : State laws should protect any person who discloses information that he or she reasonably believes , at the time of disclosure , to be true and to constitute a threat or harm to a specified public interest , such as a violation of domestic or international law , abuse of authority , waste , fraud , or harm to the environment , public health or public safety .
Internal institutional and external oversight mechanisms should provide effective and protective channels for whistleblowers to motivate remedial action : In the absence of channels that provide protection and effective remediation , or that fail to do so in a timely manner , public disclosures should be permitted . Disclosure of human rights or humanitarian law violations should never the basis of penalties of any kind .
Protections against retaliation should apply in all public institutions , including those connected to national security : Because prosecutions generally deter whistleblowing , penalties should take into account the intent of the whistleblower to disclose information of public interest and meet international standards of legality , due process , and proportionality .
Establish personal liability for those who retaliate against sources and whistleblowers : Acts of reprisals and other attacks against whistleblowers and the disclosure of confidential sources must be thoroughly investigated and those responsible for these acts held accountable . When these attacks are condoned or perpetrated by authorities in leadership positions they consolidate a culture of silence , secrecy , and fear within institutions and beyond , deterring future disclosures . Leaders at all levels in institutions should promote whistleblowing and be seen to support whistleblowers , and particular attention should be paid to the ways in which authorities in leadership positions encourage retaliation , tacitly or expressly , against whistleblowers .
Actively promote respect for the right of access to information : Law enforcement and justice officials must be trained to ensure the adequate implementation of standards establishing protection of the right to access information and the consequent protections of confidentiality of sources and whistleblowers . Authorities in leadership positions should publicly recognize the contribution of sources and whistleblowers sharing information of public relevance and condemn attacks against them .
All of these principles apply to the United Nations and other international organizations : The UN and international organizations should adopt effective norms and policies of transparency to enable the public greater access to information . Specific norms protecting whistleblowers should follow similar criteria provided in the recommendations for States : wide scope of application , promotion of disclosure of information in the public interest , and clarity in the mechanisms for reporting and requesting protection . Particular attention must be paid to the effectiveness and independence of existing reporting and justice mechanisms given the lack of access of whistleblowers to any other formal justice system .

SANDY , Utah – In a battle between two teams fighting for an Audi 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs spot , it was the Portland Timbers who came out on top thanks to a major defensive error from Real Salt Lake .
The Timbers picked up a pivotal 1-0 victory over their Western Conference rivals , all but ending RSL 's postseason hopes . A red card and a Fanendo Adi penalty kick , controversially awarded when Jamison Olave took down Lucas Melano at the edge of the penalty area in the second half , was the difference in securing the three points .
The Timbers now move above the red line , tied with the fifth-place Seattle Sounders on 47 points from 32 games , three points clear of the San Jose Earthquakes and six ahead of RSL and the Houston Dynamo .
The Timbers played a very high line of pressure from the opening kick and frustrated RSL in possession , also producing their fair share of chances on the counterattack throughout the first half .
Seven minutes into the second half , the game completely changed . Timbers forward Melano got in behind RSL 's back line . Olave could not quite catch him and eventually was whistled for a foul right at the edge of the 18-yard box . Referee Juan Guzman consulted with his assistant and awarded a penalty kick to Portland and a red card to Olave , his third ejection of the season .
Timbers forward Adi stepped to the spot and slipped a low shot past Nick Rimando .
RSL head coach Jeff Cassar brought on attack-minded subs and left only three defenders in the back , searching for at least an equalizer to extend the team 's postseason hopes .
RSL had a couple of chances to pull level , and they both came at the feet of midfielder Javier Morales . In the 69th minute , Juan Manuel Martinez sent a cross toward the top of the box where Morales was able to volley a magnificent , dipping shot towards goal . Timbers goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey just got a hand to it and sent it over the bar .
Morales again nearly found the equalizer in the first minute of stoppage time after Justen Glad fed him the ball in the box . The veteran midfielder got a shot off that was deflected , and Kwarasey made a superb reaction save to preserve the victory .
One last-ditch cross from Martinez in the final minute of the game was smothered yet again by Kwarasey , buoying Portland 's playoff hopes and leaving RSL 's streak of seven straight postseason appearances in serious jeopardy .
Lou Amundson , a forward for the Knicks , calls himself an “ aspiring minimalist. ” The possessions that surround his life suggest he has been on a long vacation — a remarkable , itinerant trip that has lasted several years , crisscrossing the United States .
His mother , Eloise Berg , said the seeds were planted a little over three years ago , when Amundson was playing for the Golden State Warriors . It was just before Christmas , and he had just moved into a high-rise apartment building in San Francisco overlooking the Palace Hotel . Amundson was busy playing basketball every day , so Berg decided to fly from Denver to help him unpack . Berg spent a few days opening boxes and arranging her son 's things .
One night , as she was putting the finishing touches on the place , Amundson called to inform her that he had been traded to the Indiana Pacers . He asked , regrettably , if she could start putting his things back into boxes .
Former Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran
Atlanta 's fire chief has been suspended for one month without pay for offensive and homophobic comments in his self-published book , “ Who Told You That You Were Naked ? ”
“ Naked men refuse to give in , so they pursue sexual fulfillment through multiple partners , with the opposite sex , the same sex and sex outside of marriage and many other vile , vulgar and inappropriate ways which defile their body-temple and dishonor God , ” writes Kelvin Cochran in the book , which is available online at Amazon and Barnes and Noble .
Atlanta recently received a perfect score on the Human Right Campaign 's Municipal Equality Index , which measures factors such as non-discrimination laws , city employment policies , and leadership by city officials on LGBT equality .
It 's the only city in the Deep South to score a 100 two years in a row .
Cochran describes himself in the book as a “ devout Christian man ” whose “ greatest desire is to fulfill the purpose of God for his life and to be living proof of God 's exceeding great and precious promises . ”
A retired fire department captain who is a lesbian notified GA Voice about the book , which was published without the knowledge of Mayor Kasim Reed 's office .
He was suspended because he violated city rules by not seeking and receiving approval to publish the book , in which he compares homosexuality to bestiality and proclaims that his top priority as head of the fire department was “ to cultivate its culture to the glory of God . ”
Cindy Thompson , who retired from the fire department after 30 years and learned about the book from former colleagues , said she voluntarily accepted a demotion because she got “ bad vibes ” while working with Cochran .
“ I just did n't get a good feeling from him , ” Thompson said . “ Now I see this book and know I was right all along . ”
She said that Cochran implied the fire department endorsed his views by identifying himself in the book by his position .
Cochran has served as chief of the Atlanta Fire Department since 2008 , with a two-year stint starting in 2009 as U.S. Fire Administrator for the United States Fire Administration following an appointment by President Barack Obama .
He has been a firefighter since 1981 .
The mayor suspended Cochran for one month without pay and ordered him to attend sensitivity training and prohibited him from distributing the book on city property .
Civil rights activists are concerned the punishment is too lenient .
“ His views towards the LGBT community are shameful , ” said Glen Paul Freedman , chair of Georgia Equality 's board of directors . “ He will be back in charge , and I am sure telling his staff anti-LGBT stuff . I wonder how many LGBT AFD staff were not promoted or held back because of his views and telling his staff his views . The mayor should fire him . ”

Turkey , under the leadershipi of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , has seized roughly 50 churches and monasteries and declared them state properties .

And this one :
And then Agos , the local newspaper for Turkey , reports this :
“ After Mardin became a Metropolitan Municipality , its villages were officially turned into neighbourhoods as per the law and attached to the provincial administration . Following the legislative amendment introduced in late 2012 , the Governorate of Mardin established a liquidation committee . The Liquidation Committee started to redistribute in the city , the property of institutions whose legal entity had expired . The transfer and liquidation procedures are still ongoing .
“ In 2016 , the Transfer , Liquidation and Redistribution Committee of Mardin Governorate transferred to primarily the Treasury as well as other relevant public institutions numerous churches , monasteries , cemeteries and other assets of the Syriac community in the districts of Mardin . The Mor Gabriel Monastery Foundation appealed to the decision yet the liquidation committee rejected their appeal last May . The churches , monasteries and cemeteries whose ownerships were given to the Treasury were then transferred to the Diyanet .
“ Inquiries of the Mor Gabriel Monastery Foundation revealed that dozens of churches and monasteries had been transferred to the Treasury first and then allocated to the Diyanet . And the cemeteries have been transferred to the Metropolitan Municipality of Mardin . The maintenance of some of the churches and monasteries are currently being provided by the Mor Gabriel Monastery Foundation and they are opened to worship on certain days . Similarly , the cemeteries are still actively used by the Syriac community who visits them and performs burial procedures . The Syriacs have appealed to the Court for the cancellation of the decision .
“ Cancellation cases :
“ ‘ We started to file lawsuits and in the meantime our enquiries continued ” said Kuryakos Ergün , the Chairman of Mor Gabriel Monastery Foundation . Ergün said they would appeal to the court for the cancellation of nearly 30 title deed registries .
“ Speaking to Agos , Ergün made the following remarks :
“ ‘ For years , minority foundations could not acquire property in Turkey . Then legislative amendments were introduced in 2002 upon which we engaged in a number of initiatives . We were able to have some of the title deeds registered in the name of our foundation . And for others , the legal process was ongoing . It was not possible for us to follow-up all the title deeds . In the meantime cadastral works were carried out as well . At the cadastral offices , they did not show any sensitivity about the legislative amendment enabling the acquisition of property by minority foundations . In the face of the situation , we are filing lawsuits to the extent possible . In places where we could n't follow up the situation , some monasteries and other property were given to the legal entity of the Village .
“ ‘ After Mardin became a Metropolitan municipality the governorate established a liquidation committee . The liquidation procedures began and many places were redistributed . We were expecting them to be transferred to the municipality however they transferred the assets to the Treasury instead . The Metropolitan Municipality of Mardin took the decision to Court . However we assume that the cases were dropped after a trustee was appointed .
We have also filed appeals to the Commission numerous times and taken witnesses however they told us that legally it was not possible to give it to us and that it 's transfer procedures to the Treasury had been completed . On the other hand the Treasury gave the church monastery and the cemetery to the use of Diyanet . Here we are talking about around 50 churches and monasteries . We are still working on identifying the properties transferred . We will file an application to the directorate General of Foundations and will also file a court case . So far we have filed court cases for around 20 title deeds and we will do the same for around 30 more . ' ”

( This post has been updated to include more details on delays at the Kunming airport . )
For some in China , the unexpected advent of snow meant the chance to make tiny , fanciful inch-high snowmen .
For others , it meant massive pile-ups and a delay in travel -- one that unluckily coincides with the run-up to China 's annual Lunar New Year festival , a time during which the government estimates billions of trips will be made around the country as people return home .
As the U.S. East Coast has been paralyzed by one of its worst-ever snowstorms , China is currently hunkered down under some of its coldest weather in decades , with the mercury expected to continue dropping through Monday night in locations , according to the National Meteorological Center . In China 's eastern Zhejiang province , for example , temperatures dropped as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend .
Some residents of regions more typically found sweltering were delighted by the novelty : In subtropical Hong Kong , residents eager to see frost had to be rescued by government personnel after they found themselves stranded on a local mountain peak .
In Chongqing -- one of the country 's so-called `` Three Furnaces ” known for their steamy climes -- motorists amused themselves by constructing snowmen on the roofs of their cars . The artistic outpouring prompted a backlash from police who stopped scores of such frostily adorned cars , worried they might hamper visibility and cause car accidents . Residents in southern Guangdong province , meanwhile , made the most of their snowfall by fashioning miniature snowmen with heads crowned in leaf sprigs .
Still others delighted in making so-called `` water fireworks , '' in which cupfuls of water are thrown up in the air where they freeze in graceful arcs .
By contrast , in Kunming -- a popular holiday destination nicknamed the `` city of eternal spring '' -- poor weather kept more than 11,000 passengers stranded at the airport over the weekend , China 's official Xinhua News Agency reported . According to the verified Weibo account of the airport , which diligently microblogged the blow-by-blow action with dozens of posts , camouflage-clad armed police helped clear the runways of ice . Others tried to clear walkways with the aid of brooms . Flights were additionally canceled in Zhejiang and Sichuan province .
In the eastern city of Nanjing , meanwhile , dozens of high-speed trains were delayed , while swathes of highways were also closed in Shandong , Sichuan and more .

Liu Yunwen was among the travelers stranded after his Kunming-bound flight from Nanjing failed to take off . Mr. Liu was stranded in Nanjing for 52 hours before he managed to reach his destination , he said . `` The Kunming airport did n't handle the extreme weather properly -- after all , they 're inexperienced . ''
Another traveler , 23-year-old graduate student Li Mengjuan , was stuck in Kunming from 9 a.m. Saturday until 5 a.m. Monday . `` All I feel is exhaustion and anxiety , '' said Ms. Li , who was traveling from Kunming to Chongqing to spend Chinese New Year with her family . She slept no more than 8 hours over the course of the weekend and rode a bus back and forth from the airport five or six times as her flight was delayed twice , she said .

On Monday , flight operations had returned almost to normal , a Kunming airport representative told China Real Time . `` There 's no chaos , '' he said . `` We offered free water , meals and consultation service , '' he said , adding that the temperature inside the airport was kept at around 68 degrees Fahrenheit during the poor weather to ensure comfort for those delayed .
Chunyun , as the annual Lunar New Year travel season is commonly known , means millions of people crowd onto planes and into trains across the nation , steeling themselves for pilgrimages home that can be upwards of 20 hours long . ( In the past , sales of adult diapers have jumped as travelers lay plans to prepare for such travel . )
A record number of people are traveling this year , with the number of trips expected to rise 3.6 % over the year before to 2.9 billion .
China 's Ministry of Public Security warns that the combined factors of more people and harsher weather means a higher risk for accidents .

If you happen to follow the public debate on climate change , you might we aware that , in some circles , 2008 is being viewed as the definitive end of global warming . After all , it marks a decade where temperatures have trended downwards , and an especially cold start to the year was heralded as `` wiping out a century of warming . '' So , it might come as a surprise to learn that , now that the year 's numbers have been crunched , NASA 's Goddard Institute and the UK 's Climactic Research Unit rank 2008 as the 9th and 10th warmest year ( respectively ) in the 150 years or so humanity has been keeping careful track of these things .
The facts are that 2008 was cooler than the last few years , but warmer than most in recent history , which lends itself to spin based on the predilections of the person talking about it . But some of that spin specifically plays upon the widespread innumeracy of the public , which is n't well prepared to separate trends from short-term variability , or recognize when certain figures are selectively chosen . We 'll try to separate out some of these in a way that will hopefully help readers make a bit of sense out of the conflicting noise .
Parsing 2008 's temperature
Why was 2008 colder than the past several years ? The short answer is La Ni�a . The tropical Pacific Ocean undergoes a cyclical change in surface temperatures called the El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation , which has a dramatic impact on global temperatures . ( NOAA has a tutorial and an FAQ about the ENSO , for the curious . ) I 've taken an image from a Goddard Institute analysis and modified it to highlight this impact .
Blue bars , which are roughly centered on the cool La Ni�a events , are often associated with a drop in global temperatures . Warmer , El Ni�o events tend to correspond to warmer periods in the global temperature record . This relationship is n't absolute , as the ENSO is n't the only thing influencing short-term variations—the drop in the early 1990s is thought to be the product of the massive eruption of the Pinatubo volcano , for example . If 2008 was chilly , there 's a good chance that the La Ni�a event was a major contributor to that .
The ENSO and global temperatures
The other thing that should be apparent from this photo is that the data are noisy—they vary rapidly between many of the adjacent three-month periods shown in the upper portion of the graph . That makes drawing any significant conclusions based on a short time window—such as when a single month 's readings were used to conclude that the earth was `` wiping out a century of warming '' —a very dangerous thing . As should be clear from the information above , temperatures rose enough later in the year to turn it into one of the warmest on record .
The other thing that should be apparent from the graph is that temperatures swing both ways . If we were to conclude that the trend towards a warmer globe had ended back in February , what should we have concluded in the late 1990s , when a strong El Ni�o event shot the temperatures up to previously unprecedented levels ? It certainly was n't taken as evidence that the seas were on a trajectory to boil at the time .
Pick your trends carefully
Those exceptional temperatures are the product of an exceptional year , as the CRU has 1998 it as the warmest year on record , and Goddard places it in a statistical dead heat with the warmest . I first became aware of its significance two years ago—I know it was two years ago , because I was told that global warming had stopped eight years earlier . Now , those statements have been replaced with ones indicating that the earth has been cooling for a decade . One of the most significant things these statements have in common is their starting date : 1998 . It 's instructional to perform a similarly superficial analysis with the surrounding years .
Looking at the 1990s until now , using the deviation from the 1950-1980 mean in C
All the numbers indicate how much warmer that year was than the mean temperature from the 1950-1980 period . The data should make clear that , to get a drop in temperatures using that measure , you need to pick 1998 as your starting point ; neither of the two neighboring years will work .
CRU ( top ) and Goddard data , showing smoothed trends . ( Click for larger version )
You 'd get a different result using CRU data ( which rates 1998 as warmer , and recent years as a bit cooler ) , but the message would be the same : the years you choose for your analysis can determine your trend . In fact , a quick look at the chart above shows that you could pick a decade to support any conclusion you want . In fact , the start of the instrument era is , in effect , an arbitrary year , as is the present . So , how can we tell anything ?
To deal with this , both the CRU and Goddard apply smoothing to their data ; Goddard provides a moving five-year average , CRU more dramatic smoothing , as shown below . Both of these make the overall temperature trends clear by limiting the ability of the variability in the underlying data to obscure it .
In both cases , the temperatures of 2008 combine with several years of largely similar data to create a slight drop in the trend . Drops of a similar magnitude appear in the past , meaning that the current one is consistent with an overall upward trend in temperatures .
Should the current dip turn into a longer trend , then it would be cause for a significant revision of our understanding of the climate . The clearest indication of whether that 's going to happen might be the next time an El Ni�o arrives—assuming Mount Pinatubo does n't go off again in the meantime .
Nielsen launched a data visualization contest in the hope of further exploring the intersection of art and science—and we were amazed by the response , from downloads , to entries , from social media conversations and debates , to shares . For this contest , we made data available from State of the Media : Social Media Report ( data from 2011 ) and Consumer Usage Report ( data from 2011 ) .
JUDGE 'S CHOICE ANNOUNCEMENT
The judges—Matt Anchin , SVP Global Communications ; Ana Mackay-Sim , Global Creative Director ; Eric Solomon , SVP Product Leadership ; Evelina Simanonyte , Knowledge Manager Media And Advertising Analytics—found the entries to be diverse in their interpretation of the data and were impressed by the quality of the entries .
They are pleased to announce the Judge 's Choice winner of the Nielsen Data Visualization Contest : Dustin Poh and his interpretation of `` data showing the exponential growth in consumers ' thirst of media and social networking '' .
People who are starting a rigorous new exercise regimen might be told ( and tell themselves ) to `` keep their eyes on the prize '' —the prize being the personal best record , a completed marathon , or some other milestone . Anything to coax yourself away from the Netflix and out onto the freezing streets for a run .
But new research suggests that taking the `` eyes on the prize '' mantra literally can help with performance . A study published in the journal Motivation and Emotion found that focusing on a stopping point in the distance , like a building or tree , can cause distances to appear shorter . This , in turn , encourages exercisers to move more quickly and reduces the feeling of exertion .
“ These findings indicate that narrowly focusing visual attention on a specific target , like a building a few blocks ahead , rather than looking around your surroundings , makes that distance appear shorter , helps you walk faster , and also makes exercising seem easier , '' said New York University psychology professor Emily Balcetis in a release .
This concept is known as `` attention narrowing . '' In their experiments , the researchers took participants to a park in New York in the summertime and positioned them in front of , first , a cooler filled with cold drinks and , in a second experiment , in front of a traffic cone . One set of subjects was told to focus solely on the cooler or cone in the distance . The others were told to look around as they naturally would . `` Keeping their eyes on the prize , '' it turns out , made a big difference :
Those in the narrowed attention group perceived the cones to be 28 percent closer than did those in the natural condition group . In addition , those in the narrowed attention group walked 23 percent faster than did those in the natural attention group . Finally , those in the narrowed attention group reported that the walk required less physical exertion than did those in the natural condition group—a finding that may serve as an incentive to exercise .
The researchers write that they are n't sure why focusing on the object made the task seem easier and encouraged the participants to walk faster . It could be that the shorter-seeming distance made the subjects feel more capable of completing the task .
The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are some of the most extreme desert regions on the planet . But new research indicates that the region may actually be full of salty , extremely cold groundwater . The water may even connect surrounding lakes into a massive network , and it probably hosts extreme microbial life .
The findings were reported Tuesday in Nature Communications .
Despite McMurdo 's apparent dryness on the surface , it 's always hinted at something more : The region is home to the magnificently creepy Blood Falls , a red ooze that shines bright against the otherwise desolate surface . For a while scientists believed that red algae gave this mysterious , bloody ooze its vibrant color . But even though iron oxide is responsible for the hue , analysis has shown that the feature does contain strange bacterial life .

Scientists knew that ooze had to be coming up from somewhere , but were surprised to find just how extensive the valley 's briny waterways might be .
`` I 've been studying Blood Falls for quite some time , and it 's always been a mystery , '' said lead study author Jill Mikucki of the University of Tennessee . As a microbiologist , she 's long been interested in the communities that live in the oozy brine .

A helicopter flies the AEM sensor over Lake Frxyell in the McMurdo Dry Valleys , Antarctica . ( L. Jansan )
She and her colleagues used an electromagnetic sensor mounted on a helicopter to scope out the area , testing the conductivity of the ground below . Water increases its resistivity as it freezes , meaning that it 's less conductive of electrical currents . But salty water -- which can stay liquid at lower temperatures -- have very low resistivity .
`` We found , as expected , that there was something sourcing Blood Falls , '' Mikucki said , `` and we found that these brines were more widespread than previously thought . They appear to connect these surface lakes that appear separated on the ground . That means there 's the potential for a much more extensive subsurface ecosystem , which I 'm pretty jazzed about . ''
It 's possible that this extensive brine is n't unique to the valley , Mikucki explained , and that subsurface ecosystems of extreme microbes might be connected to visible lakes , and perhaps even interact with the ocean .
`` It turns out that as beautiful and visceral as Blood Falls is in these valleys , it 's actually just a blip . It 's a little defect in this much more exciting feature , '' she said .
[ This tiny animal can survive basically anything , including the vacuum of space ]
She hopes that the team will be able to go back and survey more areas to see just how connected the lakes of Antarctica are , and how much these subsurface brines interact with oceans at the coast . As with all work in the Dry Valleys , everything her team does is as useful for space exploration as it is for research on Earth .
`` Scientists have been using the Dry Valleys to test instruments since the Viking missions , '' Mikucki said . `` So how we detect the brines and access them is relevant to work on places like Mars . ''
[ Why NASA 's top scientist is sure that we 'll find signs of alien life in the next decade ]
And if we find life on another planet , it 's most likely going to look like the life we find in Antarctica . The subsurface lake Vostok , which is now thought to contain extensive ( and quite alien ) life , is often cited as an example of what might be found on Europa , Jupiter 's ice-and-ocean covered moon . Recent studies on Mars found evidence of brines on that planet , which could presumably have supported life once as well . On our planet , these subsurface waters host only the most extreme forms of life . But elsewhere in the universe , the same conditions might be as hospitable as a planet gets .
`` The subsurface is actually pretty attractive when you think about life on other planets . It 's cold and dark and has all these strikes against it , but it 's protected from the harsh environment on the surface , '' Mikucki said .

A Saudi court sentenced two women to ten months in prison , along with a two-year travel ban , after they tried to help a Canadian woman who , with her three children , was denied adequate food and water and was subjected to violence by her Saudi husband .
On June 6 2011 , the two human rights workers Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Oyouni received a text message from Nathalie Morin , the Canadian woman , saying that her husband had locked the whole family in the house and left for a week-long visit to see relatives in another town while her supplies of food and water were running out , according to Human Rights Watch .
“ I can not help myself and I have no rights in Saudi Arabia . My children are hungry and I can not do anything to feed them . I 'm fighting to get freedom , justice and fairness for my family including myself , ” Morin wrote on her blog .
The two bought food and came to Morin 's house , where police were already waiting for them . The women were brought to Damman station for questioning , where police told al-Huwaider and al-Oyouni they believed they were trying to smuggle Morin and her three children to Canada , Human Rights Center reports .
After the women signed a statement pledging to cease all involvement with the case , the police released them . However , more than a year later in July 2012 , authorities called in al-Huwaider and al-Oyouni for questioning , after which the government launched a case against them .
The trial continued for another year , and last Saturday presiding judge Fahad al-Gda ' a issued a ruling sentencing the two human rights workers to ten months in prison , imposing an additional two-year travel ban on top of the jail time . The charges were “ inciting a woman to flee with her children ” and “ attempting to turn a woman against her husband. ” The women were acquitted of charges that they had attempted to smuggle the wife and her three children to the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh .
Al-Huwaider and al-Oyouni plan to challenge the ruling in the Court of Appeals .
The same day the two women issued a statement that when the case was launched , they predicted that the government was trying to punish them for their women 's rights activism in recent years .
`` It was clear to us from the very beginning when we were summoned to the investigation by the prosecutor in Dammam that the issue was malicious and that those who filed this case against us are from concerned authorities that aim to harm and harass us to stop our humanitarian activities , because since the night of the incident two years ago , the case has been revoked by an order issued by the Amir of the Eastern region and the file was closed , '' they said .
Al-Huwaider said that during her interrogations , investigators did not ask her about Morin 's case but rather about her involvement in the Saudi women 's rights movement , including questions about the Women2Drive campaign and her relationship with Saudi women 's rights activist Manal al-Sharif . Al-Huwaider filmed the latter driving a car , which is illegal in the Kingdom , and posted the video on YouTube . Al-Sharif said later in a lecture in Scotland that followed the publication of that video , she received threats of being raped and killed .
Al-Huwaider told Human Rights Watch that during her trial , which began in late 2012 , the presiding judge denied her and al-Oyouni the right to adequately defend themselves by refusing to allow Morin to testify . The judge also declined to allow a Canadian Embassy official to attend the second trial session , in December , according to Human Rights Watch .
Al-Huwaider is a prominent activist , author and journalist , a co-founder of the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women 's Rights in Saudi Arabia and a member of the Human Rights Watch Middle East advisory committee .
She wrote for the Arabic language daily al-Watan and the English language daily Arab News until May 2003 , after authorities banned her from writing or appearing in any local media .
In an article published May 25 , 2006 on rezgar.com , she drew a comparison between the lives of the prisoners in the `` terrible inhuman prison '' camp at Guantanamo Bay in the United States and the lives of Arab women .
`` ... Anyone who examines and analyzes the lives of the prisoners in Guantanamo , and compares them to the lives of Arab women - particularly in the Gulf States , and especially in Yemen , Oman and Saudi Arabia - will discover that there are very many similarities ... First , in some Arab countries a woman is a prisoner in her [ own ] home , and can only move with the permission of her guardian , or , more accurately , her jailor . Her situation is similar to that of a prisoner in Guantanamo… ”
There is no codified Penal Law in Saudi Arabia , and its legal system is based on Islamic law derived from the Qu'ran and the traditions of the prophet Muhammad . That means that judges and prosecutors have wide latitude to arbitrarily define certain acts as criminal .
Saudi Arabia has a “ guardianship system ” and strict gender segregation rules that limit women 's abilities to make decisions and participate in public life . Under this system girls and women are forbidden from traveling , conducting official business , or undergoing certain medical procedures without permission from their male guardians .
Tom Daley has revealed in a YouTube video that he is in a gay relationship .
The 19-year-old Olympian and Splash ! star said that his life `` changed massively '' when he met his partner in the spring .
`` They make me feel so happy , so safe and everything just feels great , '' he said . `` [ And ] that someone is a guy .
`` It did take me by surprise a little bit . It was always in the back of my head that something like that could happen , but it was n't until spring this year that something just clicked . It felt right . ''
Daley insisted that he is still attracted to women , but `` could n't be happier '' with his current relationship .
On his decision to speak about his sexuality via YouTube , the sportsman explained : `` I did n't want to get my words twisted . I wanted to put an end to all the rumours , the speculation [ and ] just say it . ''
Daley said that his closest friends and family are `` so supportive '' of him coming out , but admitted that some relatives `` had mixed opinions '' and `` wanted [ him ] to keep it quiet '' .
He also said that he believes his late father Robert , who died of brain cancer in 2011 , would be proud of him .
Daley added : `` He always said to me , 'As long as you 're happy , I 'm happy ' . ''
ITV said in a statement that it is `` looking forward to Tom 's return to Splash ! next year '' , but would n't be commenting further as it is `` clearly a personal matter '' .
Speaking to Digital Spy earlier this year , Daley said that he `` really appreciate [ s ] '' his gay fanbase .

Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a festive toast to mark the 65th anniversary of the founding of Israel 's national intelligence agency , the Mossad .
The event was attended by Netanyahu , Israel 's Intelligence Minister Katz and Mossad chief Tamir Pardo .
Acknowledging the complex task that stands before the intelligence agency , Netanyahu said : `` We can not solve the fundamental problems of the Middle East that are revealed in all their power , and today our enemy is twofold : It is radical Shiite Islam led by Iran and its proxies , and radical Sunni Islam , currently led by the Islamic State . ''
Netanyahu stressed the importance of the Mossad 's work by reminding that `` there is one clear rule : no one makes a pact with the weak . ''
`` The real defense of our country during its years of existence and the 65 years of the existence of the Mossad , which we mark on this day , is this power of the State of Israel . It is this power that we cultivate , '' the prime minister added .
`` Facing this changing world , Israel must be a superpower . Not just a regional power , but in some areas a world power . This only deepens and enhances our ability to leverage our relationships with officials in the region and with players outside this region . ''
Netanyahu went on to stress the Mossad 's vital and irreplaceable role in Israel 's ability to maintain its position as a regional and global power , stressing that it is this position which is `` ultimately the guarantee of our existence . ''
Netanyahu also thanked not just the many Mossad operatives , but also their families for the support they lend to the agency .
`` I ask you to also thank your families who also carry a heavy burden and ask you to tell them in the name of the people of Israel , the State of Israel : 'Thank you very much and may you be inscribed in the book of life . ' ''
During the event , employees received a special gift as a souvenir - a specially designed postage stamp , issued by the Philatelic Service in a limited quantity .
Mossad chief Tamir Pardo stressed that despite the sophisticated technology on which the agency relies for many of its activities , none of it 's achievements would have been possible without its agents .
Over the years , the Mossad underwent large changes and today , 40 % of the agency 's employees are women , while 24 % of them can be found in senior positions .
The Mossad was formed on December 13 , 1949 , at the recommendation of then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and has been responsible for many legendary missions across the world .
HSBC is expected to admit on Tuesday it has settled allegations of running money for Mexican drug barons for a larger than expected $ 1.9bn ( £1.2bn ) , barely 24 hours after close rival Standard Chartered admitted paying $ 670m ( £415m ) in penalties to US regulators to settle allegations it broke sanctions on Iran .
The $ 1.9bn that HSBC will pay to the US authorities exceeds the $ 1.5bn it had warned it could cost to settle the allegations raised in a damning US Senate report in the summer which came amid a wave of scandals to hit the banking sector .
HSBC is expected to confirm it has struck the agreement which has already led to the departure of compliance head David Bagley and put pressure on former chairman Lord Green , now a trade minister .
The bank is expected to admit violating US laws meant to prohibit money laundering including the Bank Secrecy Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act . The deal is expected to include a settlement with the powerful Manhattan district attorney 's office and a deferred prosecution agreement with both the Justice department and Treasury department .
Ahead of the settlement , HSBC on Monday named a former US official as head of group financial crime compliance , a newly created role , as the bank prepared for the fine related to drug allegations . Bob Werner , who used to work for the US treasury , will create a global financial intelligence unit to conduct internal investigations at HSBC .
Peter Henning , a professor of law at Wayne State University , said : `` If the numbers are right , this is going to get everybody 's attention . The worst situation would be if the charges were for money laundering but it looks like this is a deferred prosecution relating to books and record controls , that gives the bank some wiggle room in terms of its explanations . But the size of the fine means the bottom line is this is very significant . ''
Henning said the fine would have a significant `` reputational impact '' and HSBC would have to be very careful in future . `` You get one black mark . If something like this comes up again in the US , the authorities are not going to be very forgiving . ''
European banks seemed to have underestimated the prosecutorial zeal of the US authorities , he said . `` We have had Standard Chartered and now this and we still have more Libor cases to come . '' US authorities are investigating banks involved in the alleged manipulation of London 's Libor , the key measure for setting loan rates around the world .
Britain 's banks are braced for fines following the £290m penalty slapped on Barclays – now vastly exceeded by the amounts levied by US regulators for breaching sanctions and laundering money .
The fines on Standard Chartered follow accusations that lax systems left the US financial system vulnerable to `` drug kingpins '' and terrorists .
Standard Chartered is paying $ 327m to the US Federal Reserve , the US justice department and the New York district attorney , it was announced yesterday , following a settlement of $ 340m in August with the New York department of financial services .
The bruising episode for Standard Chartered , which until the summer was regarded to have preserved its reputation through the banking crisis , also includes the bank being forced to set up `` acceptable '' compliance programmes . Cyrus Vance , the Manhattan district attorney , said : `` Banks occupy positions of trust . It is a bedrock principle that they must deal honestly with their regulators .
My office will accept nothing less – too much is at stake for the people of this country . '' The Fed , which is receiving $ 100m of the Standard Chartered fines , said it was imposing `` one of the largest penalties '' it had ever announced for `` alleged unsafe and unsound practices '' adopted by the bank .
`` Under the cease and desist order Standard Chartered must improve its programme for compliance with US economic sanctions , the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements , '' the Fed said . The Financial Services Authority , the UK watchdog , has agreed to assist in the supervision of the order .
The department of justice and the district attorney for New York County have entered into `` deferred prosecution agreements '' for which the bank which will pay $ 227m . The bank has also settled with the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( Ofac ) but the settlement of $ 132m is offset against other penalties .
Standard Chartered said that Ofac had concluded the `` vast majority '' of transactions were not in violation of sanctions . The bank said that $ 24m of transactions for Iranian counterparties and $ 109m from other countries facing sanctions – such as Burma , Sudan and Libya – had breached sanctions .

ThisThingRips OG Four 2.0 Rig Edition – Lava Quartz is a Tint
Edit 10/18/2017 : This Thing Rips reached out to us an claimed that the lava quartz is not plastic . They did not state however what the film was . We have reached out to them for further clarification and will post their answer once received .
Design & Quality
The new # ThisThingRips OG Four 2.0 Rig Edition ( how 's that for a mouthful is one of 2 new Rig Edition vape pens released by This Thing Rips . It 's the larger version of their “ lava-quartz ” ( we 'll get into that claim in a bit ) single coil OG Four 2.0 vape pen .
Battery
The best part of the new “ Rig Editions ” is a 1100mah battery with a built-in container , that is huge at 22mm wide and almost 6 inches tall . Still not as powerful as The Kind Pen Dream 1500mah battery though . The battery has 3 temp settings like most vape pens , and has a hashtag symbol to go with the Thing Rips logo on the chrome battery . It has an orange frosted that is very delicate ( do not play with it taking it off and on , you 'll break it ) with a plastic mouthpiece . Under the attachment and glass , it has a removable variable airflow system with 4 air vents to change your airflow .
If you 've read our other reviews from # ThisThingRips , you 'll remember thy have a very big tendency to use misleading statements and a TON of marketing jargon . Forget the “ Hypercharge battery , ” this time around , they straight up lie . Since last year they 've been pushing what they call “ lava quartz ” as “ game changing technology , ” which is orange quartz . They have digital renderings of their single coil wrapped around this orange “ lava quartz ” and the cup is also a dark orange , as well as promotional pictures with what is an orange piece of quartz ( Raw 100 % Lava-Quartz ) , proclaiming itself “ the only lava quartz cartridge. ” If you try to search for lava quartz you only find references from them . Does not seem to be a real product at all .
Atomizer Design
What is lava quartz then ? A marketing lie . The quartz rods inside the OG Four 2.0 Rig edition are just regular quartz rods , not orange at all . What about the quartz cup ? It 's just a regular quartz cup that has been covered on the outside with what appears to be film of orange tint . It is similar to the ones used in car windows . They literally tinted the windows orange . Then lied that they are using this “ superior ” quartz that does n't exist . It was a bonus finding a silicone ring under the quartz cup . We have reached out to This Thing Rips to get an answer regarding what this material is .
Are they as good as other similar products ? Yes , so why the need to lie ? What does that mean about the quality and safety of the product ?
Their atomizer is a standard 10mm in diameter atomizer that uses regular quartz double coils and a cheap alloy . You can see solder marks on the coil and more evidence that # ThisThingRips prefers to spend money on marketing bullshit and adding more unneeded stuff rather than giving users a quality product . The coil burns your wax even at the lowest setting . It gives that all-too-well-known “ vape pen ” smell and taste we all used to get from our old Micro Gs . Be prepared for headaches if you 're susceptible to pain from smells like diesel .
The worst part ? We do n't know if the orange film they use to “ make ” their “ Lava Quartz ” melts when you use your coil at high temperatures , but the coil had definite marks of orange around the coil . We do not recommend using too much back to back just in case the higher heat will melt it .
Dab Tray
Like their This Thing Rips R2 Rig Edition , the other reason you might purchase a Thing Rips Rig edition is the cool looking dab tray . It 's 8 inches by 8 Inches with a large compartment on the top that is an inch and a quarter deep . It 's useful if you have multiple vape pens and a rig . Then you can use the compartment to put used atomizers or other nails . Like the rest of this product they decided to save money to oversell an inferior product . Bend the silicone to do a routine quality test and you 'll see it turn white from the fillers used in the production . You can smell the chemicals when you take it out for the first time . You get a huge whiff of unpleasant old style vape pen smell . Make sure to wash it when you first open it , and do n't store wax straight on the silicone , or the chemicals and flavor will cross into your wax .
Ease of Use
The # ThisThingRips OG Four 2.0 Rig Edition is straighfoward to use . Take the orange glass off , place your wax on top of the coils , replace the glass , unlock , press the power button , and inhale . It has 3 settings : Blue is low , Green is medium , and Red is high . Press 3 times to change the setting , and 5 to turn it off .
The built-in wax container is easy to use , you simply screw on and off , and atomizers are screwed and replaced very easily .
Strength
Strength is the main draw for the OG Four 2.0 Rig Edition . It heats up its alloy coil super fast . Within less than 5 seconds the coils will glow red hot . You 'll see clouds build up quickly in the chamber . Rip through your wax within a couple of hits .
They claim the “ Power of a Rig in the Palm of your Hand. ” It gets pretty close to when you get your nail red hot and burn your wax . Not the vape pen to be looking for if you want low temp dabs .
Efficiency
The Thing Rips OG Four 2.0 Rig Edition is actually worse in efficiency compared to its white ceramic sibling the R2 Rig Edition . The quartz coils are efficient , given its larger size . Even though the diameter of the vape pen is 22mm the atomizer is only 10mm . So unlike other larger vape pens you do n't have more unnecessary empty space on the sides of the coils . The coils are low enough that it 's very hard to miss completely and have the wax just sit underneath the coils .
Even though it 's longer and deeper do n't overload the atomizer . Otherwise you 'll inhale wax unto the glass when it pulls around the coils . You 'll still get some wax , especially shatter or really gooey consistencies on the walls of the atomizer .
Versatility / Atomizer Options
You ca n't use any of the other 4 atomizers # ThisThingRips released prior to the Rig Editions . This means that the only other atomizer available is the R2 Series Rig Editions white ceramic double coil atomizer . The other 4 , including the “ Roil ” and “ ReMix ” coil-less atomizers , are not compatible because they are eGo 510 threaded .
Therefore the options you are left with are not that good . Cheap atomizers with lava quartz , a tint of unknown material , and coil wire that has obvious crimps in it .
Portability
The Thing Rips OG Four 2.0 Rig edition 's large battery and very delicate glass container make it hard to carry in your pocket . Use the included silicone ring around the glass to try to protect the glass , but it wo n't prevent cracks . We were using ours when it broke . The built-in container on the battery is a great add-on for dabs on the go .
Discretion
The large shiny color and bright orange make this hard to not notice in the day . Even with a little light . The large size will make it impossible to cover with your hand , but the quick heat uptime will help with quick hits .
Just expect large clouds of smoke ( not vapor , you 'll burn your wax with the high temperature , not vape ) .
Taste
The “ Power of a Rig , ” that means image a red-hot cheap nail to burn all your wax . The taste is awful . The cheap coils are designed to heat up as hot as possible . That means that no matter what you will burn your wax really fast .
The taste and smell leaves even the best tasting wax with an after taste of “ vape pen. ” If you like to live in Terpcity and enjoy the delicious flavor of your wax this is not for you . I also got a headache after smoking it for a while . Reminded me of smelling truck exhaust . You also get the same after-taste .
And honestly , looking at the coils , the film they used around the quartz cup seem a bit melted on the coils . It would n't be surprising if the taste is ruined by some of that .
Do n't use good wax on this . It will not taste like it is supposed to .
Value
The # ThisThingRips OG Four2.0 Rig Edition is on of the most expensive vape pen at basically $ 130 ( $ 129.99 ) . It includes 2 “ Lava Quartz ” double coil atomizers , 2 glass covers , a very small dab tool , and the large dab mat .
The atomizers use a cheap coil inside a quartz cup that is wrapped in an orange film . This makes the whole “ vape pen ” part worthless . The battery is pretty cool with its included concentrate container so you can use it with other better 510 attachments .
.The silicone dab tray at most would be around $ 30 ( especially using fillers ) so you 're paying around $ 100 for an 1100mah battery with a built-in wax .
They also only have a 90-Day Warranty , compared to a 1-Year warranty most other companies have .
Replacements
There are currently no replacements available , so do n't out your film covered quartz cup quickly or better yet , buy atomizers for the R2 Series ( once those are available ) .
A massive headache , other than after using it , is getting replacements because you have to drive to the store every time .
Conclusion
An expensive $ 130 waste . A vape pen that uses orange tinted film called “ Lava Quartz , ” that may or may not melt when in use . It 's just fake marketing hype . You are best off skipping the OG Four 2.0 Rig Edition altogether . So far you might just be better skipping anything from ThisThingRips if the same poor product quality is consistent across the brand . We hope they come out with something better in the future .

Anyone who 's ever been responsible for a baby knows that when kids are awake , finding time to make yourself a meal is no small feat . So when this babysitter needed a snack , she got hilariously creative .
Claudia Sorhaindo 's 15-year-old niece J'Ann babysat her 2-month-old while the mother made a quick trip .
Not wanting to let the baby out of her sight while she made a sandwich , J'Ann came up with an ingenious solution that might just have you saying `` Why did n't I think of that ? ''
`` I could n't help but laugh out loud and share the photo with her dad , '' Sorhaindo said in a message .
`` I have a baby holder and I asked J'Ann why she did n't go to my house ( which is next door ) to get it , '' the mother explained . `` She said she was too hungry and it would take time to go get it the figure how to put it on , and by that time she could have made four sandwiches . ''
Hilarious as it is , the photo is significant to Sorhaindo for other reasons .
`` The picture J'Ann took was to show me that she is making sure she is keeping an eye on Ava , '' the mother explained . `` Ava got her middle name from my baby girl Jenelle Pemberton . Jenelle passed away 3 months after giving birth on the island of St Croix . ''
`` I get a little paranoid so do n't like to leave Ava by herself , '' she said .
In the capable hands of her cousin , though , Sorhaindo is able to move beyond the fear and go about her life . `` [ J'Ann ] is the best , '' she divulged . `` She comes over every morning before going to school at 6 a.m. to kiss Ava good morning . When Ava was in my womb , J'Ann would listen to her heart beat with a stethoscope . She loves Ava like it 's her baby . ''
Aside from bringing joy to her life , J'Ann 's little cousin might just have also inspired her next big career move .
With the help of her aunt , J'Ann started a GoFundMe to create the J'Pant , a garment inspired by the above picture that would `` help caregivers ... everywhere . '' Sorhaindo says the fund is to raise `` at least '' enough money to patent the product .
J'Pants for all .
Barium bromide is the chemical compound with the formula BaBr 2 . Like barium chloride , it dissolves well in water and is toxic in aqueous solution .
Structure and properties [ edit ]
BaBr 2 crystallizes in a lead chloride motif , giving white orthorhombic crystals which are deliquescent . [ 1 ] In aqueous solution BaBr 2 behaves as a simple salt .
Barium bromide reacts with the sulfate ion from sulfuric acid to produce a precipitate of barium sulfate .
Similar reactions occur with oxalic acid , hydrofluoric acid , and phosphoric acid .
Preparation [ edit ]
Barium bromide can be prepared from barium sulfide or barium carbonate via reaction with hydrobromic acid to give hydrated barium bromide . This happens over a short period of time
Barium bromide can be crystallized out from the solution in its dihydrate form , BaBr 2 ·2H 2 O , which gives the anhydrous form upon heating to 120 °C . [ 2 ]
Uses [ edit ]
Barium bromide is a precursor to chemicals used in photography and to other bromides .
Historically , barium bromide was used to purify radium in a process of fractional crystallization devised by Marie Curie . Since radium precipitates preferentially in a solution of barium bromide , the ratio of radium to barium in the precipitate would be higher than the ratio in the solution . [ 3 ]
Safety [ edit ]
Barium bromide , along with other water-soluble barium salts , is toxic and can cause severe poisoning if ingested .
A group of researchers discovered the first species of hairy , white “ Yeti crab ” in hydro-thermal vents below the surface of East Scotia Ridge , Antarctica , and they revealed its existence in a paper this week . The creature has been named Kiwa tyleri after a British deep-sea biologist Paul Tyler .
Researchers photographed the creature in 2010 using a remotely operated submersible vehicle ( ROV ) , but since then , they used computed tomography ( CT ) scanning and genetic sequencing to find out more about the crab . Researchers described what they found in the journal PLOS ONE Wednesday .
There are three known Yeti crabs , including Kiwa tyleri , but this is the first to be discovered in the Southern Ocean off Antarctica 's coast , NBC News reports . It lives in large communities of great density–approximately 700 crabs per meter–in hot vents on the ocean floor .
Lead author , Sven Thatje , said that “ Crabs and lobsters are very rare in Antarctic/Southern Ocean waters because of the unusually low seawater temperatures. ” Thatje added that they “ knew immediately that we 'd found something tremendously novel and unique in hydrothermal vent research . ”
So why do the crabs live in such tiny spaces ? The answer is simple . The water beyond their packed communities is frigid . Water temperatures fluctuate between 30 and 33 degrees Fahrenheit on the Southern Ocean floor .
Though the waters are extremely cold , some crabs still leave their cozy home . Female crabs leave the vents to brood their eggs since they would not survive in the vents . However , they usually die because they are not strong enough to make it back on their own .
The crabs are pretty small . Some are only an inch in size , while others measure nearly half a foot .
The hair on its back gives them the ability to farm their own food , according to Slash Gear . The farm ( or hair ) grows bacteria for the crab to feed on . This trait , along with their pigment-less , white color , was developed in order to adapt to their unique environment .
The crab also has hair on its chest or underside . Because other Yeti crabs do not have this characteristic , scientists nicknamed it “ Hoff crab ” after the one of the most hairy-chested actors from the 1980s , David Hasselhoff .
EUSTIS , Fla. - Police in Central Florida arrested a 93-year-old woman accused of trespassing after the independent living facility in which she lived reported that she has refused to pay rent for the past three months .
Juanita Fitzgerald , 93 , has a birthday coming up Friday . She is currently being held in the Lake County Jail on a $ 500 bond and has been there since Tuesday . She has a court date scheduled for Dec. 27 .
Karen Twinem , with National Church Residences , which owns the Franklin House where Fitzgerald has lived since April 2011 , said Fitzgerald told the staff she held back the rent because she thought she was going to die soon .
Twinem also confirmed that Fitzgerald had also complained about having mold in her apartment , but said the facility had her apartment tested and no mold was found .
Twinem said officials contacted the 93-year-old woman 's family several times to try to get her help and even reached out to several agencies including the Homeless Coalition , LiveStream Behavior Center , the United Way of Lake County , Family and Children 's Services of Lake County , the Area Agency on Aging and several other apartments and transitional housing programs . Twinem said Fitzgerald refused all the assistance offered .
Court papers describe how Fitzgerald resisted the eviction every step of the way
When Eustis police officers arrived at the Franklin House , located at 2400 Kurt Street , they met with Lake County deputies inside the front lobby and Fitzgerald was there , according to court papers .
The report states that , on the previous day , Fitzgerald was made well aware that she would be evicted and was asked several times to leave the property and told she could no longer stay there .
Fitzgerald refused to get her belongings and leave and said , “ Unless you carry me out of here , I 'm not going anywhere , ” according to the affidavit .
As officers attempted to escort her out of the building , she intentionally slid out of her chair and onto the floor and resisted when officers tried to pick her up , the report said .
The affidavit states officers were able to safely escort her out of the building into the rear of a patrol car . Due to her age , officers transported Fitzgerald without handcuffs to reduce the risk of injury .
“ This is extremely rare , ” said Twinem , who said National Church Residences runs 340 properties . “ We try to find places for people . ”

From cuts and scrapes to close encounters of the shaving kind , our bodies can take quite a beating over the years .
Take a minute and do a little self-diagnostic on your body . Chances are , you 've got at least one cut , ache , sprain or other minor ailment bothering you . If not , great news : something will probably happen to you in the next three days .
That 's according to a recent year-long survey of 2,000 Britons who are either exceptionally clumsy or a good predictor of how often the rest of us are likely to suffer bumps and bruises over the course of a lifetime .
In a single year , the average British citizen cuts herself twice while shaving , gets one electric shock , and three papercuts . She 'll lose her voice at least once and accidentally bite her tongue three times . Throw in your garden-variety headaches , cramps , blisters , trips and falls and other injuries , and you get 124 such incidents annually .
In case you 're counting , that 's 9,672 ailments over the course of a 78-year lifespan .
The study , conducted by the health non-profit Beneden Healthcare Society , also revealed that a quarter of Britons have gone to sit down and missed their chairs . Half of them have knocked their heads while getting out of a car . And 1 in 20 admitted to having slipped on a banana peel at least once , which suggests there might be some truth to the classic mishap , after all .

An Ohio high school student has already been jailed and kicked out of school for having a pocket knife in his car , and now he fears he could lose his dream of serving in the Army .
Jordan Wiser , a student at Ashtabula County Technical School in Jefferson , is finishing up his senior year from home after school officials searched his car in December and found the folding knife and an Airsoft gun . School officials called police , who charged him with illegal conveyance of a weapon onto a school ground based on the three-inch knife .
“ I declined to allow them to search myself or my car and that I wanted to talk to my lawyer or my father , ” Wiser told FoxNews.com . “ They told me it was n't an option . ”
Wiser , an EMT trainee who hopes to become both a police officer and a soldier , spent 13 days in the Ashtabula County Jail following the incident . The knife , which Wiser said is part of his first responder 's kit and can be used for slicing an accident victim 's seatbelt , was found tucked inside his EMT medical vest in the trunk of the car . The Airsoft gun , which fires non-lethal pellets , was not illegal and was used by Wiser in a shooting club he belongs to , he said .
School officials told FoxNews.com that possession of the pocket knife was a violation of the school 's zero tolerance policy for bringing weapons on campus and that based on a message he posted on an online forum , they had probable cause to search Wiser and his car . They also insisted Wiser consented to the search .
“ When we asked , he had said , 'okay , ' '' school Superintendent Jerome Brockway said .
Brockway said the district is obliged to motion for expulsion once a student is found with banned items on campus , and said the student handbook states that officials have the right to search a student and his or her vehicle if they have probable cause .
“ We indicate that we have the right to search , and he was aware of the policy , ” he said , adding that the decision to pursue criminal charges was left to police and prosecutors .
Wiser has a court hearing on April 1 . He is hoping for a favorable disposition to put his career plans back on track . He has been kicked out of the Army 's Future Soldier Training System program , and his plans to enlist in August are now in jeopardy . He says he is seriously considering filing a lawsuit .
“ It is definitely an option , ” said Wiser , who must enroll in a special online program to complete his education .
'Mad Men ' Creator On What 's Next For Don Draper

The fourth season of the AMC drama Mad Men ended in a dramatically big way .
Protagonist Don Draper , played by Jon Hamm , seemed happy . So happy , in fact , that he surprised his secretary , Megan , with an engagement ring on a Disneyland vacation with his children . The last shot of the episode showed Megan happily asleep in bed with Don , as he remained awake , staring up at the ceiling , before turning his head and staring out the window .
What did it mean ?

On Monday 's Fresh Air , series creator Matthew Weiner details his storytelling process . He also talks in depth about the plot and character choices he made last season and in the first episode of Season 5 .
`` The first episode of each season , in a way , really starts to become the finale of the season before , '' he tells Fresh Air 's Terry Gross . `` And when you get to the end of the season , you will see it all laid out . But it is not clear to you what is going on . What is clear is that there is a new dynamic , people are in different places . ... You 'll see that the language is becoming more modern , that people are breaking a lot of the mores , whether they like it or not . And they 're changing , so when you go into that dynamic , what you 'll see is the setup to a bunch of problems . ''
Weiner reveals that one of the problems this season will revolve around Don 's relationship with Megan , played by Jessica Pare .
`` What 's wrong with it ? All I can say is , 'You know already . You 've been told . But it 's not what you think , ' `` he says .
Mad Men has received 15 Emmy awards , including the award for Outstanding Drama Series in each of its first four seasons . Weiner — who is also Mad Men 's head writer and an executive producer — was previously a writer for The Sopranos .
Interview Highlights
On the end of Season Four
`` I always try not to paint myself into a corner , and when I came in at the beginning of Season Four , I said , 'Don is going to have these two parallel relationships ; we 're going to bring this character in as a tiny part as a receptionist . ' And the actress did n't even know that she 's going to end up married to Don Draper . And , of course , I had the chance to pull the plug on this thing at any point during the season , because it 's not set in stone , and then when it got there , I thought , 'This turned out great . This is exactly what I wanted . ' ``
On the character of Don Draper
`` Every decision that he makes is filled with ambiguity . You see him at the end of Season Four . The end of every season is , to me , the end of the show . And that shot was a perfect mirror image of the end of the pilot , when you see Don come home , and you see him with his kids and his wife , and you realize that he 's married . And you feel his emotional connection to them , and he looks out the window , and what you 're getting is someone who 's filled with an ambiguous emotion about things being good , maybe . Because in some ways , this man has some deep issues . ''
On likability
`` What I hoped is what I felt , which is when you see somebody falling apart , you can be disgusted or you can actually feel badly for them . Feeling pity for them can be a tough corner to turn , but I do n't think about likability . I think about lovability . And Don , at the bottom there , was the most lovable I 've ever seen him . He needed love . He is a man who never asks for anything and does n't know how to . He 's a man who keeps such distance that the grains of vulnerability that he expresses are the moments for us to put ourselves into his life . ''
On power and sex and Megan and Don
`` Don 's relationship — and [ the ] women in his life 's relationship [ s ] — between power and sex is very closely linked . And I think it 's part of the human experience . I think it 's an animal thing . Powerful men in particular seem to want to be controlled sexually . ... I think what you 're seeing is that they do have a vibrant sex life , and she is controlling that part of it , and he likes it . And it 's the way they fight . And it 's kind of her saying to him , 'You want to be this way ? Then you ca n't have this , ' and on some level wanting him to realize that he wo n't get it . And what I love about it , and what I think is fresh , is that this woman is not judged afterward . It 's very rare for a woman to express that kind of sexual confidence and control and not be the prostitute , and be somebody 's wife and be in a relationship afterward . I 'm both sexualizing their relationship and explaining her status in the relationship . ''
On his son Marten playing Glen Bishop
`` He was cast because he was the best person available for the role . I would have never thought of him if he was n't my son . It was actually someone else 's idea , and I was counseled against it from all the complications that could happen from him failing at that job . But he really nailed it , and he 's a really good actor . When I asked if he wanted to do this , he wanted to do this . He 's now 15 . At the time , I remember someone saying to him , 'What 's your favorite part about acting ? ' And he said , 'Eating lunch with my dad . ' Who knows if he even understands the difference between this job and other jobs , but it 's beautiful to have him there , and I work a lot . He is part of the cast , and the reason I had him do it is because he 's good at it . The fact that I identify a lot with Glen was confusing to him . ''
For two seasons , Marcus Smart had shown signs of being a force on the court . But after two years filled with gaps of inconsistency , injuries , foul-plagued stints and massive shooting slumps , Smart wants to be an impact player with the Celtics this season .
WALTHAM , Mass . — The night was a glimpse into everything everyone had been told that Marcus Smart could be as an NBA player .
With nine minutes left in Game Four of a first-round series against the Atlanta Hawks , Celtics coach Brad Stevens turned to the 6-foot-4 guard as a last resort to slow down the 6-foot-9 Paul Milsap , who had already torched the Celtics for 40 points on the night . The second-year player was not only up to the task defensively — frustrating Milsap into 1-for-5 shooting the rest of the way — but also offensively when he scored 11 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter of a 104-95 overtime victory .
For two seasons , the Oklahoma State product had shown signs of being that type of force on the court . But those two years were also filled with gaps of inconsistency , injuries , foul-plagued stints and massive shooting slumps .
Now Smart is looking to show he is that player from that memorable playoff night at TD Garden night in and night out throughout a full season .
“ This year is a big year , ” Smart said following Tuesday 's first official practice of training camp . “ It 's my third year . There is no more trying to get used to it . I know what to expect . It 's just time to bring it . ”
Stevens has lauded the way Smart has brought it with his volume and intensity in practices ever since the team took him with the No . 6 pick in the 2014 draft . But getting that competitiveness to translate to effectiveness in games has been a litany of stops and starts . Smart hit some critical shots as Boston rallied into the playoffs during his rookie year , but was benched in the first-round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers .
Last season , his middling shooting numbers regressed as he dipped from 36.7 percent overall as a rookie to 34.8 percent , while his 3-point shooting fell from 33.5 percent to 25.3 percent . This is from a player who attempted 45.9 percent of his shots from behind the arc .
Smart said at the beginning of the summer his main objective was to improve his shooting , claiming on Tuesday he has quickened his release and eliminated “ a dip ” in his shot with the help of Celtics director of player personnel Kenny Graves and video assistant Alex Barlow .
“ I 'm making sure I give myself a chance for the shot to go in , ” he said . “ There is a small room for error . So I 've been just getting up reps . ”
Smart 's transition from a boom-or-bust role player to a reliable cog in the lineup could be one of the biggest variables for the Celtics as they attempt to make the leap toward the NBA elite this season . With Evan Turner 's departure in free agency , there are minutes to be had at both backup point guard behind Isaiah Thomas and backup small forward behind Jae Crowder , with Smart possessing the most versatile skill set of those vying for that time .
“ Nobody is going to do exactly what Evan did , ” Stevens said . “ They may do some things . They may be more of a spot-up shooter . They may be more of a penetrator . It may be that we decide to go small . We may decide to go big . We 're going to play to the strengths of the individual and not necessarily try to fill a spot and be Evan . ”
Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge on Monday mentioned Smart , second-year point guard Terry Rozier and rookie Jaylen Brown as candidates to grab Turner 's vacated minutes , while Stevens tossed in recently reacquired forward Gerald Green to that mix while speaking at a University of Rhode Island coach 's clinic two weeks ago .
The coach added on Tuesday that the preference is for one or two players to separate themselves from the rest and earn those minutes out of training camp . Smart said he believes his breakout playoff performance , and his offseason work , will put himself in position to gain that space for a squad looking to climb from the middle of the Eastern Conference playoff pack .
“ This year is real huge , ” he said . “ Not only for me , but for this team . This year is just big because we have the pieces . We know what it takes . We 've been to the playoffs . We won games . We 've beaten the best of the best on their home floors .
“ Now we 've got to be more consistent as a team and I 've got to be more consistent as an individual . ”
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved a bill that allows military veterans to more easily access medical marijuana in states where it is legal .
Under current Department of Veterans Affairs regulations , doctors who work for the V.A . can not issue cannabis recommendations , even in the 23 states that have laws allowing for medical use .
But under language in the new legislation , the FY2016 Military Construction and Veterans AffairsAppropriations Bill , the department would be prohibited from spending any money to enforce those regulations or to punish veterans who use medical marijuana in accordance with state law .
The vote on the bill comes on the eve of Veterans Day .
“ Veterans in medical marijuana states should be treated the same as any other resident , and should be able to discuss marijuana with their doctor , ” Michael Collins , deputy director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance , said in a press release . “ It makes no sense that a veteran ca n't use medical marijuana if it helps them and it is legal in their state . ”
The newly approved language , which is excerpted below , was added to the overall bill via a committee vote of 18-12 back in May .
Sec . 246 . None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Veterans Affairs in this Act may be used in a manner that would– ( 1 ) interfere with the ability of a veteran to participate in a State-approved medicinal marijuana program ; ( 2 ) deny any services from the Department to a veteran who is participating in such a program ; or ( 3 ) limit or interfere with the ability of a health care provider of the Department to make appropriate recommendations , fill out forms , or take steps to comply with such a program .
The provisions are also included in a separate package of spending bills that Sen. Thad Cochran ( R-MS ) , the powerful chair of the Appropriations Committee , introduced last month as a salvo in ongoing negotiations with the House . Current federal funding runs out on December 11 , and leaders from both chambers are in discussions that they hope will result in an omnibus spending package that can be approved prior to that date .
When the House considered its version of the V.A . spending bill in April , a floor vote to allow veterans to access medical marijuana narrowly failed by a vote of 210-213 . The next day it was revealed that one medical marijuana supporter mistakenly voted no and another voted no because he thought the amendment did n't go far enough . With those two votes flipped , the amendment would have been approved .
In a statement , TJ Thompson , a disabled Navy veteran , praised Tuesday 's action by the Senate . “ On this eve of Veterans/Armistice Day where we remember those who served in the military and the treaty agreement to reach peace concluding WWI , we see this victory as a step toward a peace treaty with the government we volunteered to defend with our lives and as a step toward restoring our first amendment rights and dignity as citizens of the United States , ” he said .
Platforms will be extended to accommodate the high-capacity Crossrail trains that will pass through the station every six minutes at peak . To cope with the extra traffic , a new ticket hall will be built and the entrance will be doubled in size . New lifts will also be installed .
Construction will now start next year , with Vinci as main contractor , and is expected to take 18 months to complete .
The new station , designed by Bennetts Associates , will have a long , curved canopy running the length of the forecourt . The façade will be replaced with a new glass structure .
Client for the project is Network Rail , whose programme director for Crossrail , Matthew Steele , said : “ Crossrail is one of the most important projects that Network Rail is working on and promises to deliver huge improvements to rail transport in Ealing , west London and out to Reading . The project team are committed to delivering these important works efficiently and in partnership with the local authority . ”
Sigmar Gabriel , German vice chancellor and leader of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , said he wo n't run for the post of chancellor , while sharply criticizing Angela Merkel 's legacy , saying her economic policies caused the “ division of the EU . ”
In a statement on Tuesday evening , Gabriel , who had long been touted as his party 's choice for chancellor in the September parliamentary elections , proposed former European Parliament President Martin Schulz to serve as his replacement .

Gabriel also announced he was stepping down as the SPD 's chairman in favor of Schultz .
“ As the leadership of the SPD must be definitive and clear , I also propose him [ Schultz ] as the new chairman of the SPD , ” Gabriel wrote in a statement , praising his record in the European Parliament as “ unique work , ” as cited by Die Zeit .
In particular , Gabriel singled out Schultz 's “ decade-long opposition to right-wing populism and his commitment to social justice , democracy , and social cohesion in Europe , ” contrasting him to current German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who the outgoing SPD chief accused of playing into the hands of Eurosceptic populist parties with her deeply unpopular austerity policy .
“ For all her merits , she , together with Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) , bears the main responsibility for the division of the European Union , ” Gabriel argued , adding that “ no German Chancellor before [ Merkel ] has risked such a great economic , social , and political division [ in the EU ] . ”

The “ relentless insistence on austerity ” by Merkel and her government have , according to Gabriel , who also serves as the minister of economic affairs and energy , “ no doubt contributed to the deep crises in the European Union since 2008 , ” including the increase in unemployment outside Germany and “ to the isolation of a dominant German foreign policy , ” as cited by Handelsblatt .
Merkel 's divisive economic strategy came in handy to opponents of common European policy and a united Europe who have thrived on popular discontent with austerity across Europe .
“ One consequence has been the strengthening of anti-European populist parties and the damaging of not only democracy but also a good investment climate , ” Gabriel pointed out , according to Reuters . He noted that this approach to the economy , which already “ comes at the cost of sustainable growth , ” can be “ also dangerous for Germany . ”
Frauke Petry , the chairperson of the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , questioned whether a candidate like Schultz was suitable for the job .
“ Symbol of EU bureaucracy and a deeply divided Europe as chancellor candidate ? ” Petry tweeted .

While Gabriel did not elaborate on his reasons for stepping down ahead of the general election , he told Stern tabloid in an interview on Wednesday that he did not believe the SPD could win with him as the face of the party .

“ If I were to run now , I would fail , and with me the SPD , ” Gabriel said , as cited by Bild .
“ There are two basic prerequisites for a successful election campaign : the party has to believe in the candidate and gather behind him , and the candidate himself has to want it with every fiber of his heart , and neither of these applies to me to a sufficient extent , ” he explained .
Gabriel 's decision to step aside for Schultz , whose candidacy is expected be confirmed by the SPD on Sunday , seems to be at least partially grounded in unfavorable opinion poll results . A recent poll conducted for Bild by the Emnid Institute shows an almost 20 percent gap between Merkel 's and Gabriel 's popularity . In a direct vote , 46 percent of Germans would vote for the incumbent chancellor , while only 27 percent would vote for Gabriel . At the same time , the poll showed an only one percent difference between Schultz and Merkel , who received 38 and 39 percent respectively .
A hundred years ago , Arsenal moved to North London and built Highbury minutes away from Tottenham 's stadium , White Hart Lane . For a hundred years the two have fought , the pendulum swinging one way , and then the next , decade to decade . And then the 1990s happened , and then the 2000s , and after nearly a hundred years , North London turned emphatically , and some think , irrevocably red . Finally , after nearly a hundred years , Spurs were relegated to playing catch up with an opponent that had already won the race .
But recently , things have changed . Since 2006 , Arsenal and Spurs have been more or less attached at the hip . Instead of fighting for trophies , the Gunners regressed and turned to fighting for fourth-place finishes , while Spurs inched ever closer to their local rivals . Arsenal , on the surface at least , had gotten weaker , as Tottenham had grown stronger . Last year , the Gunners went on a legendary run to finish the 2012-13 season a point above Spurs , winning fourth place and a Champions League berth . But finally , after forever , it seems , the two sides were regarded as equals . This summer , Tottenham sold their soul to Los Blancos for about £86 million , seven players , and the chance to , after forever , it seems , once again turn North London white .
But on Sunday , injury-plagued Arsenal beat Tottenham at home , 1-0 , in the season 's first North London Derby . It was devastating . On paper , at least , Spurs , who used the money from the Gareth Bale sale to Real Madrid to buy Erik Lamela , Paulinho , Roberto Soldado , Nacer Chadli , Étienne Capoue , Christian Eriksen , and Vlad Chiriches , were a better side than Arsenal . But a pragmatist will tell you , pride aside , the result did n't mean much . It was one match . Spurs ' new boys were still gelling , and Arsenal , who still needed a striker , a winger , a defensive midfielder , defensive cover , and a keeper , had spent dick all summer on improving their squad . The smart money was on the deeper , stronger , hungrier Tottenham to outlast and outclass the Gunners throughout the grueling Premier League season . But then , höly shit .

On Monday night , just before the summer transfer window closed , Arsenal announced that they bought German international Mesut Özil from Real Madrid for about £42 million . Everything changed .
Even before the stories ran about Spurs chairman Daniel Levy pleading to Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to block the Özil transfer , it was obvious how momentous this single move was to the rivalry . See , a player like Özil was never supposed to end up in North London . Mesut Özil is , almost without hyperbole , an eater of souls .
As the number 10 for Real Madrid , the 24-year-old ( 24 ! ) established himself as perhaps the single best playmaker on the planet . Since joining the Spanish giants in 2010 , he 's created more chances and goals for his club and country than any other player , and more than than most tandems . Statistically , he is the best . According to his former manager José Mourinho , now at Premier League rivals Chelsea , he is the best . He plays the way you 'd expect a psychic to play . For a player like Özil , moving to any club outside of FC Bayern and Barcelona is a step down .
In a cruel twist for Spurs fans , the transfer would n't have been possible without Tottenham 's help . Gervinho conspiracies theories aside , Bale 's transfer—and , more importantly , his transfer fee—along with the Real Madrid 's signing of of 20-year-old stud Isco , made Özil surplus to requirements .

And with the signing , we see a difference in strategy between the Gunners and Spurs . Tottenham sold their most valuable piece—basically their only valuable piece—and swapped him for a new team . Arsenal , after a disaster of a transfer window in which they failed to plug their holes , signed one legend . Though both teams could win trophies this year , it 's unlikely that either will win the Premier League or continental competitions . Come next spring , they 'll probably both be fighting for Champions League qualification . The question , then , is a tough one : in this pivotal transfer window , when North London is , after forever , it seems , neither red nor white , who had the better summer ?
It 's a tough question , because it 's also a philosophical one . Because surely in a game that employs 11 players a side on a 120-yard-long playing field , seven is greater than one . After all , this is n't basketball , where a player can block a shot , grab the loose ball , race down the court , then dunk in transition . In sacrificing Gareth Bale , Spurs sacrificed 21 league goals , four assists , and a talisman . In return , they got Soldado , who is a if nothing else , can score goals . They got Lamela , a young winger who looks , physically and stylistically , at least , a player in the mold of Bale himself . They got Eriksen , Capoue , and Paulinho , hot commodities who will hold down the midfield once they gel . Chadli and Chiriches add extra strength and versatility . They traded in their star , their savior , for a complete team . On paper , Spurs had the best transfer window of the summer .
The signing of the summer , though , belongs to Arsenal . Because while Spurs no longer have a star , Arsenal , who are still full of holes that no single player could hope to cover , do . He 'll win his new squad points , sure . But Özil is important to the Gunners for more than just points . He 's important because he belongs nowhere near North London . He 's important because after some coaxing , and in spite of reported offers from teams like Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United , he chose Arsenal . He vouched for the Gunners , and the hope , the expectation now is that other stars will follow .

This transfer window was a vital chapter in the storied North London rivalry , but it will be a while before we know who had the best of it . Both clubs , who have grown closer and closer in stature and ability in recent years , have diverged again . It 's difficult to see where they 'll end up . But for now , for today , at least , North London is still red .
As a nationalist I fully support the decision of President Trump to pull out of the Paris deal . My objection is not based on the environment but rather on the fact that the restrictions on the US are much harsher than the restrictions on China , India , and our other competitors despite these countries producing just as much if not more pollution than the US . If democrats and other environmentalists wanted nationalist support for something like this they would simply have to make sure that our competitors are hit harder than we are and we would gladly take the comparative advantage .
President Trump has the opportunity to exit the agreement the proper way and I fear he will miss it . The worst way President Trump can exit the treaty is the same way Obama entered it : By executive action . When this treaty was offered to the countries of the world it was ratified by their respective legislatures . It was only the US , with the dictatorships of the world , who entered to it soley on the will of one man , Barack Obama . Instead of saying that the US will pull out of the agreement President Trump should do what should have been done in the past and send it to the senate . This creates precedent for things like this to be ratified by the senate in the future .
Article 28
There is also a hidden provision in the Paris agreement that we need to pay attention to . Article 28 section 1 says that a nation can only withdraw from the agreement three years after the agreement was entered into . With this provision we are stuck in the agreement for 3 years . If the decision gets sent to the senate and they fail to ratify then we would never have entered into the treaty in the first place and can leave it as soon as possible .

Local authorities in Japan have demanded the removal of a monument in memory of the tens of thousands of labourers forcibly recruited from the Korean peninsula during the second world war .
The monument , dedicated to Koreans who died after being brought to Japan to work in coalmines and factories amid a wartime labour shortage , was erected by a friendship society in a public park in 2004 .
The government in Gunma prefecture , north-west of Tokyo , has ordered it removed after what the Asahi Shimbun newspaper described as petitions from `` anti-Korean '' groups and individuals complaining that it was anti-Japanese and had become the focus of political activity in a publicly owned space .
Part of the inscription , written in Japanese and Korean , reads : `` We hereby express our determination not to repeat the same mistake by remembering and reflecting on the historical fact that our country inflicted tremendous damage and suffering on Koreans in the past . ''
Many of the 600,000 ethnic Koreans living in Japan are the descendants of labourers who remained in the country after its defeat in 1945 .
The Gunma assembly adopted a resolution to remove the monument after accepting criticism that it had been the focus for political activity during a memorial service in 2012 . Prefectural authorities said they would refuse to extend the monument 's 10-year licence if the friendship society failed to remove it voluntarily .
Giichi Tsunoda , a former upper house MP and representative of the group that commissioned the monument , said the officials had acted unreasonably . `` The gathering is a memorial event and the prefectural government 's decision to remove the monument is tantamount to abusing its authority , '' Tsunoda said . `` Its conclusion that the gathering was politically motivated is also arbitrary . ''
Commemorating the use of forced labour is causing similar controversy in other parts of Japan . In Nagasaki , a row has erupted over a proposed monument to Korean victims of the atomic bombing of the city in August 1945 . A draft text of the epitaph reportedly condemns imperial Japan for its use of slave labour .
The controversies are being played out against a rise in anti-Korean sentiment in Japan , fuelled by disputes between Tokyo and Seoul over territory and Japan 's conduct during its 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula .
The UN human rights committee has called on Japan to do more to clamp down on hate speech directed at Koreans during demonstrations in Tokyo and other cities . The committee , which noted that there were more than 360 such demonstrations and speeches last year , mainly in Korean neighbourhoods in Tokyo , is expected to make recommendations to Japan on Wednesday , possibly including the introduction of legislation against hate speech .
On Wednesday , officials from both countries met in Seoul to discuss Japan 's use of as many as 200,000 mainly Korean and Chinese women as sex slaves before and during the war . Japan recently ruled out a revision to a 1993 official apology , but suggested that the statement was the result of a political compromise and not an accurate reflection of Japanese involvement in wartime sex slavery .
The prime minister , Shinzo Abe , is one of several prominent conservative politicians who have questioned claims that the imperial Japanese army coerced the women – euphemistically referred to as comfort women – into working in frontline brothels .

I wo n't lie , Arizona . We 've had some great times drinking beer . Who could forget our first trip to Four Peaks ? Or the Mesa Strong Beer Festival just a few months ago ? We 've had fun and that 's what makes this so hard to say : my beer gut belongs to another state .
That 's right , Arizona . I , like many of my fellow Phoenicians , am a transplant . It just so happens that I 'm from Texas and as such , my heart belongs to Shiner ; that delicious beer made from the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner Texas . Which is why I 've been sneaking bottles of Shiner 's Bohemian Black Lager between Kiltlifters . I 'm sorry for the betrayal .
Initially I was attracted to Bohemian Black Lager 's tiny , black label , but when I opened my first bottle , I found so much more than superficial reasons for enjoying this beer . So despite how hard it will be for me to get this off my chest , I 'm going to tell you the reasons why . You deserve that much .
Trigger warning : Frank discussion of domestic abuse , rape , self-harm , and recovery from trauma .

Once upon a time , I did not like Sansa Stark .
My disinterest in her did n't last long . I started watching Game of Thrones four-odd years ago , when I was a fresh college grad who , despite the strong feminist streak I 'd picked up during the course of my higher education , was still sorting through a lot of internalized misogyny . What can I say ? It takes more than four years on a liberal arts campus to unlearn a lifetime of problematic mentalities .
Truth be told , I did n't even take the full four years to embark on this journey of self-exploration and discovery , because half of that time was spent under the thumb of a man who I called my boyfriend , but who I would later come to realize was my abuser .
I began to empathize with Sansa as soon as Joffrey showed his true colors to her , when he attacked Mycah and Arya while on the Kingsroad . Sansa did n't recognize his cruelty then , as he had been nothing but kind and courteous to her . He was her prince , and nothing could change her mind about that . Really , Joffrey was a walking red flag , but to someone as idealistic and romantic as Sansa once was , there 's no such thing . Having made countless excuses for my abuser while we were together , I connected with Sansa as soon as she lied to save Joffrey from punishment .
For all of her efforts to prove that she would be loyal and obedient to her betrothed , Sansa 's reward was the death of her direwolf , Lady . This loss was the first stab in the slow death of Sansa 's personhood . Joffrey was the only one who could have convinced his parents that it had been him , and not Arya , who instigated the fight . That would have saved Sansa 's wolf , but he chose silence . Displacing blame is a favorite course of action for an abuser , but Joffrey covers his tracks by giving Sansa a necklace and some pretty words so his behavior will be excused and she 'll trust him again . What 's more , he was coerced into doing this by Cersei—Joffrey did n't want to comfort Sansa , but did so because he eventually realized it would suit him .
The transference of blame is an effective way for an abuser to initiate control over a victim , because the act is so insidious . While Joffrey 's refusal to take responsibility for his actions ended dramatically in Lady 's death , in my case the tactic was more subtle . The first time I recall it happening was perhaps a month before my abuser and I became a couple . We 'd smoked in his car and , since it was raining , he said we could ash in the car instead of rolling down the windows . The next night he sought me out to tell me , “ You made a mess in my car . It took me a half hour to clean up all the ashes from your cigarettes . But it 's okay , I got to think about you while I did it . ”
I felt guilty and stupid for making a mess in his car , even though he 'd initially told me not to worry about it . It was perhaps the most confusing encounter I 've ever had with a crush , and I agonized over it . But , like Sansa , I let it go because it was my fault , really , and he 'd said something sweet to make up for it .
It was n't until Ned 's death that Sansa truly becomes a prisoner in King 's Landing and a plaything for Joffrey to practice his sadism on . It was an easy enough risk for Joffrey to take—he was the king by then , and “ The king can do as he likes. ” Abusing his future queen was like taking candy from a baby , so much so that he could command Ser Meryn Trant to strip and beat Sansa in a roomful of spectators without worrying that anyone would interfere .
I 'm not sure exactly how or when my abuser knew he could do what he liked to me and I would take it , but he had the power and he abused it thoroughly . He performed my public humiliation on a smaller scale than Joffrey , but it stripped me of my self-worth all the same . One incident I remember was when , in front of a mutual friend , my abuser talked about what might happen if we had children . “ If there 's anything wrong with it , I 'll kill it and I 'll leave you , ” he said .
At the time , I was more shocked that he would say that in front of another person than I was that he would say it at all , and I was embarrassed—not of him , but of myself . I did n't even have the desire to be a mother , but he made me feel guilty that I would prove to be an unfit one , and I was humiliated that my friend was privy to this fault in me .
It 's no wonder that such events can shatter our perceptions of love and healthy relationships . For example , after their engagement , Sansa rejects Tyrion 's kindness , both because he 's a Lannister and because she does n't know what it means to be treated well by a man , or perhaps she does n't believe herself worthy of kindness . She no longer believes in the romantic notion of a knight in shining armor . I was much the same way , and continue to be skeptical of potential romantic partners . I flinch or grow stiff when touched , am endlessly apologizing for things I have no control over , and am so surprised when they have a nice word to say about me that I often brush off their compliments or outright accuse them of lying . My abuser tricked me into believing that kindness comes at a price , and it 's a misconception not easily shaken .
Despite the atrocities Joffrey committed against her , perhaps the most obviously abusive act visited upon Sansa—or at least the most talked-about—is her rape by Ramsay in Season 5 , which I have discussed before . I still disagree with the showrunners ' decision to exacerbate Sansa 's suffering—once the camera cut to Theon , her rape is hardly about her at all , and more about shock value . I caution fans against defending the scene because it 's “ realistic ” and “ reflective of actual crimes committed against medieval women , ” because those who oppose the scene already know that . Rape victims do n't need to be told that rape is realistic—it 's our reality . Statistics estimate that one in every five or six women are victims of attempted or completed rape in their lifetimes , and that 's in America alone .
I remember mine , as well as I can under the circumstances . It was the middle of an afternoon in the middle of November . I thought we were just kidding around until he put his pillow over my mouth—it was an old pillow , flat , and the pillowcase was black and white and gray and I could n't breathe or muster the words to ask him to stop . I 've tried so hard not to think about it that when I look back , it feels like I blacked out . The next thing I knew , he was tossing the pillow aside and laughing at me : “ I do n't know what you were so scared for . I would n't rape you , Katie. ” But he did ; he 'd done it just moments ago . In a similar vein , Ramsay told Littlefinger , “ I 'll never hurt [ Sansa ] , ” and afterwards he did nothing but .
Part of the reason why Sansa 's rape is so upsetting is because we , the audience , had been led to believe that no harm would befall her now that she was out of Joffrey 's clutches . Sansa had been mistreated and abused by one man already ; surely her story would n't repeat itself . The idea of Dark Sansa was hyped up , and we were all clamoring to see her transition from pawn to player in the game of thrones .
That phrase in and of itself has , however , given me pause . We often call Sansa a pawn rather than a player , perhaps because she 's cleverer than we give her credit for . We have to ask ourselves why “ pawn to player ” does n't apply to other characters when it rightfully could : Daenerys was certainly a pawn when the story began , traded to a stranger in exchange for an army that was n't even intended for her . Arya has played the part , handed off from captor to captor , all of whom take care of her in order to meet their own ends . Even Tyrion , cunning as he is , has been used as a piece in someone else 's game—namely his father 's , who pretty much played the sadistic matchmaker in all of his son 's personal affairs .
Maybe the phrase applies to Sansa because she is never in a position to speak her mind the way others are—Daenerys as Khaleesi , Arya because she 's regarded as a headstrong but harmless child , and Tyrion as a member of a noble and powerful family . Victims of abuse are not permitted to speak so openly , but our timidness is both a result of our abuse and a survival tactic . Sansa has to choose her battles in order to stay alive , so she 's patient , calculating , and can be subtly cruel . This Season 2 scene is a prime example , where she tries to manipulate Joffrey into going where the fighting is thickest during Stannis ' attack on King 's Landing , knowing he very well might be killed .
This is also the first time we experience Sansa 's apt judgment of character : she knows Joffrey was a sadist , but a stupid and cowardly one , and she tries to use that to her advantage . Later , Ramsay proves himself to be a sadist of a much more intelligent kind , and Sansa adjusts her behavior accordingly by choosing her words more carefully . In Season 5 , despite the damage Ramsay has done to her , she abandons subtlety and uses her wits to undermine his claim as the eventual Warden of the North .
Victims of abuse often have nothing but our words , and those are just as likely to get us into trouble as anything else ; as far as the abuser is concerned , everything about us can justify punishment . Sansa measures her words and picks her battles , and in these moments she is powerful ; it 's how we know she has n't lost herself or her self-worth . It 's how we know she 's still fighting , that not only is she determined to survive , but she will .
This is especially poignant to me , because I was already in a state of low self-esteem when my abuser sought me out . I was unsure about my decision to go away to school , I was shy and no great shakes at making friends . I walked with my head down and always had a book with me so I would n't have to talk to anyone . I was noticeably vulnerable , and therefore an easy target . I had very little self-worth left for him to strip away before I was totally compliant . He was smart and perceptive , so he saw right through me , and whatever he saw in me apparently did n't deserve to be treated like a human being .
As we saw with Theon , Ramsay is an expert in stripping away his victims ' personhood . But Sansa escaped Joffrey , and it 's her past experience that gets her through her ordeal with Ramsay . She remembers who she is , even when there 's no one left to remind her . Victims of abuse are often isolated by their abusers , cut off from family and friends , so we have to be our own hero . While more than half of abused women do just that by leaving the relationship , they are 70 times more likely to be killed by their abuser during that process than at any other point in the relationship .
While we do n't yet know what Ramsay will do to hunt down his bride next season , I certainly did n't have a life-saving escape in mind when I made the move to end my relationship . I broke up with my boyfriend not because I consciously realized who he really was , but because I could n't be in a relationship anymore . Maybe I was more alert than I give myself credit for , but all I remember from the time is that I could n't stand to be touched by him , that I wanted to be alone , and that I did n't want the responsibility of a relationship because I simply was n't ready for it . I was tired of him , and whatever love I had for him was n't enough .
In retrospect , I was too scared to overtly end things with him , so instead I told him I did n't want to have sex anymore , and he took it from there . It hurt that I 'd be tossed aside over something as trivial as sex when we 'd been in love , but then again , I 'm not sure there was really any love to lose between us . It took several months after the end of our relationship for him to leave me alone for good , and longer still for me to begin my recovery .
When Sansa says to Myranda , “ If I 'm going to die , let it happen while there 's still some of me left , ” her defiance took me back to when I was at my lowest point , when I had no idea who I was anymore , all because of what my abuser had taken away from me . It took me a year to acknowledge what that relationship really was . I had to admit to myself that he hurt me on purpose , both physically and emotionally , and although that admission should have been a moment of clarity that began my healing , all it did was make me feel like he had once again gotten the best of me . He 'd beaten yet another time ; it was almost like he came back into my life and started the cycle all over again .
No , he was n't physically around to hurt me anymore , but my memories of him were so present that I started hurting myself . I could n't handle the emotional pain , the nightmares when I could sleep or the paranoia when I could n't , so I channeled it all into something physical that I could control—my self-harm was a coping mechanism and my scars a reminder that I was in control of myself , my mind , and my body , and that he could n't take that away from me ever again . As soon as I realized this , I jumped off my own Winterfell rampart by chucking my scissors and letting my scars fade .
It 's been six years , but I 'm still healing ; I suffer from insomnia and can be easily triggered , and it can take days for me to recover from a triggering incident . I 'm not sure what sort of person I 'd be if this had n't happened to me , and while I 'm proud of who I am now , I will never say I 'm grateful for the path that led me here . I 'm stronger now , healthier , but my abuser did n't give that to me ; he tried to take that away , and I made myself better in spite of him . One of the last things he said to me was “ I ruined you . Who 's going to want you now that I 'm done with you ? ” At the time , I did n't know the answer to that . Now I know that it does n't matter , because he did n't ruin me—he broke me , yes , but I put myself back together .
Sansa Stark helped me see that I am in control of myself , no matter what others do to beat me down , and that I will continue to survive and thrive . Words are powerful weapons we can utilize to realize what we 're made of , and characters are windows into self-discovery , which is why we admire those who are so fleshed out , flawed , and gray . Sansa is a fictional woman who has suffered through real , modern-day tragedies that continue to be misunderstood , underestimated , and too often dismissed .
To my fellow survivors , I hope that no one ever makes you feel that your pain is invalid and that your suffering has been in vain . I hope that you find peace and recovery , and that you discover the confidence within you that 's helped you to survive and move on . I hope that you take Sansa Stark 's words to heart , that you remember who you are , and that who you are is strong , important , and , above all , a person worth fighting for .

White supremacist charged with threatening judge , State Attorney , FBI agent
William White of Roanoke , Va. , is accused of threatening key figures in the prosecution against American Front members .
William A . White , a 36-year-old white supremacist from Roanoke , is accused of threatening former State Attorney Lawson Lamar , Circuit Judge Walter G. Komanski and an FBI task force agent .
A federal grand jury indicted a Virginia man on charges that he threatened key figures involved in the Central Florida case against the American Front white supremacy group , the U.S. Attorney 's Office said Wednesday .
More than a dozen suspected members of the American Front were arrested last year and accused of conducting paramilitary training in Osceola County to prepare for what they believed would be a race war .
After their arrests , death threats emerged on several websites , and prosecutors say White demanded authorities release the 14 people facing state charges .
Federal prosecutors said White made four threats directed at Lamar and one at the former prosecutor 's son .
White threatened to kidnap , torture , rape and kill his targets and their spouses , children and grandchildren , the U.S. Attorney 's Office said . The threats also included names and home addresses .
The case against the American Front members largely fell apart . The only remaining defendant set for trial next year is the American Front 's leader , Marcus Faella .
On Wednesday , an Orlando federal grand jury indicted White on five counts of making threats over the Internet , and one count of unlawful use of identification . If convicted , he faces up to 20 years in prison per count .
White is being held in a Virginia jail on other charges .

Over the last 15 years , I 've amassed a fair share of concert memorabilia . My collection features the usual suspects in splintered drumsticks , worn out guitar picks , and beer-stained setlists , as well as a totally weird/obsessive face towel that was used and then discarded by a frontman . Well , at least I thought it was one of the stranger souvenirs lifted from a show . In terms of utter ridiculousness , nothing comes close to the bags of Kanye West concert “ air ” that recently popped up on eBay .
You can rub your eyes all you want , but the above absurd statement remains the same . Someone claimed to have “ captured ” air during a concert on Kanye 's 2013 Yeezus tour and actually tried peddling it on eBay last weekend . The initial asking price was merely $ 5.00 , but after more than 90 bids , that number ballooned to a monstrous $ 60,000 . The post has since been taken down , and it 's unclear if any transaction was completed .
For those looking to add a bag of Yeezus air to their epic Kanye memento closet ( $ 350 Yeezy Boosts and nearly $ 4,000 Kanye jackets soon to come , no doubt ) , fear not — there are about five more listings on eBay at this very moment . I ca n't quite tell if those sellers are absolute geniuses or idiots . Either way , it seems Kanye fans have A LOT of money to burn .
Step One To Embracing A Lack Of Scarcity : Recognize What Market You 're Really In
from the not-as-hard-as-you-think dept
This is my latest post in the ongoing series of posts about economics when scarcity is removed from certain items . Two weeks ago , in my post about the 17th century button makers and how they were quite like the RIAA in many ways got plenty of attention , and that kicked off a fun discussion . Many people ( phew ) saw the connection , but a few did not , and claimed that the situations were entirely different . The button makers , they claimed , were trying to stop anyone else from making buttons , while the RIAA has no problem with anyone else making music . Of course , this ignores the specific similarities ( crying out for government help to defend a business model , treating customers like criminals , wanting to invade people 's private homes , etc . ) that were pointed out in the post -- but more importantly , it highlights one of the biggest problems that many who are in industries threatened by disappearing scarcity face : they do n't actually understand the market they 're in.It 's interesting to note that it was n't horse-drawn carriage makers who became successful automobile companies . No , they ended up going out of business , because they too narrowly defined their markets as being the horse-drawn carriage market , rather than the road-based transportation market , or just the transportation market . Of course , that was something the railroad businesses could have claimed as well -- but they also were too narrowly focused on being in the railroad business ( and , some say , were the inspiration behind passing certain anti-automobile laws early on in the automobile 's history ) . The horse-drawn carriage makers , however , very much should have realized they were in the transportation market , and should have been always looking for ways to step up to provide better and better systems for local transportation . People were n't buying horse-drawn carriages because they were horse-drawn carriages , but because they could use them to more easily get somewhere . Thus , when automobiles hit the scene , the smart horse-drawn carriage maker would n't have looked at it as a threat , but as an opportunity to provide a better transportation system to his customers . But , that only works if he correctly defined the market.In the case of the RIAA , contrary to the complaints in that button-maker post , they are not actually `` making music . '' The musicians make the music , and the RIAA hardly represents the musicians . The RIAA is the `` recording industry '' and they represent the interests of the record labels who , while they may claim are in the music business , appear to believe they 're really in the `` music selling business '' rather than ( as they really are ) the `` music entertainment business . '' They believe their job is to distribute music , promote it , and get people to buy it . They make money by keeping that system closed and locked down . If they recognized they were really in the `` entertaining people with music business '' they should only be ecstatic about new technologies and services that make their job easier . In the case of file sharing systems , that was a tremendous new distributionpromotion system all rolled up in one -- . What a tremendous resource -- if they were actually in the music entertainment business and wanted to make it easier to promote and distribute music . They could leverage that infinitely available , free resource to promote and distribute music and musicians , and then use that to make money in other ways ( concerts , sponsorships , endorsements , appearances , fan clubs , etc. , etc. , etc. , ) But by limiting the definition of what business they were in by what their existing business model said they were selling , they chose to fight it.The same is very much true of the MPAA , who represents the movie studios , and still seems to think they 're in the business of selling movies . That 's not true . People do n't go out to the movies because it 's `` a movie . '' They go out to the movies to be entertained . They 're in the entertainment business , and the industry is falling down miserably by making the movie going experience dreadful . They 've taken the entertainment part out of the entertainment business as they focus so desperately on holding onto the `` movie selling business '' and in the process , they 're finding it actually tougher to sell movies.So , when it comes to the button-makers ( who did n't realize they were in the clothing accessories business ) , it really is the same situation . The entertainment industry cartels are n't really fighting `` competition . '' They 're simply scared to death of the opportunity that 's staring them in the face , because they think they 're in a different business than they 're actually in.If you 're looking to catch up on the posts in the series , I 've listed them out below :

Since early days of iOS , iTunes-style system backups could be protected with a password . The password was always the property of the device ; if the backup was protected with a password , it would come out encrypted . It did n't matter whether one made a backup with iTunes , iOS Forensic Toolkit or other forensic software during the course of logical acquisition ; if a backup password was enabled , all you 'd get would be a stream of encrypted data .
Password protection of iOS system backups was always a hallmark of iOS data protection . We praised Apple for making it tougher for unauthorized persons to pair an iPhone to the computer in iOS 11 . Today we discovered something that works in reverse , making it possible for anyone who can unlock an iPhone to simply reset the backup password . Is this so big of a deal ? Prior to this discovery , forensic specialists would have to use high-end hardware to try recovering the original backup password at a rate of just several passwords per second , meaning that even the simplest password would require years to break . Today , it just takes a few taps to get rid of that password completely . If you know the passcode , logical acquisition now becomes a trivial and guaranteed endeavor .
iOS Backup Password Security
How secure , exactly , are iOS backup passwords ? We measured the recovery rate or backups made by several different versions of iOS , and here are the results .
iOS 4 to 9 ( and 10.1 ) : about 150,000 passwords per second on GPU ( NVIDIA GeForce 1080 )
iOS 10.0 : about 6,000,000 passwords per second with Intel i5 CPU due to a bug we discovered
iOS 10.2 and up ( incl . iOS 11 ) : about 5 passwords per minute ( CPU ) ; ~100 passwords per second on GPU
As you can see , iOS backup passwords are pretty secure . With just 100 passwords per second ( iOS 11 , GPU acceleration ) , a simple 6-character password would take over a month to break – considering the password only contains of lower-case letters ! 6-character password with at least one capital character and a digit would take several years to break . Do n't even dream of breaking longer/more complex passwords !
iOS 11 Ruins It
Prior to iOS 11 , if you 've got an iPhone and attempted to perform logical acquisition by pulling an iTunes backup , you would always face the risk of backup data being encrypted with an unknown password . If this was the case , your only option would be using Elcomsoft Phone Breaker or Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery to attack the original , plain-text password in order to decrypt the backup . Depending on the version of iOS installed on the iPhone or iPad you were extracting , the recovery speed would be slow or very slow , with iOS 10.2 through iOS 11 being the slowest .
It is very important to note that , once a backup password was set , all versions of iOS prior to iOS 11 would not allow removing or change that password without either providing the original backup password ( that you may not know ) or performing a full factory reset of the iPhone/iPad .
In iOS 11 , Apple makes it possible to simply reset the backup password on the iPhone . The procedure is simple .
Unlock the iPhone with Touch ID , Face ID or passcode .
Open the Settings app and navigate to General .
app and navigate to . Scroll all the way down and tap Reset .
. Tap and confirm Reset All Settings ( iPhone passcode required if enabled ) .
Using “ Reset All Settings ” will erase the following settings :
Display brightness
Whether or not to display battery percentage
All Wi-Fi passwords ( but not any other passwords or tokens stored in the Keychain )
any other passwords or tokens stored in the Keychain ) apple.wifi.plist
iTunes backup password
As you can see , resetting an iTunes backup password is fairly simple . All you lose are a few settings that are n't all that important for the investigation , as well as the list of Wi-Fi passwords . All user data including the content of the Keychain ( except Wi-Fi passwords ) are preserved .
It is important to know that this process does not wipe/invalidate existing pairing records ( lockdown files ) ; otherwise , with iOS 11 new security policy , that would require you to enter device passcode in order to establish a new pairing relationship between the iPhone and the desktop . As a result , you may use an existing lockdown record to perform logical acquisition ; however , you would still need to enter device passcode in order to Reset All Settings .
iOS 10 and Earlier
According to Apple , “ If you have a device with iOS 10 or earlier , you ca n't reset the password . ”
Check If Backup Password Is Enabled
You can check if the backup password is enabled by either using Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ( the “ ( I ) nfo ” option ) or with iTunes . Note , however , that iTunes may alter the content of the device by syncing it with the computer . In the following screen shot , you can see that “ Encrypt iPhone Backup ” is enabled . This means you 'll have to recover the backup password in order to decrypt the backup – or simply reset it on the device if it is running iOS 11 .
Logical Acquisition of iOS 11 Devices with Unknown Backup Password
We recommend the following approach to performing logical acquisition of iOS 11 devices if ( and only if ) the backup is protected with an unknown password .
Pre-requisites :
iPhone or iPad device running iOS 11
Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit 2.40 or newer
Backup password is set and is unknown ( whether or not a backup password is set can be verified by using the ( I ) nfo command of Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit )
Device passcode not set or is known ( it will be required to Reset All Settings , and you may need it to establish a trust relationship , which is required to pull a backup after resetting the password )
Steps :
Perform steps to create a local backup . You may still attempt attacking the original backup password .
Disconnect the iPhone or iPad device from the computer .
Unlock the iPhone or iPad device with Touch ID , Face ID or passcode .
In Settings – General – Reset , tap and confirm Reset All Settings . Note : device passcode required ( if enabled ) .
Reconnect the iPhone or iPad device to the computer .
( Skip this step if you have a valid lockdown file ) You will be prompted to establish the trust relationship with the computer . Confirm prompts on the computer and on the iPhone or iPad device .
( Skip this step if you have a valid lockdown file ) You will be prompted to enter device passcode on the iPhone or iPad device . Provide the passcode to complete pairing .
Once the pairing relationship is established , use Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit to create a new backup . Note : iOS Forensic Toolkit will set a temporary password of “ 123 ” ; this will allow you to decrypt keychain items . You may use an existing lockdown file ( pairing record ) to create the backup .
Our Take
In our opinion , the new “ feature ” looks like a huge step backwards . The ability to reset backup password allows anyone who can unlock your iPhone ( and knows the passcode , if one is enabled ) to pull the ( mostly ) complete set of data from your device , which includes your credit card data , passwords and tokens . In many cases this even includes the Apple ID token , which in turn opens access to almost everything in the cloud such as iCloud Photo Library . The passcode remains the only thing to protect your iPhone . If your passcode is compromised , the content of your iPhone is now open to anyone with access to the actual device .
Conclusion
iOS 11 makes it possible to reset passwords protecting iTunes-style backups , which was never possible in previous versions of iOS . Interestingly ( and somewhat counter-intuitively ) , the Settings reset does not invalidate existing lockdown ( pairing ) records ( the “ Reset Network Settings ” option does ; apparently , Apple does not consider network settings to be part of “ all ” settings – so they should have named the feature as “ Reset Some Settings ” instead ) . If it would , you 'd require to re-establishing trust relationship with the computer you 're to make the backup . Since iOS 11 requires entering device passcode in order to establish trust between the device and the computer , you would need to know the original device passcode in order to perform logical acquisition . Since pairing records are not invalidated , you may extract a lockdown file from the user 's computer and use it in order to make a backup ( but you would still need that passcode in order to reset backup password ) .
Thanks to Cindy Murphy from Gillware who first discovered that change in iOS 11 , and to Mattia Epifani , the author of Learning iOS Forensics book , who pointed out to the article at Gillware .
AMSTERDAM , Sept 26 ( Reuters ) - A Dutch website said on Sunday it had garnered enough signatures to force the Netherlands to hold a non-binding referendum on the EU 's association agreement with Ukraine , in a move meant to signal popular dissatisfaction with Dutch European policy .
GeenStijl , a satirical news website known for its irreverent and raucous takes on controversial subjects ranging from Islam to immigration , said it had collected more than 440,000 signatures - far more than the 300,000 needed under Dutch law to trigger such a vote .
“ YOU did it , out of love for democracy in the Netherlands and Europe , and to send a signal to The Hague and Brussels , ” the website told its readers in a post on Sunday evening . Any referendum is likely to be held during the Dutch presidency of the European Union , which starts in January .
Though the signatures must still be vetted for authenticity and eligibility by electoral authorities , the unexpected scale of interest is seen as an unwelcome challenge to the broadly pro-EU consensus in The Hague , even if it is unlikely to have any impact on Dutch government policy .
A founding member of the 28-member bloc , the Netherlands has in recent years cooled on European integration amid controversies about immigration from poorer new members in the East and rising poll showings by the anti-EU Freedom Party of right-wing populist Geert Wilders .
“ The petition will definitely bolster the broader Eurosceptic and right-wing populist subculture . Expect more petitions , ” Cas Mudde , a Dutch specialist in political populism at the University of Georgia , told Reuters .
“ It is a purely consultative referendum , which will almost certainly not change the Dutch position . I doubt turnout will be high , which will undermine the result , ” he added .
The website , which has a broadly anti-EU editorial line , said it chose the association agreement as a subject for a referendum simply because it was an EU-related topic eligible for a vote under Dutch electoral law .
But it also argued that the agreement , under which the EU will provide help and financial aid to Ukraine in return for it implementing economic and political reforms , is a major step towards membership for the East European country , which is fighting a war against Russian-backed separatists in its East .
“ Have you ever been asked what you think of such an expansion of the EU ? ” asked the website .
The Netherlands ' relationship with Moscow has been badly strained by the shooting down of an airliner with 298 people on board last year over Eastern Ukraine , two thirds of whom were Dutch . ( Editing by Andrew Roche )
Nicholas Rabone Hogan was convicted over posting ‘ ill-advised ' satire in December but the conviction was overturned on appeal
An SBS employee who drunkenly posted “ ill-advised ” satirical threat to murder police in the name of Allah has had his conviction overturned on appeal .
Nicholas Rabone Hogan , 32 , posted the threat to Facebook hours after the funeral of the murdered NSW police accountant Curtis Cheng on 16 October 2015 .
He was convicted in December 2015 and given a two-year good behaviour bond . However , Hogan appealed to the district court and in April judge Christopher Hoy quashed his conviction under section 19B of the federal Crimes Act , which allows for an offence , while proven , to be dismissed on character and other grounds .
Hogan 's barrister , Tom Molomby SC , told the court section 19B was “ tailor made ” for no conviction to be recorded against Hogan . Molomby submitted that the offence was not committed with any intent to harm , was not aimed at anyone and had no victim .
The court had heard in December that Hogan drank 10 pints before posting “ I 'm going to kill a police officer this morning in the name of Allah ” in what his lawyer called “ ill-advised ” satire .
UPDATE ( 3/18/12 ) : In conjunction with this post please also read the second part of the story which I wrote about two months after creating this post , along with the third part of the story . The text you see here was originally crafted in November of 2011 which was a lifetime ago in terms of iPad and Chromebook updates .
I am fortunate to work in a school district that is often on the cutting edge when it comes to instruction and technology integration . Much of our technology is purchased by individual school site communities and this diversity has led to many teacher-led , grass-roots instructional technology innovations . However , it means at Technology Services we must be flexible , adaptable , and constantly learning .
As part of this learning process , we have the opportunity to work with one school site that happens to have simultaneously occurring iPad and Chromebook pilots . The class set of iPads are used in the intermediate grades and the class set of Chromebooks are used with middle school English , history , and AVID students . In both cases the teachers are leveraging technology to support the site 's instructional focus of comprehensive balanced literacy ( Reading and Writing Workshop and balanced literacy approaches ) . We are only a few weeks into each of the pilots , but so far the iPad teachers are a bit disappointed . One of them even asked , “ Can I trade the iPads in for Chromebooks ? ” To Apple iPad devotees , this request might come as a bit of a shock . However , this statement really stems from frustration with iTunes and the iOS operating system .
So why do the Chromebooks look so good ?
Immediate Set Up : When delivered to the site the Chromebooks were being used by students within 5 minutes of being taken out of the boxes . The devices integrate with our Google Apps for Edu system , so Technology Services could take care of the initial set up and students were able to immediately log in with their district-provided Google Accounts

All of the Google Apps tools , along with third party apps the district installs from the Google Apps Marketplace ( SlideRocket , Aviary , etc ) work with the hardware . All Websites Work : The Chromebook works with any website . Flash , HTML5 – it does n't matter . It just works . The teachers do not have to spend any time looking for or downloading a special app .
The Chromebook works with any website . Flash , HTML5 – it does n't matter . It just works . The teachers do not have to spend any time looking for or downloading a special app . Personalization : Since students login to the Chromebooks with their individual accounts , they can personalize the device in terms of adding bookmarks , browser backgrounds , and apps . This particular classroom where the Chromebooks are being used has close to 95 % home-Internet access . The kids have mentioned that they also like the fact that all of their settings , documents , and resources can be retrieved at home by using the Chrome web browser . Effectively , these students are able to seamlessly move their technology and learning experiences between both school and home .

Additional Costs : The teachers noted that the Chromebooks do n't need a case or any additional apps , yet the initial purchase price is about the same ( or even a little less ) than a 16GB iPad . Additionally , if a Chromebook has any problems we just drop it in a box , mail it to Google , and they 'll send out a new one .
And why are the iPads frustrating ?
Device Set Up & Management : We were able to preconfigure the iPads before they were sent to the school site . However , the devices still have to be associated with the iTunes account and the computer to which they will all sync . When you plug the 30 devices into the computer ( through the Bretford Syncing Cart ) you are met with the most un-Apple of Apple experiences . First you have to wait…it takes iTunes a few moments to see all the devices . Then various windows start popping open including update and registration windows . These windows open for all of the devices . So , if you have 30 devices , you have 30 windows to close . Once the windows are all closed you need to rename each of the iPads .

Updates : Have you ever updated your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch ? To update a class set of iPads you have the luxury of experiencing that process 30 separate times . There is no “ Update All ” and walk away . You get to do them one at a time . We have discovered a method for streamlining the process – get the first iPad all updated and configured , back it up , and then use that file to individually “ image ” the remaining iPads .

Apps : The teachers have described the App Store as being “ a complete mess. ” It 's challenging to find apps that are educationally relevant and effective , while also being within their limited budget . As time passes on , we 're really focusing on free apps because for any paid app you need one copy for each device . A $ 5 app will cost $ 150 to have it on all of the devices . Additionally , there really is n't a method for trying out an app before buying it .

Additionally , there really is n't a method for trying out an app before buying it . “ The Syncing Cart that Does n't Sync ” – This is how one teacher described the Bretford PowerSync Cart . The cart does allow you to plug all 30 devices into your computer with one cord . However , once they show up in iTunes you manage each device separately . If there is a video you want on all of the devices you use the iTunes menu ( just like you would for your iPhone ) to chose that video and put it on that device . Once you have iPad 1 set up , just repeat the process 29 times . There are some short cuts like having apps and iTunes content automatically download to all devices . However , one of the teachers suggested that iTunes really needs an option where she could tell the program “ make all 30 devices look like iPad # 1 ” and be able to a walk away .

Google Apps : Our students and staff have access to Google Apps EDU . Google Apps and specifically Google Docs , has become a very powerful tool for teachers and students . They love the fact students can start an assignment at school , finish it at home , and collaborate on their work with other students . Unless the school site pays for an app ( and we 've had challenges finding a good one ) , the iPads can not effectively use Google Apps and all of its features .

Turning In Student Work : While the iPad may have been designed as a personal device , due to limited funding our sites have situations where students must share iPads . For example , the teacher might use the same set of iPads with three different groups of students . When students use an app like Pages or Keynote to construct content , they can not easily submit it to their teacher . Our teachers are used to students submitting work via Moodle or a digital dropbox . We are still working with teachers to identify a solution that will effectively assist in this process . Our students do have email ( through Google Apps for Edu ) , but we ca n't really have 3-5 different email accounts set up ( and ready for use ) on each device . Additionally , email does not work well if the teacher has many students – like our secondary teachers with 165 kids .

Additional Costs : Between the need to purchase apps , a case , and headphones the $ 499 iPad can quickly increase in total cost of ownership .
By no means is this post meant to be a comprehensive review of either device . When I first purchased an iPad I found it frustrating as well . It did n't do what I expected it to do . However , over time I realized it definitely was a powerful device I would hate to live without , but it was different than anything I had owned before . Similarly , I have had my own Chromebook for the past two months and while I love the battery life and seamless integration with Google Apps and any web 2.0 tool ( it 's great for conferences ) , you ca n't do much with it if you do n't have an internet connection and the trackpad is a bit challenging . Interestingly , none of the students have mentioned any frustration with the trackpad – perhaps it 's just an adult issue .
The experience of supporting both Chromebooks and iPads at this one school site reinforces for me the importance of choosing technology that directly supports your instructional goals and then providing the time , talent , resources , and professional development to ensure the seamless integration in the classroom . Fortunately , we are just at the beginning of these pilots and we have even more to learn from this great group of innovative teachers and students . Who knows , perhaps in few months the Chromebook teacher will be asking to trade her devices for iPads ? I 'm just happy they let me come learn with them .

Yay ! Another trip around the Sun . New Year 's Eve is sort of like the birthday celebration for the Earth ( or at least according to the Gregorian calendar ) . But it does n't just have to be about a party . You can also add some physics into your celebration .
How Fast Is a Champagne Cork ?
Why does a cork shoot out of a champagne bottle ? The first reason that cork sails across the room is because you made a mistake . Do n't shoot that champagne cork , instead hold your hand over it while you open it . Otherwise you could hurt someone—or even worse , spill some alcohol .
The second reason is that champagne contains dissolved carbon dioxide . This carbon dioxide produces internal pressure that pushes on the cork . But here is the cool part . Normally , this internal pressure exerts an outward force on the cork that is balanced by a frictional force between the cork and the walls of the bottle ( and maybe a force from the cork net on top of it ) . However , once the cork starts moving it transitions from static friction to kinetic friction with a lower value such that the forces are no longer balanced . The cork then accelerates and shoots out of the bottle .
But how fast is it ? If you know the size of the cork and the frame rate of a cork shooting video , you can also get position and time data . Here is a plot of the position of the cork in the direction of travel ( the axis is along the length of the bottle ) .
Looking at the slope of this line , I get a cork velocity of about 12.2 m/s or 27.3 mph . Yes , that 's fast for a cork even if it has a small mass .
Motion of a Party Popper Streamer
What would New Year 's Eve be like without explosives ? These tiny party poppers have just enough explosives to shoot some streamers out of a small container . Here is a plot of the position of a streamer as it comes out of the popper .
The streamers leave with a velocity of about 10.7 m/s ( 24 mph ) . But notice how the slope of the position graph decreases towards the end . The streamers slow down because of air resistance . At the beginning of the shot out of the popper , all of the streamers are bunched up together making them sort of like one larger object with a larger mass . As they spread out , the ratio of air resistance to mass increases and they start to slow down . I guess this is all for the best . If the streamers continued on with a high initial speed , they would fly all the way across the room .
Why Does a Party Horn Make That Noise ?
Although the sound might be rather annoying , these party horns show some cool physics . The horn sound comes a vibrating plastic part in the mouth piece . It might look something like this .
The small plastic piece contains two flaps that are pushed closed . When air is blown into the horn , this air pushes the flaps open so that the air flows through . But here is the cool part . Moving air has a lower pressure than stationary air . This means that the moving air does n't push on the flaps as hard as when the air was stationary . This reduced pressure lets the flap close which stops the airflow . You can probably guess what happens next—now that the air is stationary , the pressure increases pushing the flaps open again . This process creates that annoying sound and keeps repeating until you run out of breath .
It 's essentially the same way all wind instruments ( like the clarinet and saxophone ) make their music also .
So do n't just party , enjoy the physics along with that party horn .
Ford kicked off the 2014 North American International Auto show in Detroit by unveiling its new F-150 . It 's the first full-body truck to be constructed from aluminum . WSJ 's Joe White reports .
THE global boss of car giant Ford has warned the Australian economy will suffer `` in the long term '' with the loss of its auto manufacturing sector .
With Ford and Holden announcing factory shutdowns in 2016 and 2017 , and with Toyota likely to follow in 2018 , Australia 's entire automotive manufacturing base - which employs in excess of 50,000 workers - is destined to collapse , with little hope of a revival .
At an open forum on day two of the Detroit motor show , Ford chief Alan Mulally was asked by a university student about the importance of government assistance in manufacturing .
`` No country is ever successful in the long term … without a really strong and vibrant manufacturing base , '' said Mr Mulally .
`` It 's the foundation of all economic development . You actually make things that create value . That 's why every country around the world is collaborating with the private sector … to figure out how to create an environment where manufacturing ( is viable ) . ''
Nineteen of the G20 nations have vehicle manufacturing industries but that figure will fall to 18 once the car industry shuts its doors in Australia .
The industry estimates at least $ 10 billion in economic activity would be wiped from Australia each year once car manufacturing ceases .
Early in Holden 's campaign for an increase in government assistance last year , Holden boss Mike Devereux told News Corp that Australia needed to decide if it was content to simply become `` a farm , a hotel and a quarry '' , referring to agriculture , tourism and mining as the big industries once manufacturing dies .
Yesterday , Mr Mulally said 70 per cent of all the research and development in advanced technology and investment is associated with manufacturing , and it was the `` foundation of wealth creation '' .
`` You create value and you create jobs , '' he said .
When asked if this meant Australia was `` doomed '' , Mr Mulally said : `` I do n't know about that word , but clearly Australia is going where it 's going . And what Australia 's done with their ( low import ) tariffs and what they 've done ( reducing ) support of their industry ... ''
Mr Mulally would n't comment further on what the loss of the manufacturing industry would mean to the Australian economy , but he repeated the message that Ford will continue to sell cars once the Broadmeadows car assembly line closes . `` We 're going to serve ( Australia ) with more vehicles ... we 're just not going to be making them there , '' he said .
Mr Mulally 's comments came a day after the head of international operations for General Motors , Stefan Jacoby , said it was `` impossible '' to make cars in Australia .
`` Since the market is so open , with a lot of Free Trade Agreements coming up , it is fundamentally impossible to produce vehicles in Australia , regardless of what the government is saying , '' said Mr Jacoby , formerly the boss of Volvo and a high-ranking Volkswagen executive .
Even if the Federal Government were to raise import tariffs it still does not make sense to build cars in Australia , he said .
`` If they would make barriers and would truly support their local automotive industry it would lead to an uncompetitive business , '' said Mr Jacoby . `` Local production , even if you would be a pure assembly ( operation ) does n't make any sense .
`` Our business is driven by scale of economics , of productivity , of an efficient supplier industry … optimised logistics … Australia is just too small in these scales . ''
A statement from Toyota Australia yesterday said : `` Recent factors have put our manufacturing operations under unprecedented pressure . We are now studying all relevant business impacts and a decision will be made on future investments sometime this year . ''
Last week , Toyota Australia 's executive director of sales and marketing , Tony Cramb , admitted the situation is dire but insisted `` the writing is not on the wall '' .
But Mr Cramb said Holden 's decision to end manufacturing in 2017 `` puts unprecedented pressure on Toyota and makes it more difficult for us to be the sole manufacturer here in Australia '' .
Mr Cramb confirmed that a decision about investment in the all-new Camry due in 2018 would come from Japan by `` the middle of the year '' .
However , News Corp Australia has been told by Toyota insiders that Japan may delay the announcement until later in the year because the relationship has soured between the global headquarters and the Altona factory floor .
Ford 's Alan Mulally is credited with one of the biggest turnarounds in the automotive world . He joined Ford seven years ago after 37 years with Boeing .
The company was tracking so badly , In his first year at Ford it posted a record $ 17 billion loss .
Mr Mulally sold off assets and other car brands that Ford had acquired , including Jaguar , Volvo , Aston Martin and Land Rover , mortgaged the company to the hilt - including the Ford badge - borrowed $ 23 billion and began a complete transformation of the company just before the Global Financial Crisis hit .
It enabled Ford to keep its foot on the accelerator and develop new models at a time when other brands were forced to stop development and slash costs . Indeed , Ford 's rivals General Motors and Chrysler had to be bailed out by the US Government .
Ford has since paid back its original $ 23 billion loan from the banks , its global sales have increased and the company has been profitable under Mr Mulally 's leadership . He recently declined an offer to run Microsoft and says he will continue to lead Ford through to the end of 2014 .

San Francisco 49ers Faithful have n't forgotten the rhetorical rampage coach Mike Singletary issued when reports of Jimmy Raye 's `` garbled '' playcalling surfaced the day after the Seattle loss in Week 1 . Samurai Mike was furious that this information had anonymously become public .
`` If there 's something you have to say , go say it and say that you said it , '' Singletary told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat . `` But do n't go say a bunch of stuff , ‘ But do n't tell him I said it . ' To me that 's a rat . That 's a coward and a rat . ''
Singletary was not finished . `` I do n't want to spend my time trying to find the rat . In time , the smell will come , '' Singletary told the San Francisco Chronicle .
Coach , there are now strong indications that the rat is your boss , 49ers owner Jed York . The same guy who hired you and signs your checks .

Dadgummit !
It 's pure speculation , but it 's speculation that has popped up among the Bay Area 's most esteemed 49ers beat writers since York fired off the infamous `` We 're going to win the division '' text message to ESPN 's Adam Schefter .
`` Jed is letting everyone know he texts national writers , '' Lowell Cohn notes in the Santa Rosa Press Democrat . `` That also lets us suspect he 's done it before — i.e. , he is a leak in his own organization . Is he The Rat ? ''

The 49ers coach Mike Singletary announces he 's sticking with Smith for the Oct. 17 game against the Oakland Raiders . ( Published Monday , Oct. 11 , 2010 )
`` ( York ) texted ESPN 's Adam Schefter , '' noted the Sacramento Bee 's Matt Barrows . `` Gee , I wonder who leaked the Jimmy Raye/Michael Lewis/Takeo Spikes items . '' A Jason LaCanfora NFL.com report in Week 2 had erroneously claimed Lewis and Spikes were being immediately benched .
Another report on Singletary 's job security or lack thereof surfaced on Yahoo ! Sports Tuesday .
`` Does n't that make you wonder about the true identity of the 'rat ? ' '' Tim Kawakami writes in an 800-word Mercury News hit piece , clearly suspecting Jed York as the rat . `` I know around the league , it 's not that hard to figure this one out . ''
49ers 2010 in Pictures
Many of us are n't as sure as Kawakami that Jed York is , in fact , the so-called rat .
But until we know for sure , just for laughs , maybe we should nickname the rat `` Tim Rat-tay '' .
Joe Kukura is a freelance writer who probably should have worked an `` I smell a rat ! '' gangster movie reference into all this .

Borussia Dortmund plan to announce the sacking of coach Peter Bosz on Sunday , Sport Bild and other German news outlets reported , after the spiralling club lost at home to Werder Bremen on Saturday .
The result extended the Black and Yellows ' winless streak to eight games in the Bundesliga dating to September , in which time they 've fallen from first to seventh place while losing 18 points to league leaders Bayern Munich .
Bosz had described Saturday 's match against 17th-placed Bremen as a `` must-win , '' and after suffering a 2-1 defeat , he will pay the price with his job , according to Bild .
Bosz , 54 , was hired in June after helping Ajax reach the Europa League final and finish second in the Eredivisie .
His tenure with Dortmund started well , winning six and drawing one of his opening seven league games -- putting Dortmund top of the table while Bayern Munich struggled under then-coach Carlo Ancelotti .
But since the start of October , Dortmund have only managed to beat third-tier Magdeburg in the DFB Pokal , while losing five of eight Bundesliga games . In the Champions League , they only managed two draws against Cypriot minnows Apoel .
Bosz admitted after Saturday 's defeat that Dortmund had reached a new low with their performance .
`` Bremen deservedly won . Especially in the first half , we played very poorly . That was the worst I 've seen since my appointment , '' Bosz said . `` Not only from a footballing point of view , we were simply not aggressive enough in the tackles . Bremen 's lead was a logical consequence .
`` There was only a brief period in the second half when I thought that could nick it . But after conceding the 2-1 off a corner , we had no comeback . I have to bluntly say : We lacked quality . ''
He also accepted the blame for the team 's form , adding : `` We did not play the way exercised in training . If one player had the ball , others did not move . Of course , I 'm responsible for all that in the end . ''
Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer , who did not mince words in his own opinion on Dortmund 's form , said the players should be held accountable rather than the coach .
`` It 's us players , who shoot the ball out of bounds , who do not defend the goals , who ca n't defend set pieces , '' he said . `` The coach ca n't sub himself on and score the goals himself . I 'm sorry if I keep repeating myself on a weekly basis but it 's us players [ who are at fault ] and today 's game is annoying me so much . ''
Dortmund will travel to Mainz on Tuesday before facing Hoffenheim on the following weekend .
Human Nature and Martial Arts Training
What are we willing to do ? A man is verbally assaulting your date . I suppose one could respond in rime one could walk away . But if we were to ask a psychologist about the essence of human nature we would hear from a specialist what we all know deep inside . It is human nature to stand up for ourselves and our beliefs . It is human nature to stand up for people who need our help and our courage to be strong for them . If we witness an assault or a crime we have to do something about it . Somehow , society wants to make us believe that we should stand back and let other people handle it . But when you look around there is no one else . It is only us who are able to help . Back to the example from earlier , a man is out with his date and she gets verbally assaulted . From the women 's perspective it is comforting to see that the man is able to stand up for her and protect her… may it be as primal as a punch in the face . From a man 's perspective he really has no other option than to stand up for her . First he should ask the assailant to leave but in the real world that usually makes it worse and it is at that point where he has no other choice than to physically restrain the assailant and protect his date . It is here where good martial arts training becomes necessary – because as a human being we need to decide what is appropriate and what is not . Most of the time a punch to the face will end the confrontation because the receiver does not expect it . A punch has a sobering effect and as such is very effective . It is the assailant 's ego that makes him believe that the man who only protected his date has no right to physically restrain him and his assaults . It is the same ego that made the assailant believe in the first place that he has the right to assault someone else without any consequences . It is not about encouraging violent behavior . It is about doing the right thing at the right moment ! It is about controlling the situation and making sure that innocent people wo n't get hurt because of our negligence !
Man , any man is part warrior . Yes , we have evolved . We were suit and ties , have cell phones and drive expensive cars . But there are certain primal qualities that will always be there . We all have experiences the embarrassment of not standing up for ourselves . Usually that happened in our childhood years , someone takes our lunch money or cuts in line in front of us . And although we were being told that ignoring it and walking away was the right thing to do , deep deep down we knew that we should have done something about that . And this failure stays with us , haunts us and sometimes defines who we become in life until we learn the techniques and skills to make better decisions and stand up for ourselves and others .
We all have had our successes in our professional careers , we have given money to charities , we have volunteered to causes dear to us and it has brought us enormous gratification as a human being . But as a man , as medieval as this may sound , as a man the most satisfying moment of our life is the moment when we stand up for ourselves or someone who needs standing up . And that is a fundamental truth of man 's human nature .

Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals
Although Amgen is the world 's biggest biotechnology company , the drugmaker has been mostly absent from one of the industry 's biggest and fastest-growing markets : cancer drugs .
It took a big step to fix that on Sunday , agreeing to buy Onyx Pharmaceuticals for about $ 10.4 billion in cash to gain access to the company 's three anticancer treatments .
Under the terms of Sunday 's deal , Amgen will offer $ 125 a share in cash through a tender offer for Onyx 's shares . The transaction is expected to close at the beginning of the fourth quarter , subject to regulatory approval .
Sunday 's takeover is the latest within the health care industry , one of the busiest sectors for deal makers as companies seek to gain greater scale . drugmakers have been among the most prolific buyers , seeking new medicines that will refresh aging product lines .
Amgen 's purchase ranks among the five biggest-ever takeovers of a biotechnology company , according to data from Standard & Poor 's Capital IQ . Among the larger transactions were Sanofi-Aventis ' $ 20 billion acquisition of Genzyme and Gilead Sciences ' $ 11 billion purchase of Pharmasset , both announced in 2011 .
It is also one of the two biggest takeovers in Amgen 's history , trailing only the company 's $ 17 billion deal for Immunex in 2002 .
Though many drugmakers and their advisers have spoken of a continuing hunger for more takeovers , the deal machine has actually slowed a little this year . One reason is that biotechnology companies ' stocks have risen strongly , reducing potential sellers ' desire or need to sell .
Though the bid is higher than the $ 120-a-share proposal from Amgen that Onyx rejected two months ago — about 38 percent above its stock price at the time — the offer is lower than the $ 130 a share many analysts had expected . A number of pharmaceutical companies had shown interest during the sales process that Onyx 's bankers ran , but ultimately Amgen showed the most persistence in pursuing a deal , people briefed on the matter have said . On Friday , shares of Onyx closed at $ 119.96 ; Amgen closed at $ 105.60 .
The crown jewel of Onyx , which is based in South San Francisco , Calif. , is Kyprolis , which was approved in the United States last July as a last-ditch treatment for multiple myeloma , a bone marrow cancer .
The drug recorded sales of $ 125 million in the first six months of this year . But many analysts see annual sales growing to $ 2 billion in several years if the drug wins approval in Europe , and wins approval to be used earlier in the course of treatment .
“ Amgen has a unique opportunity to add value to Kyprolis , a product which is at an early and promising stage of its launch , ” Robert A. Bradway , chief executive of Amgen , based in Thousand Oaks , Calif. , said in a statement Sunday .
Mr. Bradway , a one-time investment banker who took over as chief executive in May 2012 , is under some pressure to increase Amgen 's sales , which were $ 17.3 billion last year . Much of the company 's revenue comes from older drugs whose sales are no longer growing rapidly or , in the case of the anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen , are falling .
Some of Amgen 's older drugs are facing competition in Europe from near-copies , known as biosimilars , and might face the same in the United States in the coming years . Late this year , Teva is expected to begin selling a near-copy of Amgen 's Neupogen , a drug that helps prevent infections in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy .
Amgen has huge sales of drugs that help patients cope with chemotherapy and counter some of the effects of cancer , but it has long wanted drugs that directly attack the tumors themselves . Those are among the most popular in the pharmaceutical industry because they can fetch prices as high as $ 10,000 a month .
Amgen sells one such drug , Vectibix for colorectal cancer , but sales have been disappointing . The company has some others in clinical trials .
The acquisition of Onyx is not without risk . The multiple myeloma market is now very competitive , led by Celgene , which sells the blockbuster Revlimid . Celgene won approval earlier this year for another drug , Pomalyst , that has been competing with Kyprolis as a last-ditch treatment .
There is also the issue of cost . If Kyprolis is approved for use earlier in the course of treatment , it is likely to used in combination with another drug like Revlimid . That could run into resistance on reimbursement , particularly in Europe .
Onyx obtained Kyprolis through one of its own acquisition , that of privately held Proteolix , in 2009 for $ 276 million upfront , with up to $ 575 million more dependent upon achievement of various milestones .
The deal was considered a gamble for N. Anthony Coles , who had become Onyx 's chief executive a year and a half earlier . But it transformed the company . It was not announced Sunday what role , if any , Dr. Coles will have after the merger is completed .
Kyprolis , known generically as carfilzomib , inhibits the action of the proteasome , which is sort of a garbage disposal system for cells . That inhibition somehow hurts cancerous cells more than healthy ones . It is the same mechanism of action of Velcade , a myeloma drug sold by Takeda Pharmaceutical and Johnson & Johnson that was approved in 2003 .
Onyx 's two other products on the market are Nexavar for liver and kidney cancer and Stivarga for colon cancer and a gastrointestinal tumor . Onyx sells both of those drugs with Bayer . Onyx also has the rights to an 8 percent royalty on sales of a promising breast cancer drug , palbociclib , that Pfizer is developing . The company reported revenue of $ 362 million in 2012 , mostly from drugs it shares with Bayer .
Amgen has plenty of financial resources to support its purchase . It has lined up $ 8.1 billion in bank loans , and will finance the balance with some of its $ 22 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand as of June 30 . The company expects to retain its investment-grade credit rating and plans to continue raising its dividend .
Amgen was advised by Lazard , Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell . Onyx was advised by Centerview Partners and the law firm Goodwin Procter .
Introduction
BarbBlock is a content blocking list with standalone browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox . It blacklists sites which have used DMCA takedowns to force removal from other content blocking lists . Such takedowns are categorically invalid , but they can be effective at intimidating small open-source projects into compliance .
BarbBlock was created in response to a troubling instance where a company used the DMCA takedown process to force a domain blacklist to remove its domain . In reaction to this , some people added the domain to their personal blacklists , even those who were n't blocking it before the takedown . This phenomenon is called the Streisand Effect , and it ( indirectly ) gives BarbBlock its name . In essence , this extension exists to automate the Streisand effect .
The initial release of BarbBlock blocks the domain in question , functionalclam.com . If DMCA takedowns continue to be misused for blacklist removals , the extension will be updated to cover other domains as well . Updates are automatic through the Chrome App Store .
As the maintainer of this extension , I pledge to dispute any takedown that comes to this repository . This is not my first DMCA-takedown rodeo 😉 . I also pledge to only add domains belonging to companies which have attempted to remove themselves from other blacklists through legal threats , including ( but not limited to ) “ Cease and Desist ” letters and DMCA takedowns .
Goals
I intend to accomplish a few things with this project .
By calling the bluff of DMCA takedown notices , I hope to show that the takedown filers know their takedowns are meritless and would not stand up in court . If the extension gains significant traction , it will provide a disincentive for companies to issue takedowns in the first place . As a browser extension and centrally-hosted blacklist , the number of users is more quantitatively verifiable than a bunch of users independently adding domains to their blacklist .

In the past 15 years , Balkan governments have expended huge efforts to reduce the levels of crime and corruption .
Much of this good work now threatens to be undone as the syndicates exploit the chaos on Europe 's periphery to refill their coffers , expand their recruitment and further exert their corrupting influence on governments . In times of instability , criminal structures grow deep roots quickly , which are very tough to remove , especially in struggling economies .
Organized criminal syndicates have changed rapidly since the fall of Communism . They were among the first institutions to exploit globalization to the full . With the expansion of new markets around the world and the emergence of a vast lawless zone for the best part of a decade from Yugoslavia in the west to Russia 's border with China in the east , the 1990s saw a remarkable upturn in the provision of illicit goods and services around the world .
Rob Wainwright , the director of Europol , told me that this has affected “ a move away from the traditional family structures of organized crime towards one that is much more multinational. ” Add to this the exceptional value of mobile technology and social media networks to criminals , and this renders policing the refugees all but impossible .
This refugee crisis will not go away until a solution to the war in Syria is found , and there is no prospect of that in the near future . So it is imperative in the short term that barriers are brought down . In the last week , borders have been closed , walls built and armed forces deployed . In response , the smuggling groups in the Balkans are simply raising their prices to guide people across the ever more treacherous borders . Meanwhile , the humanitarian situation for all those refugees , whether in Macedonia , Serbia , Croatia or Hungary , reaches crisis levels .
The European Union must agree on and implement a policy for taking refugees across its member states as soon as possible . There are 500 million people in the European Union , and it is perfectly capable of absorbing a further two million , especially since the aging population is already placing immense strains on the Continent 's long-term economic prospects . Many of the refugees from Syria are highly educated and a significant potential asset to the union . Allowing them to stagnate in makeshift camps where despair and criminality are spreading will benefit nobody in the host countries except for those running the underground economy on which the refugees increasingly depend .
The Balkans have come a long way since the wars of the 1990s , but there are still major unresolved political and economic challenges , especially in Bosnia , Kosovo , Serbia , Albania and Macedonia . The longer Europe dithers over its refugee policy , the greater the strain on these countries , not the least being the growing influence of corrupt and criminal structures .
NEW DELHI : Amid reports that the US may curb President Barack Obama 's early morning schedule during his visit to Delhi later this month , air pollution monitoring agencies said the levels of ‘ PM2.5 ' or fine , respirable particles that get lodged in the lungs are likely to be in the range of moderate to high in the period while he 's here.Air quality , because of the high pollution in the city , is routinely rated by the US embassy pollution monitor as “ poor ” — in other words , unhealthy . It 's in that context there is speculation that the US authorities here could seek to curtail Obama 's “ outdoor activities ” during his visit.However , what makes this difficult is that Obama is chief guest at the Republic Day parade which is held in the open and in the morning when pollution levels are usually high.It 's possible that Obama will be seated in a sealed bulletproof enclosure which will keep out the polluted air . When contacted , US embassy sources dismissed all speculation about Obama 's outdoor activities being curtailed.According to data with Delhi Pollution Control Committee , the PM2.5 level for the past three years - 2012 , 2013 , 2014 - during January 25 to 27 ( the period when Obama will be here ) was between 130 to 170 micrograms per cubic metre , which is at least five times the WHO standard , eight times the US Environment Protection Agency ( USEPA ) standard and twice the Indian safe standard.The PM2.5 levels early in the morning when the R-Day parade is held is likely to be very high . In 2013 , on the Republic Day between 6 am to 10 am , PM 2.5 values ranged between 234 to 160 µg/m3 . So , the levels could peak to 15 times the US safe standard of 15 µg/m3.This winter , the US embassy 's monitoring station in Chanakyapuri has been recording several days with `` hazardous '' air quality because of severe smog . The embassy provides an AQI in the city with real time PM2.5 values and a corresponding health advisory . `` It is too early for the SAFAR model to predict the air quality on January 26 , but based on the statistical analysis of past four year of data and considering the growth in emissions and weather conditions , it is estimated that value of PM2.5 on that day is likely to be hovered between moderate to poor , between 90 to 110 µg/m3 , which is better than now , '' said Gufran Beig , chief project scientist of System of Air Quality , Weather Forecasting and Research .
I think we 'd all agree we 've got a few scores to settle in Milwaukee . The Bucks ' owners talking shit , to a certain Malcolm Brogdon stealing the Rookie Of The Year . Obviously we will settle these scores in the most harmless way possible , but we need to settle them nonetheless .
But there 's no way we 're staying in that shithole .
So this year , Bus The Process will be Bus The Process AND Fly The Process .
On March 2nd , we 'll fly ( direct ) to Chicago . We will stay in Chicago until Sunday , when we take a bus to Milwaukee , have a three hour pregame party , and then take over the March 4th ESPN game against the Bucks . We 'll then bus back to Chicago and fly home on Monday .
Chicago is an amazing town and a lot of fun . And if you 've been to Bus The Process I or II , you know we 're going to have ( harmless ) fun and make ( harmless ) news .
Stephen McConnell Case ( born August 21 , 1958 ) is an American entrepreneur , investor , and businessman best known as the former chief executive officer and chairman of America Online ( AOL ) . Case joined AOL 's predecessor company , Quantum Computer Services , as a marketing vice-president and became CEO of the company ( renamed AOL ) in 1991 . Since his retirement as chairman of AOL Time Warner in 2003 , [ 2 ] he has gone on to invest in early and growth-stage startups through his Washington , D.C. based venture capital firm Revolution LLC . Case authored The Third Wave : An Entrepreneur 's Vision of the Future which became a New York Times bestselling book in 2016 . [ 3 ] Case recently gave a fireside chat at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC , on May 16 , 2017 , titled `` Building Silicon Valley Outside of the Valley . `` [ 4 ]
He supports inclusive entrepreneurship and innovation through the Rise of the Rest road trips [ 5 ] and the Case Foundation . Case also served as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship ( PAGE ) and was a member of Barack Obama 's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness . [ 6 ] He also served on the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship ( NACIE ) . Case was chairman of UP Global , a non-profit organization focused on fostering strong entrepreneurial communities , recently acquired by Techstars . [ 7 ]
Life and career [ edit ]
Steve Case was born and grew up in Honolulu , Hawaii , [ 8 ] the son of Carol and Daniel Case . [ 9 ] He graduated from the private Punahou School [ 8 ] ( Class of 1976 ) and attended Central Union Church .
Case graduated from Williams College in Williamstown , Massachusetts in 1980 with a degree in political science . For the next two years he worked as an assistant brand manager at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati , Ohio . In 1982 he joined Pizza Hut Inc. in Wichita , Kansas , serving as manager of new pizza marketing . [ 8 ]
In January 1983 , his older brother Dan , an investment banker , introduced him to Bill von Meister , CEO of Control Video Corporation . The company was marketing a service called GameLine for the Atari 2600 video game console that allowed users to download games via a phone line and modem . After that meeting , von Meister hired Case as a marketing consultant . [ 8 ] [ 10 ] Later that year , the company nearly went bankrupt and one of its investors , Frank Caufield , brought in his friend Jim Kimsey as a manufacturing consultant . Case later joined the company as a full-time marketing employee .
In 1985 Quantum Computer Services , an online services company , was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video . Kimsey became CEO of the newly renamed Quantum Computer Services and hired Case as vice president of marketing . In 1987 he promoted him again to executive vice president . Kimsey groomed Case to become chairman and CEO when Kimsey retired , and the transition formally took place in 1991 ( CEO ) and 1995 ( chairman ) .
As part of the changes that gave birth to Quantum , Case changed the company 's strategy , creating an online service called Quantum Link ( Q-Link for short ) for the Commodore 64 in 1985 with programmer ( and AOL co-founder ) Marc Seriff . In 1988 , Quantum began offering the AppleLink online service for Apple and PC Link for IBM compatible computers . In 1991 he changed the company name to America Online and merged the Apple and PC services under the AOL name ; the new service reached 1 million subscribers by 1994 , and Q-Link was terminated October 21 of that year .
AOL pioneered the concept of social media , as its focus from day one was on communication features such as chatrooms , instant messaging and forums . [ 11 ] Case believed that the `` killer app '' was community — people interacting with each other — and that was the driver of much of AOL 's early success . By contrast , competitive services of the time such as Prodigy funded by IBM and Sears , focused on shopping , and CompuServe focused on being an information utility . [ 12 ] AOL 's strategy was to make online services available and accessible to the mass market by making them affordable , easy to use , useful and fun . [ 13 ] At a time when competing services like CompuServe were charging for each minute of access ( which varied based on modem speeds and added extra charges for premium services ) , AOL priced its service at $ 19.95 per month for unlimited use of basic tier services beginning in 1996 . [ 14 ] Within three years , AOL 's userbase grew to 10 million , ultimately reaching 26.7 million subscribers at its peak in 2002 . [ 15 ]
Among many initiatives in the early years of AOL , Case personally championed many innovative online interactive titles and games , including graphical chat environments Habitat ( 1986 ) and Club Caribe ( 1989 ) , the first online interactive fiction series QuantumLink Serial by Tracy Reed ( 1988 ) , Quantum Space , the first fully automated Play by email game ( 1989 ) , and the original Dungeons & Dragons title Neverwinter Nights , the first Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ( MMORPG ) to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text ( 1991 ) .
After a decade of quick growth , AOL merged with media giant Time Warner in 2001 , creating one of the world 's largest media , entertainment and communications companies . The $ 164 billion acquisition was completed in January 2001 but quickly ran into trouble as part of the dot-com recession , compounded by accounting scandals . Case announced his resignation as chairman in January 2003 , although he remained on the company 's board of directors for almost three more years . [ 16 ]
The failure of the AOL-Time Warner merger is the subject of a book by Nina Munk entitled Fools Rush In : Steve Case , Jerry Levin , and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner ( 2005 ) . A photo of Case and Time Warner 's Jerry Levin embracing at the announcement of the merger appears on the cover .
In 2005 , Case wrote in The Washington Post that `` It 's now my view that it would be best to 'undo ' the merger by splitting Time Warner into several independent companies and allowing AOL to set off on its own path . `` [ 17 ]

2018 Midterms : What To Watch For One Year Out
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images
One year out from the 2018 midterm elections , Democrats see light ahead while Republicans are being dragged down by President Trump .
Democrats got a huge boost after big wins in Virginia and other states on Tuesday in a repudiation of Trump 's victory just one year ago , finally harnessing the backlash against an unpopular president to wins at the ballot box . Now , they must keep that momentum going .
Republicans have to figure out how to run campaigns in the era of Trump . Can they distance themselves from the president , or are their candidates too inextricably linked ? In Virginia , Ed Gillespie tried to run on Trump 's controversial policies without fully embracing the president , and failed spectacularly .
There is a lot over the next 12 months that will determine the answers to some big questions : Can Democrats take back control of the House ? Can Republicans expand their majority in the Senate so they can govern more easily ? And how will the Trump factor play into all of it ?
Here 's your guide to what to watch for with both parties and the White House over the next year , and an early take on the battles for the House and Senate .
What 's at stake for Republicans
Republicans have yet to prove they can be , in the words of House Speaker Paul Ryan , a `` governing party '' and not just the `` opposition party '' they became during the Obama era . And that could cost them at the ballot box next November .
Privately , political strategists admit that not passing major tax legislation could be disastrous for their midterm prospects — failing to deliver on yet another one of their campaign promises after several misses earlier this year in efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act .

But the long-term identity of the party could be decided in fractious primary challenges , being amped up by former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon . If the ethno-nationalist forces in the GOP triumph in the primaries , it could mean that Trumpism is here to stay far beyond Trump as figures like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake leave and people in the mold of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore enter the stage .
If that happens , leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan could be in serious trouble . Bannon 's bark may end up being bigger than his bite , but he will force the establishment to spend to save incumbents or prevent weak candidates from being nominated instead of focusing their fire on Democrats , and that is n't what Republicans wanted to be doing this cycle .
What 's at stake for Democrats
Democrats have many advantages this cycle — a heavily unpopular president , historic patterns of losses for the party in power and an apparent enthusiasm edge , given the protests that have popped up with regularity ever since Trump 's election and closer special House elections this year .
On Tuesday night , they finally got the big victories they had been salivating over . Now , if wins across Virginia were any indication , Democrats have a lot to be hopeful about come next November . Turnout was higher than it was four years ago , and even while Democrats privately fretted that nominee Ralph Northam had run a lackluster campaign , he easily overperformed Hillary Clinton , with the reality of President Trump now proving more motivating for Democrats than the mere possibility of Trump in office was one year ago .
So Democrats may be inching closer to the type of economic message that vexed them last year , have capitalized on backlash to health care , and appear to be making opposition to the GOP tax plan a salient issue . There is still plenty of resentment lingering among supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders after the bruising presidential primary — hauled back into the open as of late with former interim Democratic National Committee Chairman Donna Brazile 's book , which dredged up many of those 2016 wounds . They were able to unite in Virginia , but that will be tested as the cycle goes on .
What 's at stake for Trump
The president won his party 's nomination — and , as unlikely as it once seemed , ultimately the White House — without the backing of much of the Republican establishment . And since taking office , he has operated largely independent of and sometimes counter to party leaders , constantly looking out for his own best interests , often to the detriment of getting any major legislation passed on Capitol Hill .
For his own re-election prospects , Trump has worked to finesse his own political brand and shift much of the blame for legislative failures to Capitol Hill instead of his own administration . A big question in 2018 is whether he will work to support GOP campaign efforts — or whether candidates in certain places would even want him — and if he might rebuff incumbents who have n't been loyal to him , as Bannon and his allies are pushing for .
However , Republican operatives are quick to point out what Trump allies may be overlooking if they do nominate weaker candidates that ultimately lose — a Democratic House would only deepen investigations into alleged collusion with Russia and could eventually start impeachment proceedings .
Ultimately , midterms are historically a referendum on a president 's first few years in office . And if Trump 's approval ratings continue to hover in the mid-30s — or worse — Republicans could be headed for historic losses that are typically seen as a rebuke of the incumbent president . Trump may try to deflect , as he did in Virginia , and point to Congress ' low approval ratings as the culprit , but he still remains the leader of the GOP .
The battle for the House : control up for grabs
The most consequential 2018 battle will be the fight for the House . Given historical trends and the current standing of both President Trump and the GOP , the House is absolutely in play . But even if a wave develops , it would need to be larger than in past cycles given the advantage Republicans still enjoy thanks to post-2010 redistricting .
Going back to World War II , the president 's party loses an average of 28 seats in his first midterm election — and none of those were under someone with approval ratings like Trump 's a year out , which just hit a new 33 percent low in last week 's Gallup Poll . Democrats need 24 seats to take back the majority . And , while it 's early , the generic ballot test is in the range it needs to be for Democrats to have widespread successes . In the Washington Post/ABC News survey released this past weekend , voters said they prefer a Democratic representative over a GOP one by an 11-point margin — the widest edge for Democrats since just ahead of 2006 , the last time they took back the House .

Early retirements from GOP moderates signal there is unrest in the party . Eleven Republicans so far have announced they wo n't run for re-election outright , and many of them are moderates whose exit now puts their seat in jeopardy for the GOP . And after the bloodbath in Virginia , there could be more to jump ship .
The top Democratic targets for the 24 seats they need to flip are , naturally , Republicans who sit in the 23 GOP House districts that were won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 . Many of those members are from suburban districts that rejected Trump , and Democrats hope they 'll now vote out GOP members in a referendum on the president .
But also on that list are some Republicans who have proved their mettle in tough contests before and significantly outperformed Trump in 2016 on the ballot , like Florida 's Carlos Curbelo , California 's David Valadao and New York 's John Katko .
Democrats ca n't focus on just flipping those Clinton seats , though , especially given that they 'll be playing defense in places Trump won , too . To have a prayer of getting the 24 seats they need , they 're looking to expand the battleground map . They 've been successful in recruitment , and many challengers have posted impressive early fundraising totals , including outraising nearly three dozen GOP incumbents . But many of those candidates still face primaries , and that 's where Democrats ' own intraparty squabbles and the pull between the progressive and more establishment wings will be put to the test .
Republicans have their sights set on places where Trump outperformed and they hope Democratic struggles will continue . There are 12 seats currently held by Democrats in districts that Trump carried in 2018 , and they must defend those too in some that have become increasingly hostile to national Democrats .
Fight for the Senate : Can Republicans take advantage of a golden map ?
Democrats started off the cycle knowing they would be playing almost entirely defense in Senate races , while Republicans were salivating at the chance to take on the 10 Democratic incumbents who sit in states Trump carried last year .
Ultimately , how successful Republicans can be in challenging those red state Democrats wo n't be fully known until after some potentially divisive primaries . And given the political environment , some top-flight recruits in several states passed early on even running in deep red territory .

Democrats need to win three seats to win back the majority , a feat that initially looked impossible given the map . But with Republican infighting , there is the narrowest of paths .
Nevada 's Dean Heller is really the only vulnerable GOP incumbent — and maybe the most endangered overall . He has a primary to worry about first , and then is the only Republican running in a state that Clinton carried . The Arizona open seat also puts Republicans on defense .
But the Democrats ' map still remains grim , with at least eight incumbents in competitive races . Missouri 's Claire McCaskill and Indiana 's Joe Donnelly are probably the top two endangered incumbents after both drawing flawed opponents last time .
Rust Belt Sens . Sherrod Brown in Ohio , Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin , Debbie Stabenow in Michigan and Bob Casey in Pennsylvania are running for re-election in states Trump carried . And Florida 's Bill Nelson will be in for a tough fight if , as expected , Republican Gov . Rick Scott runs against him , dipping into his own deep pockets in the expensive Sunshine State that Trump also won in 2016 .
But Democratic incumbents in states that Trump won by wide margins may have easier paths to victory than once thought . Republicans privately admit that taking on Montana 's Jon Tester wo n't be as easy as they had hoped , and the GOP field to oppose North Dakota 's Heidi Heitkamp is still very unsettled . And West Virginia 's Joe Manchin , who remains popular , has long vexed Republicans .
In the states : Republicans try to hold on to power
Democrats have the opposite fortune from their Senate colleagues when it comes to the gubernatorial map . Republicans may have reached an all-time high with 34 governorships this year ( thanks to the switch of West Virginia 's Jim Justice to the GOP ) , but they face a tough test in keeping many of this governor 's mansions in the red column come 2018 .
Of the 36 contests up next year , Republicans are on defense in 26 states , compared with just nine for Democrats ( in addition to Alaska 's independent governor ) . And many of the key battles in places like Florida , Ohio and Michigan could have a major impact on post-2020 redistricting .
New Mexico is Democrats ' best shot outright , where Republican Susana Martinez is term-limited and that GOP strategists concede will be increasingly tough to hold .
Illinois Republican Bruce Rauner , who has seen his approval ratings plummet , is the most vulnerable incumbent . Democrats also have prime chances in open GOP-held seats in Michigan , Florida and Ohio . Maine is another top pickup opportunity , and Republicans lost their best recruit when Sen. Susan Collins opted to remain in the Senate . Meanwhile , Democrats will be on defense in open seats in Minnesota , Connecticut and Pennsylvania .
Other GOP incumbents who sit in deep blue territory may not be as vulnerable as they seem on paper , however . In Maryland , Larry Hogan remains popular . Democrats admit a race against Hogan , who successfully completed treatment for lymphoma , starts as an uphill battle . Meanwhile , Massachusetts — a state Clinton won by 27 points — is probably off the table , with GOP Gov . Charlie Baker having high approval ratings absent a strong challenger .
The Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers face off against each other during the second half of an NFL football game Sunday , Nov. 16 , 2014 , in San Diego .
The Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers are planning a shared stadium in the Los Angeles area if both teams fail to get new stadium deals in their current hometowns , the teams said in a joint statement Thursday night , adding another layer of complexity to a possible NFL return to the region.The proposed $ 1.7-billion stadium would be in Carson , 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles and home to the Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team.The statement says the teams have tried and failed for years to find stadium solutions in Oakland and San Diego , and without new agreements in those cities their hands will be forced . `` We are pursuing this stadium option in Carson for one straightforward reason , '' the statement says . `` If we can not find a permanent solution in our home markets , we have no alternative but to preserve other options to guarantee the future economic viability of our franchises . `` The plan creates the odd prospect of divisional rivals suddenly sharing a home field , and of Los Angeles having two NFL teams after going two decades with none.And it takes the muddled issue of the NFL 's return to Southern California and makes it downright messy , with at least three viable stadium plans in the works.St . Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke is part of a joint venture to build an 80,000-seat stadium at the site of the former Hollywood Park horse track just 10 miles from Carson in Inglewood.And a plan remains alive for an NFL facility in downtown Los Angeles . That stadium known as Farmers Field , until recently the leading candidate for the NFL 's return , now becomes a long shot with multiple competitors and no clear team attached.Earlier this month , the NFL sent a memo warning teams that the league itself will be behind any decision to move to Southern California , and established a committee of owners to review the options.The Chargers and Raiders statement says they will respect and adhere to the guidelines the league laid out.The teams said they plan to work in good faith through 2015 to find new agreements to stay in their current homes , where they are both in year-to-year leases and both have sought public funding that has been hard to get.The Chargers ' talks with San Diego City Hall to replace the nearly 50-year-old Qualcomm Stadium have grown increasingly contentious . Mayor Kevin Faulconer appointed an advisory group earlier this month to recommend a site and financing plan for a new stadium that can go on the November 2016 ballot . But Chargers ' attorney Mark Fabiani told the group that there may not be a publicly acceptable solution to the problem and warned them against using the team for political advantage.The head of the mayor 's group Adam Day said the new plan came as a `` complete surprise . `` `` While it 's disappointing to hear the Chargers are moving forward with plans in Los Angeles , we remain committed to finding a solution in San Diego , '' Day said in a statement.The Raiders ' even older Oakland Coliseum has had sewage and electrical problems and is now the only stadium in the US used as the home for both an NFL and Major League Baseball team , the Oakland Athletics . The team wants to build a new stadium at the site but talks with the city have shown little progress.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said she spoke Thursday night with team president and CEO Marc Badain , `` and he continued to assure me that the Raiders ' first priority is to stay in Oakland in a new stadium . `` Schaaf said she wants to be `` a responsible steward of the public dollar , to keep my sports teams and '' to redevelop the neighborhood around the Coliseum . She added : `` I am committed to not putting public dollars into stadium construction . `` The Rams have been in a similar struggle with St. Louis , but have made progress with a burgeoning plan for a 64,000-seat stadium there on the city 's north riverfront.All three teams have Los Angeles ties . The Rams called the area home from 1946 to 1994 , the Raiders were here from 1982 to 1994 and the Chargers played their inaugural 1960 season in LA .
Washington ( CNN ) For nearly a year , President Donald Trump and several of his top advisers have repeatedly denied that there was any contact between members of the Trump campaign and individuals tied to the Russian government . But the veracity of that story appears to be crumbling under contradictory revelations from the President 's son , son-in-law and the current attorney general .
Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway , White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders , former White House press secretary Sean Spicer , Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort have all previously denied that there were any contacts or ties between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials or Russians trying to meddle in the election .
Trump has routinely called the Russia story `` fake news '' and a `` witch hunt . ''
Jared Kushner , Donald Trump Jr. and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have all confirmed ( on-record ) that they had Russia meetings during the campaign , despite all these denials .
The President and his top aides stopped denying that members of the Trump campaign had contact with Russians after Jeff Sessions confirmed in March that he met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in July and September 2016 .
Trump 's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner further contradicted previous denials from the President and his top advisers in a statement Monday to the Senate and House intelligence committees ahead of his closed-door interview with lawmakers .
Kushner confirmed that he had `` perhaps '' four encounters with Russians during the 2016 campaign and transition in the 11-page statement but insisted that he discussed nothing improper during those meetings , which include two encounters with the Russian ambassador , a meeting with the head of a Russian state-owned bank and the June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer and others that was set up by Kushner 's brother-in-law , Donald Trump Jr .
`` I did not collude , nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded , with any foreign government , '' Kushner said in the statement . `` I had no improper contacts . I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector . I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form , above and beyond what is required . Hopefully , this puts these matters to rest . ''
Kushner reiterated his denial , stating he `` did not collude with Russia '' in front of cameras outside the West Wing on Monday .
But even if the encounters were benign in nature , revelations from members of Trump 's inner circle that there was contact during the campaign clash with the blanket denials previously offered by former campaign advisers , current senior White House officials and even the President himself .
Here is a look at some of those previous denials :
July 26 , 2016 : Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort tells Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort tells ABC News that there are no ties between the Trump campaign and Russia .
ABC News : Are there any ties between Mr. Trump , you or your campaign and Putin and his regime ?
Manafort : No , there are not . That 's absurd . And , you know , there 's no basis to it .
November 10 , 2016 : A Russian diplomat says that some Russians were in touch with Trump 's associates during the campaign . In response , Hope Hicks , then a spokeswoman for the Trump transition , issued a blanket denial : `` We are not aware of any campaign representatives that were in touch with any foreign entities before yesterday , when Mr. Trump spoke with many world leaders , '' she told the A Russian diplomat says that some Russians were in touch with Trump 's associates during the campaign . In response , Hope Hicks , then a spokeswoman for the Trump transition , issued a blanket denial : `` We are not aware of any campaign representatives that were in touch with any foreign entities before yesterday , when Mr. Trump spoke with many world leaders , '' she told the New York Times . She also told the AP : `` It never happened . There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign . ''
December 18 , 2016 : Kellyanne Conway denies any contact between the Trump campaign and Russia Kellyanne Conway denies any contact between the Trump campaign and Russia in an interview with CBS News ' John Dickerson .
Dickerson : All right . We are not going to get any insight into the president-elect 's thinking here , but let me try this . Did anyone involve in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election ?
Conway : Absolutely not . And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night . Those conversations never happened . I hear people saying it like it 's a fact on television . That is just not only inaccurate and false , but it 's dangerous .
January 11 , 2017 : Trump denies `` he or anyone on his campaign '' had any contact with Russia during the campaign while Trump denies `` he or anyone on his campaign '' had any contact with Russia during the campaign while speaking to reporters . The question was a shouted question as Trump walked away from a press conference
Reporter : Did you or anyone in your campaign ...
Trump : No .
Reporter : ... have any contact with Russia leading up to or during the campaign ?
Trump : No , not at all .
January 15 , 2017 : Vice President Mike Pence denies there were contacts between Trump campaign and Russia in an interview Vice President Mike Pence denies there were contacts between Trump campaign and Russia in an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News
Wallace : If there were any contacts , sir , I 'm just trying to get an answer .
Pence : Yes . I -- of course not . Why would there be any contacts between the campaign ? Chris , the -- this is all a distraction , and it 's all part of a narrative to de-legitimize the election and to question the legitimacy of this presidency , the American people see right through it .

Karl : Back in January , the President said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians . Now , today , can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign , not even General Flynn , had any contact with the Russians before the election ?
Spicer : My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period -- well , we were very clear that during the transition period , he did speak with the ambassador --
Karl : I 'm talking about during the campaign .
Spicer : I do n't have any -- there 's nothing that would conclude me -- that anything different has changed with respect to that time period .

Do n't speak to people from Russia . Not that I would n't . I just have nobody to speak to . I spoke to Putin twice . He called me on the election . I told you this .

Former heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar has finally faced his punishment after failing a pair of drug tests surrounding his return bout at UFC 200 in July .
Lesnar tested positive for a pair of anti-estrogen drugs called clomiphene and hydroxy-clomiphene in both an out-of-competition drug sample collected on June 28 and a second sample taken on the night of his fight against Mark Hunt on July 9 .
Lesnar has been suspended for one year retroactive to the date of his fight with Hunt , and he was also fined $ 250,000 for the infraction .
Article continues below ...
Lesnar 's win at UFC 200 will also be overturned to a no contest .
The terms of the agreement were already set before the Nevada State Athletic Commission had a hearing on the matter on Thursday . The commission voted unanimously to accept the terms of the agreement .
The fine equals out to 10-percent of Lesnar 's $ 2.5 million disclosed purse that he earned for the fight with Hunt at UFC 200 .
With the suspension and the fine handed down , Lesnar 's tumultuous return to the UFC has finally come to a close after the WWE superstar came back to fight for the first time in nearly five years .
There 's been no indication that Lesnar intends to return to the UFC to fight again following this latest incident but with a one-year suspension he would be eligible as early as July 9 , 2017 .
Before Lesnar would be eligible to fight again , he would have to submit clean drug samples at intervals of 30 , 15 and 3 days prior to any contest .

The financial world used to have a diversity of corporate organisational forms – listed company partnership , mutual . Most partnerships and mutuals became listed companies , a change that was not usually for the better.There were once three main types of corporate organisation in the financial services industry – the public company , the partnership and the mutual .
Most commercial banks were listed public companies , since only equity markets could provide the capital needed to give security to their deposit base . Most bank shares offered high , stable yields appropriate to a utility . In many respects such equity resembled subordinated debt : the better off customers of the bank were generally well represented on the share register . This structure was destroyed in 2008 , when companies such as Citigroup and Royal Bank of Scotland lost almost all their value and most bank dividends ceased .
Partnerships dominated riskier activities such as market making and investment banking , a structure that ensured tight internal control of competence and conduct . All the personal wealth of the senior managers was on the line and knowledge of that had a salutary effect on behaviour . The architects of a financial disaster could not expect to walk away as rich men and leave others to bear the costs , the outcome that caused so much justifiable public anger in 2008-09 .
Mutuality was common in retail financial services . Such businesses were better able to build and retain the trust of small customers . Stock exchanges and commodity clearing houses were also usually mutuals , since the structure was well adapted to the provision of common services and the policing of self-regulation .
Organisational variety was almost extinguished in the final two decades of the last century . The conventional wisdom was that any form of business organisation other than the public limited company was an anomaly , a relic of a bygone age . The most common explanation for this belief was that the plc was uniquely well placed to make acquisitions and could make imaginative use of share options for senior executives . The observation was factually correct , but its consequences would prove disastrous .
Yet that argument was little more than rationalisation . The claimed superiority and historic inevitability of the public company provided legitimacy for the conversion and flotation of partnerships and mutuals . Such conversions enabled the goodwill of these businesses to be monetised for the benefit of those who had the good fortune to be partners and customers at the time . The amounts of money released were very large . Some partners of Goldman Sachs walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars . The Halifax Building Society distributed shares to its members worth about £20bn . The conversion process generated massive fees for investment banks , which could be relied on to act as cheerleaders . These banks had pioneered the procedure themselves , with Lehman leading the pack in 1982 .
The predictable consequence was that the partnerships and mutuals which had become listed companies ceased to behave like partnerships and mutuals and behaved like listed companies . They assumed more risk and controlled it less effectively . The short-term orientation of the public company , ever more fixated on quarterly earnings reports , encouraged them to emphasise transactions over relationships . Public trust in the financial services industry declined .
In most cases people who invested in the newly converted businesses discovered that the value once inherent in the business could not in practice be translated into returns to outside shareholders . Few of them proved good long-term investments , Goldman Sachs excepted . In general , the conversion process destroyed the goodwill it sought to realise . Halifax members who retained their conversion shares find them worth little today .
Partnerships and mutuals increase their capital slowly and organically . This feature is both a strength and a weakness ; today we are better placed to recognise the strength . But the resources so casually dissipated can not easily be restored .
In looking to the future of financial services , we should learn a lesson from an unhappy episode in the past . Business behaviour is the product of the structure of corporate organisation in which it takes place .
The instincts that kept Gilles Vaillancourt in power in Laval for 23 years never left him , even as he was about to head off to jail .
The former mayor of Laval seemed incapable of helping himself as he decided to make a series of awkward handshakes , including with a few surprised reporters , as he headed into the courtroom on Thursday for a hearing that he knew would result in him being incarcerated . One of his two lawyers was not too far behind carrying a hockey equipment bag that appeared to be full of his personal belongings .
He made small talk with one reporter , informing her that he no longer needed his trademark eyeglasses because he had recently undergone laser eye surgery . And then he headed into the courtroom where he admitted he took part in a conspiracy to use his position to fill Swiss bank accounts with millions of dollars through a system of collusion and corruption that operated between 1996 and 2010 .
During the hearing , the mayor who ran Laval from 1989 until he resigned in 2012 entered a guilty plea to being part of a conspiracy to commit fraud , fraud and breach of trust . As part of a joint recommendation made on a possible sentence , Vaillancourt might be required to serve a six-year prison term . As part of the plea agreement , Vaillancourt had already begun the process of reimbursing the city of Laval with $ 8.6 million in cash and will turn over the keys to a luxury condo he owned that is estimated to be worth more than $ 1 million .
Superior Court Justice James Brunton will decide on Dec. 15 whether the sentence fits the crime . The judge asked Vaillancourt if he had anything to say before he makes his decision .
“ I sincerely regret the errors that I committed , ” Vaillancourt said , while adding he regretted what he put his family , friends and Laval through . “ I feel a pain that I will have for the rest of my life . I did a lot of things for Laval . But I made mistakes that are unacceptable . ”
Prosecutor Claude Dussault informed Brunton that , as part of an agreement reached between Vaillancourt , the prosecution and the city of Laval , the former mayor has already had $ 1.7 million hidden in Swiss bank account transferred to the Directeur des poursuites criminelles et pénales ( DPCP ) and that another $ 5.2 million is “ in transit . ”
Part of a summary of facts agreed upon by both Vaillancourt 's lawyers and the DPCP has been placed under a publication ban imposed because many of the other 36 people charged in 2013 along with Vaillancourt as part of an investigation dubbed Project Honorer are scheduled to have a trial soon .
“ The investigation conducted within the framework of Project Honorer demonstrated the existence of a system of collusion and corruption in the awarding of public contracts at the city of Laval , ” Dussault told Brunton . “ Contrary to other cases involving collusion where the colluding companies make agreements without the knowledge of the ( city ) paying , Gilles Vaillancourt and certain bureaucrats in the municipal administration were aware of the system .
The prosecutor also said the investigation revealed that construction companies and engineering firms agreed to pay a percentage of the contracts they were awarded to be part of the system of collusion .
In Quebec City , Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée said Vaillancourt 's guilty plea sends a message to Quebecers .
“ I do n't want to comment on the particular case of Mr. Vaillancourt because he 's not alone in this file . This file is not done and over with , but I think the message that we have to bring to the population , Quebecers , is that no one is above the law , ” she said .
“ You have the law , you have to respect it no matter who you are , no matter who you know , no matter what you do , ” she said .
Vallée said she is acting on court delays , which are believed to be putting high-profile cases at risk . A recent Supreme Court decision set firm time limits on how long an accused should be expected to wait for trial after he is charged . The limit in Superior Court is 30 months . Vaillancourt was charged in May 2013 .
“ We can take action in the way that we do things , in the way we treat the files , in the way we address the issues , in the way we handle the different steps within a file . We can take action by making rooms more available , by having more court time , by adding resources , and this is what we 're working on , ” Vallée said .
“ I 've also asked everyone involved , judges , the director of penal prosecutions and the justice department to establish the need for additional resources . ”

The US is suffering from a dangerous shortfall in active members and needs 30,000 more on board to combat threats including Russia , China and ISIS , the Air Force chief of staff has warned .
General David Goldfein says that the active duty Air Force needs to grow from 317,000 - its current size - to 350,000 . It 's currently planned to reach 321,000 .
'We just got too small too fast and we 've got to grow , ' General David Goldfein , the Air Force chief of staff , told USA Today on Wednesday . 'We 're at a risk level I 'm not comfortable with . '
US Air Force chief of staff General David Goldfein has warned that the US needs to increase its active Air Force member numbers by 30,000 to combat threats around the world
It would take five-to-six years to reach the highest level of militarization recommended by Goldfein , who is currently on a five-day tour of air bases around the country .
But Goldfein , who says his tour has left him concerned about the state of the US Air Force , says that the increase is needed .
It would also require an additional $ 3 billion a year on top of its existing $ 151 billion budget .
The US military is increasingly stretched by a troubled - and troubling world .
'It seems like every two weeks we 're responding to a crisis or event around the globe , ' General Carlton Everhart , commander of the Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois , said .
The Air Force is currently engaging ISIS in Syria ( F-22 prior to Syrian mission pictured ) , where Russia is backing the anti-US president but could need to be deployed against China
The Air Force is currently supplying weapons and ammunition to anti-ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria .
But there are forces moving outside the Middle East that could need its attention .
China has increased its presence in the South China Sea , claiming international waters , militarizing artificial islands and flying nuclear bombers around Taiwan .
Tensions between those two countries have been particularly high of late , since President-elect Trump broke US protocol and spoke to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen .
And Russia has increased its presence in the Middle East , backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , who opposes both ISIS and the US-friendly Syrian rebels .
Suspected hacks by Russia on the Democratic party during the election also suggest an increasingly militant attitude .
The Thick of It returns next week . And it 's for outbursts like this that we love it
Armando Iannucci 's part-improvised political comedy about the inner workings of new ( ish ) Labour , The Thick of It , returns to TV next week – this time with a proper run of eight episodes and a prime-time Saturday night slot on BBC2 .
The new series begins on the day of a cabinet reshuffle and a new minister for the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship in the form of Nicola Murray ( played by queen of twisted middle-class women Rebecca Front ) a back-bencher so low down the pecking order her appointment is likened to a dinner lady presenting the 10th series of The Big Breakfast .
The best reason to tune in though is to witness the further adventures of Malcolm Tucker , Peter Capaldi 's lethal Scottish enforcer of number 10 's wishes , or as Murray describes him `` the PM 's all-swearing eye '' . With Tucker , The Thick of It has taken profanity , the liberal use of the word cock and the fine art of the soul-puncturing put-down to a new high .
So here are our 10 favourite Tucker quotes from the first series and the two spin-off specials ( both of which are being repeated next week ) . Did we miss any pearls of Tucker wisdom ? Feel free to share them below .
WARNING : Obvious really , but just in case … ridiculously sweary language follows below :
Our ten favourite Tucker quotes
• Responding to knock at his door : `` Come the fuck in or fuck the fuck off . ''
• Tucker 's Law ( out-take from the Spinners & Losers special ) : `` If some cunt can fuck something up , that cunt will pick the worst possible time to fucking fuck it up cause that cunt 's a cunt . ''
• Moaning about minister on the phone : `` He 's about as much use as a marzipan dildo . ''
• To a pair of rival advisors : `` Laurel and fucking Hardy ! Glad you could join us . Did you manage to get that piano up the stairs OK ? ''
• Dressing down MP , Geoff Holhurst : `` You 're so back-bench , you 've actually fucking fallen off . You 're out by the fucking bins where I put you . ''
• Commenting on Ben Swain 's disastrous Newsnight appearance : `` All these hands all over the place ! You were like a sweaty octopus trying to unhook a bra . ''
• Bollocking a communications department employee : `` How much fucking shit is there on the menu and what fucking flavour is it ? ''
• Advising minister Hugh Abbot to keep up with the zeitgeist : `` You 've got 24 hours to sort out your policy on EastEnders , right ? Or you 're for the halal butchers . ''
• Note passed to assistant Jamie during meeting with blue-sky thinker Julius Nicholson : `` Please could you take this note , ram it up his hairy inbox and pin it to his fucking prostate . ''
• Admonishing junior adviser Ollie Reeder to respect government property : `` Feet off the furniture you Oxbridge twat , you 're not on a punt now . ''
While refreshing our RapiCover qualification kit , we looked harder for corner-cases and undefined behaviours . One of the more bizarre things we came across is the issue of code before the first case label of a switch statement . Such a simple concept turns out to have some rather unique challenges .
Here 's a fairly standard-looking C switch statement with five branches ( five code sequences to choose among ) :
switch ( n ) { case 0 : code_reset ( ) ; break ; case 1 : case 2 : code_report ( n ) ; code_reset ( ) ; break ; case 3 : code_preset ( 1 ) ; code_report ( 3 ) ; break ; case 4 : code_preset ( 2 ) ; code_report ( 4 ) ; break ; default : code_any ( ) ; code_reset ( ) ; }
The behaviour is reasonably clear : if n is 0 , call code_reset . if it 's 1 or 2 , call code_report ( n ) . For 3 , call code_preset first , then code_report ( 3 ) . For anything else , call code_any and then code_reset .
Now here 's a slight optimization : an additional goto statement looping from cases 3 and 4 , back to cases 1 and 2 :
switch ( n ) { case 0 : code_reset ( ) ; break ; report : case 1 : case 2 : code_report ( n ) ; code_reset ( ) ; break ; case 3 : code_preset ( 1 ) ; goto report ; case 4 : code_preset ( 2 ) ; goto report ; default : code_any ( ) ; code_reset ( ) ; }
We often see this kind of optimization in parsers , regular expression engines , and other state-machine type systems .
So the natural next optimization is this :
switch ( n ) { reset : case 0 : code_reset ( ) ; break ; report : case 1 : case 2 : code_report ( n ) ; goto reset ; case 3 : code_preset ( 1 ) ; goto report ; case 4 : code_preset ( 2 ) ; goto report ; default : code_any ( ) ; goto reset ; }
So that got us thinking : now we 've inserted something between the start of the switch and the first case label . Is that legal ? What else can we put there ? What does it mean ? So we double-checked and found this note in ISO9899 under the `` switch statement '' :
[
EXAMPLE In the artificial program fragment
switch ( expr ) { int i = 4 ; f ( i ) ; case 0 : i=17 ; / * falls through into default code * / default : printf ( `` % d
`` , i ) ; }
The object whose identifier is i exists with automatic storage duration ( within the block ) but is never initialized , and thus if the controlling expression has a nonzero value , the call to the printf function will access an indeterminate value . Similarly , the call to function f can not be reached .
]
So in general terms , the content at the top of the switch could be :
switch ( n ) { int j = some_expr ; / * j accessible but some_expr never evaluated * / statement_1 ; / * dead code * / label1 : statement_2 ; / * reachable , but only by `` goto label1 '' * / case 0 : / * normal case label * / ... / * note that we can refer to `` j '' here but it was never initialized * / }
Most of the time , such things would be forbidden through the use of a coding standard , but sometimes there is auto-generated code or hand-optimized parsing code that may try to use this code pattern .
The issue of some_expr not being evaluated is not limited to weird code in switch statements - it applies whenever code jumps over a declaration , leaving the variable in scope but with an undefined value .
For coverage reporting , we decided here to make sure that RapiCover reports on all of the constructs within potentially dead code , requiring the user to supply justifications to address any code that can not be obtained through test . We do not make any special exception for potentially-skipped initializations or unreachable code .
Finally , note that this is all for C. There are some different issues with C++ , related to scopes and object initialization , which we hope to address in a future post .
PARIS—Livestock emissions were all over the menu at the Paris Climate Conference—in the form of butter , cheese and meat—but they were nowhere to be found on the agenda . Nonetheless , 196 countries committed to a global emissions target that will make it difficult for the animal-agriculture sector to operate as it has been .
“ The Paris agreement offers new challenges for the livestock sector , in that it introduces more ambitious longer term emissions-reduction targets , ” said Antony Froggatt , a senior research fellow with Chatham House , a London think tank .
“ Given the importance of livestock to global emissions , this increases the imperative for reductions from the sector . ”
Countries agreed `` to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century . '' That scope reaches beyond the three sectors climate advocates have focused on so far—energy , industry , and transportation .
Countries will have difficulty achieving net-zero emissions unless they address emissions from livestock , variously estimated at 14.5 percent , 18 percent , or even as high as 51 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
`` The kind of secret source of greenhouse emissions that no politicians are talking about at the moment are the emissions that come from the livestock industry , '' said Peter Singer , a Princeton moral philosopher who has studied climate change as `` humanity 's greatest ethical challenge , '' in a Chicago appearance ahead of COP 21 .
`` The United Nation 's food and agriculture organization said a few years ago , in a document called Livestock 's Long Shadow , that the livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transport sector . So more than all of the cars , planes , trains , ships and so on . So after stationary power generation , that may well be the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions , in particular of methane emissions which come from ruminant animals . ''
There are steps farmers and ranchers can take to reduce emissions , such as eliminating transportation by growing feed on site . The International Fund for Agricultural Development also recommends adapting grazing practices to increase soil carbon , improving animal nutrition , breed selection and manure management . But an effort to bring the sector to net-zero emissions will require more drastic measures .
About 39 percent of livestock emissions derive from enteric fermentation—the production of methane in the gut of cows , sheep and goats , and to a lesser extent chicken and pigs . Another 26 percent is emitted from manure , 21 percent from feed production , the remainder from energy use and land use .
The Paris Agreement should also curtail rainforest deforestation , often driven by land clearance for livestock , by encouraging countries to protect forests and rewarding them financially for doing so .
`` The impact of the livestock sector on land use marks this of particular relevance , '' Froggatt said .
How the hammer will fall on the livestock sector remains to be seen . Even environmental groups have been reluctant to challenge meat consumption , Singer said .
`` Some of those organizations are clearly worried that they 'll lose members and supporters who may be prepared to switch to a Prius or maybe even to ride a bike under some circumstances but are not ready to contemplate going vegan or vegetarian , '' he said .
Without a shove from green groups , politicians are unlikely to act , especially because the meat industry wields considerable political clout .
`` It 's going to be a problem to get politicians to directly address the meat problem , '' Singer said , `` while the meat industry remains as strong as it is . ''
But future politicians will have to confront an obligation to act to meet the net-zero emissions target now enshrined in the Paris Agreement .
Chatham House notes that a carbon tax on meat is unlikely to be popular , though it would probably be effective . It recommends governments do what they can to promote vegetarian diets through planning regulations , procurement for government institutions and price adjustments .
This year , for the first time , the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended Americans eat less meat on the basis of sustainability .
`` A diet higher in plant-based foods , such as vegetables , fruits , whole grains , legumes , nuts , and seeds , and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet , '' the committee wrote in its recommendations to the U.S. Dept . of Agriculture .
In the recommendations , sustainability goals are closely tied to health goals .
Ultimately , people will have to choose to eat less meat , and they 're unlikely to do so for the planet 's sake , according to a Chatham House report titled `` Changing Climate , Changing Diets . '' They 're more likely to do so for their own sake .
`` Currently , health ranks higher than the environment in most consumers ' choice , '' the report states .
`` While low concern for global environmental impacts may be discouraging to governments looking to promote dietary change , the significant health benefits from reduced meat consumption still present a considerable opportunity for leveraging autonomous action at an individual level . ''
Twenty years ago , it was impossible for most of us to listen to JRR Tolkien read Elvish or see Zelda Fitzgerald grin at a camera or hear an inebriated Hemingway shout about pigeons . But today , these and other rare recordings of famous authors are just a mouse click away . Enjoy , you lucky ducks .
1 . Ernest Hemingway
In this recording from 1950 , Ernest Hemingway describes his novel Across the River and Into the Trees . He sounds drunk , which may explain the interesting vocal modulation and bursts of random yelling . Best part : “ [ she ] enjoys herself very much , looking out of the upper windows and studying the action OF THE PIGEONS . ”
2 . JRR Tolkien
In this TV spot , watch Tolkien light a pipe , blow smoke rings , write and read Elvish , clap at fireworks , and answer questions about The Lord of the Rings in a thick , garbled accent . It 's not hard to see how this mind imagined worlds full of elves , wizards , and hobbits .
3 . Raymond Chandler
In 1958 , Ian Fleming , author of the James Bond series , interviewed crime writer Raymond Chandler for the BBC . This is the only recording of Chandler 's voice . Listening to their conversation is like eavesdropping on two master genre writers talk shop . [ Part 2 , 3 , 4 ]
4 . Sylvia Plath
While many stereotype Sylvia Plath as moribund and depressed , this interview reveals a sharp , enthusiastic person with an adroit ability to turn a phrase . “ Poetry , ” she says , “ is a tyrannical discipline . You 've got to go so far , so fast , in such a small space that you 've just got to burn away all the peripherals . ”
5 . Walt Whitman
Here 's Walt Whitman reading his poem “ America. ” It was taken from a wax cylinder recording Thomas Edison made in 1889 or 1890—although the recording 's authenticity is somewhat disputed . The last two lines of the poem are not read .
6 . Langston Hughes
Watch the famous poet from the Harlem Renaissance read his poem `` The Weary Blues , '' while the Doug Parker Band plays jazz in the background .
7 . Virginia Woolf
This is the only known recording of Virginia Woolf 's voice . On April 29 , 1937 , she read an essay on words for a BBC radio series called “ Words Fail Me. ” It was published in The Death of the Moth and Other Essays in 1942 . A sample : “ Of course , you can catch [ words ] and sort them and place them in alphabetical order in dictionaries . But words do not live in dictionaries ; they live in the mind . ”
8. and 9 . F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald
Here 's footage of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda sitting at an outdoor table , surrounded by friends and a dog . It 's a glimpse into the decadent lifestyle Fitzgerald made famous in his novels and short stories . Wait until the end , when Zelda glances at the camera and grins .
Bonus : Here 's Fitzgerald reading Shakespeare .
10 . Edna St. Vincent Millay
Edna St. Vincent Millay reads her poem “ Love is Not All. ” Her high-faluting accent and theatrical style may seem dated today , but in the 1920s , Millay 's reading tours regularly sold out to rapt crowds .
11 . John Steinbeck
In this 1952 interview , John Steinbeck talked about writing The Grapes of Wrath and how things had changed since the book was published in 1939 . He 's surprisingly optimistic about the changes in American society since the Great Depression : “ We have solved so many of [ the problems ] and the solutions have been the product of ourselves , and the product of our own people working together . We have many more to solve , but at least we 're on the way there . ”
12 . Flannery O'Connor
Here 's Flannery O'Connor reading her short story “ A Good Man is Hard to Find '' at Vanderbilt University in 1959 . Here are Parts 2 and 3 .
13 . Alfred , Lord Tennyson
Like a ghost from the past , Tennyson reads his poem “ The Charge of the Light Brigade. ” Like the Whitman recording , it too was taken from a wax cylinder Thomas Edison made in 1890 . Tennyson can be hard to understand at times , especially at the poem 's most famous lines : “ Theirs not to make reply , / Theirs not to reason why , / Theirs but to do and die. ” Odd , too , is the mysterious knocking at the end .
14 . Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
In a pleasant Scottish brogue , Sir Arthur Conan Doyle talks about how he started writing Sherlock Holmes ( “ I began to think of turning scientific methods , as it were , onto the work of detection ” ) and the character 's popularity ( “ I 've even had ladies writing to say that they 'd be very glad to act as [ Holmes ' ] housekeeper ” ) . Then the interview veers toward “ psychic matters ” as Doyle explains that he has given up mystery writing to devote himself to the study of spiritualism .
15 . JM Barrie
The author of Peter Pan was famously short , as is evident in this 1931 footage , where Barrie unveils a statue of Henry James .
16 . Arthur Miller
In a 1987 interview , Arthur Miller talks about his marriage to Marilyn Monroe . In addition to thoughtful insight into Monroe 's psychology , he discusses the reception of After The Fall , a play he wrote about his relationship with Monroe .
17 . Vladimir Nabokov
Here 's Nabokov talking about his novel Lolita on a 1950s CBC program `` Close Up. ” The interview is at the height of the controversy surrounding the book , which was banned due to its theme of child molestation . When asked his intentions in writing it , Nabokov replies : “ I do n't wish to touch hearts and I do n't even want to affect minds very much . What I want to do is produce that little sob in the spine of the artist reader . ”
18 . William Faulkner
In this short excerpt from a Q & A as University of Virginia 's first Writer-in-Residence , Faulkner talks about The Sound and the Fury , and why it was his favorite novel . Listen to the full recording here .
19 . Jack Kerouac
And finally , here 's Jack Kerouac on the The Steve Allen Plymouth Show in 1959 . After awkwardly answering questions while Steve Allen tinkles on the piano , he gives a terrific reading from On The Road and Visions of Cody while jazz plays in the background . You got ta love that ending : “ I think of Dean Mor-i-ar-ty . ”
What kind of public debate can we have on the most vital issues of the day in the United States ? A lot depends on the media , which determines how these issues are framed for most people .
Take the war in Afghanistan , which has been subject to major debate here lately , as Barack Obama has to decide whether to take the advice of his commanding officer in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , and send tens of thousands more troops there , or heed public opinion , which actually favours an end to the war .
This month , one of America 's most important and most-watched TV news programmes , NBC 's Meet the Press , took up the issue . The lineup :
Retired General Barry McCaffrey , former army general and drug tsar ( under Bill Clinton ) turned defence industry lobbyist . In a news article on McCaffrey titled `` One man 's military-industrial-media complex '' , the New York Times reported that McCaffrey had `` earned at least $ 500,000 from his work for Veritas Capital , a private equity firm in New York that has grown into a defence industry powerhouse by buying contractors whose profits soared from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . '' McCaffrey has appeared on NBC more than 1000 times since 11 September 2001 .
Retired General Richard Myers , former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under George Bush ( 2002-2005 ) . He is currently on the board of directors of Northrop Grumman Corporation , one of the largest military contractors in the world , and also of United Technologies Corporation , another large military contractor .
Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican from South Carolina , a pro-war spokesperson that is one of the most regular guests on the Sunday talkshows .
Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , a Democrat , was apparently intended to represent the `` other side '' of the debate . Here is what he said : `` Clearly we should keep the number of forces that we have . No one 's talking about removing forces . ''
`` No one '' in the above sentence refers to the American people , whom Levin understandably sees as nobody in the eyes of the US media and political leaders . According to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll , 32 % of those polled wanted US troops out of Afghanistan within one year or right now . That was the largest group . Another 24 % wants the troops `` removed within one to two years '' . For comparison , the leadership of the Taliban is willing to grant foreign troops 18 months to get out of their country .
In other words , a majority of 56 % of Americans wants US troops out of Afghanistan about as soon as is practically feasible or even sooner . Yet Meet the Press – a mainstream network news talkshow since 1947 – does not see fit to find one person to represent that point of view . The other major TV and radio talkshows that the right also labels `` liberal '' in the US make similar choices almost every day .
When asked whether the US should set a timeline for withdrawal , Levin answered `` no '' .
I know , if you have enough time you can still find an anti-war , public-interest viewpoint and the facts to support it – on the internet and even among some of the news stories in major media publications . But most Americans have other full-time jobs .
If the media 's influence stopped there , the damage would be limited . After all , Americans can often still overcome the tutelage of the media 's opinion leaders , as the above poll demonstrates . But the media also defines the debate for politicians . And that is where the life-and-death consequences really kick in .
If you want to know why Obama has not fought for a public option for healthcare reform , why he has caved to Wall Street on financial reform , why he has been Awol on the most important labour law reform legislation in 75 years ( despite his campaign promises ) , just look at the major media . Think for a moment of how they would treat him if he did what his voters wanted him to do . You can be sure that Obama has thought it through very carefully .
Obama 's whole political persona is based on media strategy , and on not taking any risk that the major media would turn against him . That is how he got where he is today and how he hopes to be re-elected . Many analysts confuse this with a strategy based on public opinion polling . But as we can see , these are often two different things .
Seventy-five percent of Americans support a public option for healthcare reform . ( A majority would support expanding Medicare to cover everyone , but over the years the media , insurance and pharmaceutical companies made sure that this option did n't make it to the current debate . )
Obama has the bully pulpit . He could say to the rightwing Democrats in the Senate : `` Look , you can vote against my proposals , but if you do not allow your president to even have a vote on this reform , you are not a Democrat . '' In other words , you ca n't join the Republicans in blocking the vote procedurally .
He could probably force Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader , to join him in enforcing this minimal party discipline that would come naturally to Republicans , which would allow the healthcare bill to pass the Senate even if conservative Democrats voted against it .
But to do that would risk losing some of Obama 's post-partisan , non-ideological aura that guarantees his media support . Of course , the media is not the only influence that hobbles healthcare reform . The insurance , pharmaceutical and other business lobbies obviously have more representation in Congress than does the majority of the electorate . But Obama does not feel this direct corporate pressure nearly as much . After all , he was the first president in recent decades to get 48 % of his campaign contributions from donations of less than $ 200 – a very significant change in American politics , made possible though internet organising .
There are other powerful elite groupings , such as the foreign policy establishment – which is more ideologically driven , like the medieval church , than a collection of lobbying interests – that thwart reform on issues of war and peace . But the major media remain one of the biggest challenges to progressive reform in the 21st century .
I am charged with exploring the feasibility of a video gaming tournament in downtown Eugene . The event would double as a fund raising event for the 15th night organization to help youth experiencing homelessness in our community . ( http : //www.15night.org/ ) . We have identified commercial space downtown and have commitments from our downtown tech companies . I am looking at a end of February or early March weekend . My questions are :
1 . Is this community ready for such an event ?
2 . Does it sound like fun ?
3. Who are the additional partners and who can help make this event a reality ?
I am leaning towards an Overwatch/Destiny 2 event but open to the community 's ideas . Overwatch is on my mind because during our U.S. Ignite interview , one the interviewers mentioned kicking our butts regularly in Overwatch . I think we have been challenged !

The National Organization of Short Statured Adults ( NOSSA ) was an American non-profit advocacy group for adults of short stature . The organization clearly defined `` short stature '' to be men 170 cm ( 5 ' 7 '' ) or below and women 157.5 cm ( 5 ' 2 '' ) or below in height . [ 1 ] The group advocated on behalf of short people and hoped to foster greater acceptance of short people within society . NOSSA was opposed to the prejudice known as heightism . The group defined heightism as , `` a prejudiced attitude about human height that often results in discrimination . It is based on the belief that short stature is an inferior trait and therefore undesirable . `` [ 2 ] The organization ran a series of public education programs , sponsored height-related research , acted as a media `` watch-dog '' group , provided legal assistance for those affected by heightism , hosted online discussion groups , and invited members to gather once a year for an annual convention . NOSSA ended in early 2013 due to lack of support .
History [ edit ]
NOSSA was formed in New York City in 2005 . The organization is run by a four-person board of directors ( trustees ) who are elected to serve four-year terms in office . In May 2006 the group 's secretary made comments in support of a Nebraska judge 's decision not to send a short man to jail over child sexual abuse charges , due to a risk of his stature affecting his safety in prison . [ 3 ] The organization apologised for the comments and removed the trustee who had made them , as well as making a donation to the Nebraska Children and Families Foundation . [ 4 ] Short Support Editor , Steven Goldsmith became the new Secretary . In July 2006 , NOSSA began producing a podcast called , Standing Tall Against Discrimination . In May 2008 , NOSSA was featured in the Canadian Documentary S & M Short and Male . [ 5 ]

In 2003 , The Food & Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved the use of human growth hormone ( hGH ) for children well below the average height with no medically determined cause , also known as idiopathic short stature . GH therapy had been prescribed previously for only medically determined causes of reduced height . Most patients to which this therapy was now made available produce normal levels of growth hormone on their own . Some other biological cause ( s ) still place these children more than 2 standard deviations below average height .
NOSSA announced its opposition to the use of human growth hormone for short , but otherwise healthy , children . The organization believes being short is n't a problem ; the real difficulties lie in the social bias against short people . In part to define the organization 's position on the matter , NOSSA representative and author Ellen Frankel LCSW stated , `` What we need is education for those who discriminate against short people , not the genetic engineering of the victims of that prejudice . `` [ 6 ] Frankel states , `` The growth hormone deficient child suffers from an underlying medical problem that affects the body 's health in different ways . The non-growth-hormone-deficient child has no underlying medical problem . They simply present as a variation on the norm with regard to height . The decision to medically intervene on the healthy child 's stature is socially based due to height discrimination and prejudice . `` [ 7 ]
Cosmetic leg lengthening [ edit ]
Leg lengthening is a complex process that has traditionally been performed primarily on children to correct disproportional leg lengths . It has also been an option for people with dwarfism to gain height . More recently , the procedure has been used to give people with constitutional short stature two or three extra inches of height . ( Constitutional short stature refers to people who are in the bottom fifth percentile of height in their region and do not display any deformities common with dwarfism . )
NOSSA claims to receive hundreds of e-mails each year from people requesting more information on cosmetic leg lengthening . The group actively discourages short statured people from undergoing leg lengthening solely for cosmetic reasons . The group encourages anyone who is seriously considering the surgery to research the procedure and surgeon thoroughly before undergoing the procedure . NOSSA encourages people to accept and love themselves as they are . [ 8 ]
Princeton economist study [ edit ]
In August 2006 , a study by Princeton University economists Anne Case and Christina Paxson , `` Stature and Status : Height , Ability , and Labor Market Outcomes '' [ 9 ] concluded that tall people are smarter than their height-challenged peers . The researchers report , `` On average , taller people earn more because they are smarter . As early as age 3 — before schooling has had a chance to play a role — and throughout childhood , taller children perform significantly better on cognitive tests . The correlation between height in childhood and adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women , so that tall children are much more likely to become tall adults . As adults , taller individuals are more likely to select into higher paying occupations that require more advanced verbal and numerical skills and greater intelligence , for which they earn handsome returns . `` [ 9 ] Case and Paxson emphasized that the correlation between height and intelligence was due to non-genetic factors , such as health and nutrition in utero and in childhood . As they explained , `` Our results say nothing about the relationship between cognitive ability and that part of height that is determined by genetic background . Our results speak to that part of height that is driven by health and nutrition . There are very many very smart short people ( Einstein comes to mind ) and , frankly , many not-so-smart tall people . ''
NOSSA Secretary Steven Goldsmith responded to the study by stating , `` If a similar study made similar conclusions about any other minority group , there would be fierce outrage from those groups and sympathy from many who are not in those groups . `` [ 10 ] NOSSA Advisor Ellen Frankel LCSW continued , `` We understand racism . It 's time we take a serious look at heightism . `` [ 10 ]
In reporting on the study , the media simplified the connection that the economists had drawn between height and intelligence . Paxson and Case theorize a person genetically programmed to be 6 ' 4 '' who reaches only 6 ' 2 '' because of poor nutrition is not necessarily smarter than someone who with optimal nutrition has reached his full height potential of 5 ' 4 '' . [ 11 ]
eHarmony boycott [ edit ]
On April 2 , 2007 , NOSSA called for a boycott of the online dating website eHarmony . Their press release cited :
`` Suspicions have been confirmed after numerous tests indicated that the exact same responses to the website 's membership questionnaire , with the exception of physical height , resulted in either approval of membership ( when an acceptable tall height was submitted ) or denial of membership ( when a short height was submitted ) . These tests were conducted numerous times to ensure accuracy . The National Organization Of Short Statured Adults has requested a full explanation from the company . On June 1 , 2007 , NOSSA received a response from eHarmony in which the company denied that it had ever discriminated against short statured people . `` [ 12 ]
Legal programs [ edit ]
NOSSA provides legal assistance for members who present valid claims of height discrimination in employment , housing and other real estate , public accommodations , public service , and educational facilities . [ 13 ] There is one U.S. state , Michigan , that prohibits height discrimination . [ 14 ] There is pending legislation introduced by Massachusetts Representative Byron Rushing that would add Massachusetts to the list . [ 15 ]
Two U.S. municipalities prohibit height discrimination : Santa Cruz , California [ 16 ] and San Francisco , California . [ 17 ] The District of Columbia prohibits discrimination based on personal appearance . [ 18 ]
Ontario , Canada prohibits height discrimination under the human rights code . [ 19 ] Victoria , Australia prohibits discrimination based on physical features under the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995 . [ 20 ]
Although NOSSA is not directly involved in any lobbying activities , the group supports height discrimination legislation . NOSSA also provides legal assistance to members who present valid claims of fraud perpetuated by various growth-product manufacturers . [ 21 ]
Children and young adult programs [ edit ]
Bullying involves the tormenting of others through verbal harassment , physical assault , or other more subtle methods of coercion such as manipulation . Smaller children and young adults are often perceived as being physically weaker and vulnerable . Because of this , short kids are frequently targeted by bullies . NOSSA provides support services for short statured kids and their families who are experiencing a bullying problem . [ 22 ] NOSSA also offers a college scholarship award each year to a young short statured person . [ 23 ]
Dissolution [ edit ]
On January 15 , 2013 , NOSSA announced on its website that the group would be ceasing operations due to a lack of support . [ 24 ]
UPDATE ( 2:00 p.m. ) : As of Shoe Palace 's opening this morning , employees at the Fairfax location tell us that people are still lined up for the Yeezys despite the store repeatedly confirming that it wo n't get them next week . `` We 're not getting the Yeezys , but people are still lined up because they 're stubborn , '' an employee said .
See original story below .
At this point , the next Yeezy Boost release still does n't have a confirmed release date , but that has n't stopped droves of people from lining up at a Los Angeles sneaker store .
As reported by TMZ , sneakerheads are camped out in front of Shoe Palace in hopes to cop the latest adidas Yeezy Boosts , which are rumored to be released next week . Some say they 've been waiting for days—one group even went as far as to pull up in an RV to stay comfortable . There 's just one small problem : no one knows for sure if the Yeezys are actually dropping next week or not .
To Shoe Palace 's credit , the store has attempted to stress the lack of an official date , posting a flyer on its window that says the store has n't received information regarding the release and that no release is currently scheduled .

We 'll be sure to update you as this one develops .
It started out as a simple gesture of appreciation . It turned into something much more special .
Will Bolton is beloved by everyone at Franklin Co. High School . The school 's football manager for three seasons and the basketball manager for two , Bolton could n't play football or basketball because of scoliosis .
`` I enjoy the sport a lot because that is the time of year I wish I could put a jersey on for anything . I 'd give anything to put a jersey on , ” Bolton said .
`` Will is one of those kids , that the only way I can describe him is , if you do n't like Will , then the problem is probably with you , '' Franklin Co. basketball coach Tony Wise .
Wise brought Will , a senior , and the rest of the team , into the locker room on Wednesday to discuss Thursday 's Senior Night festivities . Wise surprised Bolton and the team with the announcement that Bolton would suit up for the Flyers .
Bolton was ecstatic .
“ Looks like I 'm getting some playing time tomorrow , boys , ” Bolton shouted to his teammates . Flyers players and Wise celebrated .
On game night , it did n't take Bolton long to get into his Franklin Co. uniform .
`` I know what it means to him , or at least I thought I did , '' Wise said .
Wise also had some pregame advice for Bolton .
`` Just imagine that our gym is your driveway . You 've told us you 're 99-0 at home . ”
“ No one takes me out on my driveway , ” Bolton answered .
Bolton predicted before the game that he 'd hit a three-pointer . As fate would have it , after missing his first four shots , Bolt nailed a three .
Franklin Co. 's gym erupted .
Bolton played two minutes and scored three points , in one of the biggest moment 's of his life .
The Flyers would go on to win on Senior Night and Bolton 's dreams of wearing a jersey and playing for Flyers had come true .
Microsoft Bob was revolutionary . Normally you 'd hear a phrase like that coming from an idiot blogger , but in this case a good argument could be made . Bob threw away the ‘ files ' and ‘ folders ' paradigm for the very beginnings of virtual reality . The word processor was just sitting down at a desk and writing a letter . Your Rolodex was a Rolodex . All abstractions are removed , and you 're closer than ever to living in your computer . If Microsoft Bob was released today , with multiple users interacting with each other in a virtual environment , it would be too far ahead of it 's time . It would be William Gibson 's most visible heir , instead of Melinda Gates ' only failure . Imagine a cyberpunk world that is n't a dystopia , and your mind will turn to Microsoft Bob .
Not everyone will laugh at the above paragraph . Indeed , some people are trying to make the idea of a gigantic , virtual , 3D space populated by real people a reality . For the last few years , [ alusion ] has been working on Metaverse Lab as an experiment in 3D scanning , virtual web browsers , and turning interconnected 3D spaces into habitats for technonauts . The name comes from Snow Crash , and over the past twenty years , a number of projects have popped up to replicate this convergence of the digital and physical . By integrating this idea with the latest VR headsets , Metaverse Lab is the the closest thing I 've ever seen to the dream of awesome 80s sci-fi .
I 've actually had the experience of using and interacting with Metaverse Lab on a few occasions . The only way to describe it is as what someone would expect the Internet would be if their only exposure to technology was viewing the 1992 film Lawnmower Man . It works , though , as a completely virtual environment where potential is apparent , and the human mind is not limited by its physical embodiment .
Ford Motor Company filed a lawsuit against John Cena in U.S. District Court in Michigan for violating his contract and `` flipping '' his custom-made model year 2017 Ford GT sports car .
The lawsuit says Cena was obligated to maintain ownership of the car for two years , but instead flipped it for a big profit soon after receiving the car .
`` Mr. Cena has unfairly made a large profit from the unauthorized resale flip of the vehicle , and Ford has suffered additional damages and losses , including , but not limited to , loss of brand value , ambassador activity and customer goodwill due to the improper sale . ''
The lawsuit alleges that after Cena was informed of violating the contract , he responded , `` I completely understand and as stated am I willing to work with Ford to make it right . My sincerest apologies . ''
It also says he sold the vehicle to liquidate for cash to take care of expenses .

Imagine if Israel would launch a successful preemptive strike against a country that is building a nuclear bomb that threatens its very existence , and the American president would describe it as “ a tragedy ” .
And then , not only would the U.S. administration fail to “ stand by its ally ” , as Republicans pledged this week , but it would actually lend its hand to a UN Security Council decision that condemns Israel , calls on it to place its nuclear facilities under international supervision and demands that it pay reparations ( ! ) for the damage it had wrought .
And then , to add insult to injury , the U.S. president would impose an embargo on further sales of F-16 aircraft because Israel had “ violated its commitment to use the planes only in self-defense ” .
Can you imagine the uproar ? Can you contemplate the brouhaha ? I mean , if Mitt Romney believes that President Obama “ threw Israel under the bus ” just for suggesting that a peace settlement with Israel be based on the 1967 borders - what would he say about a president who actually turns his back on Israel in its greatest time of need ? That he hurled Israel over the cliff with a live grenade in its pocket and into a burning volcano ?
And what if that very same president , only a few months later , would decide to sell truly game-changing sophisticated weaponry to Saudi Arabia , an Arab country that is a sworn enemy of Israel ? And not only would this president dismiss Israeli objections that these weapons endanger its security , but he would actually warn , in a manner that sent shivers down the spines of American Jews , that “ it is not the business of other nations to make American foreign policy ” . And his Secretary of State would mince no words , just in case Walt or Mearsheimer had n't heard the first time , saying ominously that if the deal would be blocked by Israeli influence , there would be “ serious implications on all American policies in the Middle East ... I 'll just leave it there. ” And then the two of them would extend the abovementioned arms embargo , just to twist Israel 's arm a little bit more .
I mean , what words would be left to describe such behavior , after the entire thesaurus ' arsenal of synonyms for “ insult ” “ perfidy ” and “ knife in the back ” have been exhausted to describe the official White House photo of President Obama talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu with his shoes on the table ?
And what if this same president - you know who I 'm talking about by now , but let 's keep up the charade - what if this same president , time after time , not only failed to exercise the U.S. veto in the UN Security Council to block anti-Israeli resolutions , but actually joined Muslim and Communist and other heathen countries in supporting Security Council decisions that condemned Israel for assassinating well-known terrorists ; for annexing territories that Michele Bachman has clearly stated belong only to Israel ; for killing violent jihadist students at Bir Zeit University ; for waging war against the enemies of Western civilization in Lebanon ; and even for “ Israel 's policies and practices denying the human rights of Palestinians. ” Denying the human rights of Palestinians ? Who wrote that ? Judge Goldstone ? Khaled Meshal ?

But because Newt Gingrich is already on record as saying of the Obama Administration that “ this one-sided , continuing pressure that says it 's always the Israelis ' fault no matter how bad the other side is has got to stop , ” we have no doubt that he would say much worse things about this president we 're talking about , do n't we ?
Especially when that president called for a settlement freeze that “ more than any other action , could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks ” ; when he threatened a reluctant Israeli prime minister in an official letter that “ the relationship between our two countries is at stake ” ; when the same Israeli prime minister - that this president could n't stand , by the way - is forced to ask why the US is treating Israel as if it was a “ banana republic ” ; when this Administration 's secretary of defense does n't veil his criticism of Israel before a pro-Israeli crowd at the Saban Forum , like Leon Panetta did this week , but actually tells Congress in open session that the Israeli leader “ is not a moderate ” ; or when the White House spokesman - Marlin Fitzwater , for God 's sake - says that the Israeli “ occupation ” actually “ damages the self-respect and world opinion of the Israeli people . ”
I mean , if Ambassador Gutman should be tarred , feathered and sacked for saying that the Middle East conflict fuels Muslim anti-Semitism , what should one do with a White House that is openly providing ammunition to the boycotters and the delegitimizers ? And what would all the piqued pundits and bristling bloggers who scribed this week that the words of Panetta and Gutman along with Hillary Clinton 's off-the-record concern for Israel 's democracy prove the Obama Administration 's animosity towards Israel - what would they have to say about an Administration that often spoke to Israel with all the subtlety of Tony Soprano holding a sledgehammer in his hand ?
And finally - and this is where we really enter the Twilight Zone , I admit - imagine if this president not only never once visited Israel , despite being eight years in office , but he even balked at visiting a concentration camp , as Obama did after his speech in Cairo . You want to know why ? Because - take a deep breath - because the Germans “ feel that they have a guilt feeling that 's been imposed upon them . '' Poor things .
But wait , I 'm not finished yet . So where does this president insist on going , despite overwhelming Jewish objections and an emotional last-minute appeal by Elie Wiesel in the name of Holocaust survivors ? To lay a wreath at a ceremony commemorating the memory of the soldiers of the Waffen SS , a Nazi unit designated as a criminal organization at the Nuremberg trials , whose soldiers committed countless war crimes , including the razing of the Warsaw Ghetto , and murdered hundreds of thousands of Jews . And what does this president , this American idol of Republican conservatives , this righteous gentile of right-wing Jews , what does he have to say about these Nazi war criminals ? That “ they were victims just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps . ''
NOW , SERIOUSLY , can you even begin to imagine what mayhem would break out if Obama would say such an insensitive , obtuse and borderline Holocaust-denying sentence ? Can you picture the earthquake of rage and the tsunami of venom that would spontaneously and simultaneously erupt and sweep forth all the way from Fox News through Newt Gingrich to Pamela Geller ? Is it far-fetched to imagine that America would actually grind to a halt as Republicans frantically sought a constitutional offence with which to impeach Obama and angry multitudes gathered before the White House lawn ?
Ah , but Ronald Reagan , obviously , was not Obama , notwithstanding what some of Obama 's advisers once wanted you to believe . Reagan was the Gipper , the Great Communicator , the father of Reaganomics , the scourge of the Evil Empire , the great conservative revivalist who , in retrospect at least , can do no wrong . And he was a mensch , the Jews will add , because no matter what he did to Israel and how often he did it , his heart was always in the right place .
And Obama ? I mean , perhaps he 's failed in other matters , but by all accounts he 's been a great help to Israel in many security -related areas , he 's supported Israel in countless international forums , and even if he has made some bad mistakes , in comparison to Reagan 's often roughshod treatment of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir , he 's a Zionist-loving pussycat , no ?
That 's when your interlocutor will look you in the eye and sigh with a mix of scorn and pity . Yes , well , he 's a kalter Fisch , you know , a cold fish , he does n't “ feel ” for Israel like Reagan did , he did n't want a photo-op with Bibi , he bowed his head before the Saudi king , his middle name is Hussein and , well , you know . We do n't have to spell it out .

An Armenian Protestant church in Diyarbakır 's historic Sur district is the first building whose restoration has been completed two years after it suffered from PKK terrorist attacks .
Sur was the scene of clashes between security forces and the terrorist group whose campaign of violence plagued the southeastern Turkey for decades two years ago . Authorities managed to quell the group 's presence , but not before the militants inflicted serious damage to historic structures in the area , from Ottoman-era mosques to Armenian churches .
The church will reopen next year after additional renovations are completed while work is underway for other churches and historical structures in the area .
In an interview with Anadolu Agency ( AA ) on Thursday , Environment and Urban Development Minister Mehmet Özhaseki said that thousands of houses damaged in the violence in the summer of 2015 will also be rebuilt over the next six months . Özhaseki said 26,000 houses were rebuilt from scratch due to heavy damage .
The General Directorate for Foundations oversees the restoration of 11 historic sites in Diyarbakır . Among them is Fatih Paşa Mosque , also known as Kurşunlu ( leaded ) because of its lead-covered dome , whose restoration is scheduled to be completed by 2018 . It is the first Ottoman building in Sur , and was built in the 16th century .
The striking Armenian Catholic church is one of most damaged buildings in the district , as it lost its bell tower , part of the façade and clergy house during PKK attacks carried out with handmade explosives last year . The church is the only one in the region that reflects 19th century architecture with ceramics and plaster , which will hopefully return to its former state in 2018 . Directorate officials have said that the two churches were restored before in 2011 , but need renewed restoration after the attacks .
Indians are the largest depositors in banks abroad with an estimated USD 500 billion ( nearly Rs 24.5 lakh crore ) of illegal money stashed by them in tax havens , CBI Director A P Singh said on Monday .
India , in particular , has suffered from the flow of illegal funds to tax havens such as Mauritius , Switzerland , Lichtenstein , British Virgin islands etc .
`` It is estimated that around 500 billion dollars of illegal money belonging to Indians is deposited in tax havens abroad . Largest depositors in Swiss Banks are also reported to be Indians , '' CBI Director A P Singh said speaking at the inauguration of first interpol global programme on anti-corruption and asset recovery .
He said getting information about such illegal transactions is a time taking process as investigators have to peel each layer by sending judicial requests to the country where such deposits have been made .
`` 53 per cent of the countries said to be the least corrupt by the Transparency International Index are offshore tax havens , where most of the corrupt money goes . The tax havens include New Zealand which is ranked as the least corrupt country , Singapore ranked number five and Switzerland number seven , '' Singh said .
He said there is a lack of political will in the leading tax haven states to part with the information because they are aware of the extent to which their economies have become `` geared to this flow of illegal capitals from the poorer countries . ''
The CBI Director said tracing , freezing , confiscation and repatriation of stolen assets is a legal challenge , a complex process which requires expertise and political will .
`` Managing the asset recovery investigation is complex , time consuming , costly and most importantly requires expertise and political will . There are many obstacles to asset recovery . Not only is it a specialised legal process filled with delays and uncertainty , but there are also language barriers and a lack of trust when working with other countries , '' Singh said .
He said global financial markets allow money to travel faster and further making tracking the money trail in such cases even more difficult which necessitates the organisation of such global training programs as they enhance the knowledge of investigators in tracking assets created out of corrupt and criminal acts .
Singh said criminals are using the territorial issues of investigating agencies to their advantage by spreading their crimes to at least two countries and investing in a third .
`` In some of the recent important cases being investigated by the CBI such as 2G , CWG and Madhu Koda , we find that money is taken to Dubai/Singapore/Mauritius from where it goes to Switzerland and other such tax havens .
`` For criminals all it involves is setting up of a few shell companies and then making layered transfers from account to another in a matter of hours as there are no boundaries in banking transactions , '' he said .
He said the World Bank estimates the cross border flow of money from criminal activities and tax evasion is around 1.5 trillion US dollars of which 40 billion US dollars is bribe paid to government servants in developing countries .
Singh quoted the report to say that only five billion US dollars of this money has been repatriated during 15 years .

Amazon 's E-Book Business Is Up 70 Percent , but It 's Still Not Disclosing Kindle Sales
Amazon is still not saying how many Kindles it is selling , even though the e-book business has become a “ multi-billion dollar category ” for the retailer .
But whatever those sales numbers were , they would have been higher last year if Amazon had n't sold out of its flagship e-reader , said Amazon 's CFO Tom Szkutak during the company 's earnings call today .
In response to an analyst 's question about why the company 's revenue was lighter than expected in Q4 , Szkutak named a number of reasons .
For one , he said , sales of consumer electronics , including TVs , MP3s and digital cameras , fell short of expectations . But also , he said , it had to do with shortages of the Kindle Paperwhite .
“ We are thrilled to have Paperwhite in our lineup — it 's the best e-reader out there , but we could n't keep up with demand , ” he said . “ We would have had more sales in Q4 if we could keep up with demand . ”
“ The team is working hard to have good stock going forward on that product , ” he added .
Amazon is notorious for not commenting on the performance of its hardware business , and that policy did n't change this quarter . But in Amazon 's earnings release , Amazon 's CEO Jeff Bezos did open up a little bit about the company 's e-book business as a whole .
“ We 're now seeing the transition we 've been expecting , ” he said . “ After five years , eBooks is a multi-billion dollar category for us and growing fast — up approximately 70 percent last year . In contrast , our physical book sales experienced the lowest December growth rate in our 17 years as a book seller , up just 5 percent . We 're excited and very grateful to our customers for their response to Kindle and our ever expanding ecosystem and selection . ”
Some critics will not consider that enough information , given the size of the business .
After all , without knowing unit sales , it makes it extremely difficult for analysts to compare Amazon to other tablet makers , namely Apple . But in some respects , e-book sales is a better measurement to track Amazon 's performance . That 's because it makes little to no profit on the hardware , and instead emphasizes the lifetime value of the customer .
By emphasizing content sales — and not unit sales — Amazon is under less pressure to get customers to continually upgrade their devices to generate more revenue . Put another way , a three-year-old Kindle can generate as much revenue as a brand new one . If Amazon disclosed device sales , analysts and investors would be closely tracking that metric for signs of growth .
Amazon also deploys this loss-leader strategy for Amazon Prime , which gives members free two-day shipping as well as access to free streaming video and free e-books . On the call , Szkutak cautioned that it 's still early , but that those freebies are beginning to drive additional revenue .
“ The percentage of Prime customers who are watching free content has gone up dramatically , ” he said , “ And , they are purchasing paid content . They are watching for free , but they are also paying for new content . ”

Is Ronald McDonald about to pick up his ball and go home ? Less than a year away from the World Cup in Russia , one of FIFA 's biggest sponsors is kicking around the idea of withdrawing sponsorship of the organization 's premier tournament due to ethical concerns .
According to a report in the Daily Mail , McDonald 's executives are considering whether ongoing corruption controversies around international football 's governing body are worth the cost to the brand . Among them are issues related to the awarding , planning , and organizing of the 2018 World Cup in Russia and 2022 World Cup in Qatar . The United States-based multinational fast food chain , however , is publicly stating that it intends to remain committed as a sponsor .
In 2015 , McDonald 's was one of FIFA 's top-tier sponsors—along with Coca-Cola , Visa , and Anheuser-Busch—to have demanded that president Sepp Blatter step down amidst a corruption controversy that included Swiss prosecutors opening criminal proceedings . That was quite a statement for a company that uses the sponsorship to reach people in more than 100 countries around the world , at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per year and likely many times that if it decided to bring a premature end to the deal . Even if McDonald 's is n't planning to change anything just yet , it is another shot that surely has FIFA 's attention .
McDonald 's has sponsored the World Cup since 1994 . The corruption and ethical issues around FIFA have been around for much longer . So , why is it now that McDonald 's may be taking on its latest round of thinking about whether it can continue justifying the sponsorship ?
One reason has to do with the basic business management responsibility of conducting checks at frequent intervals to test the health of the business . Another reason has to do with McDonald 's making changes in its sports sponsorship game of late , as part of new directions in its global growth strategy ; last month , in a mutual parting of ways with the International Olympic Committee , the company ended its 41-year-long worldwide sponsorship of the Olympic Games . The third reason has to do with a shift in moral values .
In the case of a sponsorship such as the one McDonald 's has with FIFA , it would appear that so much money and so many years of planning are good enough reasons to keep things going as-is . But leaders of companies and organizations seem to be more attune these days to partnering on deals that might draw attention for the wrong reasons . In the past , partners on both sides of a deal could play a little bit of a waiting game as news of a scandal or ethical lapse came to light . But the pace and style of news with today 's social media does n't allow for much time or room to try to read the market , customers , and public sentiment .
Sports sponsorship can serve financial and social benefits , as Anheuser-Busch 's Busch Media Group showed with its pioneering advances into television , events , and venues beginning in the early 1980s . But that all falls away when the ethics of one party or both come into question .
To add to things , Russia has been in the news headlines a lot lately , from updates about preparations for the World Cup to discussions between Russian officials and the Don ; ad Trump presidential campaign .

The night after Iowa has been spent on cable news mostly interviewing candidates about their results there , and probing them on problematic issues . Piers Morgan opened his program tonight with a chat with Rep. Ron Paul , in which he asked the candidate to assess his performance and challenged him on his weaknesses . He also brought up a gaffe from earlier in the week– a mocking tweet at Jon Huntsman Rep. Paul claimed not to know about , and scolded Rep. Paul for being uninformed about it– as Huntsman himself looked on .

Morgan spoke to Rep. Paul for two segments– the first mostly concerned with why Rep. Paul connects with young people and on his individual policies . Morgan was a bit more aggressive during the second segment , which opened with Morgan asking how Rep. Paul would react to the fact that “ your opponents always present you as someone crazy. ” “ I get a charge out of this when they say these views are extreme , ” Rep. Paul noted , explaining that “ what really counts are the issues and what you believe in , ” and that age did n't matter as “ I have young ideas and I 'm in good health . ”
Morgan then turned to the tweet in question , asking Rep. Paul whether he had any comment : “ Do you want to apologize ? ” Rep. Paul responded by saying that “ it was supposed to be a little high-spirited and funny , but it turned out to be a national incident , ” and that it was his staff that thought it was a good idea . As he began explaining what happened , unbeknowst to him , Huntsman himself appeared on the screen waiting for his interview , listening to Rep. Paul . Morgan eventually let Rep. Paul know that Huntsman was on the line , as the Congressman continued to explain . “ I thought he was a nice guy he had some nice ideas ! ” Rep. Paul explained .
Morgan then gave the Congressman a bit of unsolicited advice : “ I would urge a little caution… [ there now is ] a pattern of you being completely unaware of what your staff are doing half the time. ” Rep. Paul responded that it was n't “ half the time , ” and that “ it was meant to be in good humor , ” though he told his staff that it “ is n't very funny ” for them to do something that causes the candidate to be caught flat-footed on national television . On the other screen , Jon Huntsman smiled .

Lisk Nano 1.1.0 — Rewritten in React for Improved Performance
Lisk Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 14 , 2017
We are happy to announce the release of version 1.1.0 of our desktop client , Lisk Nano . The main goal of this release was to completely rewrite the application into React , a modern front-end framework . React puts Nano in a better position in terms of performance , testability , and ease of development .
Performance
With the previously used framework AngularJS , we were hitting performance limits . An example of this being the table of delegates in the Voting tab . Users are able to load more delegates by scrolling down the table , but with 1000+ delegates on the main net , the app started responding slowly . After the migration , this table is now optimized and capable of flawlessly listing thousands of delegates .
Refinements
We started to use Redux for state management of the application . An important part of the state of the application is data that is not yet stored on the blockchain , like pending transactions or delegates selected for voting . Redux allows us to easily preserve this data regardless of where the user goes in the application . Specifically , it means that users can select some delegates for voting , then navigate through the application and finally come back to voting , with the selected delegates still there .
Development with future releases in mind
React , as a modern component-based front-end framework , clearly structured the source code into small presentable components and separated business logic in Redux store . It puts us in a great position to add countless new features in the future , whilst maintaining a well-structured and stringently-tested code-base . Ultimately , this release leads to higher productivity of development , so you can get new features sooner .
Speaking of new features , we are already developing Nano 1.2 . Our next version will introduce a seamless way to share a list of delegates for voting . Furthermore , being as inclusive as possible is at the heart of Lisk , which is why we 're also working to support additional languages beyond English , for our worldwide community . Last but not least , we 're developing an optional feature which will save you from having to type in your passphrase if you 're just opening Lisk Nano to do something that does n't require security measures , like checking incoming transactions . We are all very excited to share these features with you in the next release .
Installation instructions and further details can be found in the GitHub repository .

It is time for a collective reckoning , a moral accounting , a radical self-appraisal and calling out , fellow white Americans . Our explicit and implicit participation in crimes against black people has gone on for too long .
What allows us to justify murder ? What selfish gene prevents us from intervening in the face of blatant injustice ? What history of lies and distortions have we sold ourselves that keep us in our isolated boxes of superiority and denial ? What truth would we have to tell about ourselves to unravel these strangulating tentacles of racism and violence ?
I was a cop – but I still do n't know how to survive a police stop | Michael A Wood Read more
What systems would we have to abandon or lose or claim as bankrupt ?
Which one of us has n't seen the outright slaughter going on in the recent videos of police shootings , and the videos before them , and the lynchings before them ?
Who does n't know the history of the very intentional policies that created abject conditions that so many black people are forced to live in : the poverty , the lack of opportunities , education , jobs , the exclusion ? Which one of us does n't understand the daily terror that occupies the lifeblood of every black woman , man and child in America which inhibits their ability to breath , live and thrive ? Which one of us has n't noticed the prisons filled with millions of black folks who are held and incarcerated at a rate 14 times higher than whites ?
And if we do n't see or know these things , why the hell do n't we ? Why have we created and allowed such a distance between us and the black people around us ? Why have we inured ourselves to their suffering , their sorrow , their fear , their desires , their dreams ?
It 's time now to put our white asses on the line for the freedom of our black sisters and brothers – time to be willing to forfeit our privilege and status ; time to admit the failure of a racist ideology and framework . Time to stop criticizing the tactics or methods or emotions of revolutionary movements that rise with bravery , heart vision , passion , patience and heroic kindness in response to the most grotesque atrocities , murders , degradations , terror , isolation and exclusion .
Because nothing will change until we are all willing to shut up and listen and serve , willing to stop making it about us : our feelings , our hurts , our guilt . Until we are willing to say this structure that we created and mastered has failed , to stop saying that agonizing and aggressive phrase “ all lives matter ” when we know full well they do n't , even to many of us .
Until we are willing to be wrong , willing to be lost , willing to be quiet . Can we be quiet ? Can we shut up ? Can we just shut up for one moment , shut up and stop talking about us ? How the pain and righteous rage of black people affects us ? How blamed we feel , how no matter what we do it stays the same , how they will never forgive us blah blah blah . Can we step out of the center of the picture for enough time for a healing to happen ?
Dallas is a tragedy for all of us – and should n't shut down calls for justice | Ijeoma Oluo Read more
Can we own our selfishness and fear and need for comfort and our desperation for power ? Can we give ourselves in service without directing or determining ? Can we walk behind black folks or beside them ? Can we allow ourselves to get close , real close , and rub up against the burning pain of those we have abused and enslaved , raped , incarcerated , shot , lynched , ignored and degraded ? Can we die that death and not make black people responsible for our guilt and neglect ?
Can we stop punishing people we have harmed for reminding us we have harmed them ? Can we be that honest , that generous , that vulnerable , that humble that we are able to provide support and kinship without being thanked or getting credit ? Can we serve without expecting to be worshipped ? Can we stop issuing instructions and offer our bodies for action instead ? Can we make this terrible wrong of racism the center of our thought and moral occupation ?
The truth is we are as much sinew as we are symbol . Our whiteness is our skin color , but it 's also a torn sheet draping the dead , a flag of privilege that will not surrender , a town called separateness . Our whiteness is that poisonous sky right before it rains , the color of shame .
So can we sit and be still for a minute and let the onerous truth and sorrow wash over us ? Then , in that cataclysmic silence , when we have touched into the tidal wave of our responsibility , we will know what lengths we have to go , what risks we will have to take to dismantle this mad hatred – and how fiercely we will have to love to right this wrong .
Mary Matalin , a longtime Republican consultant and aide to both Presidents Bush , has endorsed a libertarian for president in 2016 .
Matalin wrote that she supports Austin Petersen , a 35-year-old former producer of Judge Andrew Napolitano 's show on the Fox Business Network , because of his `` distinguished and dedicated career in advocacy for the principles upon which this country has founded and under which it has thrived . ''
`` In an ideal world , the GOP would continue to be the natural home of libertarian principles , '' Matalin wrote in the Libertarian Republic . `` Unfortunately , both parties have decimated the first principles that made this country great over the last 80+ years . The Democratic Party , steeped in progressive , liberal philosophy , has consistently fought for consolidated , centralized political power at the expense of individual self-determination . In recent years , the GOP has been less rigorous in providing a robust loyal opposition . ''
She continued , `` In these tumultuous times of domestic and global uncertainty , the country would be well served with Austin Petersen on the national ballot along with the two established party candidates . ''
Matalin joins other anti-Trump voters on the right such as conservative personality Erick Erickson , who want the Libertarian Party to choose Petersen over 2012 nominee Gary Johnson and John McAfee , the computer anti-virus creator .
The Libertarian Party 's convention begins in Orlando , Fla. , on Thursday .
Ubisoft , one of the most beloved and cherished gaming companies of the modern age , has announced they 're joining together to make the most mind bending creation of all time . Ubisoft , the force behind masterfully crafted and polished titles like The Divison and Assassin 's Creed Unity , said that in the wake of the virtual reality boom , they would be delving in with an Oculus title of their own .
The Virus will be a state-of-the-art simulator released exclusively for the Oculus Rift , which Ubisoft developers say will “ completely alter the way you understand playing games. ” The main mechanic in the VR title will be navigating an ever crumbling world , where you frequently clip through walls , characters deconstruct in front of you , and your save file can be suddenly erased—even while you 're in the middle of playing it .
Early screenshots have drawn criticism for appearing “ buggy , ” but Ubisoft executives have clarified that this is all intentional . “ What appears to be bugs are actually done intentionally , we 've been testing this new technology for a long time—as far back as Pools of Radiance : Ruins of Myth Drannor—but we 've finally perfected it . In order to win , you have to literally beat the game—be better than the code . ”
Developers from Ubisoft said they took inspiration from games that break the fourth wall and decided to take it to another level of immersion-breaking storytelling . “ When I played Undertale and that part where the game makes you think you 've lost your progress—that 's incredible . But what if you actually did ? That 's the kind of experience we wanted to build here . ”
Beyond the simple design of using bugs to actually build the game world , the game will also interact with your system to a degree . “ The game is called Virus , right—we decided it would be clever to make that literal . So it is literally a virus . It does n't do a lot of harm yet , though . We 're still working on that part . ”
It goes beyond effecting your electronics though . Ubisoft says their game can change your actual biology . The company explained their choice for VR , stating that it was the only thing powerful enough to run some of the more experimental technology in the title . “ We recruited some of the best from Japanese animation studios to help with particular sections . Our hope is to find a way to make it where , after playing certain parts for an extended period , you start to see the effects in real life . We figured the closest thing thus far are those old animes that used to give kids seizures . ”
The game is currently in alpha , but Ubisoft has already recruited their interns to test the game for them . They say the results are beyond what they expected . “ They 're saying after playing for a while they actually stopped being able to see people 's faces in real life . Also , some of them seemed to have formed a bit of memory loss , but only one has developed total amnesia . So far anyway . ”
The technology is not yet perfected though , as Ubisoft is still trying to find a solution for player retention . “ We 're finding most interns simply refuse to play the game after a short while . We 're not sure why , because most of them quit on the spot . We 're working on a new rewards system in the game to keep players more invested . That portion of the game will be worked on by Konami , who have offered to let us use some of their intellectual property as long as they can use our technology for their future endeavors . We 're already working on a port to slot machines . ”

U.S. Open 2017 : Tee times , parings for Round 3
Here are the tee times and pairings for Round 3 of the U.S. Open .
Symbol of exotic Brazil , Carmen Miranda was in fact born in Portugal . When she was young , her family decided to try their luck down South American way .
These days , the flow is in the opposite direction . Bananas , said Carmen , were her business . The business of Braga , meanwhile , is importing Brazilians . The provincial club , who visit Arsenal on Wednesday , are attempting to disturb the peace of Portugal 's traditional big three - Benfica , Porto and Sporting - with a squad that includes 17 representatives of the country 's former colony .
Perhaps it is payback time . After all , the Portuguese contribution to Brazilian football is considerable - especially in the history of Vasco da Gama , the Rio club dominated by immigrants from the old country .
Elton is one of many Brazilians at SC Braga and throughout Portugese football
Introduced by the British , football in Brazil began life as an elite pursuit . It was transformed by the emergence of Vasco and their policy of selecting poor white and black players . Under constant attack from the established clubs , Vasco 's place was assured in 1927 when they inaugurated their own stadium in the working class Sao Januario neighbourhood . At the time , it was the biggest ground in the continent , financed by contributions from the Portuguese small businesses that are so characteristic of Rio .
But it was Vasco 's biggest rivals who enjoyed the services of the finest member of Portugal 's footballing diaspora . Zico is the son of immigrants , as his nickname testifies . He was little Artur - Arturzinho in a conventional Brazilian family but Arturzico in his home . Shortened to Zico , he remains the all-time idol of the giant Flamengo club .
In the long run , though , it was inevitable that the flow would be reversed . For three reasons .
Firstly , there has been no large scale Portuguese immigration to Brazil in decades . The last wave , of young men seeking to avoid military service in the African wars of the crumbling Portuguese empire , ended in the mid-70s .
Secondly , there is the respective size of the two countries . Portugal has a population of less than 11m . Brazil 's is hurtling towards the 200m mark .
And thirdly , there is the rapid development of South American football after the introduction of professionalism in the 1930s and the primacy it achieved in the following decade while Europe had its mind on weightier matters .
Brazilian football was gripped with tactical curiosity at the time , which meant that one of the first things to come back across the Atlantic was ideas .
Flavio Costa , charismatic coach of Brazil in the 1950 World Cup , had some success with Porto a few years later . Far more important , though , was Otto Gloria , the grandson of Portuguese immigrants who carried Brazil 's 4-2-4 system with him when he took charge of Benfica in 1954 .
Along with huge domestic success , Gloria was also the man behind the finest hour of the Portugal national team . He took them to third place in the 1966 World Cup in England , playing some exhilarating football but also having few scruples about getting his defenders to hack Pele out of the tournament when his team met Brazil in the group stage . Four years later , he turned down the chance to take Brazil to the Mexico World Cup .
Brazilian coaches still come across to Portugal . Far more important these days , though , are the players . Portugal 's World Cup squad included three naturalised Brazilians - Deco , Pepe and Liedson - leading then-Brazil coach Dunga to quip maliciously - when the two sides were drawn together in the group stages - that it was Brazil A against Brazil B .
These three are the tip of the iceberg . Last season , 181 Brazilian footballers moved to Portugal . The players union in Portugal is unhappy that more than half the players in the first division are foreign , the bulk of them from Brazil . One club , Maritimo , have even fielded a team made up entirely of Brazilians .
From the point of view of the Portuguese clubs , it makes clear sense to take advantage of the historical and linguistic ties by buying from Brazil .
With the size of the country and the importance of the game to the national identity , it is little wonder that Brazil produces players by the cartload . Many head for Portugal without having made a mark in the land of their birth , which does not necessarily make them mediocre . They could be relatively late developers , like Deco .
Also , Portuguese football can be an interesting stepping stone on the way to one of the bigger European leagues . Ramires is a good example . Benfica picked him up on the day he was first chosen for the Brazil squad and have since sold him on to Chelsea at a huge profit . They were similarly shrewd and successful with the Argentine Angel di Maria , now of Real Madrid .
Given the limitations of their domestic market , this would seem to be a sound strategy for Portuguese clubs and helps explain why they have extended their Brazil connection to take in the rest of South America .
Among Braga 's key players , for example , are Uruguayan midfielder Luis Aguiar and classy Peruvian international centre-back Alberto Rodriguez . The squad also contains an Argentine , Andres Madrid .
There is no doubt , though , that Brazilian players give the side its flavour . The team that lost 3-2 to Porto on Saturday included only one Portuguese , with seven Brazilians in the starting line-up and another four on the bench .
Some of those have played almost their entire career in Portugal . Others made some impact on the Brazilian game before heading across the Atlantic . Only one , though , is a household name back home - goalkeeper Felipe , recently acquired from Corinthians .
Talented but temperamental , he appears to have struggled to adapt to faster European pitches . Or perhaps a lay-off while he was in dispute with Corinthians has taken the edge off his game . Wednesday would be an excellent moment to rediscover his touch .
A provincial Portuguese side against Arsene Wenger 's cosmopolitan giants , Braga have tried to level the playing field by investing in Brazilians . To have much of a chance at the Emirates , it would help if their keeper can find the form that made him an idol with one of Brazil 's biggest clubs . If not , then perhaps Braga fans will be dwelling on the title of Carmen Miranda 's last film - 'Scared Stiff ' .

OKLAHOMA CITY – Perhaps because the days and nights are cooler and more people are looking up , October proved to be another busy month in Oklahoma when it comes to people reporting UFO sightings .
October 2015 was also a busy month for UFO sightings as we reported last year , with information compiled by the Washington state-based National UFO Reporting Center ( NUFORC ) .
YUKON : Occuring late on the night of October 1st , the eyewitness reported seeing a “ quick flash ” that was not attributable to lightning and there was no sound accompanying the flash which was two seconds in duration . The eyewitness said a colleague in Oklahoma City also reported a similar flash .
ANTLERS : On the night of October 6th , the eyewitness reported the following to NUFORC : “ Seemed like just another star but then looked like a spotlight rolling and was extremely Bright ... then went back to a twinkle and started moving away but the movement was like shaky , jerky at first till it gained speed rather fast . It was absolutely ( quiet ) . ”
COWETA : A person in Coweta taking a picture of a falcon in the sky on the morning of October 8th reported seeing something else flying by in one of the photos they took . What it looked like was not noted in the report .
OKLAHOMA CITY : Near Oklahoma City 's southern boundary with Moore , an eyewitness reported seeing a “ white , perfect circle ” moving through a clear blue sky on the afternoon of October 13th . As the person sought someone else to point it out to , the circle “ ascended higher and disappeared . ”
TULSA : The objects seen in the predawn hours of October 18th were described as “ 3 triangular shaped craft. ” The duration of the sighting in Tulsa was approximately 20 minutes .
SHAWNEE : A family reported to NUFORC that for a week or so in mid-October , between the hours of 2 and 5 a.m. , an circular object with “ multi-colored lights on it ” were seen fairly consistently . NUFORC notes in the report that the Shawnee eyewitnesses may be seeing the star Sirius .
STILLWATER : A teardrop-shaped object with flashing green lights was seen in the early afternoon of October 27th . The sighting was preceded by a “ buzzing ” sound . The sighting was quick , however , and the object suddenly disappeared .
EDMOND : The eyewitness in Edmond reported seeing a “ flying wing ” made up of “ many small objects together. ” It was also slightly luminescent . The object ( s ) , also seen on October 27th , flew about 200-300 feet off the ground and was silent . It headed in a northwesterly direction .
NORMAN : Ten hours after the “ teardrop-shaped ” object reported in Stillwater earlier on October 27th , an eyewitness in Norman saw a similar object featuring green and yellow lights at Highway 77 and Cedar Lane , although the eyewitness seemed to think it might have been hovering somewhere around the intersection of Highway 9 and 24th Avenue in Norman .
“ It seemed to have appeared in the middle of the sky suddenly , ” reported the eyewitness . “ ( T ) hen it fell towards the ground . I lost sight of it behind trees and the neighborhood . There was just one . ”

BAGHDAD ( AP ) — The Islamic State group released at least 200 Yazidis after five months of captivity in Iraq , Kurdish military officials said Sunday , mostly elderly , infirmed prisoners who likely slowed the extremists down .
Peshmerga Gen. Shirko Fatih , commander of Kurdish forces in the northern city of Kirkuk , told The Associated Press that almost all of the freed prisoners are in poor health and bore signs of abuse and neglect . Three were young children , he said .
The militants transported the captives from the northern town of Tal Afar , where they were being held for the past five months after the militants raided their towns last summer . The militants dropped them off Saturday at the Khazer Bridge , near the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil . Fatih said . They were being held Sunday by Kurdish authorities for questioning , he said .
Fatih said that it appears the militants released the prisoners because they were too much of a burden .
`` It probably became too expensive to feed them and care for them , '' he said .
Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled in August when the Islamic State group captured the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar , near the Syrian border . But hundreds were taken captive by the group , particularly women . Iraqi and international authorities later said that some Yazidi women were sold into slavery .
About 50,000 Yazidis — half of them children , according to United Nations figures — fled to the mountains outside Sinjar during the onslaught . Some still remain there .
The Sunni militants of the Islamic State group view Yazidis and Shiite Muslims as apostates , and have demanded Christians either convert to Islam or pay a special tax . The Islamic State group currently holds a third of both Iraq and Syria and is being targeted by U.S.-led airstrikes .

CLOSE According to a report released on Tuesday , tuition fees at both public and private American colleges and universities are among the highest in the world . NorthJersey.com
A piggy bank ( Photo : Getty Images/iStockphoto )
LANSING – The prospect of free college tuition for students in 15 communities in Michigan are one of the highlights of the 58 bills signed into law by Gov . Rick Snyder since the end of June .
The Promise Zone legislation expanded the number of communities that can receive such designation from 10 to 15 . Introduced by state Sen. Jim Ananich , D-Flint , students in the community hit with a public health crisis as a result of lead-tainted water could begin benefiting soon from the designation .
The community has already raised roughly $ 3 million of a $ 5 million goal for the tuition promise , fueled by $ 2 million in contributions from Consumers Energy and Tom Gores , the owner of the Detroit Pistons ' basketball team .

“ This is going to give families hope in Flint that if they decided to stay after the water crisis , their children are going to have the opportunity to go to a trade school , community college or university , ” Ananich said . “ We want to try to raise as much as possible so we can provide kids private dollars first because it takes two years to be able to capture the other dollars.Kalamazoo was the first city in the state to implement a Promise Zone , which allows communities to capture a portion of property taxes to be used to provide at least two years of free tuition at state schools . Since it began in 2006 , 85 % of the eligible high school students in the Kalamazoo district – or 4,760 students – have taken advantage of the program to get free tuition through the end of 2015 , according to the Upjohn Institute , which is tracking the program .
Ten school districts – Baldwin , Battle Creek , Benton Harbor , Detroit , Hazel Park , Lansing , Muskegon , Newago , Pontiac and Saginaw – have received Promise Zone designation . With the legislation signed by Snyder , five more school districts will be able to get the designation and Flint is the first in the pipeline .
Besides Flint , the other school districts seeking Promise Zone designation are : Forest Park , Covert and River Rouge . A fifth district has n't yet applied .

Yes , I played a little . In junior high and even later . Lawful good paladin . Had a flaming sword . It did not make me popular with the ladies , or indeed with anyone . Neither did my affinity for geometry , nor my ability to recite all of “ Star Wars ” from memory .
Yet on the strength of those skills and others like them , I now find myself on top of the world . Not wealthy or in charge or even particularly popular , but in instead of out . The stuff I know , the geeky stuff , is the stuff you and everyone else has to know now , too .
We live in Gary Gygax 's world . The most popular books on earth are fantasy novels about wizards and magic swords . The most popular movies are about characters from superhero comic books . The most popular TV shows look like elaborate role-playing games : intricate , hidden-clue-laden science fiction stories connected to impossibly mathematical games that live both online and in the real world . And you , the viewer , can play only if you 've sufficiently mastered your home-entertainment command center so that it can download a snippet of audio to your iPhone , process it backward with beluga whale harmonic sequences and then podcast the results to the members of your Yahoo group .
Even in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons , when his company was selling millions of copies and parents feared that the game was somehow related to Satan worship , Mr. Gygax 's creation seemed like a niche product . Kids played it in basements instead of socializing . ( To be fair , you needed at least three people to play — two adventurers and one Dungeon Master to guide the game — so Dungeons & Dragons was social . Demented and sad , but social . ) Nevertheless , the game taught the right lessons to the right people .
Geeks like algorithms . We like sets of rules that guide future behavior . But people , normal people , consistently act outside rule sets . People are messy and unpredictable , until you have something like the Dungeons & Dragons character sheet . Once you 've broken down the elements of an invented personality into numbers generated from dice , paper and pencil , you can do the same for your real self .
Photo
For us , the character sheet and the rules for adventuring in an imaginary world became a manual for how people are put together . Life could be lived as a kind of vast , always-on role-playing campaign .
Do n't give me that look . I know I 'm not a paladin , and I know I do n't live in the Matrix . But the realization that everyone else was engaged in role-playing all the time gave my universe rules and order .

We geek might not be able to intuit the subtext of a facial expression or a casual phrase , but give us a behavioral algorithm and human interactions become a data stream . We can process what 's going on in the heads of the people around us . Through careful observation of body language and awkward silences , we can even learn to detect when we are bringing the party down with our analysis of how loop quantum gravity helps explain the time travel in that new “ Terminator ” TV show . I mean , so I hear .

Mr. Gygax 's game allowed geeks to venture out of our dungeons , blinking against the light , just in time to create the present age of electronic miracles .
Dungeons & Dragons begat one of the first computer games , a swords-and-sorcery dungeon crawl called Adventure . In the late 1970s , the two games provided the narrative framework for the first fantasy-based computer worlds played by multiple , remotely connected users . They were called multi-user dungeons back then , and they were mostly the province of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . But they required the same careful construction of virtual identities that Mr. Gygax had introduced to gaming .
Today millions of people are slaves to Gary Gygax . They play EverQuest and World of Warcraft , and someone must still be hanging out in Second Life . ( That “ massively multiplayer ” computer traffic , by the way , also helped drive the development of the sort of huge server clouds that power Google . )
But that 's just gaming culture , more pervasive than it was in 1974 when Dungeons & Dragons was created and certainly more profitable — today it 's estimated to be a $ 40 billion-a-year business — but still a little bit nerdy . Delete the dragon-slaying , though , and you 're left with something much more mainstream : Facebook , a vast , interconnected universe populated by avatars .
Facebook and other social networks ask people to create a character — one based on the user , sure , but still a distinct entity . Your character then builds relationships by connecting to other characters . Like Dungeons & Dragons , this is not a competitive game . There 's no way to win . You just play .
This diverse evolution from Mr. Gygax 's 1970s dungeon goes much further . Every Gmail login , every instant-messaging screen name , every public photo collection on Flickr , every blog-commenting alias is a newly manifested identity , a character playing the real world .
We do n't have to say goodbye to Gary Gygax , the architect of the now . Every time I make a tactical move ( like when I suggest to my wife this summer that we should see “ Iron Man ” instead of “ The Dark Knight ” ) , I 'm counting my experience points , hoping I have enough dexterity and rolling the dice . And every time , Mr. Gygax is there — quasi-mystical , glowing in blue and bearing a simple game that was an elegant weapon from a more civilized age .
That was a reference to “ Star Wars. ” Cool , right ?
New research from Ontario , Canada has uncovered some interesting finds about how cannabis helps those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder . These recent advancements help explain why so many veterans in the USA have abandoned their psychiatric medications and switched to cannabis .
Over the years , doctors have slowly begun to realize that psychiatric drugs commonly prescribed for conditions such as anxiety or depression provide little relief to individuals affected by post-traumatic stress disorder . Having taken notice of the astounding numbers of patients finding relief by switching to pot , psychiatrists and neuroscientists have attempted to explain how cannabis might help PTSD .
This latest research has uncovered that cannabidiol , CBD , a non-psychoactive component found in many strains of cannabis , interacts with the serotonin system in a certain area of the brain in a way that disrupts the formation of negative associative memories .
The study involved an experiment that used rats to measure how well they associated a painful sensation with a certain odor . Administering CBD directly into the rats ' brains during the painful sensation prevented them from associating the pain with the smell . Other rats without CBD got afraid of a potential electric shock and froze when they smelled the odor .
Previous research from Brazil has shown that THC , or tetrahydrocannabinol , the stuff that gets you high , is even more potent than CBD at disrupting contextual fear memory reconsolidation . Their experiment also showed that CBD and THC administered together could potentially provide relief for PTSD with minimal psychological side effects .
According to another researcher , those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder may actually have an imbalance in their endocannabinoid system , a relatively undetailed part of the body that has important implications in digestion , metabolism , mood and memory .
New York University showed how people suffering from PTSD actually have lower levels of endocannabinoids in their body , and in turn have more cannabinoid receptors to compensate . Given that the author of the study measured CB1 receptors and anandamide levels in humans with PTSD , not in rats like in the afore-mentioned research , it 's only a matter of time before the medical community begins to understand and accept the fact that many patients self-medicate with cannabis instead of pharmaceuticals .
While cannabis-based drugs for the treatment of PTSD will need to wait more time for clinical trials in order to obtain FDA approval . Even without the FDA , the mounting evidence that simple cannabis is enough for treatment will hopefully convince doctors and psychiatrists to quietly recommend cannabis for PTSD .
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck said this week he is “ absolutely approaching ” the point that he will throw for the first time since his January shoulder surgery .
Sometime in July seems on target for the procedure he had , but he does not have a chance to be full go for the start of training camp . If things break the Colts ' way , their starting QB could still play Week 1 .
However , Luck 's arm will need to continue to get stronger as the year progresses .
Now , why is Luck so far behind Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton ? After all , Newton underwent his shoulder procedure three months later than Luck but is on the verge of throwing .
The two surgeries were on different parts of the shoulder and were not the same procedures.Colts owner Jim Irsay confirmed that Luck had labrum repair surgery , while Newton 's procedure was a debridement of the rotator cuff .
The big difference is that Luck needed sutures and , thus , extended time for healing , while Newton 's recovery does not involve waiting for tissue regrowth .
The labrum is fibrous tissue that deepens the glenoid ( socket ) to help hold the humeral head ( ball ) in place . However , the shoulder is not a true ball and socket joint , like the hip joint is , but rather more golf ball ( humeral head ) on a tee ( glenoid ) .
A labral tear essentially means the tee ( glenoid ) is chipped , making it hard for the golf ball ( humeral head ) to stay in place . This shifting causes shoulder problems and the goal of repair is to stabilize the shoulder .
Luck had been playing with this injury since the second week of the 2015 season . Thus , it was an easy decision to undertake this major surgery for a throwing athlete and sacrifice the extended recovery time .
The Colts , who are historically secretive about injuries , have been adamant in claiming there is no firm timeline for throwing . That may be true , but it is virtually certain the medical staff has always had an expected timeframe in mind . It would be typical to not allow throwing until six months after surgery whereas rehabilitation on non-throwing athletes with the same procedure is quicker .
This means Luck could begin throwing in July , perhaps even a few weeks before the start of training camp . It is almost certain he starts camp on PUP .
Throwing is the hardest thing a shoulder does , and caution is imperative to avoid setback during recovery . With the labral repair , extended time is needed to allow the tissue to grow together . Only then can a throwing program be started .
When he does start throwing , Luck will need a minimum six-week throwing rehab program before rejoining the team in actual drills . Remember , recovery is not like a light switch where one day you ca n't throw and the next you can be 100 percent . The reality is the body progresses more like a slow sunrise or dimmer switch .
Head coach Chuck Pagano has acknowledged Luck will be on a “ pitch count ” when he returns .
The good news here is that ultimately there is good chance for 100 percent return . Drew Brees and other throwers have overcome such surgery for successful careers .
United States Supreme Court case
Bowman v. Monsanto Co. , 569 U.S. 278 ( 2013 ) , [ 1 ] was a United States Supreme Court patent decision in which the Court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved , patented seeds without the patent owner 's permission . The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman , an Indiana farmer , bought transgenic soybean crop seeds [ 2 ] from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season . Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting . The farmers sold their soybean crops ( also seeds ) to the local grain elevator , from which Bowman then bought them . After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest , Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license . In response , Bowman argued that Monsanto 's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion , because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold .
In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan , the Supreme Court ruled that Bowman 's conduct infringed Monsanto 's patents and that the doctrine of patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds by planting and harvesting saved crop seeds without the patent holder 's permission . The Court held that , when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed , thereby growing another soybean crop , that action constitutes an unauthorized `` making '' of the patented product .
The case garnered attention in part due to its potential impact on policy about genetically modified crops and self-replicating technologies , and due to the involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas , who previously served as a lawyer for Monsanto . [ 3 ] Commentators noted , however , that the Court 's ruling was narrow in scope , and did not set a broad legal precedent with respect to the applicability of the doctrine of patent exhaustion to self-replicating technologies .
Background [ edit ]
Factual setting [ edit ]
Monsanto developed patents for genetically modified soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides . [ 4 ] :36 When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup , the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants ( weeds ) would be killed . [ 5 ] Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting . [ 4 ] :36 [ 6 ]
Different types of genetically modified soybeans being grown side by side
In 1999 , Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season . He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops , many of which were transgenic , [ 7 ] and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities , not as seeds for planting . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] He tested the new seeds , and found that , as he had expected , some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate . [ 7 ] He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting , supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator . [ 8 ] He informed Monsanto of his activities . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Monsanto stated that he was infringing its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto ; Bowman stated that he had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator , on the grounds that for seed , all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold . [ 9 ] Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop , [ 7 ] but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation . [ 1 ] In 2007 , Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana . [ 4 ] :36 [ 6 ] [ 8 ]
Lower court rulings [ edit ]
After filing suit , Monsanto moved for summary judgment . In response , Bowman argued that if Monsanto was allowed to continue its license past exhaustion , it would be able to dominate the market . [ 6 ] Although the district court found Bowman 's arguments compelling , it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs [ 10 ]
and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling [ 11 ] to control , and in 2009 , the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto . [ 6 ] The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license , they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted . [ 6 ] The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $ 84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making , using , selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto 's patent . [ 6 ]
Bowman then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit . [ 6 ] Bowman argued that the Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second-generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court 's ruling in Quanta Computer , Inc. v. LG Electronics , Inc. [ 6 ] [ 12 ] Monsanto argued that the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds for planting . [ 6 ] The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court 's decision in favor of Monsanto . [ 4 ] :37 [ 6 ] [ 8 ]
Petition to the Supreme Court [ edit ]
Bowman sought review in the United States Supreme Court . [ 6 ] Bowman argued that the Federal Circuit 's decision conflicted with existing Supreme Court precedent on patent exhaustion . [ 6 ] Bowman said that United States v. Univis Lens Co. [ 13 ] showed that patent exhaustion applied even when the patent holder created post-sale restrictions . [ 6 ] He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created a judicial exception to patent exhaustion for Monsanto , allowing it to dominate the soybean seed market . [ 6 ] Finally , Bowman argued that he was not `` making '' infringing new seeds merely by planting and reaping crops . [ 6 ]
Monsanto argued that the Federal Circuit 's decision was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent . [ 6 ] They further argued that this was not an appropriate case to hear , as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale . [ 6 ] The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court , and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position . [ 6 ] The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari . [ 6 ] The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5 , 2012 . [ 14 ]
Supreme Court [ edit ]
Arguments [ edit ]
Bowman argued that the authorized sale of the seeds extinguished the patent , and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo . [ 6 ] He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created an exception to the exhaustion doctrine , and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide . [ 6 ] Monsanto argued that the second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement . [ 6 ] He noted that even when exhaustion applied , it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product , which the second-generation seeds were . [ 6 ]
A number of Amici Curiae also filed briefs on behalf of the parties . [ 15 ] For example , the American Intellectual Property Law Association , arguing on behalf of Monsanto , wrote that `` [ e ] xhaustion of the right to control propagation of patented seed would disrupt the balance created by Congress between the Patent Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act . `` [ 15 ] The American Seed Trade Association , also arguing on behalf of Monsanto , wrote that `` [ p ] atented seed technology benefits farmers , consumers and the environment '' . [ 15 ] The National Farmers Union , arguing on behalf of Bowman , wrote that `` [ a ] patent exhaustion exception for self-replicating technologies is inconsistent with this Court 's precedent and the competition policies reflected in the first-sale doctrine '' , and the Center for Food Safety wrote that `` [ f ] arming is not genetic engineering '' . [ 15 ]
In the months leading up to the decision , commentators weighed in on several issues relating to the case . Because Justice Clarence Thomas had served as a lawyer for the Monsanto Company 34 years earlier , some critics questioned whether he would remain impartial . [ 16 ] Other commentators noted that the case raised the `` important question '' of whether the exhaustion doctrine should include an exception for self-replicating technologies , which may one day include self-replicating robots . [ 17 ] In SCOTUSblog , Ronald Mann wrote the case 's `` practical ramifications are substantial '' , [ 18 ] and that the case was `` one of the highest-stakes cases of the Term '' . [ 19 ] However , Mann also predicted that `` it seems most unlikely the Court will rule against Monsanto '' , [ 18 ] and in his coverage of the case 's oral arguments , he observed that `` none of the Justices expressed any sympathy for [ Bowman 's ] position '' . [ 19 ]
Opinion of the Court [ edit ]
On May 13 , 2013 , Justice Elena Kagan delivered the Court 's unanimous opinion , which affirmed the judgment of the Federal Circuit . [ 6 ] [ 1 ] [ 20 ] Justice Kagan stated that while an authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item , that exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder 's permission . [ 6 ] [ 1 ] Justice Kagan stated that when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed , thereby growing a further soybean crop , that action constitutes an unauthorized `` making '' of the patented product , in violation of section 271 ( a ) of the patent code . [ 6 ] [ 21 ] Justice Kagan concluded that Bowman could resell the patented seeds he obtained from the elevator , or use them as feed , but that he could not produce additional seeds ( that is , crops ) . [ 4 ] :37
After the Court published its decision , analysts offered a range of opinions about the impact of the Court 's ruling . An academic co-author of an amicus brief on behalf of Bowman filed by the American Antitrust Institute expressed relief that the loss was on a narrow basis rather than providing a broad affirmation of the lack of patent exhaustion for self-replicating technologies . [ 22 ] Kevin Rodkey argued that an analysis under Quanta Computer leads to the conclusion that patent rights covering self-replicating seeds are exhausted on the first authorized sale , including subsequent generations , and that seed companies can only exclude subsequent replantings with carefully written license restrictions . [ 23 ] :600–603 Ronald Mann writing in SCOTUSblog noted : `` The tenor of the Court came through most clearly when the Court ridiculed what it called Bowman 's 'blame-the-bean defense ' – the argument that Bowman did not make new seeds , because it was the seeds themselves that replicated . `` [ 24 ]
Another academic , Richard H. Stern , did not take issue with the Court 's refusal to shelter Bowman 's conduct under the exhaustion doctrine , but criticized the Court 's classification of the act of planting seeds and growing crops from them as an act of `` making '' a new patented article . [ 25 ] Rochelle C. Dreyfus is also reported to have criticized the decision , noting that Bowman was attempting to obtain the benefit of the genetic modifications , while others , such as organic growers , fear being sued for inadvertent cross-contamination . [ 26 ] Additionally , the Harvard Law Review wrote that `` [ t ] he Court reached the correct outcome but via the wrong route '' because its ruling `` obfuscates the role of the licensing agreement '' and because the `` exhaustion doctrine is ill suited to address the challenges posed by self-replicating technologies '' . [ 27 ]
Other commentators suggested the case will have broad-ranging impacts for other self-replicating technologies . Tabetha Marie Peavey suggested that the Court `` appeared to be alert to the consequences of its ruling , not just for the value of Monsanto 's soybean patents , but also for technologies like cell lines , software , and vaccines '' . [ 28 ] Likewise , Christopher M. Holman wrote that the case `` should be viewed as a bellwether for an oncoming wave of controversy around the patenting of self-replicating technologies that will challenge the ability of the patent system to respond effectively '' . [ 29 ] William J. Simmons also wrote that `` more cases like this will probably be appealed to [ the Supreme Court ] as these technologies become more prevalent in society '' . [ 15 ]
Subsequent developments [ edit ]
In a similar case , Organic Seed Growers & Trade Ass'n v. Monsanto Co. , [ 30 ] a coalition of farmers filed suit to challenge twenty-three of Monsanto 's patents for glyphosate-resistant crops . [ 31 ] The plaintiffs argued that if their crops became `` contaminated by transgenic seed , which may very well be inevitable given the proliferation of transgenic seed today , they could quite perversely also be accused of patent infringement '' . [ 32 ] The plaintiffs sued to declare Monsanto 's patents invalid and asked Monsanto to `` expressly waive any claim for patent infringement [ Monsanto ] may ever have '' against the farmers and to `` memorialize that waiver by providing a written covenant not to sue '' . [ 33 ] However , the case was dismissed for lack of a controversy . The suit did not demonstrate instances of current harm or future risk . Monsanto also gave assurances that it did not plan to sue in cases of inadvertent infringement when a grower was not also using glyphosate on their crop . [ 34 ] Monsanto 's patent for the soybeans at issue in this case expired in 2014 , prior to which Monsanto announced that it will no longer enforce the licenses associated with the soybeans . [ 28 ] [ 35 ]

Nurses are `` devastated '' by the proposed restructuring at the Southern District Health Board .
New Zealand Nurses Organisation Dunedin organiser Lorraine Lobb said the proposal removed budgetary and operational control from nursing leadership .
There would be fewer nurse management roles , and those who remained would have less say in decision-making , Mrs Lobb said .
`` We 're quite devastated by this proposal .
`` We 're all about safe staffing , [ and that ] requires nursing leadership , '' she said .
The proposal would see a net loss of 23 management positions .
It was unclear how many were nursing roles .
`` There has definitely been a reduction , '' she said .
The new chief nursing and midwifery officer would have no control over budgets as their underlings would only report to them on professional matters , she said .
`` When we 're at the front 24 hours a day , seven days a week , this is not what nursing needs at this time . ''
The proposal also removes operational responsibilities from the board 's top doctor , the chief medical officer .
On operational matters , medical directors would report to the director of specialist services , rather than the chief medical officer .
Senior doctors ' union representative Dr John Chambers said the proposal appeared to break up a joint decision-making model which had involved senior doctors and nurses .
Dr Chambers said he had some sympathy for the DHB 's view that some managers spent too much time on the road , and more site-specific roles were needed .
He said it was unsettling and distressing for affected staff . Dunedin North MP Dr David Clark said the proposed change was significant , and he believed it lacked a rationale .
`` There 's no underlying explanation about how this is going to improve patient care . ''
In the document released this week , chief executive Chris Fleming said he wanted to reduce complexity in management , and make it more responsive in areas such as primary care .
The DHB will consider submissions before announcing the final structure in June .
`` Many of the driving forces in health care require transformational change to our primary services — whether in mental health , or caring for our ageing population .
`` We need to ensure we have the right structures to ensure a strong and integrated , whole-of-system approach to delivering care , '' Mr Fleming said in a statement released with the proposal .

Like plants and trees on land , phytoplankton give us a lot more than food . Scientists estimate that at least 50 percent of the oxygen in our atmosphere has been produced by phytoplankton . At the same time , they are responsible for drawing down significant portions of the carbon dioxide from the air . The tiniest of living organisms exert an outsized influence on the planet .
In mid-summer 2016 in the Southern Hemisphere , they took up an outsized parcel of real estate in the Southern Ocean , as shown in the image above . On January 13 , 2016 , the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) on the Suomi NPP satellite captured this view of extensive phytoplankton blooms stretching from the tip of South America across to the Antarctic Peninsula . The image was built with data from the red , green , and blue wavelength bands on VIIRS , plus chlorophyll data . A series of image-processing steps highlighted the color differences and more subtle features , such as nearly a dozen eddies of varying sizes .
The parcel of blooming ocean—at least that part visible through the break in the clouds—stretched from 56° to 68° South latitude ; that is roughly 720 nautical miles or 1300 kilometers from top to bottom . At the widest point , the plankton-rich waters spread from 78° to 93° West longitude , or roughly 480 miles ( 770 kilometers ) . Of course , these measurements only account for what we can see between the clouds .
The blooms in this image formed just west of the Drake Passage , one of the most turbulent mixing regions in the ocean . Winds and water currents are steady and strong , and the ocean and atmosphere exchange a lot of heat , water , and other natural chemicals . With abundant summer sunshine and lots of nutrients being churned up , the waters can become a factory for the creation of oxygen .
The Southern Ocean has been an area of intense study and educated speculation in recent years . Modeling by researchers at the University of Tasmania recently suggested that the growth of phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean , particularly diatoms , might double by 2100 . Other research led by the University of Washington has suggested that blooms in the far southern waters alter the cloud cover of the region by releasing chemicals ( such as dimethyl sulfide ) and by becoming airborne seeds for clouds ( when picked up by winds ) . A third group from the University of Sheffield examined ocean color imagery and found that icebergs often create phytoplankton-rich wakes that can drawn down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for as long as a month .

While Europe was in the ‘ Dark Ages ' from the 6th to the 14th century , another area of the world was shining bright – the Middle East .
From the fall of Rome until the European Renaissance the Arab world was far and away the keyholder and advancer of higher learning . One major center of this ancient knowledge was calledFounded by the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid sometime around 800AD , the House of Wisdom was a great library in Baghdad . Under al-Rashid 's son , al-Ma'mun , the capital was moved from Damascus to Baghdad and the House of Wisdom grew with his support . Al-Ma'mun saw the importance of the sciences and expanded the library to include one wing for each . Now it was an Academy ( universities did not exist , knowledge was transferred directly from student to teacher without any formal surroundings ) , a place to translate works into Arabic , a building of learning , and a center for the birth and sharing of new ideas .
Works were translated from all languages , Greek , Hebrew , Aramaic , Latin , Farsi , Syriac , Sanskrit , and others . Hundreds of scholars worked daily to increase the collection of important books . A key reason for the growth was the invention of paper in China had reached Baghdad in 793AD . Now instead of costly parchment or mold susceptible papyrus , a cheaper and lasting material was commonly available . Baghdad built the region 's first known paper mill due to the demand from the House of Wisdom .
The middle east was at the perfect crossroads to obtain the ideas of both the western world and the eastern . Thanks to the silk road , Baghdad became rich off the tolls collected from traders , who also brought news and ideas . Growing rapidly , the city became the key center of the region . Strong in its military and economic power , it could afford a well establish scientific community . 9th century Arabic geographer and historian al-Y'qubi wrote Baghdad had “ no equal on Earth , either in the Orient or the Occident ” and “ no one is better educated than their scholars ” .
Thanks to its patronage and location in such a powerful city , the House of Wisdom became a major center of intellectual thought in not just the Arabic world , but a destination of scholars from all over . The pursuit of the sciences became a great focus in the Abbasid empire , and they good pay was a major draw for these scholars . Works from Plato , Ptolemy , Hippocrates , Aristotle and other well-known philosophers were requested from libraries near and far , such as the library of Constantinople . The books would be brought back to Baghdad and translated before being returned . By the end of the 9th century , it is estimated that the House of Wisdom contained more books than anywhere else in the world .
The good pay for translations led to a little bit of corruption . Hunayn was fluent in four languages and al-Ma'mun made him the head of the translation department – with a reported salary of the weight in gold of each book translated . So it was said that he used thick paper and large lettering with wide margins.One interesting tale is that algebra was invented in the House of Wisdom . In the 9th century al-Khwarizmi wrote his book of mathematics called ‘ Book of Restoring and Balancing ' , or in Arabic Kitab al-Jabr wa ' l-muqabla. -- - algebra . He was also responsible for our word algorithm .
Another tale is that al-Ma'mun had heard of a grand library in Sicily , so he wrote to the King to ask if he could have all the books stored there . The Sicilian bishops told their King that the books were no good to the people of the ancient world , and so were no good to the people now . The king sent al-Ma'mun every book in the collection . It was said that it took 100 camels to carry them all back to Baghdad .
Since al-Ma'mun was so interested in the sciences he could often be found in the halls and lectures discussing the ongoing research . One of his favorite subjects was astrology , as the society of the times believed the planets and stars influenced events here on Earth . So he commissioned a great astronomical observatory to be built for the House , it was called Marsad Falaki . There the positions of the heavenly bodies were tracked and recorded .
For some 450 years the House of Wisdom collected and passed on knowledge to those who sought it . But on February 10th , 1258 it was destroyed forever . The Mongol Hulagu Khan ( grandson of Genghis ) and his army had besieged the city on January 29th of that year , and attacked on the 5th seizing a large portion of the defenses . The last Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'sim saw little hope of fighting them off , so he surrendered the city in exchange for the promise that the city and its cultural heritage not be destroyed .
Once the gates were open , the Mongols pillaged everything and killed nearly everyone .
They killed the Caliph 's court and almost his entire family ( his youngest son was sent back to Mongolia and one daughter was taken as a slave and added to Hulagu 's harem ) . The Caliph was kept alive and made to watch the murders and destruction , it is said he was rolled into a carpet ( they believed the blood of royalty touching the earth would offend the Gods ) and trampled to death by Mongol horsemen . They looted , raped , and murdered the citizens . They killed the scholars and threw all the books into the Tigris river .
The story told is that the river flowed black and red for days , black from the ink and red from the blood .
The death toll was anywhere between 90,000 to 1 million . Hulagu repositioned his encampment upwind because of the stench of all the dead bodies .
Baghdad was a ruined city for hundreds of years afterwards , never regaining the status it once held . Its destruction was the beginning of the end of the Arabic golden age in sciences .
A man named Nasir al-Din al-Tusi managed to flee before the Mongols had arrived and he is reported to have saved 400,000 manuscripts by taking them to Maragheh observatory in present day Iran . Nasir then sought the protection of the Order of Ismailis Assassins and was captured by the Mongols after the fall of Alamut Castle in 1256 until he died in 1274 .
Over the course of its many years , the House was the birthplace of numerous ideas .
The engineers Ahmad and Hasan wrote a book of ingenious mechanical inventions , one was called the instrument that plays by itself - an early programmable machine . Mohammad Musa might have been the first to state the laws of physics were universal . Hunayn was a doctor who studied the eyes , and others wrote works on diseases , infections , and surgery that were the most detailed until the Italian Renaissance . Ibn al-Haytham loved astronomy and also studied the eyes as a way to improve optics .

This ultra-fast Internet may beat Google Fiber to your home
Google Fiber offers mind-boggling data transfer speeds , but fiber optics require a massive build-out . That need for digging keeps Fiber from rolling out quickly , and gives the competition a chance to catch up where Fiber has n't made its presence known . That Gigabit speed via Fiber and other services is impressive , but also a bit of overkill . New wireless tech from Mimosa brings us all back to Earth a bit , but still delivers on impressive data speeds you 're likely not currently getting .
The products also make it easier for Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) to implement , as it 's nearly plug-and-play . Attaching the products to a tower give a central hub for ISPs to point the antennae on the homes of users .
Once the tower is set up , all you or I would need is a similar wireless antenna on our homes , pointing to the tower . At right around $ 100 , the access point is n't going to break the bank , either .
We 'd also see data speeds between 100-500 megabits per second . That 's not the breakneck speed of Fiber , but it 's also not the 20Mbps speed that 's average at home .
Mimosa 's network will start rolling out next year , but ISPs will have to build out towers for it . Towers need to built in neighborhoods , so while it gets away from the tedious task of laying fiber optic cable , there 's still some work to be done with boots on the ground .

The Houston Texans are beyond laughably bad . They may be beyond the tear-inducing stage , too . They 've achieved perhaps the lowest low : We 're nearly through Week 7 and not quite at midseason yet , and the Texans are completely irrelevant .
When exactly did that happen Sunday ? There were several options during a 41-7 drubbing from the Miami Dolphins .
Personally , I 'll go with the entire first half , when the Dolphins scored all of their points . That came from the same Dolphins offense that had been moving along at a putrid 20.6 points per game prior to Week 7 ( 24th ) .
But giving up an 85-yard rushing touchdown to Dolphins running back Lamar Miller is also a fine choice for when the Texans truly imploded . Incredibly , that was one of four 50-plus-yard touchdowns allowed by Houston during the first half . That led to an ugly-yardage scoreboard over those first two quarters , with the Texans outgained 392-65 .
And to throw more gas on this burning fire , Texans running back Arian Foster tore his Achilles during garbage time , and his season is over , according to NFL Network 's Ian Rapoport .
If the misery continues Texans head coach Bill O'Brien will get the most obvious mercy firing in recent NFL history .
Drunk History : Cultural Role of Alcohol Revealed
To learn more about how human ancestors evolved the ability to break down alcohol , scientists focused on the genes that code for a group of digestive enzymes called the ADH4 family . ADH4 enzymes are found in the stomach , throat and tongue of primates , and are the first alcohol-metabolizing enzymes to encounter ethanol after it is imbibed .
The researchers looked at the ADH4 genes from 28 different mammals , to investigate how closely related they were and find out when their ancestors diverged . In total , they explored nearly 70 million years of primate evolution . The scientists then used this knowledge to investigate how the ADH4 genes evolved over time and what the ADH4 genes of their ancestors might have been like .
The results suggested there was a single genetic mutation 10 million years ago that endowed human ancestors with an enhanced ability to break down ethanol .
The scientists noted that the timing of this mutation coincided with a shift to a terrestrial lifestyle . The ability to consume ethanol may have helped human ancestors dine on rotting fruit that fell on the forest floor when other food was scarce . `` I suspect ethanol was a second-choice item , '' Carrigan said .
The scientists detailed their findings online Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

History Edit
Terminology , definitions , and jargon Edit
Over the decades since the 1950s , a rich technical jargon has grown around the engineering of vehicles designed to enter planetary atmospheres . It is recommended that the reader review the jargon glossary before continuing with this article on atmospheric reentry . When atmospheric entry is part of a spacecraft landing or recovery , particularly on a planetary body other than Earth , entry is part of a phase referred to as entry , descent , and landing , or EDL . [ 7 ] When the atmospheric entry returns to the same body that the vehicle had launched from , the event is referred to as reentry ( almost always referring to Earth entry ) .
Entry vehicle shapes Edit
Reentry heating Edit
Thermal protection systems Edit
Feathered reentry Edit
In 2004 , aircraft designer Burt Rutan demonstrated the feasibility of a shape-changing airfoil for reentry with the suborbital SpaceShipOne . The wings on this craft rotate upward into the feather configuration that provides a shuttlecock effect . Thus SpaceShipOne achieves much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing significant thermal loads . The configuration increases drag , as the craft is now less streamlined and results in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher altitudes than otherwise . The aircraft thus slows down more in higher atmospheric layers which is the key to efficient reentry . Secondly , the aircraft will automatically orient itself in this state to a high drag attitude . [ 44 ] However , the velocity attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry is much lower than that of an orbital spacecraft , and engineers , including Rutan , recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit . On 4 May 2011 , the first test on the SpaceShipTwo of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight after release from the White Knight Two . The feathered reentry was first described by Dean Chapman of NACA in 1958 . [ 45 ] In the section of his report on Composite Entry , Chapman described a solution to the problem using a high-drag device : It may be desirable to combine lifting and nonlifting entry in order to achieve some advantages ... For landing maneuverability it obviously is advantageous to employ a lifting vehicle . The total heat absorbed by a lifting vehicle , however , is much higher than for a nonlifting vehicle ... Nonlifting vehicles can more easily be constructed ... by employing , for example , a large , light drag device ... The larger the device , the smaller is the heating rate . Nonlifting vehicles with shuttlecock stability are advantageous also from the viewpoint of minimum control requirements during entry . ... an evident composite type of entry , which combines some of the desirable features of lifting and nonlifting trajectories , would be to enter first without lift but with a ... drag device ; then , when the velocity is reduced to a certain value ... the device is jettisoned or retracted , leaving a lifting vehicle ... for the remainder of the descent . The North American X-15 used a similar mechanism . [ citation needed ]
Inflatable heat shield reentry Edit
NASA engineers check IRVE . Deceleration for atmospheric reentry , especially for higher-speed Mars-return missions , benefits from maximizing `` the drag area of the entry system . The larger the diameter of the aeroshell , the bigger the payload can be . `` [ 46 ] An inflatable aeroshell provides one alternative for enlarging the drag area with a low-mass design . Such an inflatable shield/aerobrake was designed for the penetrators of Mars 96 mission . Since the mission failed due to the launcher malfunction , the NPO Lavochkin and DASA/ESA have designed a mission for Earth orbit . The Inflatable Reentry and Descent Technology ( IRDT ) demonstrator was launched on Soyuz-Fregat on 8 February 2000 . The inflatable shield was designed as a cone with two stages of inflation . Although the second stage of the shield failed to inflate , the demonstrator survived the orbital reentry and was recovered . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] The subsequent missions flown on the Volna rocket failed due to launcher failure . [ 49 ] NASA IRVE Edit NASA launched an inflatable heat shield experimental spacecraft on 17 August 2009 with the successful first test flight of the Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment ( IRVE ) . The heat shield had been vacuum-packed into a 15-inch ( 380 mm ) diameter payload shroud and launched on a Black Brant 9 sounding rocket from NASA 's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island , Virginia . `` Nitrogen inflated the 10-foot ( 3.0 m ) diameter heat shield , made of several layers of silicone-coated [ Kevlar ] fabric , to a mushroom shape in space several minutes after liftoff . `` [ 46 ] The rocket apogee was at an altitude of 131 miles ( 211 km ) where it began its descent to supersonic speed . Less than a minute later the shield was released from its cover to inflate at an altitude of 124 miles ( 200 km ) . The inflation of the shield took less than 90 seconds . [ 46 ] NASA HIAD Edit Following the success of the initial IRVE experiments , NASA developed the concept into the more ambitious Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator ( HIAD ) . The current design is shaped like a shallow cone , with the structure built up as a stack of circular inflated tubes of gradually increasing major diameter . The forward ( convex ) face of the cone is covered with a flexible thermal protection system robust enough to withstand the stresses of atmospheric entry ( or reentry ) . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] In 2012 , a HIAD was tested as Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 ( IRVE-3 ) using a suborbital sounding rocket and worked . [ 52 ] :8
Entry vehicle design considerations Edit
There are four critical parameters considered when designing a vehicle for atmospheric entry : Peak heat flux Heat load Peak deceleration Peak dynamic pressure Peak heat flux and dynamic pressure selects the TPS material . Heat load selects the thickness of the TPS material stack . Peak deceleration is of major importance for manned missions . The upper limit for manned return to Earth from low Earth orbit ( LEO ) or lunar return is 10g . [ 53 ] For Martian atmospheric entry after long exposure to zero gravity , the upper limit is 4g . [ 53 ] Peak dynamic pressure can also influence the selection of the outermost TPS material if spallation is an issue . Starting from the principle of conservative design , the engineer typically considers two worst case trajectories , to undershoot and overshoot trajectories . The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowest allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric skip-off . The overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness . To undershoot trajectory is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory . For manned missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration . To undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure . Consequently , to undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material . There is no `` one size fits all '' TPS material . A TPS material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive ( too dense ) for a long duration heat load . A low density TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high . A TPS material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux , but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the wall pressure is significantly increased ( this happened with NASA 's R-4 test spacecraft ) . [ 53 ] Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials . However , modern TPS materials often lack the flight history of the older materials ( an important consideration for a risk-averse designer ) . Based upon Allen and Eggers discovery , maximum aeroshell bluntness ( maximum drag ) yields minimum TPS mass . Maximum bluntness ( minimum ballistic coefficient ) also yields a minimal terminal velocity at maximum altitude ( very important for Mars EDL , but detrimental for military RVs ) . However , there is an upper limit to bluntness imposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon shock wave detachment . A shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if the cone 's half-angle is below a critical value . This critical half-angle can be estimated using perfect gas theory ( this specific aerodynamic instability occurs below hypersonic speeds ) . For a nitrogen atmosphere ( Earth or Titan ) , the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 60° . For a carbon dioxide atmosphere ( Mars or Venus ) , the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 70° . After shock wave detachment , an entry vehicle must carry significantly more shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point ( the subsonic cap ) . Consequently , the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing aerodynamic instability . It is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design intended for Titan entry ( Huygens probe in a nitrogen atmosphere ) for Mars entry ( Beagle-2 in a carbon dioxide atmosphere ) . [ citation needed ] [ original research ? ] Prior to being abandoned , the Soviet Mars lander program achieved one successful landing ( Mars 3 ) , on the second of three entry attempts ( the others were Mars 2 and Mars 6 ) . The Soviet Mars landers were based upon a 60° half-angle aeroshell design . A 45° half-angle sphere-cone is typically used for atmospheric probes ( surface landing not intended ) even though TPS mass is not minimized . The rationale for a 45° half-angle is to have either aerodynamic stability from entry-to-impact ( the heat shield is not jettisoned ) or a short-and-sharp heat pulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison . A 45° sphere-cone design was used with the DS/2 Mars impactor and Pioneer Venus Probes .
Notable atmospheric entry accidents Edit
Friction with air In air flight Expulsion lower angle Perpendicular to the entry point Excess friction 6.9° to 90° Repulsion of 5.5° or less Explosion friction Plane tangential to the entry point Reentry window Not all atmospheric reentries have been successful and some have resulted in significant disasters . Voskhod 2 – The service module failed to detach for some time , but the crew survived .
Soyuz 1 – The attitude control system failed while still in orbit and later parachutes got entangled during the emergency landing sequence ( entry , descent , and landing ( EDL ) failure ) . Lone cosmonaut Vladimir Mikhailovich Komarov died .
Soyuz 5 – The service module failed to detach , but the crew survived .
Soyuz 11 – After tri-module separation , a valve was weakened by the blast and failed on reentry . The cabin depressurized killing all three crew members .
Mars Polar Lander – Failed during EDL . The failure was believed to be the consequence of a software error . The precise cause is unknown for lack of real-time telemetry .
Space Shuttle STS-1 – a combination of launch damage , protruding gap filler , and tile installation error resulted in serious damage to the orbiter , only some of which the crew was privy to . Had the crew known the true extent of the damage before attempting reentry , they would have flown the shuttle to a safe altitude and then bailed out . Nevertheless , reentry was successful , and the orbiter proceeded to a normal landing . STS-107 – The failure of an RCC panel on a wing leading edge caused by debris impact at launch led to breakup of the orbiter on reentry resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members .
Genesis entry vehicle after crash Genesis – The parachute failed to deploy due to a G-switch having been installed backwards ( a similar error delayed parachute deployment for the Galileo Probe ) . Consequently , the Genesis entry vehicle crashed into the desert floor . The payload was damaged , but most scientific data were recoverable .
Soyuz TMA-11 – The Soyuz propulsion module failed to separate properly ; fallback ballistic reentry was executed that subjected the crew to forces about eight times that of gravity . [ 54 ] The crew survived .

THE PRO LIFE Group , Youth Defence , has said abortion campaigners are rushing to exploit the case of Savita Praveen Halappanavar to “ further their own agenda ” and insisted that her death was not caused by Ireland 's ban on abortion .
The campaign group said that its thoughts and prayers were with the Indian woman 's family and insisted that there were “ very clear ” Medical Council guidelines which state that doctors will be struck off if they do n't intervene to save a mother 's life .
The group was responding to the news of the 31-year-0ld dentist 's death at the University Hospital Galway last month after she suffered a miscarriage over two days .
Today 's Irish Times quotes her husband as saying that his wife was repeatedly refused a termination .
Savita later developed septicemia and died . The matter was raised in the Dáil this morning where there were calls for an independent inquiry into the case separate to two investigations already being carried out by the HSE and the hospital .
Youth Defence said that journalists – whom they did not identify – had been “ rushing to pre-empt those investigations when they are not in full possession of the facts ” .
Its statement said : “ According to the information that is available , it seems that a delay in administering antibiotics may have been the cause of the septicaemia which tragically led to her death .
“ Experts commenting on the case have made it clear that in such cases the main concentration of the medical team treating any woman in these situations would be on maintaining her health . ”
Youth Defence went on to say that Ireland 's ban on abortion does not pose a threat to women 's lives citing “ Obstetricians and Gynaecologists who care for Irish women every day ” .
“ In fact , without abortion , Ireland is one of the safest places in the world for a mother to have a baby , according to the United Nations , ” the statement said .
‘ Regrettable '
Niamh Uí Bhriain of the Life Institute added : ” It is very sad to see abortion campaigners rush to exploit this case to further their own agenda .
“ The tragic loss of Savita Halappanavar 's life was not caused by Ireland 's ban on abortion . We need to ensure that mothers and babies are best protected ; and abortion is not part of the best medical practise . It is medieval medicine . ”
In another statement issued a short time ago , Senator Ronan Mullen said that it was “ regrettable ” to see people using the case “ as an argument for legislating for the Supreme Court decision in X . ”
He also pointed to Medical Council guidelines which he said meant that Savita was entitled to the treatment she needed .
Mullen said that there needed to be fairness to the medical staff involved in the case and that people needed to await the outcome of investigations that have been set up .
He said : “ According to medical council guidelines , widely accepted medical practice and Irish law , a woman in Ms Halappanavar 's situation is entitled to the medical treatment she needs .
“ This is true regardless of the existence of a foetal heartbeat or whether her unborn child might die or already have died .
“ A primary issue in this case may have been the diagnosis and management of infection . But there would be no good legal or ethical reason why an induced delivery could not have taken place , once the medical situation called for that . ”
He continued : “ It 's regrettable that some people are seeking to use this tragedy as an argument for legislating for the Supreme Court decision in X .
“ There is no legal impediment to offering all necessary medical treatment to pregnant women . Notwithstanding this tragedy , Ireland still ranks as one of the safest countries in the world for pregnant women .
“ On the other hand , legislation for the X-case decision would , among other things , introduce abortion on a mental health ground that is unjustifiable on any reputable medical basis . ”
This film review will be slightly different . Instead of focusing on the entire game , we 'll look exclusively at the performance of Bishop Sankey . I think we may have something special in Sankey , though I know that opinion is n't universally shared among Titans fans . And , when you look at his general statistics , it 's not hard to understand why some fans might be lukewarm .
50 Carries . 211 Yards . 4.2 YPC . 1 TD .
These stats are fine , but they certainly do n't jump off the page . Context , though . It always matters . What is Sankey being asked to do ? What 's working , and what is not ? We 'll look at that in more detail in this post .
Playing to Strengths
It 's always interesting to me when the discussion of adapting an offense to personnel comes up with fans , many take the stance that the player in discussion must be limited . Fans want all players to be all things , yet it rarely works this way . Like most personnel related things , players have strengths that should be highlighted and weaknesses that should be avoided . Now , of course , as the player becomes increasingly limited , then the discussion changes . For the purpose of this conversation , I do n't think that applies . Sankey does just fine at baseline ball carrying duties , and thrives in some areas .
This leads to the topic of strength specific play calling , which is just another way of saying we should call plays that highlight the things we 're best at , and eliminate the areas in which we struggle . It 's certainly not a trend setting idea . For most fans , it 's intuitive . Sometimes , though , I think coaches get lost in dogma , or philosophy , and miss what 's working . To me , this seems to be happening in the running game with Sankey . With that in mind , I charted Sankey 's runs from this past game .
The numbers jived with what the film was telling me . When you can create space by removing defenders , Sankey can be electric . He 's decisive with his cuts , and has no problems attacking even small creases . Alternatively , as more blockers are added , it allows more defenders to get involved without consequence ( they have to match the gaps , after all ) . Our blocking is n't strong enough to be begging defenders to get into a dog fight , nor is Sankey the type of back that 's meant to push the pile .
Be mindful that this is a small sample size . It 's not mean to be extrapolated to a season , or anything of that sort . It just helps tell the story .
This was the first thing that jumped out at me . Sankey appears to just run better out of the gun . Some of this is due to a short area burst . He 's going to be quicker in and out of his initial cuts than the pursuing linebackers . Alternatively , runs from under center buy defenders time to read keys and react before Sankey has an opportunity to make cuts . It 's also worth noting here that all shotgun runs came out of 11 personnel , which spreads the field more .
The second thing I noticed was that Sankey ( and really all the Titans backs ) tend to run better on zone runs . I do n't think the technique is there with pulls . We 're not blowing guys off blocks consistently when blocking down , and our pulling linemen continually appear to struggle . Still , this line has some athleticism to it that can shine at times when working laterally in the zone game . As it relates to Sankey , the zone game gives him the leeway to use his vision and ability to change direction , both of which are strengths . Instead of attacking a predetermined hole , often times of which is not correctly blocked , the zone game affords him the potential to cut things back with the playside blocking breaks down .
Not surprisingly , if we combine the zone runs with a shotgun look , the numbers get even better . Of course , a 22 yard play helps this small sample size . Really , though it 's also meant to show the improvement in the under center runs as well . 2.67 YPC may not seem like much , but consider that on the other 5 runs from under center we totaled -1 yards . The only non-zone rushing play that went for more than 1 yard came out of 11 personnel .
Then , there 's this chart which includes all runs - zone and gap . In a linear fashion , YPC gets incrementally worse than more blockers are added . Note that I 've included Chris Spencer as a tight end in these numbers when he lined up off the tackle . Also worth noting that I think bringing Chris Spencer in only as a blocker for 7 snaps shows an almost tragic disconnect between what Whiz would like to run , and what we should be running .
Finding Space
All of this is a long winded way of saying that we need to do our best create an environment for Sankey to find space on his own . Insistence on being reliant on well executed blocking in a specific gap will continue to be an uphill battle . Inviting extra defenders into the blocking surface , even with matched numbers , is also a recipe for continued frustration .
Instead , we 'd be wise to understand our flaws . We 're inconsistent with leverage , and struggle getting people off the ball at times . Still , we are athletic and have no problem with movement . This is the exact reason you run zone in the first place . If the blockers excel at point of attack , great . Press the hole . But , if they do n't , the back still has options . For Sankey , he 's shown the ability to correctly identify those options decisively .
I think the Titans found a good back in Sankey . At times , he 's flashing special talent , but you 've got to put him in the environment that puts that on display . As the Titans press on , I hope to see more of Sankey running in a zone scheme in space . If the Titans make that a focal point of this offense , a lot of other things could begin to fall in line .
How the Oilers left Houston and set the stage for the Texans
The Texans are preparing to enter their 15th season , but they would have never existed if the Oilers and owner Bud Adams had n't picked up and moved in 1997 after failing to get the city of Houston to build them a new stadium .
The tumultuous times led to Adams getting the new stadium he wanted in Nashville , Tenn. , then one of the country 's fastest-growing cities , and set the stage for Bob McNair to finally getting the NFL franchise he had coveted .
Adams ' disenchantment with Houston began in 1994 , the worst possible time . The Oilers fell from a 12-4 AFC Central champion in 1993 to 2-14 the next year , the biggest one-season plunge in NFL history .
It was the worst possible time for Adams to get political and business support for a new , multipurpose downtown stadium to replace the decrepit Astrodome .

Adams first became disillusioned with the Astrodome and his landlord , the parent company of the Astros , in 1993 . As a member of the NFL 's finance committee , he was privy to everything St. Louis was offering the Rams to relocate from Los Angeles .
Adams studied the sweetheart deal the Rams were offered and considered the sky-high rent he was paying for the Astrodome , which needed millions in renovation .
Adams wanted a deal similar to what the Rams received to start playing in St. Louis in 1995 . He told his right-hand man , executive vice president Mike McClure , to get a better deal from the Astros . When the Astros refused , Adams told McClure to look around for a city willing to build him a new stadium .
Adams was told about Baltimore building a new stadium to replace the Colts . He did n't want to fly that far for home games . Then he was informed about Nashville , a city of 500,000 and a television market that ranked 33rd compared with Houston 's 11th .
Nashville built a new downtown arena and pursued the New Jersey Devils of the NHL . The Devils got a new deal to stay at home .
Nashville mayor Phil Bredesen , a visionary who knew little about football , realized what a boon an NFL franchise would be to his city and state . He convinced Adams to sign an exclusive negotiating agreement . If Nashville gave Adams everything he wanted before the agreement expired , the Oilers would relocate .
At that point , Houston 's political and business leaders turned on Adams , who was an unpopular owner to begin with . In 1987 , he had threatened to move to Jacksonville , Fla. , unless the Astrodome was expanded . The county approved the expansion of 7,500 seats .
Houston 's late mayor , Bob Lanier , knew the only way he would n't win a final term in a landslide was to join Adams ' efforts to get public money . He led the anti-Adams brigade whose numbers grew by the day .
Local media , ignited by the Chronicle and Post , blasted Adams and urged Lanier not to give in . There was never a referendum to see what the public wanted .
`` You 've got warring parties on all sides , '' McClure said . `` Powerful egos are at play . To sum it up , it 's a big mess . ''
The city and county 's basic message to Adams , who offered to contribute $ 85 million if the public would provide the rest for a $ 280 million stadium : `` Do n't let the door hit your backside on your way out of town . ''
Many thought Adams would never leave . The Oilers ' lease did n't expire until after the 1997 season .
While Adams waited , Bredensen was proactive and had to convince Davidson County voters to approve $ 80 million in bonds to get the football rolling on a new $ 292 million downtown stadium as well as a practice facility and relocation fees . The referendum passed 59 to 41 percent .
`` People who never voted for anything came out to vote for this , '' said Dave Cooley , who organized the `` Yes for Nashville '' campaign .
At that point , Houston officials began to realize they were going to lose the Oilers .
`` This was really the last frontier on our expansion list , '' Adams said .
NFL owners still had to vote . Commissioner Paul Tagliabue tried to convince Adams to remain in Houston , but it was too late . The owners approved the move 23-6-1 .
`` This is an historic move for all of us , '' Tagliabue said . `` We 're the first major sports franchise in Tennessee . ''
Voting against the move were Buffalo , Cincinnati , Minnesota , the New York Giants , Pittsburgh and Washington . Oakland abstained .
`` The academic analysts who point out you ca n't justify a new stadium in economic terms , well , they 're right , '' Bredensen said . `` But there are so many intangible reasons , and in our case , we were also able to totally renovate an eyesore on the other side of the river ( for the new stadium ) .
`` Nashville will now be known more broadly now . We have been well-known for a city of our size because of our music , but this was a chance to round out that image . ''
There was a well-publicized rally downtown to save the Oilers . It was poorly promoted by fans , and only a handful showed up . The media used it as an example of how few still cared about the Oilers .
Despite the circumstances , the Oilers still had to play in Houston because of their lease . Jeff Fisher , who was named interim coach in 1994 , coached two full seasons in Houston .
Adams bought out the last year of his rent . In 1996 , their last season at the Dome , the Oilers played before small crowds but finished 8-8 , including 6-2 on the road .
In June of 1997 , the Oilers made the move . In their first season in Nashville , they played home games at the Liberty Bowl in Memphis . In 1998 , they played home games at Vanderbilt Stadium before moving into their current home in 1999 , the year they were renamed the Titans and the season they went to the franchise 's only Super Bowl .
`` It was never my intention to leave , '' said Adams , who passed away in 2013 . `` I did n't want to pull up anchor , but I could n't remain competitive while leasing from a baseball owner ( Drayton McLane Jr. ) .
`` Nobody listened to me . How soon people forget . Now the city and county are looking into building facilities for all three sports . ''
After the Oilers left , the Astros ( Minute Maid Park ) and Rockets ( Toyota Center ) got new homes downtown . When McNair was awarded his expansion franchise for Houston , Reliant Stadium was built for the Texans .
All owe a debt to Adams .
After the Oilers left , Houston waited eight years for the NFL to return in 2002 when the Texans beat Dallas in a prime-time game signaling pro football was back in H-Town .
Yes , The Big Banks DO Care If We Move Our Money
650,000 customers moved $ 4.5 billion dollars out of the big banks and into smaller banks and credit unions in the last month .
But there is a myth making the rounds that the big banks do n't really care if we move our money . For example , one line of reasoning is that no matter how many people move their money , the Fed and Treasury will just bail out the giants again .
But many anecdotes show that the too big to fails do , in fact , care .
Initially , of course , if the big banks really did n't care , they would n't have prevented protesters from closing their accounts .
NBC notes that – in response to inquiries regarding how many people have moved their money – Bank of America refused to provide figures , and instead sent the following defensive email :
“ Bank of America continues to be a great place for customers to manage their everyday finances and achieve their savings goals , ” [ Colleen Haggerty , a spokeswoman for Bank of America 's Southern California operations ] said in an email . “ We offer customers more choice and convenience , including industry-leading fraud protection , access to thousands of banking centers and ATMs , and the best online and mobile banking , which allow customers to bank on their terms 24/7 . ”
A writer noted at Daily Kos :
At Wells Fargo , my sister walked up to the teller and politely asked to close her account . The teller said , “ No problem. ” She pulled up her account and saw the balance and told her that due to the amount she had to speak with the branch manager . The branch manager came out . He was probably 30 years old and was very arrogant . He asked my sister why she wanted to close her account and my sister told him she thought Wells Fargo was part of the problem with the economy . He went thru some talking points about why she should n't move her money , but my sister did n't back down . When he asked her where she was going she told him that she would be banking at the North Carolina State Employees Credit Union . She is n't a state employee , but anyone can join if you are related to a state employee . It turns out her husband is . Anyway , the bankster told her “ You 'll be back . Credit unions ca n't provide the services you need. ” We 'll see about that . She withdrew over $ 200k from Wells Fargo . Next we went to Bank of America . I closed my last account with hardly any questions asked . Of course , I had taken most of my money out so there was n't much left to take . My sister on the other hand had a large balance in multiple accounts . They actually refused to cut her a check for the full amounts . They only gave her 1/3 of her money and told her she 'd have to come back to withdraw the rest . They claimed they were only allowed to make checks for a certain amount , and that they had no authority to cut additional checks on the same day . Stupid BofA . She had her check in hand and politely told off the branch manager when he told her she had to come back another day or two to withdraw the rest . At BofA , we were n't the only ones closing accounts . There was a line of people . Most had small accounts because they were n't even being challenged , but she actually had to wait in line to speak with a branch manager . At SunTrust , the branch manager went off his rocker . He just kept asking her “ is there anything I can do or anything I can say to change your mind ? ” He asked probably twenty times . He even offered to have the market executive meet with her and hear out her concerns . She told him she was n't interested . He really looked nervous about it .
And a writer at Daily Bail pointed out :
I went in , asked to speak with a banker and was seated in an office . When the young associate came in and asked the purpose of my visit , I handed her my ATM card and requested that she tell me the balance . When she did , I then asked for a cashiers check in that amount . That 's when things got wonky . She froze , stumbled over her words and asked why I needed that amount ( It was not a small sum ) . This gave me an opportunity to explain that although I personally would not be affected by their new fees I know plenty of friends and family that would feel the pain . In solidarity with them , I wished to close the account and move on . She unwittingly suggested that if I just use my debit card once a month then there would be no fee . That was good for a belly laugh from me , then I again requested the balance to be issued to me in the form of a cashier 's check . She then told me that there would be a $ 10 fee for this service . Another laugh . I guess it did n't sink in when I told her that I was fee adverse . There was an easy work-around anyway – I requested the cash . That finished my time with this associate banker as the amount I was requesting was “ well past ” her daily limit for withdrawals . I asked if there would be an issue with securing the cash and she said “ I honestly do n't know if we have that here ” and walked out to get the branch manager . The manager was pleasant enough and very direct . After introducing herself she flat out asked “ What can we do to change your mind ? ” “ We do n't want to see you go ” she emphasized . This opened a door for me to further explain my decision to leave the bank and why I was doing it . Amazingly , it did not fall on deaf ears . She indicated that understood where I was coming from and actually showed genuine surprise at some of the facts I provided her about the less than consumer friendly policies and machinations of her employer . She did make some feeble counter-arguments and repeatedly asked me if I would change my mind ( with a hint of desperation ! ) . I stood firm and by the end of our conversation she asked if I would be willing to put it all in writing so she could send it up the chain . She shared that management is nervous , they are seeing money leaking out of the bank and realize that they have made mistakes… . They are also aware of the growing momentum behind the November 5th move your money movement . * * * Management is aware that people are angry ( how could they not be ! ) and have put an ear to the ground .
Hundreds of similar stories are being told all over America .
Even though the government may keep throwing money at the dinosaurs , the Basel regulations do have some capital requirements , and so the big banks need to bring in some actual deposits to fund their casino gambling .
Moreover , if too many depositors leave , the illusion that the big banks are serving the American public will be burst , and a critical mass of consciousness will occur , so that the banks ' unquestioned control over the American political and financial systems will start to be questioned .
So moving our money is an effective step towards reclaiming America .
The first images from the set of 007 's latest adventure , Spectre , have arrived – with Daniel Craig skulking around Sölden in Austria
The first footage and official image from the set of James Bond 's 24th adventure , Spectre , have been released .
Daniel Craig , in his fourth outing as the British spy , is shown gadding about in the Sölden region of the Austrian Alps , firing a pistol ( not a Walther ! ) at non-specific baddies . As it is compulsory in any snowbound Bond setting , there are snowmobiles .
Associate producer Gregg Wilson promises that Austria will be the site of “ one of the major action sequences of the movie , a jewel in the crown so to speak . It 's going to be spectacular. ” Some of the most memorable scenes from Bond films have been alpine , from the union jack parachute jump in The Spy Who Loved Me to Blofeld 's lair in On Her Majesty 's Secret Service . The sleek glass exterior of the mountaintop hideaway pictured in the Spectre footage suggests a similar base .
Léa Seydoux , one of two female leads , alongside Monica Bellucci , is pictured in regulation Bond babe furs . “ I 'm nervous , but really excited , ” she says . Dave Bautista meanwhile , whose burliness surely has him earmarked as some kind of henchman , has apparently “ never been on a mountain before … it 's surreal , it looks like a painting ” .
The Bond team has since moved on to new pastures , and are now filming in England , as a recent tweet from the set shows .

Spectre will be released on 6 November . It also stars Bond newcomers Christopher Waltz and Andrew Scott alongside MI6 regulars Ralph Fiennes , Naomi Harris and Ben Whishaw . Sam Mendes is once again at the helm following his work on Skyfall , which became the most successful Bond film of the franchise .
On Monday night , the Kennesaw City Council ( in Georgia ) voted down a proposed Islamic center located in a strip mall… but even that was an obstacle in itself :
… when the time came , Kennesaw Mayor Mark Matthews had trouble getting the council to take a vote at all . No member would second the motion to proceed . After several very awkward pauses , the council finally voted . Four of the five members voted “ no ” .
Why would they say no when the Muslims fulfilled all the requirements of any group looking to acquire the space ? Council member Debra Williams ( below ) made clear this had nothing to do with anti-Islamic prejudice :
Williams said she voted against the application because she did not think a religious center should operate inside a retail shopping center . “ I believe it 's a retail space . It 's as plain and simple as that , ” Williams said .
Yet Williams and all four other council members voted unanimously in July to allow a Pentecostal church in a retail center when the council approved Redeemed Christian Fellowship Church to use a 4,000 square-foot unit in a center on the corner of Ben King Road and Cherokee Street .
Well… okay . I guess that makes some sense . She 's a woman of principle and she 's stickin–
Ah . Now I get it…
The rules do n't apply to Christians because they 're Christians . If the Muslims were Christians , then they 'd be approved , too . See ? ! The solution is that simple .
There are no plans to file a lawsuit against the city council , but the Muslim group 's lawyer is advising them to take that step . I 'd fully support them if they did .

The announcement of Disney Infinity 3.0 was very much focused towards the introduction of a new product line ‘ Star Wars ' to the Disney Infinity world . Whilst this is absolutely fantastic news , there has been a vast amount of fans with questions which need answering . There has been very little information regarding the development & improvements that Disney Interactive and the third party development agencies have made over the past year as well as what we should be expecting from both Disney Infinity 3.0 Originals & Marvel .
With that being said , we have tried to get as much information as possible regarding the Disney Infinity 3.0 Toy Boxes to help answer any and all questions you may have . You can also see our guide to Disney Infinity 3.0 here as well as our guide to the Disney Infinity 3.0 Play Sets here .
Also , if you are looking to preorder Disney Infinity 3.0 you can do so right here .
OK , so let 's begin – what do we know !
Firstly , there is going to be an array of new features within the Toy Box 3.0 world , which include :
4 New Toy Box Game Discs
2 New Toy Box Game Modes a.k.a Toy Box Expansion Games
Let 's start with the 4 Toy Box Game Discs , these are :
Toy Box Speedway – a racing game . Toy Box Takeover – an all-in-one game where you must defeat enemies across multiple levels and multiple worlds . Villain Takeover – new ‘ Escape from the Kyln ' game . Unknown Title – new ‘ Assault on Asgard ' game .
Toy Box Speedway
Basically , we are getting a racing game within Disney Infinity ( how cool is that ? ) . Your probably thinking , well what is the point considering how poor the driving controls were in Disney Infinity 1.0 & 2.0 , well I 'd agree however Disney Interactive brought on board Sumo Digital to help completely revamp driving gameplay and build a whole new game within the Toy Box .
Within the game there are three cups , which feature three racing tracks and different engine classes . As well as this there are also Time Trails & Battle Races ( including missiles , mines and much more ) and lastly a ‘ Skate Park ' style arena .
All in all , this looks like an absolutely brilliant expansion for Toy Box 3.0 and definitely one which I am very excited about . To me it sounds a little like Crash Bandicoot Kart meets Mario Kart meets Disney Infinity !
Toy Box Takeover
There is very little known about the Toy Box takeover so far , to be honest it sounds very similar to the Villain Takeover so we will wait for more information to be released .
Villain Takeover
The scene is set after Syndrome takes control of the Toy Box world and begins creating mashup worlds with the Toy Box wand where enemies from each and every franchise come at you . Whilst defeating the enemies you will earn special rewards , giant et pieces such as the Trash Compactor from Star Wars as well as unique sidekicks .
To be totally honest , I absolutely loved to Escape from the Kyln so there is no doubt I will absolutely love this as well !
Unknown Title
This will be replacing the Assault on Asgard Toy Box Game Disc , however very little is known about this game , so we shall await more information .
Toy Box Game Mode : Farming
As bizarre as it initially sounded to me when reading the official press release and exclusive news from GameInformer that Disney Interactive have created a completely new gaming mode for ‘ Farming ' it actually sounds pretty darn sweet and possibly addictive !
What is the farming game mode ?
It is basically a Toy Box game where you can create your own farm and plant your own crops to grow , as well as build your own village . For each crop you plant and then feed to your sidekick you will be able to boost their stats . You will also be able to get food from Play Sets and other areas within the game , but it does sound pretty cool to be able to grow your own crops and build a village around your farm .
Your first seed , grows in to a unique surprise for each player
A very cool feature of the Toy Box farming game mode is the initial setup , when you begin your journey to becoming a fully fledged farmer you are given one single plot of land and a seed to plant . Once that seed has grown it will produce a surprise for each player , this could be a flower , a weed or maybe , jut maybe something awesome ! There are over 20 types of food available for you to harvest and these vary from corn to cotton candy to mickey pop ! Each type of food will give your sidekick various stat increases , as well as taking varied time to grow in your farm .
Overall the Toy Box Farm Mode seems pretty exciting but it would be extremely useful to see a live video of Disney Infinity farming in action , hopefully that will come soon though !

Whereas a lot of game developer turns to Kickstarter to help their projects become a reality , Borealys Games is hoping that crowdfunding can help its game reach the finish line in better shape than it otherwise would .
Borealys is at work on Mages of Mystralia , which I recently got to play at PAX East and walked away very impressed with . Think of it as a Zelda-style game in which the core mechanic is a spell-crafting system with a huge range of possibilities . ( You can see some of the wild spells you can create in the video above . ) It also boasts a story from Ed Greenwood , who created the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms world , and a soundtrack by Shota Nakama , who worked on Final Fantasy XV 's score .
Mystralia is nearing its completion and is due out the second quarter ( which runs from April through June ) . Today , Borealys launched a Kickstarter campaign for a fairly modest amount : $ 25,000 CAD , or $ 18,787 in the US . One of its goals is to facilitate a beta that will be used to improve the game and iron out any lingering issues . As business manager Dan Adelman told GameSpot at PAX East , the type of game-breaking spells Borealys wants to stomp out are those that prevent the game from being played , not those that allow you to one-hit kill a boss .
`` If someone can come up with a spell that can do that -- like , they think it through and they figured out how to do that , then more power to them , '' Adelman explained . `` But that 's why we 're doing a lot of beta testing . Since there are potentially millions of spells you can make , we want to see if there is something that 's really game-breaking . Being able to one-shot kill a boss is n't really game-breaking if they thought it through . That 's kind of the game : can I outsmart the game ? But if by doing a spell , you can bypass an entire area [ where ] you needed this thing and you did n't realize that , that would n't be fun . ''
The Kickstarter campaign will also feature stretch goals to add new features to the game , though the first of these wo n't be revealed until tomorrow , March 17 . The studio said it has new game modes it intends to implement post-launch but that the Kickstarter could help to get them released more quickly .
`` Recently , there have been several Kickstarter campaigns that have raised an amount of funding to prove that the concept is viable , but then seek publisher or outside investor support for what they really need , '' Borealys explained in the Kickstarter . `` We are taking the opposite approach . We built our proof-of-concept , got investment , and made our game . It is fully playable beginning to end , and many would consider it complete .
`` But as we 've observed our playtesters and gotten feedback , we 've generated a ton of ideas that would not take too long to implement but have the power to take this game to the next level . Adding all of those little tweaks and extra polish will only add a couple months to our schedule , so for a relatively modest sum , we can have a huge impact . ''
Borealys is n't the first developer to take this approach with Kickstarter -- Subset Games did something similar with FTL toward the end of its development .
The low-end for Kickstarter tiers comes in at about $ 19 , which gets you beta access and a copy of the game for PC , PS4 , or Xbox One . However , the beta -- which launches immediately after the campaign wraps up -- will be PC-only .
After launching earlier today , the Kickstarter has raised just over $ 4,000 USD of its goal as of this writing . It runs for the next month , ending on April 15 .
Doctor Who : The Complete Series Six comes out on DVD on Tuesday . And here 's your exclusive first look at one of the five never-before-seen mini-episodes on the disc !
It 's weirdly Doctor Seuss-like , what with the goldfish and the top hat and a bizarre plot twist that we wo n't spoil here .

If , by some chance , you 've wondered why we love Steven Moffat 's clever-pants dialogue and rapidfire storytelling , then the five brief mini-stories that are included as extras on the Doctor Who is a Series Six DVD set should provide an ample reminder . They 're collective called `` Night and the Doctor , '' and the first four of them show what the Doctor gets up to when his companions are asleep aboard the TARDIS .
The new bonus scenes also layer in some much-needed character development for Amy Pond — including an on-screen reference to her two wildly different sets of childhood memories . And there 's some absolutely lovely River Song moments as well .

All in all , the Doctor Who is a Series Six DVD set is a nice addition to any fan 's collection — apart from the five new vignettes , there are all the Doctor Who Confidentials , detailing the making of each of the season 's episodes , plus a bonus Confidential about the making of the extra new scenes . There are also five `` episode prequels , '' which were released on the BBC 's website before each episode , and the two Comic Relief sketches from last year , `` Space '' and `` Time . '' Then there are four `` Monster Files '' which provide basic info about the Silence , the Gangers and other monsters .
The commentary tracks are nice , especially Neil Gaiman explaining just which bits of `` The Doctor 's Wife '' were added by Steven Moffat . ( And apparently , Idris getting the `` soul '' of the TARDIS put into her happened much later in Gaiman 's original script , so we got to know Idris as a person before she became the embodiment of the TARDIS . )
For some reason , we 're never getting actual deleted scenes from recent Doctor Who episodes on DVD any more , which seems odd since there must be some .

Watching bits of the sixth season all over again , its inventiveness and cleverness remain paramount — and a few episodes , like `` The Doctor 's Wife '' and `` The God Complex , '' stand out as instant classics . Moffat 's writing remains as funny and as whiz-bang clever as always — although this season 's storyline , including Amy 's captive pregnancy , River Song 's messed-up childhood , and the plot to assassinate the Doctor , does n't seem any more satisfying or fully realized the second time around , from a character standpoint . It 's all fun stuff , as long as you do n't worry too much about Amy and River as plausible characters .
The other thing that jumps out at me , rewatching these episodes , is how much everything revolves around the Doctor now . The only reason the Silence and Madame Kovarian are even out there doing their evil stuff is because they believe the Doctor will answer a question that could trigger a horrible prophecy . Even with all the `` universe in jeopardy '' stuff , the main threat of the season is the Doctor 's death , and the most interesting stuff is always about how people view the Doctor . Contrast that with the Davies era , where you got the impression the Daleks would still be trying to parboil the universe even if the Doctor never bothered to show up . Moffat has turned the show into an examination of how the Doctor fits into his universe , and as a result , the stories revolve around the Doctor — as primary cause for everything that happens — like almost never before .
One thing 's clear : This is one of the most unusual , and structurally ambitious , eras in Doctor Who 's history , and watching the season six DVDs , you get a better sense of the scope of it .
President Trump 's executive orders on the Mexican border and the temporary ban on immigration from seven countries that are hotbeds of jihad terror have the Left in an uproar that increases in hysteria by the minute , proving once again that the Left will be satisfied with national suicide and national suicide only – not anything less .
What has the Left so enraged is a simple declaration of an intention to protect and defend the United States . Trump 's executive order states that it is designed “ to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States. ” How dare he ! It adds : “ The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism . ”
It 's racism ! The Nation published an article entitled , “ How to Fight Trump 's Racist Immigration Policies. ” Bigotry ! The Detroit Free Press editorialized : “ Immigrant , refugee ban reflects fear , bigotry. ” Islamophobia ! Vox informed us that “ Trump says his refugee ban is about protecting America . It 's really about Islamophobia . ”
Here is the substance of that racism , bigotry and Islamophobia , straight from the executive order :
The United States can not , and should not , admit those who do not support the Constitution , or those who would place violent ideologies over American law . In addition , the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred ( including “ honor ” killings , other forms of violence against women , or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own ) or those who would oppress Americans of any race , gender , or sexual orientation .
So acting to prevent people who have no intention of obeying American law and approve of honor killings , other violence against women , and the persecution of non-Muslims and gays is such an outrage that Leftists have begun nationwide protests . Meanwhile , in response to a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , federal judge Ann Donnelly on Saturday night issued an emergency stay , barring U.S. officials from deporting people who were being detained at airports . According to CBS News , “ the order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq , Syria , Iran , Sudan , Libya , Somalia and Yemen . It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application . ”
However , it did n't cover those who had not yet made the trip . The Department of Homeland Security announced on Sunday morning that it would “ continue to enforce all of President Trump 's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people . President Trump 's Executive Orders remain in place—prohibited travel will remain prohibited , and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety . President Trump 's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers , and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America 's borders and national security . ”
Trump was n't backing down , either , despite the Left 's treating this executive order as if it were the second coming of Auschwitz and Dachau . White House chief of staff Reince Priebus defended the executive order on Sunday on “ Face the Nation ” : “ This is not a Muslim ban . All this is is identifying the seven countries -- and the reason we chose those seven countries is those were the seven countries that both the Congress and the Obama administration identified as being the seven countries that were most identifiable with dangerous terrorism taking place in their country . You can point to other countries that have similar problems like Pakistan and others -- perhaps we need to take it further . But for now , immediate steps , pulling the Band-Aid off , is to do further vetting for people traveling in and out of those countries . ”
Priebus added : “ This was a promise that President Trump had made and it 's a promise that he 's going to keep . And he 's not willing to be wrong on this subject -- we need to do our best to be vigilant and protect Americans . ”
That is what makes President Trump , after just over a week in office , the recipient of even more hatred from the Left than George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan . And they 're just getting started .
Sony 's Fluster Cluck Is a Real Thing , PS4 Exclusive with Couch Multiplayer ; Screenshots and Info Shared
Giuseppe Nelva June 6 , 2014 8:00:58 AM EST
A couple weeks ago we unveiled the tradermark “ Fluster Cluck ” filed by Sony DADC , sparking speculation and hilarity about the use of such a strange and a little mischievous name .
Today the company sent in a press release finally explaining what it is about . It 's indeed a game , and unexpectedly it 's also a PS4 exclusive by Sony DADC 's internal studio LOOT entertainment .
The press release gives a brief explanation of the game 's backstory and features :
Fluster Cluck takes players on an out-of-this-world , cosmic adventure riddled with fast-paced challenges , unusual intergalactic beings , and quite a few flusters to keep gamers coming back for more . Players come to the aid of two lowly Chikkin Koop employees , Pimento and Cornichon , to help them “ chikkinize ” everything in sight in hopes of realizing their dream of being promoted to middle-management . The fast-paced time-trial , action shooter game features single and multi-player modes that have players gathering resources by abducting cows , camels , zombies , and battling enemies as they strive to unlock new equipment and climb the corporate ladder .
We also learn that the game will be released on the PSN for PS4 this summer , and will be playable at E3 exclusively at the Nyko booth .
LOOT Entertainment Managing Director David Sterling accompanied the announcement with a comment , also explaining that the game will feature couch multiplayer involving up to four players on top of its single player campaign :

In addition to an engaging single player campaign , Fluster Cluck also features a riotous local multiplayer mode for up to four players which will have gamers smacking the ‘ cluck ' out of each other , both on screen and off .
If you 're unfamiliar with LOOT Entertainment , it 's a team of developers at Sony DADC New Media Solutions that gathers people from Sony Computer Entertainment , Treyarch and Elctronic Arts . Before working on Fluster Cluck , they have sharpened their development fangs on experience for PlayStation Home .
Below you can see the first four screenshots and pieces of artwork of the game , that show its simple but cutesy graphics and the split-screen multiplayer feature .
Austria announces UN General Assembly resolution to prohibit nuclear weapons in 2017
September 22 , 2016
Austria 's foreign minister , Sebastian Kurz , announced on Wednesday that his country would join other UN member states in tabling a resolution next month to convene negotiations on a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons in 2017 .
Speaking in the high-level debate of the UN General Assembly in New York , he said that “ experience shows that the first step to eliminate weapons of mass destruction is to prohibit them through legally binding norms ” .
The announcement follows a landmark recommendation last month by a UN working group in Geneva for the General Assembly to convene a conference in 2017 to negotiate “ a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons , leading towards their total elimination ” .
The Austrian-sponsored resolution would take forward this recommendation by establishing a formal mandate for negotiations . The deadline for tabling the resolution in the General Assembly 's First Committee , which deals with disarmament matters , is 13 October .
Following the tabling , nations will debate the resolution , then vote on whether to adopt it in the final week of October or first week of November . A second , confirmatory vote will take place in a plenary session of the General Assembly early in December .
ICAN warmly welcomes Austria 's announcement . “ This is a major breakthrough in global efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons . The resolution will be of enormous historical importance , ” said Beatrice Fihn , executive director of ICAN .
“ The proposed treaty will place nuclear weapons on the same legal footing as other weapons of mass destruction , which have long been prohibited under international law . It will be a major step towards the goal of elimination , ” she said .
In 2014 Austria hosted an intergovernmental conference on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons , at which it launched a diplomatic pledge , supported by 127 nations , “ to fill the legal gap for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons ” .
Excerpt from Austria 's statement :
“ In a world that is less and less secure and faced with more and more tensions between big powers , nuclear disarmament remains the number one unfinished business . The recent nuclear tests by DPRK [ North Korea ] should be a warning signal . We all agree that the humanitarian consequences of the explosion of nuclear weapons would be unacceptable , and therefore we have to finally get rid of all these nuclear weapons . Experience shows that the first step to eliminate weapons of mass destruction is to prohibit them through legally binding norms . Together with other member states , Austria will table a draft resolution to convene negotiations on a legally binding comprehensive instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons in 2017 . ”

In June of 2016 , the nation erupted in outrage after Brock Turner—a Stanford student who had been convicted of multiple felonies after sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster—was sentenced to a mere six months in county jail . After the sentencing , millions of horrified people read a statement from his victim , who has chosen to remain anonymous , in which she described the impact the assault had on her life : “ My independence , natural joy , gentleness , and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition , ” she said . “ I became closed off , angry , self deprecating , tired , irritable , empty . ”
But Aaron Persky , the judge who presided over the case , seemed to have reserved most of his pity for Turner . “ A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him , ” he said at the sentencing . “ I think he will not be a danger to others. ” This , it seems , was not an isolated case . The day of Turner 's sentencing , Persky sentenced Ming Hsuan Chiang , a man who had pleaded “ no contest ” to beating his ex-girlfriend , to just 12 weekends in county jail . During the week , Chiang would be free to continue his job as an engineer in Silicon Valley ; his victim , a Chinese immigrant in her 30s , testified that she 'd been subjected to “ torture ” at his hands . And in 2011 , Persky presided over a high-profile gang rape civil lawsuit , during which he allowed the defense to introduce photos of the plaintiff scantily dressed in order to disprove her claim that she suffered from PTSD as a result of the alleged assault .
Troubled by these rulings , a group of volunteers started gathering signatures to recall the judge from the bench this summer . “ Aaron Persky gave too lenient a sentence to Brock Turner , a former Stanford Swimmer convicted of sexual assault , ” the campaign committee wrote on its website RecallAaronPersky.com . “ Persky is unfit to sit on the bench , and as long as he is a judge , predators in Santa Clara County will know they have an ally on the bench. ” ( Other than a brief statement—in which he pointed out his job “ is to consider both sides ” —released in June , Persky has been largely silent about the recall effort , ignoring requests for comment from the media . )
If the effort is successful , Santa Clara County voters will get the opportunity to decide in a June 2018 election if they want Persky to remain in that role , or if they 'd rather choose someone else . By early January , under the California constitution , the campaign will need to garner 58,634 signatures—or 20 percent of the votes cast for the judge in the last election—a number they 've already surpassed . Now , they 're aiming for 90,000 to discourage against any petition challenges .
Perksy 's challengers are determined , but they face an uphill battle : According to the Mercury News , only two recall efforts in the state have ever been successful—one in 1913 , for a judge reducing the bail of a defendant charged with felony assault of a 16-year-old girl , and another in 1932 , in which three judges were recalled for using their positions to benefit financially .
“ Persky is unfit to sit on the bench , and as long as he is a judge , predators in Santa Clara County will know they have an ally on the bench . ”
As the deadline for the recall campaign to submit its signatures gets closer , one important question looms : Who could replace Judge Persky ? Earlier this year , Cindy Hendrickson , who has been an assistant district attorney in Santa Clara County for more than 20 years , became the first person to announce her candidacy for Superior Court judge . If she wins , she 'll serve out the rest of Persky 's six-year term , which ends in 2022 . ( To prepare for the election , Persky has reportedly hired a political consultant who worked on Donald Trump 's presidential campaign . )
“ I 'm really excited to be able to continue my passion [ for public service ] … to be a part of ensuring the judicial system in Santa Clara County is not only actually unbiased and fair but that that 's the perception that it has as well , ” Hendrickson tells Broadly over the phone . “ And I will work every day to foster and maintain that perception , because I think it 's so important . ”
Hendrickson says she was n't interested in running for Superior Court judge at first , but she changed her mind once supporters of the recall effort came to her . “ I initially said no because I am happy doing what I 'm doing , but then I gave it some more thought , and I really felt like I was uniquely qualified ” for the position , she says . “ When you have tens of thousands of people that have expressed the concern that one of their judges is biased , and they 're using the tools of democracy to try to unseat him , I think they absolutely need to have the right to follow that procedure to the end . ”
Hendrickson wo n't comment on whether she actually thinks Persky should be recalled , citing the California Code of Judicial Ethics , but there 's no denying the fact that Hendrickson 's record working on behalf of victims of domestic and sexual violence would serve as a good antidote to Persky 's recent failures . As an executive member of District Attorney Jeff Rosen 's administration , Hendrickson oversees the Family Violence Division , and in 2015 she helped start the San Jose Family Justice Center , where victims of domestic violence can get assistance .
One of the things Hendrickson finds most meaningful about prosecuting cases , especially those involving sexual assault , is being able to help victims navigate the often intimidating and emotionally taxing experience that is going to court . “ We wanted to make sure [ victims ] felt involved in the process—that they understood what was going on , that they did n't feel like it was something else that was happening to them , ” Hendrickson says . As an assistant district attorney , she works on behalf of the people of the state of California , not necessarily a plaintiff . But , she continues , “ we wanted them to feel like they were a part of the system—even though I would carefully explain to them that they were n't my client , and I would n't always be making decisions they agreed with because I did have this obligation to the public and to do what was right for the community . ”
In addition to her extensive professional qualifications , Hendrickson says her upbringing in a large , multiracial family shaped her perspective as a prosecutor . She 's the third oldest of 10 children—six biological and five adopted—and though Hendrickson and her parents are white , she has Korean , Vietnamese , and black siblings . “ Growing up in my diverse family has helped me to see the world through the eyes of many different people , including those who do n't look like me , and I think that broader lens has enhanced my ability to be thoughtful and kind in making decisions that affect other people 's lives , ” she says .
“ When you have tens of thousands of people that have expressed the concern that one of their judges is biased , and they 're using the tools of democracy to try to unseat him , I think they absolutely need to have the right to follow that procedure to the end . ”
“ I understand that the appearance of bias can be as hurtful as actual bias , ” she continues , careful to speak generally in order to avoid commenting on Persky 's record . “ You ca n't do anything about bias if you 're not aware of it . People who 've grown up in communities lacking diversity are not bad people , ” she insists . “ They 're just not aware of other people 's experiences , and so it 's harder to be sensitive to other people 's experiences when that 's not part of your reality . ”
Therein lies the whole reason why activists are demanding Persky 's removal—the lenient sentence he gave Turner , they say , revealed a troubling bias against women . That 's especially problematic in a culture where victims of sexual violence already hesitate to engage in the criminal justice system : Why undergo the emotional burden of facing one 's attacker at a trial and risk retraumatization when it appears , in Persky 's courtroom anyway , the punishment will be nothing short of a slap on the wrist ? The legal system already fails victims over and over again without a judge who apparently feels that probation is an appropriate punishment for rape .
To anti-sexual violence activists , Hendrickson 's candidacy for Superior Court judge is pivotal—not only for the people of Santa Clara County , but also in this current cultural moment , where women are standing up against the status quo and shining a light on the prevalence of gender-based discrimination . By bringing some much-needed female representation to the bench—not to mention a record that suggests she 'll be more likely to show compassion to victims—Hendrickson could help pave the way for a fairer legal system , one that actually holds abusers accountable for their actions .
MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called the Internet a CIA project and made comments about Russia 's biggest search engine Yandex , sending the company 's shares plummeting .
The Kremlin has been anxious to exert greater control over the Internet , which opposition activists — barred from national television — have used to promote their ideas and organize protests .
Russia 's parliament this week passed a law requiring social media websites to keep their servers in Russia and save all information about their users for at least half a year . Also , businessmen close to Putin now control Russia 's leading social media network , VKontakte .
Speaking Thursday at a media forum in St. Petersburg , Putin said that the Internet originally was a “ CIA project ” and “ is still developing as such . ”
To resist that influence , Putin said , Russia needs to “ fight for its interests ” online .
A Russian blogger complained to Putin that foreign websites and Yandex , the web search engine which is bigger in Russia than Google , are storing information on servers abroad , which could be undermining Russia 's security .
In his reply , Putin mentioned unspecified pressure that was exerted on Yandex in its early years and chided the company for its registration in the Netherlands “ not only for tax reasons but for other considerations , too . ”
Although Putin 's comments did n't include any specific threats to Yandex , one of Russia 's most successful tech companies , its shares plunged by 5 percent at the Nasdaq 's opening on Thursday .
In a statement Thursday , Yandex said the company got registered in the Netherlands “ solely due to the specifics of corporate law , ” not because of the low taxes there and added that its core business is based in Russia and “ practically all the taxes are paid in Russia . ”
Reacting to Putin 's claims that Yandex was under “ pressure , ” the company said it got its first investments from international funds and investors , “ which is the usual practice for any online start-up in any country . ”
Just when you think she could n't possibly get any lower , Shannon Watts took to twitter to lower the bar once again .
Yesterday , the Moms Demand founder Tweeted out my Bearing Arms article covering her lies in Teen Vogue , boasting that nothing makes her happier than lying to a bunch of teenagers who wo n't do their own research on gun owners , the NRA or Second Amendment laws :
Billionaire gun hater Michael Bloomberg will stop at nothing to wage war on gun ownership , he even recruits moms and dupes them into doing his dirty work . His number one lackey Shannon Watts has taken passion and turned into hatred and chaos . Bloomberg has turned her into an internet troll who fails to see the reality of what the NRA does , who gun owners are and what gun laws do and fail to do in America .
Watts even admitted she throws temper tantrums over the issue . Who says that ! ?
NRA TV 's Grant Stinchfield took Watts to task , saying , “ Was it just a tantrum when you attacked Kimberly Corban – a rape survivor who wants to carry a firearm to protect herself ? And where was your tantrum when Sheenan Allen was thrown in jail for carrying a legally registered handgun into New Jersey… And Ray Rice – who beat his girlfriend – got off with a wrist slap . ”

hallucinogenicminnow asked : You mention it 's not ok to upset players but to plenty of us it 's quite upsetting that we ca n't easily access and play the game competitively because of availability of cards . Should this be as much , if not more of a concern ? Magic is a game , first .
It 's a concern . It 's why things like Modern Masters and Eternal Masters even exist . We 're working to try and solve the problem . But , and this is crucial , we 're trying to do it without creating new problems .
It 's very easy to make a video or write an article and say “ Just do X ” when you do n't truly understand the repercussions of doing X .
As I said in my talk at GDC , players are excellent at identifying problems but have a harder time solving them because they 're not privy to the hundreds of issues and restrictions you have to deal with .
I hear loud and clear that there is a player issue that needs to be met and I promise you that we 're trying to figure out ways to address it . But the solutions are not simple and they 're going to take time to solve .
Tldr - We hear you . Give us time .
A POINT OF VIEW
Many innocent people are on the DNA database We hear thousands of platitudes in daily life , and many are uttered to steer us away from scrutinising questionable practices , writes Katharine Whitehorn . The great writer and journalist G.K. Chesterton once wrote that he had spent all his life finding out that platitudes were true . And maybe some of them are , though quite a few are ambiguous . `` Ne'er cast a clout till May is out '' - no-one seems to be sure whether it 's until the May tree is in bloom , or the month of May is over . But some platitudes are all wrong - `` No smoke without fire '' for instance , as any teacher smeared for life by a spiteful child knows only too well .
If your DNA 's on the police database and shows up at a crime scene , you 're a suspect right away even if you just delivered a pizza to the victim
Hear Radio 4 's A Point of View
James Smith , João Pessoa , Brazil The whole thing would be farcical if it was n't that we 're slowly becoming more and more of a police state . I hope that when it comes to the crunch , it will be millions who refuse to have anything to do with ID cards , not thousands . As for airport security , most of what the public sees is purely for show and achieves very little . It 's inconsistent between airports and sometimes checks appear to be performed based on the mood of the personnel on the day .
Dave , Cambridge , UK It is a long time since I read such nonsense , which seems to have very little fact provided to back up the assertions made . It is scare mongering of the worst kind . Is the author a `` Daily Mail '' reader ? Big Farang , St Albans DNA is no different to fingerprints . If the police find fingerprints all over a crime scene they will check to see who they belong to and why they were there , so they can eliminate all the innocent parties . Merely planting a hair at a crime scene wo n't be enough to send someone to jail , because DNA is only a small part in the investigation process , which needs to prove means , motive and opportunity . The idea that a super-criminal could commit a crime , erase all trace of their presence , and then replace that evidence with convincing evidence of another person being there , is quite frankly laughable .
Thomas , Maidstone , UK My ( least ) favourite platitude is the one that warns us that we must be protected from the `` Tyranny of the Majority '' . A moment 's reflection shows that the mathematical alternative to `` Tyranny of the Majority '' is `` Tyranny of Some Minority '' . Reading through all these infringements of our privacy and our liberty , does anyone believe that they would be approved by a majority of The People , voting in a referendum ? Of course not . But The People are not permitted to vote on it in a referendum , lest there be a `` Tyranny of the Majority '' . So we are instead tyrannised by a tiny minority of professional politicians and bureaucrats who want to collect as much information as they can about us .
Stephen , What a load of rubbish . The article is epitomised by the statement `` If your DNA is on the police database and it is found at a crime scene , then you 're a suspect even if you 've just delivered a pizza '' . I 'm afraid to say that you 're a suspect if they find your DNA or not , just for being at a crime scene . The DNA is irrelevant in such a case ! And , unfortunately , the article is flawed in so many similar ways .
Barry , Wirral What a sad , sad state of affairs this country and its people have gotten itself into . Much to say , but I 'll just say that the TV program `` Big Brother '' has been used to indoctrinate us in to thinking it 's ok to spy on people and attempts to make less of the real big brother which is coming your way soon . I 'm off . Will the last person to leave , please turn off the CTV cameras ...

I 'm sick to death of hearing about how hipsters , kids from Ohio , bearded bicyclists or any young person that 's not a mindless banker from Jersey is ruining their neighborhood .
.
Is there no room for new people in New York City ? WTF ? Stop blaming your problems on a demographic that ca n't even be defined . Just like when you generalize who “ hipsters ” are as being destructive to your old school digs , so can the generalizations of “ hard-working families ” as anyone that is n't young , cool or not fans of Dancing With The Stars just fits into that more appreciated demographic . Well , let me tell you , the “ hard-working families ” of North Brooklyn can also mean racist , homophobic , destructive , belligerant thugs and bitches that do n't blame themselves for anything and live a life not unlike those super-sized disasters that we see at Wal-Mart in Nebraska on the Internet .
.
If for every new hipster that moves to Greenpoint , a non-hipster that believes they somehow deserve 11222 residence more has to leave , then so be it . If it means for every new hipster , it 's one less non-working dirt bag that 's sleeping , barfing , shitting and screaming in my park ; one less fat-faced kid littering trash on my block without shame or parents with any care , ten feet from a trash can ; one less idiot putting half-eaten pizza and potato chips in tree pits thinking that they are doing a service for local wildlife ; one less woman beating the shit out of their kids on the bus ; one less closeted homosexual NRA nut who likes to burn out his tires while listening to raging house music from his red and white eagle stickered pickup truck ; one less hard-working family man who only shops at chain stores that put small businesses out and cause unprecedented environmental consequences so they can save pennies on their unneeded mass-produced , foreign plastic products ; one less angry dependent who thinks Brooklyn owes them something for being here longer than me ; one less middle-aged woman barely dressed , scratching lotto tickets on her stoop all day every day with my state taxes ; one less clueless neighbor who does n't understand what is actually recyclable ; one less careless parent who looks the other way while their child destroys tree branches , defaces statues with swastikas and beats up old drunks in McGolrick Park ; one less glass bottle collector that wakes up every light sleeper in the neighborhood collecting at 3am ; one less religious storekeeper that provides all the liquor , beer , porn and tobacco for the neighborhood ; one less fast-food eating , non-local food enjoying , non-local agriculture supporting meat head ; and finally , one less Manhattan Avenue junkie screaming at invisible demons while the ole ninety fourth takes a nice long break ; then so be it .
.
People have been asking me why I have loved New York for over a decade and my response has always included some line about the “ diverse cultures ” that inhabit NYC , but you know what ? Maybe I should forget that . I appreciate citizens that came from other parts of this country that could n't deal with the intolerant hilljacks of Madison County , and came to this urban bubble to collectively take over and turn it into a nature appreciating , food exploring , non-violent , generally tolerant band of new-wave hippies that do n't cause pool riots or look the other way when the fucking Exxon Valdez is under their homes . Ideally we all get along and truly enjoy each other 's company , or all find the importance of having such different views . I wrote this piece for any mainstream journalist or New Yorker on the street that has some generalized complaint about hipsters .

You 're no better , so stop hipster-hating .

Sheffield hosts hen party to help curb loneliness in older people
People living with dementia in Sheffield got the chance to interact with chickens to help improve their wellbeing and boost creativity
The HenPower event is part of the University of Sheffield 's Festival of Social Sciences funded by the Economic and Social Research Council
Academics from the University of Sheffield have teamed up with charities , Age UK Sheffield and Equal Arts to host a special event , giving people living with dementia the chance to interact with chickens in a bid to curb loneliness and encourage creativity .
The event , which is part of the wider ESRC Festival of Social Sciences funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , is the brainchild of the University of Sheffield , Age UK Sheffield and Equal Arts , who encourage creativity , the arts and activity amongst older people . Equal Arts developed HenPower , which brings older people and chickens together to combat loneliness and depression and improve wellbeing .
The aptly dubbed ‘ Hensioners ' are encouraged to hen-keep , caring for the chickens by ensuring they are fed and watered , collecting eggs and interacting with them through the creative arts , which equally benefits both hen and hensioner .
At the event , hosted at Norfolk Heritage Park in Sheffield , people living with dementia got the chance to be hensioners for the day . They met the chickens from HenPower and were able to handle them and interact with them for the morning . They also had the chance to put their artistic skills into practice and created chicken inspired art , something that Equal Arts routinely encourage .
Dr Andrea Wigfield , Director of Care Connect at the University of Sheffield said : “ Today 's event was a perfect example of how simple and easy it is to help curb loneliness in older people and those living with dementia . Here at the University of Sheffield we have some of the world leaders in social science research , many of whom conduct extensive and groundbreaking research into loneliness and wellbeing .
“ This one of a kind event is not the first time the University of Sheffield has researched and examined wellbeing and loneliness . One of the main aims of the ESRC funded Festival of Social Sciences is for people to learn more about how innovative social science is tackling the issues that individuals and societies face today through exciting and immersive events .
`` One of the most important issues societies face today is loneliness . This event was not only a positive day for all involved but will also help us examine loneliness in greater detail . ”
Douglas Hunter , Co-Director of Equal Arts , said : “ A 12-month independent study of HenPower found it reduces loneliness and depression in older people and those living with dementia . We hear regularly how bringing hen-keeping and creativity together is hugely benefiting those involved .
“ It 's amazing to have gone from such humble beginnings in one care setting in the North East to supporting thousands of older people and communities across England and globally . ”
Steve Chu , CEO of Age UK Sheffield said : “ We were delighted to bring HenPower to our Wellbeing Centre and our customers loved the event . The experience we provide to people with dementia and memory loss at the Wellbeing Centre is high quality and informed by academic research , so this was a great event to be involved in . ”
The event , funded by the Economic and Social Research Council is part of the wider ESRC Festival of Social Sciences , which hosts free events across Sheffield and gives the public a chance to immerse themselves in world leading social science research and engage with academics from across Sheffield .
The Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Sheffield has a longstanding reputation for delivering world class research and teaching . Our research addresses the major challenges facing society and our ideas are leading academic debates internationally and shaping policy and practice across the globe .
Organisers of the Man Booker prize have announced the biggest rule-change in its 45-year history with the confirmation that all English-language writers will be eligible from next year .
That means American writers such as Marilynne Robinson , Jonathan Franzen and Richard Ford can now be contenders for an award that has been restricted to citizens of the Commonwealth ( including Zimbabwe ) and the Republic of Ireland .
The prize trustees said they had consulted extensively – talking to 40 or 50 writers , readers , booksellers , publishers and agents – for 18 months before deciding on the change .
Jonathan Taylor , chairman of the trustees , said they had first thought about setting up a separate prize but were wary of jeopardising or diluting the existing one . Expansion , he said , was about reinforcing the prize 's standing as the most important literary award in the English-speaking world .
`` We are embracing the freedom of English in its versatility , its vigour , its vitality and its glory wherever it may be . We are abandoning the constraints of geography and national boundaries . ''
His fellow trustee Helena Kennedy said there were people writing novels in English in places such as China , Brazil and Israel and it was wrong that there was a kind of `` border control '' preventing writers from competing depending on what passport they carried .
The prize 's director , Ion Trewin , said trustees had been concerned about increasing the number of books judges have to read . This year it was 151 .
For that reason they will change the eligibility rules . Instead of publishers being able to submit two books it will now depend on how well they have fared in the competition previously . Publishers who have had five or more longlistings in the previous five years will be able to submit four books but that will go down to one book for a publisher with no longlistings .
For that reason they will next year change the eligibility rules . Instead of publishers being able to submit two books , it will now depend on how well they have fared in the competition previously . Publishers who have had five or more longlistings in the previous five years will be able to submit four titles ; those with three or four longlistings can submit three ; down to one submission slot for a publisher with no recent longlistings .
The central rule remains that the books must be published in the UK and judges will still be able to call books in that have not been submitted .
Concerns that winning the Booker prize will be far more challenging for UK and Commonwealth writers was a `` glass half full , half empty argument '' said Trewin , arguing that increased competition would make winning an even greater accolade .
Nevertheless , many writers have expressed disappointment at the change . Philip Hensher writes for the Guardian : `` I do n't think I 've ever heard so many novelists say , as over the last two or three days , 'Well , we might as well just give up , then . ' ``
The inclusion of all English language writers has been talked about for years but has been resisted , partly because of the problem of different publication dates in the US and UK . It was only two weeks ago that the prize 's director , Ion Trewin , told the Bookseller that the trustees were not minded to change the rules .
Taylor admitted organisers had been `` bounced into '' announcing the change early after it was leaked over the weekend but denied that it had anything to do with the emergence of the new Folio prize .
Andrew Kidd , founder of the Folio prize , said he was in some ways surprised by the announcement .
`` We ca n't help noting that the new criteria are identical to ours but , at the end of the day , there 's absolutely no reason that we ca n't both flourish . I do n't see there being any inherent competition between both prizes . ''
It is something of a game-changer for the award . The academic David Brauner , from the University of Reading 's department of English literature , is an expert on US authors . He has looked back on Booker winners from 2000 onwards and believes the only one who would undoubtedly have won if challenged by American competition would have been Hilary Mantel for Wolf Hall in 2009 .
He believes Jonathan Franzen 's The Corrections may well have triumphed over Peter Carey for True History of the Kelly Gang in 2001 and that Richard Ford 's The Lay of the Land might have beaten John Banville 's The Sea in 2005 .
There will be one big difference in that publishers do not submit books for the Folio prize , with the bulk of the list decided much like the Oscars are decided – by an academy of writers and publishers and editors .
The official release of the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , a global trade agreement between 12 countries including Canada , the United States , and Japan , has generated considerable confusion over where the Trudeau government stands on the deal . The TPP was concluded several weeks before the October election and the Liberals were careful to express general support for free trade , but refrain from embracing an agreement that was still secret .
Over the past month , there have been mixed signals over the issue . Chrystia Freeland , the new Minister of International Trade , has committed to a public consultation and noted that her government is not bound by commitments made by the Conservatives ( in the interests of full disclosure , I had the opportunity to meet with Minister Freeland to discuss the TPP earlier this month ) . Yet following a meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Barack Obama at the APEC conference in Manila , Obama indicated that he expects Canada to soon be a signatory to the deal .
How to explain the seemingly inconsistent comments on the Canadian position on the TPP ? The answer may well lie in the differences between reaching an agreement-in-principle , signing the formal text , and ratifying the deal . Each step is distinct and carries different legal obligations .
The agreement-in-principle occurred in early October during the final round of negotiations in Atlanta . Contrary to reports that Canada “ signed ” the TPP at the time , there was nothing to sign . The agreement-in-principle closed off the outstanding issues , but the formal text still needed to be finalized . There were some legal implications of the agreement-in-principle , however . For example , the intellectual property chapter includes an annex that permits Canada 's notice-and-notice rules to qualify as an alternative to the TPP 's notice-and-takedown system ( which is modeled on U.S. law ) . The annex states that only countries that have a similar system at the time of the agreement-in-principle can use the exception , effectively creating a Canadian-only rule .
The next formal stage may be the signing of the TPP , which reports indicate could happen in New Zealand as early as February 2016 . There will be strong incentives for all TPP negotiating countries , including Canada , to sign the agreement even if they are unsure about whether they will ultimately ratify it . Chapter 30 of the TPP on Final Provisions addresses some of the technical issues associated with the TPP . The chapter grants special rights to “ original signatories ” , who are the only ones who qualify for the rules related to entry into force of the agreement ( in the event that not all TPP countries ratify the agreement within two years , it takes effect once six original signatories which account for 85 percent of the GDP of the original signatories have ratified it ) . In other words , if Canada does not participate in the signing of the text , it will not be an original signatory and it will not count for the purposes of the TPP taking formal effect .
The benefits of being an original signatory may be what ultimately motivates Canada to sign the TPP and why President Obama expects it do so . However , the TPP would only become binding upon ratification of the agreement . That would require Canada to amend a wide variety of laws to ensure that it is compliant with TPP requirements . From a legal perspective , there is a significant difference between signing a treaty ( which represents only a supportive gesture ) vs. ratifying a treaty ( which creates new legal obligations ) . Howard Knopf has characterized it as the difference between dating and marriage .
It should be noted that many countries sign but do not ratify treaties . Indeed , Canada has a fair number of international treaties that is has signed but not ratified , including a 1988 Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International Promissory notes . The same is true for the United States , which has signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , but has not ratified it .
Canada could find itself in the same position with the TPP . Assuming it signs early next year , there will be still be ample time to conduct a full , open consultation on the treaty . Many have already expressed serious concerns with the implications of the TPP for intellectual property , privacy , Internet governance , and the environment . In light of the mounting concerns , the government could sign the TPP as an original signatory , but still decide to not ratify without changes to the deal .

On January 31 , 2015 , Macedonian prime minister Nikola Gruevski accused opposition leader Zoran Zaev of conspiring with foreign intelligence agencies to topple his government . Zaev 's Social Democrats are supported by the US and EU , have been boycotting parliament for almost a year since alleging fraud in the last parliamentary election .
Macedonia 's state prosecutor confirmed that police had submitted criminal charges against four people , including a former head of state intelligence and his wife . All except Zaev were in custody . Local media reported that Zaev had turned in his passport .
Democratic Union for Integration , DUI , the largest Albanian political party shares power with Nikola Gruevski 's ruling party . Muslims make over 35 % of Macedonia 's 2.1 million population . Albanians make 72 % of the Muslim population but Albanian language is not recognized as a national language .
Macedonian government has supported Russian 's position over Ukraine . Moscow has called a thorough investigation into the foreign powers agenda of an anti-Russian regime change in Macedonia .
After succeeding in making less than 1 % of Jewish population as rulers in Ukraine , the American Jewish lobby is trying to play a similar trick to turn 500 Jews as rulers of Macedonia . Zionist Jew Victoria Nuland , John Kerry 's adviser for Eurasian Affairs assisted by Israel-Firsters Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham , and Jew billionaire George Soro recently carried a failed coup against the democratically elected government of Nikola Gruevski .
Wayne Madsen , investigative journalist , author and columnist , said in a column on February 16 , 2015 :
Nuland 's tactics differed somewhat in her Ukrainian and Macedonian campaigns . Her signature challah bread offerings to protesters at Kiev 's Maidan Square took the form of unsolicited offerings to the Macedonian press suggesting that Gruevksi was wiretapping as many as 20,000 Macedonians and that a videotape proving it was secretly made by Macedonia 's George Soros-financed leader of the opposition , Zoran Zaev , in a meeting he had with Gruevski . Nuland has been charged by Macedonian intelligence with conspiring with Zaev of the Macedonian Social Democratic Union of Macedonia ( SDSM ) , the former Communist Party that has been thoroughly co-opted by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and Soros operative . Also charged in the attempted putsch against Gruevski is Radmila Sekerinska . Zaev and Sekerinska are said by Macedonian insiders to be nothing more than fronts for former Prime Minister and President Branko Crvenkovski who continues to head up the SDSM and accept large amounts of largesse from such CIA NGO laundry operations as the National Democratic Institute ( NDI ) , National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , Freedom House , and Soros 's Open Society Institute ( OSI ) to foment a themed revolution against Gruevksi 's right-of-center VMRO-DPMNE government .
When Macedonia split from Yugoslavia in 1991 , unlike Bosnia , Serb or Croat Christian militia did n't attack Macedonia to commit ethnic-cleansing of Muslim population . The country 's name remains a contentious issue . It is still referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM ) at the United Nations . Its entry to NATO is still blocked by Greece based on its name .
Skopje not only has Israeli embassy but also a Holocaust Memorial for country 's 500 Jewish citizens .
The Zionist regime and its bootlickers in the West have always considered Muslim communities in the Balkan – Bosnia , Kosovo , Macedonia , and the mountainous Sandzak region straddling the border between Montenegro and Serbia hostile to Zionists ' dream of Jewish-controlled New World Order . They 're considered pro-Iran and pro-Palestinians . Iran has its largest embassy in Sarajevo . The brotherly relation between Iran and Bosnia were built by Alija Izetbegovic , the first president of Bosnia-Herzegovina .

One of the biggest challenges faced by Canadian national team members is finding consistent playing time at professional clubs . The lack of a domestic league is a problem for the sport in our country , but the commitment that the Canadian Soccer Association has made to pay the salaries for a significant number of women in the National Women 's Soccer League is positive , compared to the option of having the majority of players just in residency camp year round .
That being said , it 's fair to say that this past NWSL season was disappointing from a Canadian perspective for a number of reasons , starting with the number of players who actually played in the league . The CSA originally allocated 16 players ( the status a player receives when having their salary paid by the CSA ) , the same number as in 2013 . However , Desiree Scott 's transfer to Notts County in England and Selenia Iacchelli 's ongoing injury meant that these two did not play in NWSL this season at all . Factoring in injuries to Lauren Sesselmann and Carmelina Moscato , but adding forward Nkem Ezurike to the list , who was picked 8th overall by Boston in the college draft , there were only 13 Canadians in NWSL who played significant minutes .
Of these 13 , only three played in the NWSL playoffs ( Gayle , Matheson and Sinclair ) , and none played in the NWSL final . No Canadians made the NWSL best or second best XI , and Christine Sinclair was the only player to earn a Player of the Week accolade .
Now , let 's break down the playing time and limited stats available , by position , for each Canadian player who participated in NWSL . GP= Games played , GS= Games started , MP= Minutes played , G= Goals , A= Assists , S= Shots , SOG= Shots on goal
Forwards
Christine Sinclair was streaky this season- it took her nine games to score her first goal , then , in the second third of the NWSL season , she netted seven goals in ten games and looked like her usual dangerous self . However , Sinclair was unable to score in Portland 's remaining six games . She looked very tired on the field at times in the latter part of the season , so it will be interesting to see how Canada 's coach John Herdman manages Sinclair 's playing time this fall , with two friendlies against Japan on the horizon . Though she still has a lot left to give at the international level , national team supporters have to be realistic . Over the last two years , Sinclair has not been able to score the amount of goals that she typically scored yearly for the majority of her career , which RNO 's Sam Gregory wrote about earlier this year .
We ca n't talk about scoring and the women 's national team without discussing the much-anticipated return of Melissa Tancredi . Tancredi joined Chicago mid-season after taking a two-year hiatus from soccer to finish chiropractic school . It was always going to take some time to transition back into the game , but if returning to professional soccer was Tancredi 's first test , she passed . She looked lively up front for Chicago , and was able to generate some good attack after not much practice time with the team . Some still may be skeptical that the 32-year-old will be able to make an impact at the international level , with good reason , but Tancredi 's half season with Chicago shows that she still has something to contribute to the national team for a few more years .
Jonelle Filigno was only able to take eight shots , three of them on goal , in almost 700 minutes on the field for Sky Blue FC , a stat that is quite disappointing . Though Filigno has 56 caps for Canada at age 23 , she is yet to develop into the consistent scoring threat that many thought she would be .
Midfielders
All three Canadian midfielders in the chart above put in consistent performances for their respective clubs , day in and day out . Diana Matheson was likely Canada 's best player in NWSL for the second season in a row , and with their improved roster , Washington was able to reach the NWSL playoffs , a great turnaround after finishing the 2013 season in last place . Sophie Schmidt played a more defensive role this year for Sky Blue , which may explain why she scored just one goal this season compared to seven in 2013 .
Defenders
With Lauren Sesselmann tearing her ACL back in March and Carmelina Moscato 's ongoing foot injury , only three defenders played significant minutes this season . A stat that stands out here is Gayle 's contribution to Washington 's attack- two goals , one assist and seven shots , all from the full-back position .
Looking at the stats above , some questions arise regarding Rachel Quon . After switching from the American to the Canadian program last summer ( eligible as a dual citizen ) , Quon was allocated by Herdman and was a crucial part of Chicago 's defense for the second year in a row . Herdman must have Quon in the team 's plans for 2015 if he allocated her , so why has n't she been a regular in camp for the team 's three friendlies so far this year ? It 's a question worth asking , especially when 17-year-old full-back Sura Yekka , who has been getting a lot of minutes with the senior team since last fall , did not have the stand out performance many thought she would at the under 20 women 's world cup in August . Might Quon get more minutes with the national team in their friendlies against Japan this fall ? We will have to wait and see .
Goalkeepers ( S= Shots faced , SOG= Shots on goal faced , GA= Goals against )
Despite the difference in save percentage stats between Karina Leblanc and Erin McLeod , I would be quite surprised if McLeod moves from first to second on Herdman 's goalkeeping depth chart , as there was nothing strikingly good or bad about both keeper 's performance this NWSL season . For the second year in a row , Leblanc had a much better team in front of her than McLeod .
Other NWSL notes
1 ) The NWSL recently announced its plans for the 2015 season . The league will play a 20 game schedule and will take a two-week break in June for the Women 's World Cup group stage . The league also confirmed that the CSA will continue to allocate players for the 2015 season , and that these national team players will be released from residency camp in order to play some NWSL games at the beginning of the season .
2 ) Last February , Herdman told Steven Sandor of the11.ca that the CSA did not replace Desiree Scott 's allocation spot after she transferred to Notts County because there was not a free agent good enough to take said spot . Herdman likely had a tough time finding a replacement player for this allocation spot due to several women 's national team players turning down NWSL contracts , as reported by Daniel Squizzato at Canadian Soccer News in January .
3 ) 21-year-old Canadian defender Shelina Zadorsky was in preseason camp with eventual league winners FC Kansas City back in March . At the time , it looked like Zadorsky had a very good chance of signing with the team as a free agent , but coach Vlatko Andonovski told The Blue Testament that Zadorsky had to return to school and would re-join the team in May . However , she did not re-join the team in May , and ended up playing for the Ottawa Fury of the W-League this past summer . She recently signed a contract with Perth Glory of the Australian W-League , which runs from September to December .
4 ) The Washington Spirit waived veteran center back Candace Chapman , who has 114 caps for Canada , on March 29th . The 31-year-old was not allocated by the CSA in either 2013 or 2014 , but signed with the Spirit as a free agent in 2013 and played quite a few minutes while struggling with injuries . Before she was waived in March , Chapman spoke with RNO 's Steve Bottjer on the future of her playing and coaching career .
5 ) Besides Christine Sinclair for Portland , Erin McLeod was the other Canadian to captain her NWSL side this season . Giving McLeod the captaincy for a young and struggling expansion team was a testament to her leadership on the field , a trait she will need in abundance next summer when directing Canada 's young defensive stars , like Kadeisha Buchanan , Sura Yekka and Rebecca Quinn .
Spacentrepreneur Elon Musk thinks we 'll eventually need a basic universal income because of “ automation . ”
“ People will have time to do other things , more complex things , more interesting things , ” he told CNBC . “ Certainly more leisure time . And then we got ta figure how we integrate with a world and future with a vast AI . ”

“ Ultimately , I think there has to be some improved symbiosis with digital superintelligence , ” the Tesla CEO said .
What will happen if robots steal our jobs ? It 's a question that 's been on the minds of both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie since the advent of artificial intelligence . Robots have already eliminated some factory jobs , but even so-called “ creative ” work is now threatened , with media companies using AI to generate news stories .

“ There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income , or something like that , ” Musk reasoned .
Regardless of whether automation replaces human labor , the benefits of a basic universal income would be incredible . The idea that everyone would receive enough resources to be able to survive without working would solve the problem of homelessness and poverty and also pivot our cultural and economic identity . In a world with guaranteed income , we would be just as defined by our leisure as our labor .

But alas , that democratic socialist paradise is , at this point , a fantasy . Robots would have to come for our jobs at an exponential rate to generate an economic crisis that would lead to public acceptance of a society where every receives government assistance . Technofuturists like Murray Shanahan and Google 's Ray Kurzweil believe that technology is developing on an exponential curve , meaning we are fast approaching a moment where our tech will outsmart us , or at least render us obsolete . Kurzweil believes this will happen in our lifetime—the year 2045—but other experts disagree .
Even as technology develops , I 'm skeptical of the capitalist West 's ability to undergo such a vast cultural change . Sure , jobs will become obsolete , but we can utilize the technology we invent to create new jobs . Especially in the United States , we define ourselves by our labor ; your labor and its fruits determine every aspect of your identity .
In Guy DeBord 's landmark 1967 piece of mass media criticism , Society of the Spectacle , the Marxist philosopher argues that automation , the epitome of modern industry , “ confronts the world of commodity with a contradiction : ... the same technical infrastructure that is capable of abolishing labor must at the same time preserve labor as ... the sole generator of commodities. ” DeBord believes that when mechanisms increase productivity , “ new forms of employment have to be created ” before labor-time falls to an “ unacceptably low level. ” What the French theorist then suggests is that as a culture , we so thoroughly define ourselves by work that we keep inventing new jobs as our old ones become automated . Case in point : I 'm a blogger . Our society did n't always have a need for hot takes , but here we are .

Musk believes basic universal income is inevitable , but who knows what the weird jobs of the future hold ? If Musk 's right , capitalism 's ruthless grip on the world might loosen a little . If only .

Today , I 'm calling on the Department of Labor to update the rules and requirements that retirement advisors put the best
interests of their clients above their own financial interests . It 's a very simple principle : You want to give financial advice , you 've got to put your client 's interests first. ” – President Barack Obama , February 23 , 2015
New Department of Labor Rule Could Help Americans Save Billions a Year
A recently proposed rule at the Department of Labor , would require retirement advisors keep their clients best interests ahead of their own personal interests and would hand them over some of the fiduciary responsibility . This is potentially great news for millions of Americans who are invested in high fee mutual funds which were offered to them in their company sponsored retirement plan .
Shifting the fiduciary responsibility to the retirement advisor is a big step towards the accountability needed in 401 ( k ) plans and was even
called for by President Obama who ” directed the Department of Labor to move forward with a proposed rulemaking to require retirement advisers to abide by a “ fiduciary ” standard—putting their clients ' best interest before their own profits. ” ( Read More )
The proposed rule not only increases fiduciary responsibility but would also bring light to conflicts of interest and hidden fees such as those in bundled plans . We have long believed that these hidden fees and conflicts of interest are part of the problem . The DOL is specifically saying that retirement advisors , “ Clearly and prominently discloses any conflicts of interest , like hidden fees often buried in the fine print or backdoor payments , that might prevent the adviser from providing advice in the client 's best interest . ”
We have always taken pride in knowing that at the GreenLine 401k and Strategic Choices Financial , we put our clients ' interests first and offer options with no fees and no stock market risk .

ARLINGTON , Texas -- He had just imposed the full force of his will on the Detroit Lions , triggering a run of four unanswered touchdowns that doomed his desperate-for-a-playoff-berth opponents to a 42-21 defeat . And now Dez Bryant , the Dallas Cowboys ' emotional and inexorable receiver , took his best shot at enunciating a collective mentality that cuts to the core of a primal and hyper-physical sport .
`` There 's a lot of talk about how we 're supposed to play this , '' Bryant said as he stood outside the Cowboys ' locker room at AT & T Stadium late Monday night . `` But here 's the deal . F -- - it , we 're gon na play ball , and we 're not gon na play scared . That 's what the coaches want , so that 's what we 're gon na do , and when we get on that field , we 're not holding anything back . ''
With the top seed in the NFC playoffs secured and a slew of devastating injuries in their collective memory bank , the Cowboys had no reason to go for broke Monday night -- except for the most important reason of all : Playing to win in 2016 has made them winners , plain and simple . As head coach Jason Garrett explained while strolling through the victorious locker room , `` If you start to pull back and pull back , you lose some of what you built up over all these weeks , and it makes you vulnerable . We do n't want to do that . We want to go after it . ''
On Monday , Dallas fell behind a Lions team looking to clinch a playoff berth -- and to take some pressure off next Sunday night 's showdown with the Green Bay Packers for the NFC North title -- and got after it with a vengeance , playing with a greater sense of urgency than the vanquished visitors .
And even after their 13th victory in 15 games was assured , the Cowboys maintained a foot-on-the-gas ( and foot-on-the-throat ) approach to the finish , keeping rookie quarterback Dak Prescott and most of their other starters on the field .
Given the carnage that occurred two days earlier , with one playoff-bound team ( the Raiders ) and another with postseason aspirations heading into the weekend ( the Titans ) losing franchise quarterbacks to broken legs , the Cowboys ' reluctance to play it a bit safer may have been perplexing to many viewers , and even to some of the 92,885 fans in attendance who spent much of the night roaring their approval .
Know this , however : Their aggressive approach makes sense to the most important voice in the building -- that of owner Jerry Jones -- who , not surprisingly , foresees the Cowboys taking a similarly hell-bent mindset into next Sunday 's regular-season finale against the Eagles in Philadelphia .
`` The plan we had tonight was aggressive , and that was not by accident , '' Jones told me as he walked to his car after the game .
`` Anything less than that is a little too much to get your hands around , and I think you 'll see the same thing next week . We think this suits us best , and we think our guys will carry that edge into the playoffs . ''
The Cowboys ' edge was evident to all after the Lions , who scored touchdowns on their first three possessions , took a 21-14 lead midway through the second quarter on running back Zach Zenner 's second scoring run . Dallas ' next drive stalled , with Prescott getting violently slammed by linebacker Tahir Whitehead and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata at his own 33 after running for five yards on third-and-6 .
That disquieting sight was augmented by the surly sounds of Dallas linebacker Sean Lee upbraiding his defensive teammates on the sidelines and insisting they play to a higher standard . Message delivered : The Cowboys ( 13-2 ) shut down the Lions ( 9-6 ) the rest of the way , while Bryant and friends ran rampant over Detroit 's defense in every way imaginable .
First Bryant made a sliding , one-handed , 25-yard touchdown catch despite being interfered with by Lions cornerback Johnson Bademosi , allowing Dallas to tie the game at 21 with 1:04 remaining in the first half . On the Cowboys ' first drive of the second half Bryant went deep down the right sideline and drew another interference penalty ( this one on cornerback Nevin Lawson ) to set up a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott ( who earlier scored on a 55-yard burst ) .
At that point , it was clear the Lions could n't cover Bryant . When the Cowboys entered the red zone on their next drive , however , offensive coordinator Scott Linehan took things to the next level : On first-and-goal from the 10 , Bryant ran an apparent end-around , took a pitch from Prescott and raced to his left , only to pull up and loft a perfect , left-handed toss to tight end Jason Witten in the back of the end zone . As Witten threw up the X , mimicking Bryant 's trademark celebration , it was abundantly clear that Detroit was done .
The Cowboys , meanwhile , seemed like they were just showing off -- and/or sending a message to their future playoff opponents , whoever they may be . After Prescott ( 15 for 20 , 212 yards , three touchdowns , no interceptions ) connected with Bryant on a 19-yard touchdown on Dallas ' next drive , logic suggested his night was done .
However , Prescott closed out the game , throwing a pass as late as the 6:40 mark ( a deep ball to Bryant that fell incomplete ) -- and setting up one more emphatic and dramatic display of Dallas dominance , as punter Chris Jones pummeled Lions returner Andrew Roberts on the sideline following a 23-yard return .
Yeah , it was like that .
And no , Monday night was not Romo Time , despite the protestations of many adoring fans . Tony Romo , whose decade as the Cowboys ' starting quarterback ended abruptly after he suffered a compression fracture in his back during the preseason , remained on the sidelines even in the blowout 's final stages , apparently to be used only in case of emergency .
This unorthodox approach to quarterback management speaks to the Cowboys ' determination not to rely on any one player the way they 've depended upon Romo in recent years . And it shows that , while Prescott is undeniably the man who 'll be charged with leading Dallas to what Jones hopes will be the franchise 's ninth Super Bowl appearance -- and first in 21 years -- the owner is n't petrified by the prospect of Romo stepping in should the situation warrant it .
As we stood on the field before the game , I asked Jones if the sight of Raiders quarterback Derek Carr going down with a broken fibula in Saturday 's victory over the Colts ( with Titans QB Marcus Mariota already having suffered a similar injury in a defeat to the Jaguars ) made him at all squeamish about playing Prescott against the Lions .
`` Of course it scares you , '' Jones conceded . `` But I know that playing in games like this will help Dak prepare for the bigger moments , and I also know what we have in Romo . I 'm not worried about ( him being rusty ) ; I 've seen what he can do in practice , and he 'll be ready if needed . And , I mean , what a luxury . How much would Oakland love to have a Romo who could step in right now ? ''
Last season , after Romo went down with a broken left clavicle in Week 2 , the Cowboys -- who were coming off an NFC East championship the previous year -- lost seven consecutive games to fall out of contention . Romo was shut down for the season after suffering a similar injury in late November , and Dallas sputtered to a 4-12 record .
So when Romo sustained his compression fracture in late August , Jones and his son , Stephen , the Cowboys ' executive vice president and director of player personnel , were understandably stressed . Yet something about the poise of Prescott , a fourth-round draft pick , compelled them to resist the temptation to trade for an experienced passer to serve as a stopgap replacement -- along with a collective initiative they 'd forged in the wake of last year 's disappointing campaign .
`` Obviously , when Tony goes down , you start thinking about , 'Are you gon na be able to get this done without him ? ' '' Jones said following Monday 's game . `` But everybody took the blame for last year and came back determined to do it differently . Our attitude was , 'Hey , let 's focus on the guys we 've got . '
`` That 's something I do n't think we did in the past , and certainly not last year . This time , our guys never blinked . It was full speed ahead . I do n't think our players ever worried about who was gon na play this week . They 've just gone out and played , and that 's what we wanted to do tonight as well . ''
Jerry Jones insisted he was n't worried when Prescott absorbed that second-quarter sandwiching by Ngata and Whitehead , saying , `` Dak 's a big guy . To me , that 's part of him getting to be a better quarterback , fighting through situations like that . And he 's a better quarterback having played this game balls out than if we had measured it in some way .
`` So yeah , we had a different mentality when ( Romo got hurt ) this year . But I 'm gon na say this : We had no idea it was gon na be a fourth-rounder , Dak Prescott , who got on the field , first of all , and then did what he 's been able to do ... To me , the odds of Dak Prescott getting this opportunity and being on the field in the first place are so long , you ca n't even count them . ''
Thus , having beaten the odds to this extent , Jones is willing to live with the possibility that the Cowboys could lose Prescott -- or Elliott , or Bryant , or Lee , or Pro Bowl left tackle Tyron Smith ( who sat out the fourth quarter with a knee injury that the owner does not believe is serious ) , or another key player -- in pursuit of victories they do n't technically need , all in the name of maintaining their edge .
`` Yeah , there 's a risk , '' Garrett conceded , `` but you 've got ta play . `` There are so many examples out there of teams over the years that pulled back and lost their edge and did n't look the same in the playoffs , and we do n't want to be one of them . ''
It 's telling that Lee , perhaps the most injury-prone Cowboys standout in recent memory , has absolutely no desire to play it safe as the playoffs approach . With Dallas three victories away from a championship -- in games that would all be played in the state of Texas , with Super Bowl LI set for Houston 's NRG Stadium on Feb. 5 -- Lee is focused on playing to win in Philadelphia next Sunday .
`` Playing makes you better , '' he said . `` You can practice as much as you want , but playing in games helps me be a better football player -- and helps me play the game right . You could see tonight , we did n't play the right way early on , and it was unacceptable . But we played our way out of it , and that was really valuable . All year long , we 've gone out and played and kept getting better , and that 's a real thing . ''
In three weeks , the real challenge begins , with the Cowboys hosting a divisional-round game against an undetermined opponent . There 's no guarantee that they 'll be fully healthy -- but judging from Monday 's performance , they 'll almost certainly be ready .

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was urged by the World Health Organisation to implement increased number of pictorial warnings on tobacco based products to stay committed to the workings behind the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ( FCTC ) .
In India , nearly a million deaths occur every year due to tobacco related diseases . Tobacco is not only a major risk factor contributing to the deaths related to non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) it also affects the fiscal and economic health of the country . India falls short on packaging guidelines for tobacco based products .
‘ The tobacco industry will undoubtedly raise unfounded concerns about impact on economic trade especially loss of livelihood to farmers and bidi rollers but evidence shows that tobacco producers are trapped in a cycle of exploitation and poverty , ' UN World Health Organisation 's Director-General Margaret Chan said in her letter to the Prime Minister .
Also , Dr Nata Menabde , WHO representative to India , issued a statement in which she stated that India , though being a party to the WHO FCTC , has not fully complied with the tobacco pack warnings which currently occupy only 40 percent of the principal display on one side of the pack .
Plain cigarette packaging could urge smokers to quit
As per a new study , cigarettes packaged in a plain manner are less appealing to smokers . Large pictorial warnings could urge them to quit smoking .
As per the study published in the online journal BMJ Open , the conclusion was based on interviews of 536 smokers in the Australian state of Victoria during November 2012 when plain packs were already available in the run-up to and immediately after implementation of the legislation requiring all tobacco sold at retail outlets to be contained in plain packs . Here 's more about this study .

During last month 's Spring League Meeting , NFL executive Eric Grubman , the man in charge of handling potential relocation to Los Angeles , indicated that another meeting would be necessary to discuss the situation .
We now know when that added owners meeting will take place .
NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Thursday that the NFL has set an additional owner meeting for Aug. 11 to discuss the L.A. topic . It will take place in Chicago , per a league source .
Per Rapoport , no major news is expected out of the meeting . The conference will be used as a timeline and process update , focused on the progress of home markets ( Oakland , San Diego , St. Louis ) to keep their teams .
The NFL believes there needed to be an update between May and October owners meetings , given the interest in moving to the second-largest market in the U.S .
Rams owner Stan Kroenke plans to build an NFL stadium in Inglewood , Calif. , while the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders have joined forces on a project in Carson .
Momentum is building toward a team returning to the L.A. market in 2016 . The additional meeting will help that process along .

The good news is that a lot has changed since 2000 . Back then , there were only a handful of outlets dedicated to calling bullshit when they saw it—TNR and a few other lefty magazines , along with a handful of columnists like Paul Krugman and E.J . Dionne . Today there 's a whole cable network ( MSNBC ) dedicated to this stuff , dozens of popular liberal blogs , and in-house fact-checkers at most major newspapers , all of whom have been fairly good ( if not great ) at adjudicating these questions .
Likewise , in 2000 , the Bush campaign did n't merely sell its version of the truth . It also made Gore out to be a liar . This crippled his ability to question Bush 's record . ( The strategy was very explicit . In his book on the campaign , Bush media strategist Stuart Stevens referred to it as “ blowing up the aircraft carrier instead of shooting down planes ” —the planes being individual allegations from Gore and the aircraft carrier being his credibility . Stevens is , of course , Romney 's top strategist this time around . ) Meanwhile , the press played right into Bush 's hand , running stories about Gore 's dubious invention of the Internet and trumped up claims about his dog 's arthritis medicine . Fortunately , the Romney campaign has had little success tagging Obama with the serial exaggerator label in 2012 .
Still , even if some in the old media have been chastened—the Times is especially good at working factual debunkings of policy claims into its coverage—the rest of the campaign media leaves much to be desired . Outside of one fact-checking piece , Politico alluded to Romney 's tax cut plan in six different post-Denver-debate stories without addressing the substance of Romney 's claims a single time . Instead , the stories typically covered the back-and-forth over the proposal as irresolvable ( “ the quibbling over numbers aside… ” went one segue ) or of purely tactical interest ( Romney had reason to tone down the tax-cut talk , another story observed , because the “ 'tax cuts for the rich ' message polls poorly with centrists ” ) . And I hate to single out Politico . Many of the pundits up and down the cable dial are much , much worse .
Suffice it to say , this is the sort of enabling behavior Tomasky and other liberals are right to go nuts over . The campaign media could never produce another story on tactics and the social consequences would be negligible . Everyone one of us is going to find out who won the election on the morning of November 7 . But if enough of the media refuses to sort out substantive claims , how many of us will walk into the voting booth November 6 knowing what it is we 're actually voting for ? And which recently reinvented candidate do you suspect is banking on that to happen ?
Update : The endlessly endearing Bob Somerby raises two points that are worth responding to . First , he writes , `` Try not to laugh at Scheiber 's claim that TNR was 'dedicated to calling bullshit ' in Campaign 2000 . For better or worse , it was n't . '' Um , yes , we were . I went back and counted a good ten pieces by Jon Chait from 2000 about how Bush was a radical on tax cuts and Social Security , despite his attempts to portray himself as a moderate . One typical piece was subtitled , `` George W. Bush , likable extremist . '' ( If memory serves , that was a cover story , and the cover image was a cartoon of a shifty-looking Bush under the headline : `` He 's Lying : Why W. Is Not a Moderate , '' or some such . ) It 's true that the weekly TRB column was written by Andrew Sullivan , then in his high-Tory/supply-side phase , but the editorial drift of the magazine was very clear . We had a number of unsigned editorials and `` notebook items '' -- a kind of proto-blog published in the magazine each week -- skewering Bush along the same lines Chait did . ( I know this first hand : I wrote a few of the notebook items and fact-checked many more of them , as well as the editorials . ) Believe me , the Bush campaign did not consider us sympathetic .
Second , Somerby says it was n't the Bush campaign that branded Gore a liar . The mainstream press accomplished that by itself . This is fair enough . The idea of Gore as a chronic exaggerator definitely was a press meme long before the Bushies got a hold of it . See , for example , this Chicago Tribune piece , which examines the origins of Gore 's claim to have inspired the movie `` Love Story , '' which he in fact never quite claimed , notwithstanding the media narrative to the contrary . I do think it 's fair to say , however , that the Bushies picked up the Gore meme and exploited it relentlessly , per the Stuart Stevens quote above .

The Ford RS200 is one of the most famous of the non-USA developed Fords ever made . In fact I ca n't think of another that even comes close , with the possible exception of the Ford GT40 – but my American friends get angry with me when I remind them that the GT40 was designed and built in England .
The iconic status of the Ford RS200 is well-cemented in Britain where it was designed and built between 1984 and 1986 – it was originally conceived as a phoenix-car that would ride from the ashes of the abandoned Escort RS1700T project .
Originally envisaged as a car to take on the Audis in Group B rally , the RS200 was designed from the ground up as a four-wheel drive , mid-engine , space-frame chassis car that would be capable of racing against the best in the world . It was designed by former Formula 1 designer Tony Southgate , and Ford 's John Wheeler , a former F1 engineer himself .
A double wishbone suspension setup , twin dampers on all four wheels , almost perfect weight distribution , an incredibly light weight , couple to an advanced , rigid chassis made the RS200 an incredible performer – it came 3rd in its first race outing and would go onto take 19 wins and 32 podium finishes at international level events .
After a relatively successful , though very eventful 1986 Group B Rally season the team at Ford were hard at work on the Ford RS200 E2 ( an evolution of the 1986 car that would race in Group B in 1987 ) when they received word that Group B had been shut down due to safety concerns . Many had died during the 1986 season and it was seen as being just too dangerous to continue .
This car is one of only 200 built ( due to homologation ) and is chassis number 90 , it was first registered for the road in 1989 and has only seen 17,090 miles since then . It 's presented in remarkable , original condition and has an estimated value of between $ 120,000 and $ 150,000 USD – if you 'd like to snap it up you 'll need to head to the Goodwood Collector 's Motor Cars Auction that 'll be held by Bonhams on the 12th of July 2013 .

Ronnie Screwvala 's claim to public fame may be the mammoth success he made of UTV - but those that know him well have always known him as a man of multiple passions .
Sport , it turns out , is one of them - but not for him the easy road that cricket in India represents .
Instead , he 's part of the serious kabaddi revival the country is currently seeing : his company U Sports owns the Pro Kabaddi League franchise U Mumba who were crowned the champions of the tournament 's second season on Sunday , 23 August .
He also supports grassroots football through his U Dream Football initiative , and is planning to start a motor-racing event called U Moto 250 .
He 's perhaps best placed to do so - he has a fervent passion for sport and a deep-seated understanding of entertainment , and the combination of the two is what will be needed to pull eyeballs away from cricket .
Excerpts from an interview to Catch :
U Mumba won the Pro Kabaddi League title with relative ease this season . What is the key to the team 's success ?
They performed consistently well throughout the season . The team spirit in the squad was excellent , which played a big part in their success in the league . This is a 40-minute game with a lot of unpredictability . Despite the best-laid plans , things can go awry - it 's the nature of this game and of most sport . However , the team managed to handle situations very well . There has been constant improvement on all fronts over the course of the season .
The core players of our team , who also played last season , have been absolutely fantastic this term .
There was a high level of consistency from every player , which translated into wins on the mat . I think our mix of three raiders , three defenders and one all-rounder turned out to be a very well-balanced strategy . It helped us turn the games around because of our prowess on both the offensive and defensive fronts .
What prompted you to invest in kabaddi in the first place ?
I like doing things which can make a major difference . With kabaddi being a traditional sport in this country , we knew that if we did a few things differently with the Pro Kabaddi League , the sport could become hugely popular here .
We were n't sure how long it would take for the sport to grow in popularity , but there was never any doubt about its scope for growth in the long run . In that context , it made complete sense investing in kabaddi .
The viewership figures are pretty amazing - starting from season one last year , which had a total of 435 million viewers . Did you expect this quick a response ?
We did n't expect this kind of response in the first season itself , to be honest with you . We knew it would eventually pick up , so the overall success of the league was not surprising - but yes , we were a bit surprised with the number of people we reached in the first season .
All eight franchises have invested considerable amounts of money since the start of the inaugural season . In how many years are you expecting to break even ?
We have already managed to do that . This is the first sports league of the country where teams have broken even in the second season itself . The sponsors ' response has been great , the gateway receipts have increased and the broadcast revenues have been picking up .
However , it is important to note that the cost model in this league is slightly different from others . I am sure that the cost will go up in the future as the league continues to grow , but it started at a very low base .
Given its success all over India , do you think the Pro Kabaddi League could expand to include teams from other parts of the country ?
I think that 's the plan . I ca n't individually speak for the league , but we would encourage and welcome additional teams to the league . What happens with more teams in the league is that it gets more diverse as a tournament .
There is greater unpredictability with respect to the on-field action , which will make the league more exciting and garner more attention . Right now , the plan is to hold a Pro Kabaddi League season every six months , instead of extending the time-span of one single season .
Apart from kabaddi , you also support football through the U Dream project , for which you 've tied up with the German club Hoffenheim . Tell us more ...
When it comes to football , we are absolutely focused on long-term talent-building . We are not here as investors . Fifteen kids left for Hoffenheim day-before-yesterday for six years of training . Next year we are planning to send 90 kids under the same program . All these kids are below the age of 14 , and the crucial bit is that we will be managing their careers for the next ten years .
And then there 's a motorcycle racing event - U Moto 250 in the works ? What exactly is the event all about and when is it slated to start ?
With U Moto we 're trying to make it a destination sport cum motorsport event . It will be held in some of the country 's most exotic places . At the moment we 're researching and analysing the right locations - so far we 've zeroed in on Daman & Diu , Pondicherry , Goa , Ladakh and Leh .
As for the commencement of the event , it will either start in 2016 , or in 2017 at the latest . At the end of the day , it will be a racing event , so we will have to do a lot of work with the tracks .
That 's an eclectic range of sport - is there any other that you 're also keeping an eye on ?
Yes , we are also looking to launch a gaming league . Such leagues have become exceptionally popular around the world in the last 2-3 years , and are quite television-friendly . So that is something we are currently exploring .
It 's obvious you have a fascination for sport . What aspect of it draws you most ?
I want to see India do well in multiple sports disciplines . For that to happen , we need to create an ecosystem where sports become a viable career option for youngsters . I am more than happy to contribute to the creation of such an environment .
Right now , not enough people pursue sports as a career . Kabaddi , for example , has become quite popular in India recently . But as a sport it is still not aspirational , which is what we want it to be in the coming years .
So it ( my involvement with sports ) is mainly about encouraging talent , backing different sports disciplines , creating brands in sports and making sports a viable career path for youngsters .
As an avid sports fan , do you think India can go on to become a major sporting power in the years to come ?
Well , I am not an astrologer , so I can not predict that . All I can say is that we do n't have a choice . India as a nation will have to go for it . You ca n't be one of the largest economies in the world and not be one of the best performing nations in multiple sports disciplines .
At present , we are not doing enough at the grassroots level . People do n't want to pursue careers in sports and we do n't have too many role models in this industry . If we can gradually bring changes in these areas , I think we will do well . As a country , we do n't have any other choice .
Actor Richard Gere was booed by firefighters at The Concert for New York shortly after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks when he said the best “ medicine ” for al Qaeda was “ love. ” The story always stuck with me for its herculean weirdness , which is why Attorney General Loretta Lynch 's very same advice for victims of the June 12 , 2016 , terrorist attack in Orlando immediately caught my ear on Tuesday .
“ To the LGBT community — we stand with you , ” Mrs. Lynch said while at a press conference in Florida . “ The good in this world far outweighs the evil . Our common humanity transcends our differences , and our most effective response to terror is compassion , it 's unity and it 's love . We stand with you today because we grieve together , and long after the cameras are gone will continue to stand with you as we grow together in commitment and solidarity and in equality . ”
Terrorist Omar Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group as he killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a gay nightclub . The organization he adored throws gay men off tall buildings and takes women as sex slaves .
Question : Could anything be more distasteful than essentially telling Christian sex slaves in Iraq , Syria , and North Africa : “ You 're not loving them hard enough , “ ?
The response to Islamic terrorism on American shores — the battlefield has no borders in this war —by President Obama is to a . ) go Orwellian by censoring any information that helps citizens define the enemy , and b . ) pretend as though scary-looking rifles are to blame .
For those who were n't paying attention to the news on Monday , the FBI tried to release transcripts of Omar Mateen 's 911 calls without any reference to ISIS , Allah , etc . National mockery forced the agency to backtrack .
USA Today reported Monday :
The FBI and Department of Justice released a full transcript of the Orlando gunman 's 911-call on Monday afternoon amid outrage that the original transcript omitted reference to the terror group ISIL . In a joint statement , officials said they released the partial transcript and omitted any reference to ISIL so as not to provide the terror group with additional publicity , which could be used for “ hateful propaganda ” purposes .
The White House is so determined to expunge the idea that Islam has something to do with Islamic terrorism that it now finds itself trying to go full 1984 . Never go full 1984…
If you do n't believe your friendly neighborhood blogger , then perhaps you will believe the Department of Homeland Security .
The Homeland Security Advisory Council ordered officials just days before the Orlando massacre :
Do not use the word “ jihad. ” Do not use the word “ sharia. ” Do not use the word “ takfir. ” “ Reject religiously-charged terminology and problematic positioning by using plain meaning American English . ”
If someone is trying to kill you and they say they are doing it to bring the world into accordance with Sharia law , then it is incumbent upon you to know what Sharia law means .
If officials refuse to familiarize civil society with the terminology used by enemies of the state , then they are putting countless lives at risk .
Imagine if officials refused to discuss Nazism during World War II .
Imagine if officials refused to discuss Communism during the Cold War .
It would be madness , would n't it ? That 's because intelligent people know that you can not mobilize a population for a giant and prolonged undertaking without accurately defining the task at hand .
America has a commander in chief who would rather muddle and confuse the population to daunting security challenges than to inform them of uncomfortable truths . The president has greater fidelity to political correctness than to life-saving clarity , and for that the citizenry should be livid .
Christians are told to turn the other cheek , but one can not do that when the head is separated from the neck .
It is right to pray for one 's enemies , but it is also just to defeat them on the field of battle .
The current administration is not up to the job of safeguarding liberty for future generations , and for that reason its allies deserve to be soundly defeated at the ballot box .
Dem Rep. John Conyers Issues Statement Confirming Settlement , Denies Allegations
The morning after Rep. John Conyers ( D-MI ) was hit with sexual harassment claims , the Associated Press went to the lawmaker 's Detroit home to seek comment .
Conyers denied the report , claiming he has not settled any sexual harassment complaints with staffers . Hours later , the lawmaker confirmed that he did , in fact , pay a settlement over sexual harassment claims .
“ JUST IN : Rep. John Conyers retracts earlier statement to AP , says he was surprised and confused about which allegations . He confirms a settlement but denies the allegations , ” tweeted BuzzFeed 's Paul McLeod .

Daily Beast reports :
Rep. John Conyers ( D-MI ) confirmed Tuesday that he had paid out a settlement after BuzzFeed News reported that his office paid a woman more than $ 27,000 as part of a confidentiality agreement related to sexual-harassment complaints . The confirmation retracts an earlier statement he made to the AP denying such a settlement and claiming he was surprised by the accusations . “ I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me , and continue to do so , ” he said . “ My office resolved the allegations– with an express denial of liability– in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation . That should not be lost in the narrative . The resolution was not for millions of dollars , but rather for an amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment. ” The long-time congressman also stated that he would cooperate with a House investigation .
Monday evening , the longtime lawmaker was accused of settling sexual harassment allegations against him with taxpayer money .
BuzzFeed reports :
Democratic Rep. John Conyers claimed Tuesday he did n't know about the sexual harassment claims against him that were detailed in a BuzzFeed News investigation — but a person involved in the case immediately said that he did , in fact , know . [ … ] But a person involved in the case — which went through the Office of Compliance which has a secret mechanism by which Congress has kept an unknown number of sexual harassment allegations quiet — said it had actually reached a point where he did know . “ We brought the complaint to the Office of Compliance . They did n't even tell him about it . You have to go through ‘ counseling ' and all this stupid stuff . There 's an informal mediation that takes place — the congressmen do n't even know about this , ” the person said . “ He ended up knowing about this because we took it as far as you can take it before you get to the official hearing , ” the person said .
In a statement to POLITICO. , Rep. Jerry Nadler ( D-NY ) said , “ The allegations against Ranking Member Conyers are extremely serious and deeply troubling . Obviously , these allegations must be investigated promptly by the Ethics Committee . ”
Speaker Paul Ryan called allegations against Conyers “ extremely troubling . ”
Rep. Bill Huizenga ( R-MI ) was the person member of Congress calling for Conyers to resign .
As TGP reported , The documents were first provided to BuzzFeed News by Mike Cernovich .
Buzzfeed reports :
Documents from the complaint obtained by BuzzFeed News include four signed affidavits , three of which are notarized , from former staff members who allege that Conyers , the ranking Democrat on the powerful House Judiciary Committee , repeatedly made sexual advances to female staff that included requests for sexual favors , contacting and transporting other women with whom they believed Conyers was having affairs , caressing their hands sexually , and rubbing their legs and backs in public . Four people involved with the case verified the documents are authentic .
Buzzfeed also reported that staffers were tasked with flying women in for Conyers using Congressional resources .
One affidavit from a former female employee states that she was tasked with flying in women for the congressman . “ One of my duties while working for Rep. Conyers was to keep a list of women that I assumed he was having affairs with and call them at his request and , if necessary , have them flown in using Congressional resources , ” said her affidavit . ( A second staffer alleged in an interview that Conyers used taxpayer resources to fly women to him . )
Former employees also said that Conyers made it very clear that if they performed ‘ personal favors ' it would lead to salary increases and promotions . It was well known Conyers was having affairs with multiple female staffers . He often made sexual advances towards women and grew angry if they brought their husbands around .
Since late January , I 've had the privilege of teaching the introductory International Politics class at Haverford College just outside of Philadelphia . One of the benefits of teaching bright undergraduates ( mainly freshmen and sophomores ) is that they come to the study of international relations from such a different perspective than my own that classroom interactions are often interesting and thought-provoking . The other major benefit is the opportunity that it has provided for me to go back and re-read some international relations classics .
As WOTR is a den of realists , I thought I would go back to the roots of modern realism and examine one aspect of Hans J. Morgenthau 's magnum opus Politics Among Nations : diplomacy . For many , this book encapsulates and defines many of the core premises of realism . While dismissed as being too normatively prescriptive by some , it is still a useful primer . This is a particularly important topic today while the U.S. is recalibrating its instruments of power ( mainly by decreasing them ) and global commitments and particularly operating in a world that is teeming with geopoliticians such as Vladimir Putin and Bashar Assad who seem quite willing to push back against America 's global interests .
For Morgenthau , diplomacy must :
determine its objectives in light of the power actually and potentially available for the pursuit of these objectives ; assess the objectives of other nations and the power actually and potentially available for the pursuit of these objectives ; determine to what extent these different objectives are compatible with each other ; and employ the means suited to the pursuit of its objectives .
He cautions that , “ Failure in any of these tasks may jeopardize the success of foreign policy and with it the peace of the world. ” This was valid thinking when Morgenthau put pen to paper and remains so today .
To carry out such diplomacy , he argued , nations had three tools at their disposal : persuasion , compromise , and the threat of force . But , you ca n't fall too much in love with any one of these tools . To maximize diplomacy 's effectiveness , countries must blend and match these tools to best deal with particular problems and situations .
Morgenthau argued that there are nine rules for diplomacy ; four “ fundamental ” and five relating to compromise . His four fundamental rules ( with some added explanations ) are :
diplomacy must be divested of the crusading spirit ( i.e. , do n't get dogmatic ) ; the objectives of foreign policy must be defined in terms of the national interest and must be supported with adequate power ( his national interest for “ a peace-loving nation ” is its national security defined by the integrity of its national territory and its institutions ) ; diplomacy must look at the political scene from the point of view of other nations ( defined in terms of their national security ) ; and nations must be willing to compromise on all issues that are not vital to them .
And his five largely self-explanatory , prerequisites for compromise are :
“ Give up the Shadow of Worthless Rights for the Substance of Real Advantage ” [ i.e. , do n't be too legalistic or ideological ] “ Never Put Yourself in a Position from Which You Can not Retreat Without Losing Face and from Which You Can not Advance Without Grave Risks ” “ Never Allow a Weak Ally to Make Decisions for You ” “ The Armed Forces Are the Instrument of Foreign Policy , Not Its Master ” ; and “ The Government Is the Leader of Public Opinion , Not Its Slave ” .
Morgenthau 's prescriptions for prudence of action should be thought about , internalized , and applied when appropriate . This would greatly reduce unforced errors , although it would not save us from the misperceptions and miscalculations that often are responsible for crises . But , with these nine rules comes the rub for many Americans , and others .
For Americans of a realist bent , the issue is that , as my colleague Mac Owens has noted , “ American realism has always fused the features of traditional realism—power and security—with prosperity and the preservation of American principles. ” This sometimes gets us into trouble . Setting aside numerous other recent examples of the past fifteen years , President Obama 's recent warnings to Russia about the situation in Ukraine displays this tension between prudence and principles . It feels good to say the right thing about the situation in Ukraine , but at the end of the day , if the Russians decided to pull a 1956 Hungary or a 1968 Czechoslovakia , are we really going to risk a major war to aid democratic forces in Kiev ? Likely not . Furthermore , could we fight such a conflict ? We probably could , but it would cause a fundamental slewing of attention and capabilities . If you hate what the focus on the Middle East is doing to the Asian pivot then you are really going to hate a reversion back to focusing on Eurasia—unless you have a fetish for state-based great power struggles . We can register objections to be sure , but we have to be mindful of how others will read those objections . Making objections that are not credible will negatively impact our street cred and influence if they are seen by others ( e.g. , Putin or Assad ) as bluffs .

WKRN web staff - NASHVILLE , Tenn. ( WKRN ) - Kings of Leon will headline the annual `` Bash on Broadway '' this New Year 's Eve in downtown Nashville .
`` I can think of no place I 'd rather play New Year 's Eve than at home with 100,000 of my closest friends , '' said drummer Nathan Followill .
`` The Kings ' following internationally is beyond impressive . No doubt they are one of the biggest rock bands in the world right now , '' Butch Spyridon , president and CEO of the NCVC added .
He continued , `` Not only are they great musicians , but they love Nashville and are great ambassadors for us . We are honored to have them play their hometown and know it takes our event to a new level in terms of reach and expectations . ''

PITTSBURGH ( KDKA ) — Pittsburgh Police say charges are pending against demonstrators who smashed windows Monday night at the Allegheny County Jail and got into a scuffle with an officer .
Police responded in force around 8 p.m. when about 20 protestors , dressed in black and wearing masks staged a protest Downtown .

“ To the best of our knowledge , there was about a group of 20-25 people . Jail staff called 911 saying this group was outside , they were throwing things at the jail and had broken some glass , ” said Pittsburgh Police spokeswoman Sonya Toler said . “ They were firing off firecrackers or fireworks , I should say , that 's probably more accurate . ”
A spokesperson for the protest group said over the weekend there was an inmate sit-in in the jail .
Lisa Washington 's Report :
However , Allegheny County spokeswoman Amie Downs said that there was no protest in the jail and all jail operations were normal .
But the group said the demonstration was in support in a specific pod in the jail that staged a sit-in to allegedly demand proper and timely medical care , among other things .
Jail Warden Orlando Harper issued a statement , thanking police for their quick response to the violence .
Harper said , in part , “ Contrary to reports made by the group that has been organizing the protests over the last few days , there are no sit-ins or protests going on inside the jail , nor have there been . Tonight 's incident has not impacted operations at all . The facility remains secure and safe for all inmates and employees . ”
Harper said the institution was safe and secure for all inmates and employees .
KDKA 's Ralph Iannotti Reports :
A Pittsburgh Bicycle Officer , who was the first policeman to arrive on the scene , suffered a shoulder injury when he got into a scuffle with several demonstrators .
“ The first one of the scene was a bicycle officer and he had a small altercation when he was trying to subdue the group , ” said Toler . “ They took off running in several directions . ”
At least 11 protestors were taken into custody .
While it 's not clear what the group was protesting , it appears to be a spin-off from a weekend rally organized by the ACJ Health Justice Project . However , that organization said it was not affiliated with the protest .

New women 's glossy squeezes out skinny models for plus-size women ( and bans dieting tips )
In a market that seems to cater for every taste , it 's the one area that magazine publishers had inexplicably failed to fill .
Now , however , the first glossy magazine dedicated to curvy women has been unveiled in Britain .
Just As Beautiful is aimed at women who are between a size 14 and 20 and , crucially , will not use models who are slimmer than its target audience .
Diet-free zone : Just As Beautiful magazine is aimed at curvy women and will not use airbrushing - even the adverts ( right ) will focus on plus-size clothing
It will feature articles on fashion , cooking and lifestyle - but unlike many other titles , it wo n't include tips on dieting .
All the models featured in the magazine 's fashion and lingerie shoots will be larger than a Size 14 , and the magazine 's editor , Sue Thomason , has promised 'no airbrushing out bits of their bodies ' .
The first issue features an article on Gavin and Stacey actress Ruth Jones .
Ms Thomason , a Size 18 herself , said : 'If you 're a woman over Size 14 , you 're likely to be stuck for something to read that does n't make you feel like you 're too big or `` wrong '' because you 're not a Size Zero .
'We want our readers to know that they do n't need to change their appearance to 'fit in ' or be truly happy .
'Most people only think they need to change because they 're constantly exposed to the message that they do - and shown images of impossibly skinny models that they 're told they `` should '' look like . '
Breaking boundaries : All fashion and lingerie models featured in Just As Beautiful magazine will be between Sizes 14 and 20 - just like the title 's target reader In her first editorial , Ms Thomason , who worked as a body image life coach for five years , explained that one of the magazine 's mission statements was to 'help end the current harsh visual obsession ' suffered by curvier women .
'Appearance needs to be rethought and placed firmly back where it belongs - in the entertainment section of your life , along with fashion and make-up , ' she said .
'If you feel anxious about your looks instead of being relaxed , it 's a sure sign that you need to change your mind and not your body . '
The magazine began three years ago as a free digital publication distributed via email on a subscription-only basis and had built up a circulation of 30,000 .
But this month it was launched as a bi-monthly magazine , available in selected stores and on subscription , costing £4.70 .
Large as life : The magazine 's shapely models are all size 14 to 20 , aimed at women who 'do n't want to be made to feel bad about the way they look '
Publisher Ronnie Ajoku said : 'This is a classy , non-pornographic magazine .
'There will be no diet sections but we do have exercise tips .
'No model under size 14 will get into the magazine .
'We have normal interviews with women who happen to be size 14-16 .
'What we want to do is supply a magazine for women who do n't want to be made to feel bad about the way they look .
'We might have interviews from plus size celebrities like Ruth Jones but they are straightforward interviews and do n't concentrate on their size .
'The point of the magazine is not to make such a big deal about women 's figures like other magazines do .
'There are plenty of magazines out there which promote losing weight but our readers do n't want that .
Five matches highlight the National Women 's Soccer League 's opening weekend , which will feature 11 Canadian players in action .
This fourth season marks a historic one for the NWSL , as it has surpassed both of its predecessors , the Women 's United Soccer Association ( WUSA ) and Women 's Professional Soccer ( WPS ) . Both pro leagues existed for just three seasons .
Here 's a closer look at the NWSL match ups on Saturday and Sunday :
Washington Spirit vs. Boston Breakers
April 16 – Maureen Hendricks Field Maryland SoccerPlex
Canadians : Diana Matheson , Shelina Zadorsky , Stephanie Labbe
You can expect Matheson to play important minutes throughout the season and Zadorsky will likely see a lot of time in the centre-back position alongside American Megan Oyster . Zadorsky and Oyster have a lot in common , including having previously played in Australia , and both are 23 . At times , U.S. international Ali Krieger has lined up as a centre back for Washington , but she is best used as a fullback . Being part of a back line with Krieger will only help Zadorsky 's game in her first NWSL season and will , in turn , benefit her national team career .
Labbe will need time to get acclimated to the pace of the NWSL after five years in Sweden 's Damallsvenskan . There 's a good chance she 'll be in net for Saturday 's meeting . With a long-term injury to Erin McLeod , the more playing time Labbe gets , the better for Canada .
Washington finished fourth last season and qualified for the playoffs . Boston was at the bottom of the standings , ninth out of nine teams . They struggled to score goals and keep them out of their net .
Houston Dash vs. Chicago Red Stars
April 16 – BBVA Compass Stadium
Canadians : Janine Beckie , Allysha Chapman
Chapman is expected to be a starter in the left fullback spot , while Beckie—who had a tremendous pre-season—will provide secondary scoring for a Dash squad that features young Brazilian international Andressa up top and 2015 FIFA Player of the Year , Carli Lloyd .
The Dash are in search of their first post-season appearance . Chicago finished second in 2015 and lost in the playoffs to the eventual champions , FC Kansas City .
FC Kansas City vs. Western New York Flash
April 16 – Children 's Mercy Park
Canadians : Desiree Scott , Sabrina D'Angelo , Adriana Leon
Scott returns to the Kansas City fold after time overseas with Notts County in England . She adds further defensive prowess in the middle of the park for the two-time defending champions .
This marks D'Angelo 's sophomore professional season and the 22-year-old will play the bulk of games for the Flash , that is , when she 's not on international duty . Much like Labbe with Washington , the more minutes D'Angelo gets , the better for Canada .
Seattle Reign FC vs. Sky Blue FC
April 17 – Memorial Stadium
Canadians : None .
While no Canadians are suiting up for either side , the Seattle Reign are two-time first place regular season finishers . Head coach and general manager Laura Harvey has always put together an exciting roster to watch and this year will be no different . Scottish international midfielder Kim Little is slated to have another impressive showing .
Portland Thorns FC vs. Orlando Pride
April 17 – Providence Park
Canadians : Christine Sinclair , Josee Belanger , Kaylyn Kyle
Sunday 's match marks the first-ever meeting between Orlando and Portland and the first of two games between the clubs during the 2016 regular season .
Keep your eye out on captain Sinclair , who has been assigned a playmaking role by new Portland coach Mark Parsons . If pre-season was any indication , she 'll be racking up assists .
The Pride are a wildcard going into their inaugural season . Coach Tom Sermanni is familiar with Kyle and Bélanger from his time working with Canada 's John Herdman as an assistant coach and technical director . During exhibition action , Bélanger was used as an attacking fullback , similar to her role with the national team .
NOTES : The EXCELeration camp is under way in Burnaby , B.C. , for seven national team players who are n't members of professional clubs : Kadeisha Buchanan , Gabrielle Carle , Jessie Fleming , Nichelle Prince , Rebecca Quinn , Deanne Rose and Rhian Wilkinson . On a recent call with the media , coach John Herdman confirmed there would be two of these 12-day camps , the current one and another in May .
“ We worked across a four-year plan in the lead up to an Olympic game and we recognized that years two and three of that plan had centralized development for a lot of players , ” Herdman explained .
“ We thought this year , coming into the pinnacle event , the Olympics and the end of the quad [ cycle ] , we would do things a bit differently and how we would approach this year was to ensure our senior players were in a playing environment , a top playing environment , where they were preparing like players who play every week . ”
The seven will be working on individual focus plans and individualize the support they get from the physical , mental and technical staff .
One player missing from that list is Ashley Lawrence . Herdman explained she is back in Toronto for routine medical reasons and is n't injured . She 'll join the group for the next 12-day camp .
Sportsnet 's Soccer Central podcast , hosted by James Sharman , takes an in-depth look at the beautiful game and offers timely and thoughtful analysis on the sport 's biggest issues .

Ingalls Shipbuilding Launches Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyer Ralph Johnson ( DDG 114 )
Huntington Ingalls Industries ' ( HII ) Ingalls Shipbuilding division launched Ralph Johnson ( DDG 114 ) , the company 's 30th Arleigh Burke-class ( DDG 51 ) guided missile destroyer , on Saturday .
DDG 114 is named to honor Pfc . Ralph Henry Johnson , who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions that saved others during the Vietnam War . Johnson shouted a warning to his fellow Marines and hurled himself on an explosive device , saving the life of one Marine and preventing the enemy from penetrating his sector of the patrol 's perimeter . Johnson died instantly . The Charleston , S.C. , native had only been in Vietnam for two months and a few days when he was killed at the age of 20 .
On April 20 , 1970 , President Richard M. Nixon posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor , the highest recognition and honor a member of the United States military can receive . On Sept. 5 , 1991 , 23 years after his heroic act , the Veterans Hospital in Charleston was renamed the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Hospital .
In September 2014 , Georgeann McRaven , ship sponsor and wife of retired Adm. William McRaven , former commander , U.S. Special Operations Command , attended the Ralph Johnson keel laying and proclaimed the ship to be “ truly and fairly laid . ”
According to the shipbuilder , the highly capable , multi-mission ship can conduct a variety of operations , from peacetime presence and crisis management to sea control and power projection , all in support of the United States ' military strategy . Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are capable of simultaneously fighting air , surface and subsurface battles . The ship contains myriad offensive and defensive weapons designed to support maritime defense needs well into the 21st century .
CHICAGO -- The Chicago White Sox continued their attempt to revamp their offense , and again used the pitching staff to do it .
The White Sox acquired third baseman Matt Davidson from the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for closer Addison Reed . Davidson , 22 , appeared in just 31 games ( 18 starts at third base ) this past season with the Diamondbacks but put up impressive numbers in Triple-A .
`` We feel he has the potential to be a middle-of-the-order run producer for a long time , whether that starts on Opening Day 2014 or soon thereafter , we 'll have to figure out over the coming weeks and months as we come to know him and see him for ourselves , '' White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said .
`` He obviously was young for the Triple-A level last year at age 22 and although he has a good approach at the plate and the ball jumps off the bat , there is a little refinement to take place and we 'll decide if that needs to take place here or at the Triple-A level . I do feel that when he does get here he will be here for a long time . We have to pick the right time to start that . ''
At Triple-A Reno in 2013 , Davidson batted .280 with a .350 on-base percentage and .481 slugging percentage . He hit 17 home runs with 74 RBIs and scored 55 runs . He was a Pacific Coast League midseason All-Star and was named MVP of the Futures Game in New York after hitting a go-ahead , two-run home run for the United States .
The 35th pick in the 2009 draft entered the season ranked by Baseball America as Arizona 's No . 4 overall prospect and top-ranked power hitter in the Diamondbacks ' organization .
Reed , 24 , recorded 40 saves for the White Sox this past season , fifth-most in the American League and tied for fourth in franchise history . He had a 3.79 ERA with 72 strikeouts over 68 relief appearances . Over three seasons with the White Sox , the former third-round draft pick had 69 saves and 138 strikeouts over 136 appearances with a 4.17 ERA .
Arizona GM Kevin Towers said Reed will be given every opportunity to be Arizona 's closer coming out of spring training .
`` I 'm going into spring training and I 'm going to try to do everything I can to prove to them that that ninth inning belongs to me and compete for that job , '' Reed said . `` Closer is the only thing I 've ever dreamed of , the only thing I 've ever wanted , so I 'm going to make their decision as tough as possible to put me in any position other than the ninth inning . ''
Defensively , Davidson is still considered to be a work in progress , but had progressed under former Diamondbacks coach Matt Williams , a former major league third baseman himself .
`` He has a strong arm , good hands , '' Hahn said . `` The question you 'll hear time to time from scouts , and has been written about , is the lateral movement . We think it 's improved and it will continue to improve . We see him there for a long time once the development is finished . ''
The trade comes one week after the White Sox sent Hector Santiago to the Los Angeles Angels and received center fielder Adam Eaton from Arizona in a three-team swap .
`` While it 's certainly never easy giving up home-grown players like Santiago or Addison Reed , guys we have drafted and developed and have had success , we did feel it was imperative to start addressing some of these position-player issues that we have in a way that can not only help us in 2014 but perhaps more importantly help us in the long haul , '' Hahn said . `` We feel we have gotten a good start at doing that over the last 12 months . ''

Tax benefits , long-term reduction in electricity bill and a booming demand generated by government policies . Here 's why the
Mumbai 's young and smart are looking up to the sun to cash in on the riches
If cutting down on expenses has been a prime savings priority , get a load of this . A solar power plant of 5 KW ( kilo watt ) , your requirement if you live in an average Mumbai-sized 2BHK , will cost you ` 4 lakhs . It 's a one-time cost that , over 25 years , will bring down your per-unit cost to ` 2-3 per unit , or in lay terms , cut your monthly bill of ` 3,000 to say ` 50 .
Interested ? There 's more .
In 2014 , Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his goal of increasing India 's solar power capacity to 100 giga watts by 2022 — five times higher than the previous target . If that 's accomplished , it will make India a world leader in renewable energy . Towards that end , at the just announced Union Budget , finance minister Arun Jaitely declared that 7,000 railway stations will be fed with solar power by mid-year , and that work has already begun over 300 railway stations .
It 's little wonder then that the city 's young , smart entrepreneurs have jumped onto the solar bandwagon .
Plugging into the sun
A commerce graduate from Matunga 's Podar College Hiren Bhanushali signed up for a two-day solar power awareness programme at Borivli 's Khadi and Village Industries Commission out of curiosity . “ It was a very short course , but I got a basic knowledge about solar power — the types of panels , their applications and the job opportunities in the sector , ” says the 23-year-old , who followed this up with a 10-day course at kWatt ( Solutions Pvt . Ltd ) , an IIT-Bombay incubated firm which provides solar power solutions . What the course involved was hands-on training on how to install solar panels , electricity bill analysis , shadow analysis and site inspection . “ I wo n't say it was enough , but it gives you a head-start . I spent the next four months doing market research and then reaching out to relevant people . I also train the contractors I work with , ” he says . Six months ago , he set up Super Watt Power Solutions LLP , a solar power solutions firm that specialises in designing , integration and rooftop installation of solar systems that help convert solar energy to electric energy . “ We ask the client to share the past year 's electricity bill to understand the consumption pattern . Then we do a bill analysis followed by a site survey , where we look for shadow-free areas . After that , we make a proposal , ” he says .
What Major Priyanka ( centre ) , estimates her six-month turnover for Visol Renewable Energy Solution , which she set up with Aparna Kshirsagar and Jyoti Prakash
How much money is there in the business ? Bhanushali , who is currently juggling 10 projects , estimates a turnover of ` 2 crore for these contracts , which includes work on a 15-floor SRA building with 800 tenants .
The guides
kWatt , when it was formed in 2013 , envisioned economising renewables . The firm with a six-member team was incubated in SINE ( Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship ) at IIT , Bombay . Founded by Dr Chetan Solanki , professor , Department of Energy Science and Engineering at IIT , Bombay , it also has a separate advisory board . While kWatt provides solar power solutions , it conducts regular training sessions to induct more into the industry .
“ We have about six to seven training courses with modules on both hands-on installation and entrepreneurship . Initially , we started off by reaching out to engineering colleges , as we wanted to lay the foundation for the future trainers . Later , we got
into corporate training programs , ” says 26-year-old Akash Sharma , one of the team members . Today , the institute — a 10-day course here will set you back by ` 40,000 — trains over 2,000 students annually .
“ This is a cheap source of energy that levels the cost at ` 3-5/unit for 25 years , ” says Sharma .
Among kWatt 's former students is former Army officer , Major Priyanka , who after completing the course last year , set up her own firm , Visol Renewable Energy Solution , along with two friends Aparna Kshirsagar and Jyoti Prakash . She estimates the six month turnover of her firm — which specialises in setting up independent power plants and solar water heater installations — at approximately around ` 15 lakhs . “ So I 'd say , business is good , ” she smiles . The push , she adds , is government generated . “ The government has created a demand of 100 GW , and India has done only 9 GW so far . Naturally there are many more players in the market now , funding is available and component prices are dropping — every six months , there 's a new price . ”
Among the more reputed players to have entered the market is the $ 1 billion Mahindra Group 's five-year-old Mahindra Susten which last year , introduced its first training course for an all-women batch of eight . “ The way solar industry is shaping up , every household is going to have a solar roof top in the future , ” says CEO Basant Jain . The course , conducted at Susten 's Thane-based institute , is open for all women who are 10+2 qualified or more — while the course is technical , one does n't need a science background to qualify .
Demand will rise
Dombivli resident Jignesh Gajra who has installed a solar water heater at his home , has seen a marked difference in the electricity bill . “ I live in a 1BHK flat , and since the time I 've installed the solar water heater , my bill has gone down from ` 3,000 to ` 1,200 . I am now in talks for installing a complete solar power panel for my house , ” says the 31-year-old software engineer .
If cutting on electricity costs was n't incentive enough , those who invest in solar energy are given tax benefits , says Sharma , adding , “ There 's a rule in Maharashtra that makes it compulsory for new buildings to install solar water heaters . PWD and other government departments have been asked to supply 15 per cent of generated electricity through solar . There 's pressure at a global level to reduce carbon emission , thanks to the G20 Summit . That 's why the government has to take steps . But , at the end of the day , we all stand to benefit . ”

MIDLOTHIAN , Texas The man killed alongside a former Navy SEAL sniper at a Texas shooting range was helping his friend work with a troubled war veteran , and the outing was intended to be a `` therapeutic situation , '' his relatives said Friday following his funeral .
Hundreds of people attended the service for Chad Littlefield , who along with his friend , `` American Sniper '' author Chris Kyle , was fatally shot last weekend . Authorities have said the former Marine they were trying to help suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and turned on the two men at the shooting range .
Littlefield 's father-in-law , Tom Montgomery , defended the notion of helping troubled war veterans through target practice . He said Kyle regularly took veterans to the shooting range , and that Littlefield often assisted in efforts to help veterans .
`` As a gesture of friendship , that 's the only way I can describe it , he was asked to help Chris in this endeavor , '' Montgomery said . `` I think this was a form of relaxation , a form of therapy . ''
Police say the suspect , 25-year-old Eddie Ray Routh , shot Littlefield and Kyle multiple times on Feb. 2 before fleeing . He later told his sister and brother-in-law that the men `` were out shooting target practice and he could n't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him , '' according to a search warrant . Routh is jailed a $ 3 million bail .
The men could not have anticipated Routh 's actions , Montgomery said , adding that Littlefield enjoyed assisting Kyle with his nonprofit , which provided in-home fitness equipment to physically and emotionally wounded veterans .
Kyle , 38 , established the nonprofit after leaving the Navy in 2009 following four tours of duty in Iraq , where he earned a reputation as one of the military 's most lethal snipers . His wartime account , `` American Sniper , '' was a best-seller .
`` I have to believe that Chris Kyle with all his military background and specialized training was quite capable of reading people , '' Montgomery said .
Hundreds turned out Friday to honor Littlefield at First Baptist Church in Midlothian , near Dallas . Although Littlefield was n't a member of the military , Patriot Guard Riders led the procession as a tribute to his efforts on behalf of veterans and formed a ring around the parking lot and church entrance . Hundreds of other people lined local streets to watch the procession pass .
Littlefield , who had a 7-year-old daughter with his wife Leanne , was remembered for his bedrock character .
`` He was a man of deep commitment and character , '' the Rev . Kenny Lowman said during the service .
Montgomery said Littlefield and Kyle bonded a few years ago as soccer dads watching their children play , and that their families occasionally vacationed together .
`` People develop these ethics over a lifetime , '' he said . `` I think Chad was the type of person who developed them and did what was right , even when no one was looking . ''
A memorial service for Kyle is planned for Monday at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington .
The Telegraph and Guardian are violently agreeing with each other today – not quite a first but an eye-opener . The Guardian presents the results of a Guardian/ICM poll into attitudes centred on the economy , while The Telegraph looks at the latest results from the British Social Attitudes survey , which has been running for 30 years and is a rich source on the mood of the nation .
The Guardian reports that while 56 % of people recognize that a recovery is under way ( with 26 % “ Do n't Know ” and 19 % disagreeing ) , only 18 % agree that it benefits their family . Four out of five people have not seen clear evidence of an economic recovery in their own circumstances .
When asked what they think lies behind this economic anxiety , and given a multiple choice of reasons , more plumped for “ Immigrants undercutting workers ” ( 46 % ) than any other reason while 40 % blamed ruthless companies . Next in line was “ Labour 's mistakes ” ( at 40 % ) ahead of “ Coalition mistakes ” ( on 36 % ) so people have long memories in this area .
And the main worry of people was that wages were lagging behind costs ( 57 % ) , a clear explanation of why individuals are not seeing a recovery . The expanding economy can in part be explained by more people being in the country generating wealth , but few very few Britons feel better off as most of the additional numbers are in low-paid work .
Turning to the Telegraph and the British Social Attitudes survey , their Social Affairs Editor , John Bingham , reports that : “ Almost half the population now believes that a decade of mass migration has not only harmed the economy but undermined “ British culture ” , the annual British Social Attitudes survey shows. ” This aligns pretty closely with the outcome of the Guardian/ICM poll . Also , “ more than eight out of 10 people now support a major tightening of rules on access to benefits and curbs on overall immigration , ” while the Guardian poll showed 77 % wanting to reduce immigration “ a little ” or “ a lot ” .
The British Social Attitudes Study also discovered signs of a rejection of multiculturalism and a greater emphasis on “ British-ness ” compared to attitudes of 10 years ago , when people were much more prepared to accept the smaller numbers of immigrants that the country had then . John Bingham reports fears that unless immigration is controlled , racism will increase .
Interestingly , another result of The Guardian/ICM poll was in people 's views of politicians . The top two concerns over politicians were that 56 % thought they broke their promises and 44 % saw their ranks packed with careerists .
Of course , we know that while Britain remains in the EU , there is precious little the British Government ( or rather what remains of it after Brussels has taken most of its powers away ) can do to curb immigration . However , they still want to be elected , because they are careerists and they do n't “ do ” much else other than politics , so they have to spin lies to us on curbing immigration , knowing full well they can not deliver .
These two surveys show that a majority of the public have rumbled the career politicians and their deceits , which explains why so many are turning to UKIP , the only party that offers a credible solution to the mass immigration problem .
NetApplications
Despite a drop in December , Apple 's iOS remained the top platform for mobile browsing , according to the latest stats from NetApplications .
Throughout December , iOS carved out a 52 percent share of the mobile market , down from 54 percent in November and 61 percent in October , but still in the lead . Google 's Android ended December with a 16 percent share , a dip from the prior two months .
Drilling down further , the iPhone accounted for 25 percent of all mobile browsing and the iPad 24 percent , leaving the iPod Touch with 2 percent . Android 2.3 was the most popular version of Google 's OS in terms of mobile browsing , followed by 2.2 and 2.1 . Devices running Honeycomb 3.2 and 3.1 picked up a 1 percent share .
But nestled in second place between iOS and Android was Java ME ( Micro Edition ) , a mobile platform found predominantly on feature phones . Smartphones have continued to surge in popularity this past year . But less-pricey feature phones still hold a fair chunk of the mobile marketplace as evidenced by Java ME 's 21 percent share in December .
Trailing the big three were Nokia 's Symbian with almost 6 percent of the mobile browsing market and RIM 's BlackBerry with 3.5 percent .
Looking at specific devices , Samsung 's Galaxy Tab grabbed almost half a percentage point . And though it 's been hot among consumers , Amazon 's Kindle Fire accounted for just one-tenth of a percentage point in the mobile browsing world last month , according to NetApplications .

Who could have guessed that the goose who lays golden eggs was actually a fish ?
Almas is the Russian word for diamonds . How appropriate that Almas Caviar should be in the same price range . A 1 kilogram tin of these Iranian fish eggs will cost you a stagaring £25,000 or $ 49,800 !
Unlike traditional Beluga caviars , Almas Caviar is white in appearance . That is because these eggs come from a 100 year old albino Sturgeon from the Caspian Sea . Supposedly , the lighter the color of Beluga Caviar the older is the fish and the more elegant and exquisite is the flavor .
The caviar comes packaged in an attractive 24K gold tin and can only be purchased from Caviar House & Prunier in London 's Picadilly , which is also where you can get Britain 's most expensive meal .

Syria 's deputy prime minister said that neither side is strong enough to win the country 's civil war . He denied reports , however , that the government would call for a ceasefire if the proposed Geneva peace talks take place .
“ Neither the armed opposition nor the regime is capable of defeating the other side . This zero balance of forces will not change for a while , ” Qadri Jamil told the Guardian on Thursday .
The two-year conflict has already killed more than 100,000 people and displaced more than one million refugees .
Jamil added that the Syrian economy has lost an estimated $ 100bn during the war - the equivalent of two years of normal production .
On Friday , the deputy PM denied he had told the Daily Star that Damascus would call for a ceasefire in the country . Speaking with RT Arabic , Jamil said that the report was “ substantially inaccurate and incorrect . ”
“ I did n't speak at all about the cessation of fire by the time of the Geneva-2 conference , ” he said , adding that it is not yet clear when exactly the peace talks will take place and for how long – most likely for only two or three days . “ Does it make any sense to demand a cease-fire for two or three days ? ” he said .
It is the goals of the Geneva-2 talks that Jamil was speaking about , he said . Those include ending external interference into the conflict , which would help to “ stop the infinite violence ” in Syria and to launch a political process . “ He [ the Guardian reporter ] called it a cease-fire , ” Jamil noted .
Since it might be difficult to put an end to violence , “ as an option ” the idea of international monitors could be considered , the politician told RT Arabic . Jamil emphasized that he was voicing the proposal in a personal capacity “ but not on behalf of the government . ”
Jamil had told the British daily that if the armed opposition in Syria accepts the ceasefire , it would have to be monitored “ under international observation. ” He added that such supervision could be provided by UN peacekeepers , assuming they came from friendly or neutral countries .
Moscow and Washington say they are committed to bringing both sides of the conflict to the negotiating table at the Geneva-2 peace conference . An earlier set of talks in Geneva broke up last year after just one day . No Syrians attended the event .
Differences remain between Russia and the US over who should take part in Geneva-2 . The US wants the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition ( SNC ) to drop its boycott of the talks and be the only opposition delegation at the conference . The SNC is calling on Assad to step down and previously stated that its demand is non-negotiable .
Russia has proposed that a combined delegation of Kurds also be present at Geneva-2 .
But Jamil said that outside powers must stop trying to influence the outcome of events in Syria . He added that the Syrian government would be pushing to “ end external intervention , a ceasefire and the launching of a peaceful political process in a way that the Syrian people can enjoy self-determination without outside intervention and in a democratic way . ”
Jamil is the leader of the secular People 's Will Party and co-chair of the Popular Front for Change and Liberation . He was appointed last year to end the monopoly of the ruling Ba'ath party in the Syrian government .
“ We wanted to give a lesson to both sides to prepare for a government of national unity and break the unilateral aspect of the regime – and break the fear in opposition circles of sitting in front of the regime , ” he said .
He added that Western countries need to step away in order for change to develop in Syria .
“ For all practical purposes the regime in its previous form has ended . In order to realize our progressive reforms we need the West and all those who are involved in Syria to get off our shoulders , '' he said .
Ahead of the Geneva conference , French President Francois Hollande stated that he is in favor of sending weapons “ in a controlled environment ” to the FSA . `` The Russians regularly send [ weapons ] but we will do it in a broader context , with a number of countries and a framework which can be controlled , because we can not have a situation where weapons end up with Islamists , '' Hollande said during a press conference in the Malian capital of Bamako .
Meanwhile , Jamil said that he did n't believe the UN 's report on the August 21 chemical attack was fully objective , citing evidence provided by Russia that the chemical weapons could have been sold to the rebels by fundamentalists from Libya . Last month 's attack is believed to have killed over 1,000 people .
Although the shell casings that allegedly contained sarin gas were Soviet-made , they were exported during the 1970s and were since loaded with chemicals by fundamentalists in Syria .
Speaking at the Valdai Club , a conference of Western politicians and Russia experts , Russian President Vladimir Putin said that although he could not be certain that the Syrian government would be able to destroy its chemical weapons within such a strict time frame , he was hopeful that it would .
“ I can not be 100 percent sure about it . But everything we have seen so far in recent days gives us confidence that this will happen…I hope so , ” Putin said .
“ Please do n't jump down my throat , ” Taylor Grin thought as he approached his training instructor with a request .
It was 2013 , and Grin was a few weeks into Air Force basic training at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland . He had just learned which religious services were available to trainees — Catholic , several Protestant denominations , Jewish , Muslim and Buddhist , among others .
Grin , then 26 , considered himself a secular humanist , someone who pursues an ethical life without a belief in God . With no chaplain-facilitated service for trainees like him , he wanted to start one — and became a key player in a national culture war playing out within the U.S. military .
With a commander 's blessing , Grin and seven others met in a lobby Sundays , picking up new members from recruits headed to nearby restrooms . The weekly meetings now attract 1,000 trainees or more , a major share of the roughly 3,800 who attend religious services each week .

Surveys suggest humanists , atheists and agnostics — among the many who register no religious preference when asked — make up a rising percentage of Americans , in and out of the military .
Based on a recommendation of the Armed Forces Chaplains Board , a Defense Department memo this year added more than 100 beliefs — including humanism , paganism , shamanism , three forms of Wicca and more than 90 previously unlisted variations of Protestantism — to supplement its recognized faith groups . It more than doubled the total , to 221 .
Chaplains use the list — once called the “ Faith Group Code ” but now the “ Faith and Belief Code ” — to assess the religious needs of a unit . Military officials say it will allow them to more accurately gauge what the troops believe . But it does n't entitle every group to representation by uniformed clergy in the chaplain corps — that list remains much smaller .
Atheist groups , who failed in an attempt to establish a chaplaincy in 2015 , see the expanded list as a step toward one day being included , but many view the idea of secular chaplains as absurd .
Beliefs without an obligation to a higher power are not religions , said Travis Weber , who directs the Center for Religious Liberty . He sees the new list as part of an “ assault on chaplains ” who no longer can freely teach tenets of their faith — particularly about sex and gender — that go against the military 's new inclusiveness .
“ There are a number of chaplains who believe their faith is at odds with what is being pushed by trends , by society and by the government , ” said Weber , whose website lists cases of chaplains who have been disciplined for expressing their views on homosexuality .
The clash also has been noted by advocates for secular and minority beliefs such as the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , which in the past had been fielding about 110 complaints a month about chaplains , many involving unwanted proselytizing . This year , it jumped to between 250 and 400 monthly complaints , said Mikey Weinstein , a former Air Force officer who helped start the group .
“ The state of religious freedom in the military is critical , ” Weinstein said . “ The current landscape is a disaster — it 's a battlefield . ”
The Air Force would n't make Lackland chaplains available for interviews . Volunteers at the humanist service say the chaplains have n't actively opposed it — one helped them start it in 2013 — but they make no effort to tell trainees about it .
Air Force atheists
Every Sunday , Vicki Gettman , 40 , a former Army staff sergeant , drives from her home in Schertz to set up a projector in the auditorium of Lackland 's Pfingston Reception Center . Air Force basic trainees file in around 12:30 p.m .
Lackland trainees are free to attend any religious service , and many take the opportunity to learn about other people 's faiths . Roughly half of those who choose the two-hour secular humanist service say they 're Christian , Gettman said . Most of the rest are atheists and agnostics , with a sprinkling of Satanists , Scientologists , the Norse religions and others , she said .
The meetings are a refereed discussion of a range of topics — morality , mortality , ethics , grief , stress — but no worship of a deity or deference to a religious leader . Gettman is endorsed by the Washington , D.C.-based Humanists Society as a chaplain and celebrant but has no such status in the military chaplaincy . She identifies as an atheist and agnostic , too .
“ I do think using the word ‘ atheist ' is important , ” Gettman said . “ It 's a scary word to some people , but as I understand , humanism is the philosophy to live your life the best way that you can . ”
The room filled with hoots and hollers at a recent service , which opened with a dance competition . The raucous crowd bellowed in unison as Gettman explained the rules : no debating , no proselytizing — “ you 're not going to bash someone else 's thought process , ” she said .
Fewer than 1 in 4 raised hands when asked if they identified as atheists , agnostics or humanists . The Air Force does not allow interviews with basic trainees , but of roughly 20 who were interviewed about the meetings after they graduated , only three or four said they were humanists .
Despite the serious topics , the graduates said , trainees consider the meetings something of a diversion .
“ Many religious people I know went there just for the laid-back atmosphere , ” said Jeremy Wentworth , who trained in January . “ I 'm not a religious person , but it 's a good way to get out of the dorms on Sunday and have a few laughs . It also kept you up to date with news . ”
Others , such as Senior Airman Sarah Soffer , said she had n't found a religious service she liked but was attracted to the humanist meetings “ to interact with trainees and adults and feel like an equal for a bit . ”
At one service , more than 30 trainees took turns at a microphone to offer opinions on the day 's question : Why are young people less religiously affiliated ? Many who said they were Christian or raised in a religious background spoke of a desire to avoid conflict and not be defined by stereotypes .
Airman Sydni Smith attended for weeks , stopped going when she realized the topics were repeating , then returned . “ I came here because I realized I am a humanist , these are my people and this is what I believe , ” Smith told the crowd .
Some trainees were less serious , mirthfully making hand gestures denoting nihilism or Satanism .
Several said they came primarily for the last half-hour , what Gettman calls “ nerd news. ” Trainees do n't have much access to the outside world , and after she began sharing videos on the latest developments in science , some trainees asked for updates from the world of professional video gaming — which led to recaps of sports scores , news headlines and occasional trailers of upcoming movies .
“ We try to end our conversations on death in a fun way , ” Gettman said .
Backstage beginnings
Religious services for basic trainees are a weekly respite from an otherwise intense schedule , and those who do n't attend are often assigned to clean their barracks . For Grin , in the spring of 2013 , it seemed unfair that his two options were to go to church or mop .
“ When you put folks in a high-stress environment , a deliberately high-stress environment , you 're going to need ways for trainees to recoup , ” Grin said . “ You 've got religious trainees — they have an institution where they can get their needs met . What about us ? ”
Grin grew up in Utah in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . His growing doubts about faith led to friction with family members . Before he entered basic training , Grin reached out to the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers , which has advocated for nonreligious service members since 1998 .
Its president , a former Army officer named Jason Torpy , contacted Gettman , the leader of its San Antonio chapter , and asked if she would help Grin hold meetings . It took weeks after Grin approached his training instructor with the request , but Gettman found a commander to approve it .
“ About seven other guys who were in my flight were really interested in these services , ” Grin recalled . “ Some were Christians , some were humanists , others had no name for their beliefs and were curious if ‘ humanist ' had what they already believed . ”
Some dropped out , but the group attracted others , he said , including atheists who had been attending Buddhist services nearby . It numbered 20 by the time he graduated .
The Air Force moved them to a slightly larger space , a storage area behind a stage , accessible only by a small side door . Catholic Mass was celebrated on the stage itself , and the humanists could n't hear each other when the Catholics sang .
“ If there was a fire , the Air Force would have lost all its atheists , ” Debbie Bienen , a volunteer at the time , recalled of the growing numbers crammed behind the stage .
Gettman used the fire hazard argument to secure the larger space used today . Last November , the meetings regularly started drawing about 1,000 trainees , the room 's capacity . Organizers have had to turn some away .
The services still go unmentioned during trainee orientation or in brochures listing available religious services . And Torpy said commanders have rejected attempts by his group to start similar meetings at Army basic training facilities at Fort Sill , Oklahoma , and Fort Jackson , South Carolina .
But after the Navy held off a request for two years , a humanist meeting now has grown to 85 attendees at its boot camp at Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois , said Ray Doeksen , an Army veteran and lay leader there . He still ca n't advertise it to trainees .
The ultimate goal is a humanist chaplain , Doeksen said , adding , “ I wo n't be happy until we 're on a level playing field . ”
The chaplain 's role
Even in the Revolutionary War , chaplains tried to provide religious services for soldiers of faiths not their own . The military has added Buddhist and Hindu chaplains to recognize the diversity in its ranks . But adding atheists and humanists would be going too far , said former chaplain Ron Crews , executive director of the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty .

“ An atheist chaplain is an oxymoron , ” he said . “ The chaplain motto is for ‘ God and country , ' and for an atheist , there is no god , so how can they raise their right hand and say they 're for ‘ God and country ? ' ”
A Pew Research Center survey of more than 35,000 Americans found that adults describing themselves as Christian declined by nearly 8 percentage points between 2007 and 2014 , while those calling themselves atheist , agnostic or “ nothing in particular ” went from just over 16 percent to almost 23 percent . The change was more pronounced among those ages 18 to 24 .
Catholics and Baptists have the largest church memberships in the military , a combined 26 percent , according to Defense Department numbers . An additional 28 percent identify as “ Christian ( no preference ) . ” About a quarter reported no religious preference in a 2014 survey , but it 's unclear how many of them were atheists .
“ That 's the $ 25 question , ” said Col. Jay Johns , an Army chaplain and the executive director of the Armed Forces Chaplains Board . “ We have no way of knowing what they actually adhere to . ”
The new list of 221 faiths and beliefs is an attempt at better record keeping and in future surveys “ forces them to say , ‘ I am this , that or another thing , ' ” he said .
“ A lot of people have confused the concept of recognized faiths and beliefs , as if the DOD is saying some are legitimate and some are not , ” he said . “ That is not the intent . ”
Amid criticism from both sides — that military religious services do n't treat atheists equally or should n't include them at all — officials still use the term “ religious ” to describe them .
“ If we 're going to offer religious education activities for believers , then we should also offer it for nonbelievers. ” said Bob Rubio , a spokesman for Lackland 's 37th Training Wing .
Asked how commanders decide to allow humanist services , Johns said by email that “ when a religious need is identified , chaplains ensure that the need is met either through direct delivery of ministry or by securing another provider . ”
It 's an “ understandable linguistic battle , ” Doeksen said . “ A hundred years ago , it was , ‘ How can you be a chaplain if you 're not a Christian ? ' ”
Nick Fish , the national program director for American Atheists , made a similar observation : “ It 's not so much an oxymoron , it 's a limitation of language . Chaplains do n't just lead religious services , they represent all members of a unit . ”
Humanist groups at West Point and the Naval and Air Force academies are clubs , sponsored by commanders but not affiliated with chaplains . That might work elsewhere , some officials suggested .
“ If we become just a club , that fails to recognize that humanism occupies the same cultural and spiritual place that other religions do for troops , ” countered Grin , now an airman in the 177th Cyber Aggressor Squadron in Wichita , Kansas .
The humanists at Lackland were a community , he said .
“ It was n't just that I had someone there offering discourse on how to live a good life , ” Grin said . “ The most important aspect of humanism in a crisis , to me , is that humanists take responsibility for reaching out . We band together because we 're all we got . ”

The Anaheim chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers ' Association ( PHWA ) announced today that forward Andrew Cogliano has been selected as the Ducks ' nominee for the 2014-15 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy . The Masterton Trophy is presented annually to the NHL player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance , sportsmanship and dedication to hockey . The winner will be selected at the end of the regular season by the full PHWA 's 30 chapters .
Cogliano , 27 ( 6/14/87 ) , has scored 15-13=28 points with a +4 rating and 14 penalty minutes ( PIM ) in 79 games with the Ducks this season . A two-time Masterton nominee with the Ducks , Cogliano became Anaheim 's all-time leading Ironman with his 277th consecutive game as a Duck on Mar . 3 at Arizona . He has also scored three shorthanded goals this season , one shy of the single-season franchise record .
Cogliano is the NHL 's reigning Ironman at 619 consecutive games , having never missed a game in his NHL career . Only two players in NHL history have played more consecutive games to start their careers , including Doug Jarvis ( the NHL 's all-time Ironman overall with 964 consecutive games from 1975-88 ) and Andy Hebenton ( second with 630 consecutive games from 1955-64 ) . Cogliano is the eighth player in NHL history to have a consecutive game streak of 600 games or more . The only two others in the last 20 years are Jay Bouwmeester ( 737 ) and Henrik Sedin ( 679 ) .
Originally selected by Edmonton in the first round ( 25th overall ) of the 2005 NHL Draft , Cogliano has appeared in 619 career NHL games with Anaheim and Edmonton , earning 119-146=265 points with 198 PIM . He was acquired by Anaheim in exchange for a second-round selection in the 2013 NHL Draft on July 12 , 2011 . The 5-10 , 184-pound forward has appeared in back-to-back Stanley Cup Playoffs with the Ducks , collecting 1-7=8 points with 12 PIM in 20 games .
Australia has among the world 's highest concentrations of stem cell businesses advertising medical and cosmetic treatments online , despite a lack of evidence about the efficacy or safety of many of those procedures , a study has found .
A senior author on the paper , Prof John Rasko from the University of Sydney , has called on Australia 's medical regulator , the Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) , to close a loophole that , he said , was allowing the businesses to promote and offer potentially ineffective or harmful treatments .
Homeopathy not effective for treating any condition , Australian report finds Read more
Websites frequently made implausible claims , were vague about the medical conditions for which they could treat or only offered information “ on request ” and used inconsistent terminology , the researchers found .
Stem cells found in bone marrow and umbilical cord blood have long been used to successfully treat some cancers , and blood and immune diseases , but those are among the few proven treatments . Clinical trials by academic centres are exploring the potential of stem cells to treat a wider range of diseases , including multiple sclerosis and diabetes .
However , some operators not affiliated with academic institutions are directly offering to the general public stem cell treatments for diseases still under clinical trial or for which no evidence exists and for which the safety and efficacy is as yet unproven .
“ Over the past decade the public has been very excited about the publicity surrounding stem cells , which are being advertised as nature 's own way of repairing the body , ” Rasko said .
“ We found an increasing number of operators that appear to be preying on the public 's vulnerability and advertising treatments without any proof that the thing they 're selling is actually working or even safe . ”
What had shocked the researchers , Rasko said , was that so many clinics were now operating in Australia . They charged consumers thousands of dollars .
“ It used to be that stem cell tourism was the only way to get these treatments , forcing Australians to fly to developing countries with less stringent medical regulations to get them , ” he said .
It took shonky clinics years to realise they could take advantage of this but take advantage they certainly now have Prof John Rasko
Rasko said the reason stem cell clinics had been able to proliferate in Australia was due to a regulatory loophole that had never been closed .
Autologous treatments involve moving a person 's tissue or cells . For example , a vein would be removed from a patient 's leg and transferred into their heart to bypass a blocked blood vessel . The TGA declared that such treatments could not be considered therapeutic goods and , therefore , did not regulate their use .
It means stem cells taken from and used in the same patient fall into the category of autologous when the donor and the recipient are the same .
“ It allowed doctors to take cells from any parts of the body , manipulate them and reinject them into the body , ” Rasko said .
“ It took shonky clinics years to realise they could take advantage of this but take advantage they certainly now have . ”
Complicating matters is that stem cells used for medical practice and therapeutic purposes are overseen by different regulatory frameworks .
Following pressure from people like Rasko and concerns about the lack of regulation for unproven stem cell treatments , the TGA sought comments from a range of stakeholders and interested parties on whether the regulation applied to some autologous cells would be appropriate . Consultation closed in March last year but no action has been taken .
Chiropractic Board of Australia ‘ should be sacked ' over members ' contentious claims Read more
“ A total of 80 submissions were received , ” a TGA spokeswoman told Guardian Australia .
“ Following this there were a large number of face-to-face meetings with healthcare professionals and other stakeholders and , based on these consultations , a second consultation paper will shortly be released by the TGA to try to resolve these concerns without constraining normal medical practice . ”
Rasko hopes the research by him and his team , published on Friday in the journal Cell Stem Cell , will prompt the TGA to act with more urgency . He believes the World Health Organisation should also develop a policy to ensure guidelines were consistent between countries .
Australians have already died from undergoing expensive and unproven stem cell treatments . In June , a New South Wales coroner found that a 75-year-old woman , Sheila Drysdale , died after undergoing experimental stem cell treatment for her severe dementia .
Coroner Hugh Dillon found that Drysdale died as a direct result of blood loss suffered following the liposuction stem cell procedure that doctors claimed might improve her quality of life by reducing her symptoms .
The procedure was performed by a cosmetic physician at a private facility and Drysdale died shortly after arriving home .
Dillon said the death “ highlights the vulnerability of elderly sick people and their families , desperate for help , to ‘ quack ' medicine ” .
“ I recommend that the TGA and the NSW Ministry of Health consider how best to manage and regulate the provision of ‘ experimental ' or ‘ innovative ' medical or surgical procedures that have not yet been approved following clinical trials or other recognised peer-reviewed evaluation processes , ” he said .
“ Among the issues to considered , I recommend that the questions of potential conflict of interest and informed consent be given high priority . ”

Many indie game developers are keen to tell stories with meaningful messages , but making sure that message is understood can be an enormous challenge .
That was the takeaway from today 's Independent Games Summit session at GDC on Tomorrow Games ' quirky fireplace simulator Little Inferno . Kyle Gray , one of the game 's designers , walked attendees through `` the many mistakes '' the team made during development .
`` If you have a message in your game , the chances are people are n't going to get it , '' he said . `` A lot of people thought Little Inferno was about global warming or a critical commentary on freemium games , but it was n't . ''
In Little Inferno , which was an indie launch title for Wii U and has since been ported to Windows PC , Mac , Linux , Android and iOS , players order goods from an Amazon-like catalog and then toss them in a fireplace . Items and combinations of items give up different effects in the fire . But the story unfolds into a larger , darker narrative .
`` What we were trying to talk about was the team 's own neurosis , that we were all hitting 30 years of age and feeling old , '' he explained . `` We were concerned with time ; making the most of it and not wasting it , like getting out of a job you hate or a bad relationship . People in Little Inferno are just doing the same thing and they do n't realize there is this whole world out there . ''
He said it was `` fine '' that the message did n't seem obvious to many players , and pointed to various online commentary debates about the issue . One of the main problems , he said , was that a significant element of the story was backloaded to the end of the game , which switches , in its final sequences , from the fireplace-view puzzle to a more narrative-based adventure .
`` It 's really risky to put all your cool content at the end of the game , '' he said , adding that the team `` over-thought '' the project , spending two and half years on a development that was originally scoped to last six months .
Ultimately , the promise of launching with the Wii U focused the team on tightening the game , and getting rid of ideas that were considered superfluous , including a section featuring a time-traveling subway . To date , he said , Little Inferno has sold more than a million copies .

Ever since gun silencers were first regulated in the 1930s , they have been used only rarely in violent crimes , with one notable recent exception : In early February 2013 , a former police officer using a silencer on a 9mm Glock shot a young couple sitting in their car in what the Police Foundation called a “ gang-style hit. ” “ Not a single neighbor had heard or seen a thing , ” the Police Foundation wrote in its report about the beginning of a string of murders committed by Christopher Dorner in Southern California . In “ lightning bolt attacks ” over the following 10 days , Dorner killed two police officers and wounded several others—including an officer who was shot nine times but survived—and drew a legion of cops into the mountains , where he eventually shot himself to death as they closed in .
Now , a bill known as the Hearing Protection Act that is quietly making its way through Congress proposes to remove silencers from the list of regulated items under the National Firearms Act of 1934 . The bill—co-sponsored by Rep. Mo Brooks ( R-AL ) , who narrowly missed getting shot in June when a gunman attacked a congressional baseball practice—would make the purchase of a silencer subject only to an instant background check , or potentially to no regulation at all in states that do n't require background checks for gun sales in private , at gun shows and online .
“ There are 300 million firearms out there and [ about ] 1 million silencers , ” a gun industry executive said in June . “ That shows you the relative scale of the business opportunity . ”
The new legislation “ assaults the interests of our nation 's law enforcement officials and threatens our public safety and security , ” David Chipman , a retired ATF special agent and senior policy adviser at Americans for Responsible Solutions , said at a recent congressional hearing . “ When silencers are used in crime , the results are particularly deadly . ”
Donald Trump Jr. has thrown his weight behind the bill : In a 38-minute interview with the CEO of one of the largest gun silencer manufacturers in the nation during his father 's presidential campaign , Trump Jr. argued that the regulation of silencers is just another example of “ arbitrary policies by people who do n't know what they 're talking about. ” When asked by SilencerCo 's CEO Joshua Waldron whether Trump as president would sign the Hearing Protection Act , Trump Jr. responded : “ We would want to go through Congress , we would want to do it the right way , but if you line up those votes , he 's obviously gon na be for it . ”
Silencers currently are legally obtainable after submitting an application , passing a background check , submitting fingerprints , paying a $ 200 fee , and registering the silencer with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms ( ATF ) . Because paperwork must be filed with the overburdened and underfunded agency , wait times can be months-long . The Hearing Protection Act—which House Republicans in June folded into the Sportsmen 's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act ( SHARE Act ) , a bi-partisan package that typically passes with little drama—would do away with these hurdles .
Advocates of the bill argue that silencers have no nefarious purpose , but instead improve conditions for hunters and people who use shooting ranges . Silencers “ reduce the damage that gunshots do to the shooter in terms of their hearing , and reduce the overall noise impact for everyone , ” says Todd Rathner , a gun rights lobbyist and executive director of the NFA Freedom Alliance , which campaigns to roll back restrictions on items regulated by the National Firearms Act . “ If firearm sound suppressors were treated the way lawnmowers and chainsaws were treated , they would be required on firearms , ” Rathner says , adding that opposition to the gear is “ a cynical , knee-jerk political reaction , not one based on knowledge or experience . ”
“ This proposal would pose an additional threat to law enforcement at a time where officer safety is already at increased risk . ”
A recent memo from the Law Enforcement Coalition for Common Sense , signed by more than a dozen current and former law enforcement leaders , argues that deregulating silencers could have “ devastating effects ” on public safety and the safety of law enforcement officers . “ Silencers mask the sound of a gun , changing the sound into one not easily recognized as gunfire , ” the memo says . “ As a result , assassination-style murders become easier , and bystanders may not know to alert first responders…This proposal would pose an additional threat to law enforcement at a time where officer safety is already at increased risk . ”
The push for the bill may also be an effort to boost a potentially lucrative revenue stream for the gun industry , which has been hurting since the presidential election—a phenomenon dubbed the “ Trump Slump. ” ( The gun industry enjoyed record sales under the Obama administration and experienced spikes amid predictions that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 election . But when Trump won , and fears of a massive “ gun confiscation ” could no longer be so easily stoked , the urgency to stock up on firearms and accessories dissipated . ) A month after Trump 's inauguration , SilencerCo , the nation 's largest manufacturer of gun suppressors , was reportedly forced to lay off approximately 50 percent of its workforce .
“ Sales have declined to the degree where…many silencer companies are fearing for their business , ” Phil Sansotta , online marketing manager for silencer manufacturer GEMTECH , told Task & Purpose . “ Right now , everyone is trying to weather the storm . ”
Still , industry leaders see a lucrative market that could be unlocked by the legislation : In an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune in June , SilencerCo President Jason Schauble said , “ There are 300 million firearms out there and [ about ] 1 million silencers . That shows you the relative scale of the business opportunity . ”
Rep. Brooks , who is also pushing legislation that would allow lawmakers to carry sidearms , once said his reasons for carrying a gun are because of “ terrorism ” and “ crime ” and that “ you never know when either one is going to happen. ” Several hours before the silencer bill 's first scheduled hearing on June 14 , Brooks was practicing baseball with other Republican members of Congress on the outskirts of Washington D.C. when a gunman , James Hodgkinson , approached from a nearby YMCA where he 'd been laying in wait and opened fire . Brooks was on deck to bat when he heard “ a loud blam , ” he told CNN . “ And I look around and behind third base , in the third base dugout , which is cinder blocks , I see a rifle and a little bit of a body , and then I hear another blam , and I realize there is an active shooter . ”
Brooks ran , and soon was taking cover on the ground with two or three others as the gunfire continued . I hear a break in the gunfire and decided to take a chance and ran to the dugout , which is…cinder block and down about 2 or 3 feet . ”
By the end of the attack , two congressional aides , two police officers , and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise had been shot . Thankfully none were killed . ( Law enforcement officers responding to the attack shot and killed Hodgkinson . )
What more damage might have been done that day , had Hodgkinson used a silencer ?
Brooks and the other backers of the Hearing Protection Act apparently are unconcerned with that question . On September 12 , the House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing on the SHARE Act and issued final markups . Proponents expect a House floor vote soon , and they expect the legislation to pass .
We 've all had that moment . That dial tone that hums in your head after you glance across the train aisle or spot someone perched upon a park bench or peer into the window at Starbucks and , based on the cover of the book a stranger is reading , zings the hope that he or she must be a kindred spirit , a literary soulmate , because you too dig Mary Gaitskill down to the nasty bone . Or perhaps it 's Netherland being held like a hymnal , the acclaimed novel by Joseph O'Neill that you keep meaning to read and never will , and here it is , being read with such care by someone so cute . If only you could strike up a chat , the two of you might stroll off like French lovers thrown together by capricious fate , scampering to take cover from the christening rain . Romantic fantasy is n't the only driver of curiosity—our inner snob is always clicking away , doing little status checks . In New York City ( ca n't speak for the other metro systems across this great land ) , every subway car is a rolling library , every ride an opportunity to spy on the reading tastes of fellow passengers and make snap judgments that probably would n't hold up in court . Single women in their 30s and 40s gripping a teenage-vampire tale or a Harry Potter—they seem to be hanging out a surrender flag . Those parading the latest Oprah selection might as well honk like geese . Then there are those who defy stereotype . A tall , straw-thin model glides into seated position and extracts a copy of concentration-camp survivor Viktor Frankl 's Man 's Search for Meaning from her bag , instantly making an onlooker ( me ) feel rebuked for assuming she was vacuous and self-centered based on her baby-ostrich stare . In the same car is another , older woman—do men not read anymore ? ( * Seinfeld ' * s Jerry , defensively : “ I read. ” Elaine : “ Books , Jerry ” ) —holding up a Kindle at an angle to catch the light . Unless you were an elf camped on her shoulder , what she was reading was hoarded from view , an anonymous block of pixels on a screen , making it impossible to identify its content and to surmise the state of her inner being , erotic proclivities , and intellectual caliber . She might be reading Alice Munro , patron saint of short-story writers , or some James Patterson sack of chicken feed—how dare she disguise her download from our prying eyes ! And reading an e-book on an iPhone , that 's truly unsporting . It goes the other way as well . How can I impress strangers with the gem-like flame of my literary passion if it 's a digital slate I 'm carrying around , trying not to get it all thumbprinty ? Books not only furnish a room , to paraphrase the title of an Anthony Powell novel , but also accessorize our outfits . They help brand our identities . At the rate technology is progressing , however , we may eventually be traipsing around culturally nude in an urban rain forest , androids seamlessly integrated with our devices . As we divest ourselves of once familiar physical objects—digitize and dematerialize—we approach a Star Trek future in which everything can be accessed from the fourth dimension with a few clicks or terse audibles . Reading will forfeit the tactile dimension where memories insinuate themselves , reminding us of where and when D. H. Lawrence entered our lives that meaningful summer . “ Darling , remember when we downloaded Sons and Lovers in Napa Valley ? ” does n't have quite the same ring to it . The Barnes & Noble bookstore , with its coffee bar and authors ' readings , could go the way of Blockbuster as an iconic institution , depriving readers of the opportunity to mingle with their own kind and paw through magazines for free . Book-jacket design may become a lost art , like album-cover design , without which late-20th-century iconography would have been pauperized . ( Try imagining the rock era without the gold lamé bravura of 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Ca n't Be Wrong or the modernist graveyard of the Sgt . Pepper cover or Andy Warhol 's zippered jeans for the Rolling Stones ' Sticky Fingers—impossible . ) Jacket design is what helped emboss books with a cool factor hitherto lacking . In an essay from his collection There 's Nothing Funny About Design—devoted to book designer Chip Kidd—David Barringer writes , “ The marketing of hardcover books has gone hard-core consumerist , tricking out books into luxury objects and personality accessories . A designer fit for the times , Chip Kidd makes books into coveted objects and conversation pieces , seducing the consumer and flattering the reader. ” At the high end of coveted-object acquisition is the coffee-table book , that chest of dreams , that ocean-liner view . Expensive to produce , difficult to market , a bear to cart around , the coffee-table book is an illustrated commemorative tablet dedicated to the history , appreciation , and subtle nuances of aristocratic objects of contemplation and acquisition ( fashion , flowers , gardens , lavish interiors , jewelry , deceased Hollywood royalty , masterpiece paintings , baseball collectibles , ballerina toe shoes ) . Totems of tasteful extravagance with a tendency to monumentalism , the most monolithic of them—Taschen 's goat ( a 75-pound tribute to the Greatest of All Time , heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali ) , Helmut Newton 's Sumo ( 66 pounds of superbody nudity ) , Peter Beard : Art Edition ( 41 pounds ) , Andy Warhol : “ Giant ” Size ( a relatively svelte 16-pounder ) —are tombstone mothers that need to be trolleyed in from the freight elevator and installed where there 's no danger of their tipping over and flattening some child , pet , pint-size grandparent , or small village . Can the average coffee-table book survive The Vanishing ? Debatable—there 's something about even the most enticing specimen that evokes a weary sigh . Opening it , turning its pages , often just seems like so much work . A newer , more demure method of showcasing one 's literary favorites involves setting the book on a minimalist stage—a wall-mounted frame with a small , built-in ledge upon which rests the book that one is currently reading or that has a personal resonance . It 's like placing a beloved book within a rectangular halo . You walk into the room and there it is , Jonathan Safran Foer 's Everything Is Illuminated staring at you at eye level , daring you to knock its block off .
As music migrates into our iPods , CD collections require less and less room , residing in our heads rather than resounding off the walls .

Others collected opera albums , searching out European imports from specialty shops and amassing souvenirs of their divas assolutas ( Maria Callas , Elisabeth Schwarzkopf ) , much as Broadway-musical fans made their pilgrimages down to Footlight Records to fill in the tiny gaps in their collection of original-cast albums and jazz freaks assembled a mosaic of Blue Note albums into myriad shades of midnight . In my bohemian days ( the exotic reek of incense haunts me still ) , I owned a jukebox—a huge honker , a neon-trimmed sarcophagus—which I studiously stocked with 45s to showcase the catholicity of my pop sensibility , from the Supremes ' “ Up the Ladder to the Roof ” to Elton John and Kiki Dee 's “ Do n't Go Breaking My Heart , ” to Duran Duran 's “ Hungry Like the Wolf , ” to the Clash 's “ ( White Man ) In Hammersmith Palais. ” I was fond of that machine , despite the mockery it inspired , because it was like having a custom-built twin . “ Male record collectors seek mastery over a body of music , almost always as a way of establishing a masculine identity , ” Krin Gabbard argues in his psychosocial study “ Hipsters and Nerds. ” ( Oh , so that 's what I was doing . ) “ The collector makes conscious and unconscious connections to the masculine codes in the music , but he also works at acquiring commanding knowledge that can be carefully deployed in the right surroundings . ”
While most of the NFL world is focused on the free agency activity currently taking place , Mel Kiper Jr. was busy working on a new mock draft . This is Kiper 's 3.0 version of his mock . Last week , fellow ESPN NFL draft analyst Todd McShay weighed in on who he had the Eagles taking . Kiper did n't agree with McShay 's pick , but still had the Eagles taking a defensive back .
Calvin Pryor
COLLEGE : Louisville Class : Jr
HT : 5-11
WT : 207
POS : S Analysis : The Eagles made a move in free agency and added Malcolm Jenkins from the Saints . In terms of starter-worthy talent at the position , I 'll say that means one down and one to go . Pryor is the obvious solution here , a player who can hold his own in coverage but will come downhill against the run and be effective in the box . The Eagles are going to score points . They could use another option at wide receiver , but it 's a deep draft there , and I think the focus will be on defense early .
Here 's Pryor spider graph thanks to Mockdraftable :
Pryor is hardly an uncommon target for the Eagles in mock drafts . The Eagles arguably still need another starting safety . There are currently four safeties on the roster : Malcolm Jenkins , Earl Wolff , Chris Maragos , and Keelan Johnson . Jenkins was signed to be a starter . Wolff is a rookie who showed potential but needs to compete to earn a job . Chris Maragos is depth and a special teams ace . Johnson is a bit of a longshot but has the potential to earn a roster spot with a good showing in training camp and preseason .
But is Pryor the best value pick here ? You be the judge . Here 's a table of all the picks . To read his explanation for each selection , you need to have ESPN In $ ider .
Hillary Clinton now leads Donald Trump at 46 points to 35 , according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll
Donald Trump 's ' p * * * y ' tape blasted a hole in his ratings among voters and allowed Hillary Clinton to open up a double-digit lead , the first full poll since the leaked tape revealed - but before Sunday 's debate .
Likely voters handed Clinton a 46 per cent share to the Republican 's 35 per cent , a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Monday .
The 11-point lead was polled over the weekend , but before the candidates went up against one another at a combative debate on Sunday evening .
On Friday the Washington Post published a 2005 tape recording Trump telling TV host Billy Bush that his fame allowed him to grope women .
Trump and Clinton faced off in a brutal debate on Sunday evening . In a poll conducted before the debate , but after the Trump tape leaked , Clinton has an 11-point lead over her rival
The 2005 tape has blasted a hole in Trump 's polling figures . In a prior poll completed September 19 Clinton had 43 per cent to Trump 's 37
'Grab them by the p * * * y , ' he told Bush on the set of Days Of Our Lives . 'You can do anything . '
Trump remained defiant on Monday , after telling debate viewers that the comments were 'locker room talk ' .
He tweeted a long list of unofficial polls showing him coming out top from Sunday 's battle .
'Debate polls look great - thank you ! # MAGA # AmericaFirst , ' he wrote .
Among the reaction polls listed was one from the conservative Drudge Report , giving the Republican 70 per cent and Clinton 30 . Right-wing news site Breitbart gave him 93 per cent to Clinton 's 7 .
Those polls relied on website visitors clicking their candidate pick , rather than getting responses from a selected cross-section of voters . They therefore can be more representative of a website 's readers than the population as a whole .
Trump tweeted eight separate polls showing him outperforming Clinton in the debate
Meanwhile a CNN/ORC snap poll of debate watchers found that 57 per cent of voters thought Clinton won , compared to 34 for Trump . A YouGov poll had the Democrat ahead by a smaller margin , at 47 per cent to his 42 .
The footage - which Trump put down to 'locker room talk ' in the debate - has caused a furor with top Republicans including John McCain dropping their endorsement for their candidate .
House Speaker Paul Ryan , the party 's most powerful elected representative , is reported to have told lawmakers on a Monday phone call that he would not 'defend ' Trump over the matter .
The scandal boosted Clinton 's numbers in the poll . Her lead was even bigger among registered voters , at 13 points - her largest since the survey began testing the duo last September .
While 52 per cent of respondents said the Trump tape should be an issue in the campaign , 42 per cent said it should not be an issue .
Still , 41 per cent of voters agreed that the remarks were 'completely unacceptable ' versus 31 per cent who labeled them as 'inappropriate , but typical of how some men talk in private with other men ' .
Just 23 per cent of Republicans said the tape should lead to Republican representatives dropping their endorsement of Trump , or calling for the billionaire to remove himself from the presidential race .
The 2005 footage from the set of Days Of Our Lives , pictured , put a bombshell under Trump 's campaign . Trump is shown with actress Arianne Zucker and Billy Bush
Speaker Paul Ryan is reported to have told lawmakers on a Monday phone call that he would not 'defend ' Trump over the footage , although he did not remove his endorsal of the candidate
Trump 's troubles apparently had effects beyond the presidential race : in the question of which party voters wanted to see in charge of Congress , Democrats commanded 49 per cent , against the Republicans ' 42 per cent , the poll showed .
That was the Democrats ' biggest slice of the vote since the government shutdown in October 2009 .
And a Rasmussen tracking poll partially conducted after the tape leaked showed Clinton with a seven-point advantage , at 45 to Trump 's 38 - her biggest since August last year .
Before the Washington Post published the footage of Trump 's 'locker room ' conversation with Billy Bush , the two were virtually even in the Rasmussen survey , at 43 for the Democrat and 42 for the real estate mogul . The latest results were collected from likely voters on October 5 , 6 and 9 .
On May 26 in 1980 five jazz musicians convened at Talent Studio in Oslo , Norway . They were jet-lagged from red eye flights and had a full day of recording ahead of them . The session was the brainchild of the youngest among them , a 26 years old guitarist who 's dream was to bring some of his most admired musicians to play together for the first time as a group . What ensued was one of the most productive and inspiring recording sessions in modern jazz . After a little over one day of recording , the session yielded a double LP album for the ages . This is the story of Pat Metheny 's album 80/81 on the ECM label .
Metheny was not new to the recording location , nor to the ECM label and its manager Manfred Eicher . Back in 1974 , when he played in Gary Burton 's band , he met Eicher and recorded the album Ring . The following year he recoded back to back the album Dreams So Real with Gary Burton and his first solo album Bright Size Life . His first recording at Talent Studio in Oslo , with engineer Jan Erik Kongshaug , was in 1976 for the recording of Gary Burton 's quintet 's Passengers for which he also wrote some of the material . The first two Pat Metheny Group records and the fantastic solo New Chautauqua followed , also recorded by the legendary producer/engineer duo of Eicher and Kongshaug . The tasteful reverb they applied in the studio is now part of the legendary ECM sound , and it worked magic on the fresh style and sound Metheny was creating in the late 70s . After non stop touring , including Joni Mitchell 's Shadows and Light in September of 1979 and with his group early in 1980 , he was ready for his next project .
In a 1978 interview for Downbeat , Pat Metheny expressed his reservations about the restrictions imposed on him by Manfred Eicher : “ If Manfred had his way , every album he did would be six ballads and a bossa nova for an up tune . There are some problems for me with ECM , but it 's still 50 times better than anything else. ” His last 1970s album , American Garage , was indeed a rarity in the ECM catalog being produced by Metheny himself , with the help of Richard Niles . Metheny had the outmost respect for Eicher , at one point saying the only criticism Eicher ever made was “ too commercial ” , a phrase normally absent from a music producer 's vocabulary . In another comment he said : “ To me the only real fault is that Manfred tends to choose artists who do n't know how to swing. ” However by early 1980 Metheny was a star on the jazz scene , and his standing in the jazz world now allowed him to pick who to invite for a recording session . Indeed , on that May 1980 session in Oslo the other four musicians could swing like very few cans .
Metheny did n't just ask four great musicians to come over for a session . He had a clear vision for how they will sound together , and wrote new music with their sound and personality in mind . Interestingly , he also assembled combinations of musicians who have not played or recorded with each other before . Amazing as it sounds , bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Jack DeJohnette , who between the two of them played with most anybody in jazz who is worth listening to in the fifteen years leading to the 80/81 session , have not recorded together up to that point . The pairing together of two tenor sax players , Dewey Redman and Mike Brecker , was also a first for both of them . It is interesting to note that not only this was the first time Metheny had reeded players on one of his albums , but excluding his collaboration with Ornette Coleman on Song X , 24 years passed after 80/81 before the next time he featured a sax player on an album under his own name , with Chris Potter on the Unity Sessions record . Metheny recalls : “ For the first time I have the opportunity to write this element of the breath . One day I noticed that all the instruments I had worked with on Gary 's and my own records were instruments from the rhythm group : piano , bass , guitar , vibraphone , drums , percussion and synthesizer . Never had I the opportunity to write for this Human Element , and I really regretted it . The sound of the breath is something very important . That was the main reason for me to do something like 80/81 at all . ”
The two tenor saxes together are featured on three pieces on the album . Two of them are energetic and allow the horn players to stretch their blowing abilities : Open , an improvisation vehicle for all soloists , and Pretty Scattered , with a theme that resembles some of Ornette Coleman 's twisted melodies . The third is The Bat , a pastoral tune that got a different and beautiful rendering in the next Pat Metheny Group record Offramp .
The Bat :
Just how well Redman and Brecker connected together is best told by Metheny . In a podcast he dedicated to the making of 80/81 , he told a story that happened during the short European tour the group played in the summer of 1981 : “ There is something that happened with Mike and Dewey on that tour that is one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced . They were a different kind of players , they did not overlap in any way . Early on we had a gig in a jazz festival in Portugal and David Oakes , at the time a relatively new sound man said , “ Ok let me hear some Tenor . Mike – play ” . Mike went up and played a lick . Then – “ Dewey come up and play something ” . And Dewey walked up the mic and played some Dewey kind of stuff . Then he said “ now both of you play something at the same time ” . Jack and I were sitting behind them , and they both walked up to the mic and played this long improvised phrase , but completely 100 % in unison , like one saxophone . And they and Jack and I and David Oakes stopped and just stared at each other for about ten seconds like – what just happened ? If you had written out a cadenza and said play this they would have practiced it for a month to get it that tight . ”
Pretty Scattered :
The title tune 80/81 was written for Dewey Redman , whom Metheny met while touring with Gary Burton 's band in the early 70s , sometimes sharing the bill with Redman who was playing with Keith Jarrett 's American quartet . That quartet , also including Charlie Haden on bass and Paul Motian on drums , was one of the best jazz combos of the 70s and left a deep impression on Metheny , who recalled Redman 's peculiar practicing methods : “ Keith would write pieces for Dewey that were very difficult and Dewey would figure out a way to get through those changes that was not what you would ever expect . When I gave Dewey that tune , he took it to the bathroom for about two hours and practiced arpeggios up and down the changes . Then he came out and said Ok , lets record it . And then he did n't play anything like that on his solo . ”
80/81 :
After playing all the compositions Pat Metheny prepared for the session , the band realized that they had material for more than one album . Manfred Eicher suggested they keep recording to fill up a double record . Pat Metheny ran out of originals , and Charlie Haden pulled out a few Ornette Coleman arrangements . One of them was Turnaround , first released on Ornette 's second album Tomorrow Is the Question ! from 1959 . Metheny , well versed with Coleman 's music , was not familiar with this one and was reading it in the studio . Evidently Haden and DeJohnette were having a blast during the session , and Charlie Haden can be heard at the end of the recording all ecstatic about Jack DeJohnette 's playing .
Turnaround :
One of the highlights on 80/81 is a tune Metheny wrote for Mike Brecker , Every Day ( I Thank You ) . It was written in a hotel room in Bremen , Germany late one night after a gig . In the rich catalog of Metheny 's well crafted melodies , this is one of the most memorable and a special one due to Brecker 's soulful playing . As a composition , it is certainly the most interesting and complex on the album , and could fit nicely on the Pat Metheny Group 's repertoire : “ I have done a lot of work to create a tune with different sections and tempos . It has a development and a form that is not a straight song . But all of that is nothing compared to the emotional depth that Mike played the melody. ” For Mike Brecker , who was in the process of kicking a drug habit at the time , the whole session was a life altering event , and this tune in particular affected him deeply : “ When I was writing the tune I was hearing how Mike would play this , and the tune is very strongly associated with Mike now . He was going through a difficult time then . He was cleaning up his life and was not there yet . He was suffering a lot. ” In the notes for the ECM Selected Recordings series dedicated to his music , Metheny wrote : “ Mike Brecker has often talked about how he felt this record was a turning point for him , that he discovered something on this date about the way he played that affected things that he did later . ”
Every Day ( I Thank You ) :
Metheny had the deepest respect for Brecker , and at the memorial service held for Mike Brecker in New York 's Town Hall on February 20 , 2007 , he said : “ The real thing that made Mike so special as a musician , as a player , was his incredible ability to communicate what it is to be human . The complications of it . The struggle of it . The joy of it . To manifest a sound that could describe things about what it is to be here on earth that everyone , musician or not , could feel and recognize as being true. ” If you need an example of what Metheny is talking about , search no farther than Brecker 's playing on Every Day ( I Thank You ) .
The last tune on the album is a solo by Metheny called Goin ' Ahead , which he intended the full band to play but it did not seem to gel when attempted on the first day of recording . The next day Metheny decided to try a different approach : “ There was an acoustic guitar in the studio , a crummy beat up Ibanez . I started playing it to show Charlie the chords and realized this could be something just on the acoustic guitar . Jan Erik setup the mics and I played the chords and the melody . I was really doing a demo for the guys to show them how it should be played . When I came in everybody was – wow , you should just do that , it sounded great . And I said , well I think I just did do it. ” Going Ahead became a footprint for many tunes Metheny will record later in his career , including his collaboration album with Charlie Haden , Beyond The Missouri Sky .
Goin ' Ahead :
80/81 was released as ECM catalog numbers 1180/81 , as ECM has a unique number for each LP , including double LPs and boxed sets . The band recorded and released the album in 1980 , and then performed it live during their tour in 1981 . Number games aside , the album was a successful one for ECM and Metheny , reaching number four on the Billboard jazz charts . A quick glance at the rest of the chart that week shows the grim state of American jazz around that time , with mostly well-produced , synthetic and uninspiring albums all around . The album won the Jazz record of the year prize in the German record critics ' award in 1980
My favorite tune on the album is the opener Two Folk Songs . I still remember the first time I listened to the album many moons ago and the sheer excitement that I felt immediately after the needle dropped on side one of the first LP . This must be one of the best album openers of all time . The fierce acoustic guitar strumming hits you and before you had time to recover from your surprise the rest of the band joins with a relentless energy that continues for the full 20+ minutes of the tune . Metheny introduced that strumming style on New Chautauqua the previous year , but up to Two Folk Songs that style has not been used in the context of a jazz quartet . Metheny : “ As far as I know that is the first time that there had been that kind of rhythm section with the guitar strumming integrated stylistically in such a way with Jack DeJohnette 's ultra modern approach to drumming . Adding to that the connection that Charlie and I had to Missouri made Two Folk Songs have a pulse and a foundation that until that time I do n't think there has been anything quite like that . ”
Two Folk Songs , 1st :
All musicians are in top form on Two Folk Songs . Brecker plays like I never heard him anywhere else . Metheny realized that in the studio during the recording : “ The way that Brecker played on that track was kind of scary at the time . It was like , man what is that ? It was something that has all that post Coltrane vocabulary , but there was this whole other thing . It was a real defining moment in Brecker 's approach. ” On a separate occasion Metheny whimsically said : “ The most treacherous position in jazz was being the guy on the bandstand who has to take a solo right after Mike Brecker. ” Still , Metheny delivers a magnificent guitar solo after Brecker .
For me the standout performance on this tune is Jack DeJohnette 's , who also considers this tune one of the highlights of his rich career : “ The groove on this thing just boils beginning to end . The way the solos build by each person is just amazing . Its like each one of us is telling a story musically that is so strong and passionate it really pulls you in. ” Metheny on DeJohnette : “ He is a challenging musician to play with . He will get all over you . I often joke its like going ten rounds with Muhammad Ali . Two Folk Songs is a classic example of that . That particular kind of thing – even eight notes but swinging – Its a groove that did n't exist before Jack came along . ”
About 13 and a half minutes into the tune , as the band winds down the first folk song , Charlie Haden starts the second folk song by playing a slow soulful version of Old Joe Clark , an old American folk tune usually played with a banjo or fiddle at high speed . Haden introduced this tune twenty years earlier on Ornette Coleman 's quartet Change Of The Century album . You can hear it 4 minutes into Ramblin ' , the album opener . Metheny and Haden 's shared Midwest background may have started here and culminated on the album Beyond The Missouri Sky : “ Charlie really experienced that Midwest background thing . When he was a little kid he was touring around with his family band , performing on radio shows and playing shows with Mother Maybelle Carter . He 's got that background in a much deeper way than me . I 've always felt very close to the kind of music that comes from out there ” .

“ What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof . ”
The only position that leaves me with no cognitive dissonance is atheism . It is not a creed . Death is certain , replacing both the siren-song of Paradise and the dread of Hell . Life on this earth , with all its mystery and beauty and pain , is then to be lived far more intensely : we stumble and get up , we are sad , confident , insecure , feel loneliness and joy and love . There is nothing more ; but I want nothing more .

By trying to adjust to the findings that it once tried so viciously to ban and repress , religion has only succeeded in restating the same questions that undermined it in earlier epochs . What kind of designer or creator is so wasteful and capricious and approximate ? What kind of designer or creator is so cruel and indifferent ? And—most of all—what kind of designer or creator only chooses to “ reveal ” himself to semi-stupefied peasants in desert regions ?

What happens to the faith healer and the shaman when any poor citizen can see the full effect of drugs or surgeries , administered without ceremonies or mystifications ? Roughly the same thing as happens to the rainmaker when the climatologist turns up , or to the diviner from the heavens when schoolteachers get hold of elementary telescopes .

Religion looks forward to the destruction of the world… . Perhaps half aware that its unsupported arguments are not entirely persuasive , and perhaps uneasy about its own greedy accumulation of temporal power and wealth , religion has never ceased to proclaim the Apocalypse and the day of judgment .

Religion comes from the period of human prehistory where nobody—not even the mighty Democritus who concluded that all matter was made from atoms—had the smallest idea what was going on . It comes from the bawling and fearful infancy of our species , and is a babyish attempt to meet our inescapable demand for knowledge ( as well as for comfort , reassurance , and other infantile needs ) . Today the least educated of my children knows much more about the natural order than any of the founders of religion .

The Bible may , indeed does , contain a warrant for trafficking in humans , for ethnic cleansing , for slavery , for bride-price , and for indiscriminate massacre , but we are not bound by any of it because it was put together by crude , uncultured human mammals .

Is it too modern to notice that there is nothing [ in the ten commandments ] about the protection of children from cruelty , nothing about rape , nothing about slavery , and nothing about genocide ? Or is it too exactingly “ in context ” to notice that some of these very offenses are about to be positively recommended ?
Religion has run out of justifications . Thanks to the telescope and the microscope , it no longer offers an explanation of anything important . Where once it used to be able , by its total command of a worldview , to prevent the emergence of rivals , it can now only impede and retard—or try to turn back—the measurable advances that we have made . Sometimes , true , it will artfully concede them . But this is to offer itself the choice between irrelevance and obstruction , impotence or outright reaction , and , given this choice , it is programmed to select the worse of the two . Meanwhile , confronted with undreamed-of vistas inside our own evolving cortex , in the farthest reaches of the known universe , and in proteins and acids which constitute our nature , religion offers either annihilation in the name of god , or else the false promise that if we take a knife to our foreskins , or pray in the right direction , or ingest pieces of wafer , we shall be “ saved . ”

Human decency is not derived from religion . It precedes it .

Our belief is not a belief . Our principles are not a faith . We do not rely solely upon science and reason , because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors , but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason . We may differ on many things , but what we respect is free inquiry , openmindedness , and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake .
―God Is Not Great
Religion is man-made . Even the men who made it can not agree on what their prophets or redeemers or gurus actually said or did .

If religious instruction were not allowed until the child had attained the age of reason , we would be living in a quite different world .

I try to deny myself any illusions or delusions , and I think that this perhaps entitles me to try and deny the same to others , at least as long as they refuse to keep their fantasies to themselves .

Faith is the surrender of the mind ; it 's the surrender of reason , it 's the surrender of the only thing that makes us different from other mammals . It 's our need to believe , and to surrender our skepticism and our reason , our yearning to discard that and put all our trust or faith in someone or something , that is the sinister thing to me . Of all the supposed virtues , faith must be the most overrated .
Name me an ethical statement made or an action performed by a believer that could not have been made or performed by a non-believer .
Take the risk of thinking for yourself , much more happiness , truth , beauty , and wisdom will come to you that way .
Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Kyrion II , who was elevated to that role upon the Georgian Orthodox Church declaring autocephaly in 1917 . He 'd returned from monastic exile to assume that role . He was murdered by an unknown assailant on June 27 , 1918 and his murder remains a mystery to this day .
On this day in 1917 , the Georgian Orthodox Church restored i ts autocephalous ( self governing ) sta tus within the Ortho dox family of Aposto lic churches .
This is likely a some what complicated story and I 'm not fa familiar with it but it seems that it had been autocephalous since 1010 , however , in 1811 it was put under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church , with their being a great deal of protest abo ut that in the Georgian community .
Soft-baked and delicious Oatmeal Creme Pies are easy to make at home !
I 'm feeling sort of nostalgic today . I remember eating Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies when I was younger . Unwrapping and crumpling the wrapper between my fingers , trying desperately ( and failing ) to stuff the whole squishy soft cookie sandwich into my mouth all at once . I LOVED oatmeal creme pies ! And still have a giant oatmeal creme pie size spot in my heart for them .
I have n't had them in a long time – homemade cookies and cupcakes have taken precedence over my favorite mass-produced packaged snack , but that does n't mean I do n't remember how incredible they are . So… I set out to bake my own from scratch .
MY LATEST VIDEOS
I made oatmeal pumpkin creme pies last fall and adored them . The oatmeal cookies are tiny , puffy , and very chewy . They have texture . I filled them with a pumpkin cream cheese frosting , one of the frostings I developed in my pumpkin rampage last September . This pumpkin version is n't particularly a copycat recipe to Little Debbie , as the cookies had some texture and chew and they were very small in size .
Today 's oatmeal cookies are made with super soft , large , and delicate oatmeal cookies – full of brown sugar , molasses , and butter . The cookies melt in your mouth . I sandwiched them between a bright white vanilla creme center . They are much oat-ier than Little Debbie 's version . Sometimes I wonder where the oats are in hers !
Are you ready for these ?
Let me begin by telling you how much butter you 'll need for this entire recipe . 2 and 1/2 sticks just for the cookies and 1 and 1/2 sticks for the creme filling . New Years resolutions can take the back seat ! These are not a healthy cookie and I do not suggest making them into a healthy cookie . They are oatmeal creme pies , not diet food .
And are worth every single bite !
The source for this copycat recipe does not call for ground cloves , but I wanted to pack some flavor into the buttery oatmeal cookie . Another thing ? For the cookie 's proper texture and spreadability , it is imperative to use quick oats in these cookies . Old-fashioned whole rolled oats will not work . You want very fine , small pieces of oats in the dough . Since I prefer whole rolled oats in my granola recipes , my pantry is never stocked with the quick kind . I make my own quick oats if I need them for a recipe . For today , I measured 3 cups of whole rolled oats and pulsed them in the food processor 4-5 times . Now you have quick oats ! Easy , right ?
The cookie dough is quite thick ; I had to stop the mixer after about 10 seconds to mix the rest by hand . Unlike most of my cookie recipes , this dough does not require chilling prior to baking . More often that not , I chill my cookie dough before baking since cold dough assures a thicker cookie . Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies are not thick cookies , so not dough chilling is necessary . You want the cookies to spread and stretch out in the oven .
I used my favorite OXO large cookie scoop to scoop the cookies into uniform sized balls . Typically , I do not use a cookie scoop for my cookies . But I knew I needed one today since the cookies have to all be equal in size to sandwich together . If you do not have a cookie scoop , be sure to roll 2 Tablespoons of dough for each cookie .
Allow the cookies to cool completely before filling . The creme center is unlike many copycat creme center recipes I 've found before . There is no shortening , marshmallow creme , corn syrup , or gelatin . I do not use shortening in my frosting recipes , ; just not a fan of the texture !
My creme filling is n't a dead ringer of Little Debbie 's , but it 's just perfect for us .
I am infatuated with these oatmeal creme pies ! I can honestly say that they are one of the best cookies I 've ever made . The taste comparison to Little Debbie 's version is uncanny !
They are soft , ultra-moist , and squishy like Miss Debbie 's . I made them large , reminiscent of the originals ( 2 Tablespoons of dough in each cookie – 4 in the whole cookie sandwich ) . When you eat one , the filling will squeeze out the sides – perfect for licking the creme around the edges . Get ready to have some sticky fingers .
ENJOY !

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 Tablespoon dark molasses
1 and 1/2 cups ( 187g ) all-purpose flour ( spoon & leveled )
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Beat in the egg , vanilla , and molasses , scraping down the sides as needed . Set aside . In a medium bowl , whisk the flour , baking soda , salt , cinnamon , cloves , and oats . With the mixer running on low , slowly add the dry ingredients to wet ingredients . The dough will be quite thick and you may have to mix it all by hand after a few seconds in the mixer . Drop dough with a large cookie scoop , or make sure each ball of dough is 2 Tablespoons . Cookies will spread in the oven , so drop each ball of dough 3 inches apart . Bake for 10 minutes or until cookies are lightly golden around the edges . Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely . For the filling : Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment , beat butter on high speed until creamy , about 1 minute . Add the confectioners ' sugar and beat on medium speed for 1-2 minutes . Pour in heavy cream and vanilla extract . Beat on high for 2-3 minutes until fluffy . Taste and add a pinch or two of salt , as needed . If filling is way too thick , add a couple more teaspoons of heavy cream . Spread 1.5 Tablespoons of cream filling on the bottom side of half of the cookies ; top with remaining cookies , right side up . Cookies stay fresh and soft ( with creme filling ) at room temperature for 2 days in an airtight container . After that , store in the refrigerator to keep the creamy filling fresh .

Sanders Applauds Decision to End Federal Use of Private Prisons
BURLINGTON , Vt. , Aug. 18 – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) issued the following statement Thursday after the Justice Department announced plans to end its use of private prisons :
“ Our criminal justice system is broken and in need of major reforms . The Justice Department 's plan to end its use of private prisons is an important step in the right direction . It is exactly what I campaigned on as a candidate for president .
“ It is an international embarrassment that we put more people behind bars than any other country on earth . Due in large part to private prisons , incarceration has been a source of major profits to private corporations . Study after study has shown private prisons are not cheaper , they are not safer , and they do not provide better outcomes for either the prisoners or the state .
“ We have got to end the private prison racket in America as quickly as possible . Our focus should be on keeping people out of jail and making sure they stay out when they are released . This means funding jobs and education not more jails and incarceration . ”
Sanders introduced legislation last year with Reps. Raúl M. Grijalva ( D-Ariz. ) , Keith Ellison ( D-Minn. ) and Bobby L. Rush ( D-Ill. ) to ban private prisons .
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Tuesday called for U.S. officials to tone down their rhetoric on North Korea after President Trump threatened to unleash “ fire and fury ” should Pyongyang continue with its threats .
`` We need to tone down the rhetoric of regime change and all this . As desirable as that may be , all that does be amp up the paranoia , '' Clapper told Anderson Cooper on CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 . ''

`` We do not seek a regime change . We do not seek a collapse of the regime . We do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula , '' Tillerson said at the time . `` We do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel . And we 're trying to convey to the North Koreans , we are not your enemy . We 're not your threat , but you 're presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond . ''
Trump , however , appeared to ramp up his rhetoric against the country earlier Tuesday , issuing a stern warning after reports said Pyongyang has expanded its nuclear capabilities to include a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit onto a missile .
“ North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States , ” Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club .
“ He has been very threatening beyond a normal state , and as I said they will be met with fire , fury and frankly power , the likes of which this world has never seen before . ”
Clapper said the difference between Trump and Tillerson 's `` discordant , inconsistent voices '' on the matter do not help the heightened tension between the two countries .
North Korea has repeatedly tested intercontinental ballistic missiles in recent months , with some analysts saying they could reach parts of the continental U.S .
The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Saturday to sanction Pyongyang for its missile tests .
This is an excellent first book for aspiring mandolin players . It does n't assume or require any preexisting knowledge of the instrument or musical notation since , as pointed out by a prior reviewer , it provides visual scores or tablature of finger placement . The book also provides very helpful practical tips on such things as tuning , recommending , for example , the purchase of an inexpensive electronic tuner . I followed that advice and bought a Korg CA-30 and used it not only to successfully tune the mandolin but also my guitar which I had for years previously tuned `` by ear '' with varying degrees of success . Mr. Casey is also straight-forward in making it clear that learning the Mandolin takes a lot of practice and , at least until you develop some callouses on your finger tips , sometime painful practice . However , if you are diligent in following his lesson plans , you will learn to play the mandolin to an extent that will amaze not only your friends but yourself .
In 2012 a curious person on the web–likely an enthusiastic entrepreneur–asked a simple question on Quora : Does a startup need an HR person ? This was in the infancy of the current boom–or bust–we 're now in ; Now-defunct shopping website Fab had just raised $ 117 million ; Pinterest landed $ 100 million , Box raised $ 125 million , and Square got $ 200 million .

Startups at the time were figuring out how to ride this wave , so it 's unsurprising that the first and most popular answer provided was this : “ No , you do n't need an HR person. ” Things have changed since then . For one , many believe the startup boom may be coming to an end , what with the rate of venture funding–along with many valuations–ramping downward . Startups are also being forced to grapple with their internal cultural problems ; big companies like Twitter , Google , and Apple are being asked to divulge their internal demographics thanks to widespread calls for a more open and transparent work culture . But even with an insular industry seeing slightly more public dialog about its intrinsic biases and inequalities , startups still have difficulty figuring out how to maintain and cultivate their workforce . And this aversion to HR may explain some part of that . The phrase “ HR is dead ” is oft-repeated in startup circles–indeed Fast Company wrote a story about its shortcomings in 2005–but it 's unclear what 's at stake when companies overlook this sort of fundamental structure . Related Video : The Reasons Why Even A Startup Company Needs H.R . A recent Motherboard piece took a look at the impact of no HR on company culture . It found that women are more often than not the most vulnerable employees due to startups ' lack of HR and general anti-harassment procedures . The article states , “ Ultimately , these structural issues contribute to one of the greatest systemic problems facing working women today : barriers to advancement , known to many as the glass ceiling. ” And over the years some of the biggest tech startups have had accusations of harassment levied at them . Github is probably one of the most memorable examples . In 2014 a female engineer left the company and went public with allegations of being targeted and harassed by one of the cofounders and his wife . The company , following an investigation of the company 's actions , found no legal wrongdoing , ultimately sweeping this saga under the rug . A few months later , however , GitHub announced it would make its HR procedures more robust , a move that could have perhaps made the original incident less of public spectacle . These sorts of instances bring to light the fact that harassment in the workplace is not uncommon , especially in Silicon Valley . A recent survey of women in tech in the Valley revealed that 60 % had experienced unwanted sexual advances in the workplace . The same number of women also said that when they reported instances of harassment , they were dissatisfied with the results .

What Is The Purpose Of HR ? This leads to the question , what exactly is the function of HR , and why is it historically so despised ? Human Resources has become a catch-all for all the functional but non-flashy parts of an organization : hiring , payroll , health insurance , and all other administrative things . As Libby Sartain , a former HR executive who worked at both Yahoo and Southwest Airlines , sees it , startups ' resistance to formal human resources is an issue of culture . “ In the old days , ” says Sartain , HR was primarily administration– “ to get people on payroll. ” But now companies are more reticent about adding an additional layer . “ I see companies concerned about their culture , ” she says . But this cultural issue is a double-edged sword . Startups are focused on growth and wooing talent by talking about how fun and casual their company is . Indeed , the idea of startup culture–one that has beer on tap and ping pong tables–is a direct response to bureaucratic rigmarole like a human resources department killing a buzz . But the startup stigma with HR has the potential to create unintended consequences : what happens when someone does n't fit into that culture . And when those problems happen , it 's departments like HR that usually attempt to fix the issues . “ There are a lot of younger people , ” says Sartain , “ who do n't understand the importance of ethical behavior in the workplace. ” And without the proper safeguard in place , this can lead to a hostile work environment . She adds , “ I think some of the younger people have n't learned what kind of behavior is acceptable and what kind of behavior is unacceptable. ” Of course , more common are simply the cultural misunderstandings . A work setting of predominately white males in their twenties can easily turn into an unwelcome environment for anyone not within those boundaries . And this hostility could easily be due to tone deafness . Often , founders are younger people railing against the perceived bureaucratic norms of a widespread HR department . Yet they still are n't aware of the environment they cultivate for people different from them . All the same , when unacceptable behavior does happen , it leaves those at the receiving end with very few options . That 's when employees would normally seek out HR for help , but instead turn to an attorney or go to the media . Thus , business veterans like Sartain believe it 's imperative to have some system in place for these sorts of situations . At the very least , there should be a policy in place clearly stating what a founder should do when faced with such a complaint .

Software As A Substitute On the other end of the spectrum is the issue of cost . Small businesses obviously ca n't afford to hire a team to do their administrative work . Instead they are now turning to outsourced or software-built services that fill the gaps . Trinet , Zenefits , and Justworks , for example , offer digital dashboards to onboard and keep track of employees similar to what a traditional HR person would do in the past . But , as one startup founder wrote in a review of the Zenefits platform , “ [ It 's ] especially great for early stage companies , but once you reach about 50 employees , you 'll need something more. ” New companies do n't like the idea that they 're using old tactics . These services , however , capitalize on being the answer for small companies looking to automate menial tasks . Isaac Oates , founder and CEO of Justworks , says he saw an opening for this kind of bureaucratic platform . He wanted to a build a software solution that would “ just do all the stuff that needs to happen. ” Justworks makes it possible for small businesses to automate their payroll , benefits , and regulatory data . These are the kinds of tasks an entire department would have done a decade ago . The focus is precisely on those small businesses that do n't have the resources to bring new humans on . With that , Justworks represents a new cadre of solutions that turn people into software . Employees get their pay stubs through the platform , along with benefits information . Amanda Moskowitz , founder of the startup leadership sharing resource Stacklist , sees these as one of the big ways startups are adapting to HR needs . Instead of hiring one or two new positions , companies are seeking out more siloed products in lieu of an entire human resources department . “ While we do n't see founders saying they 're using X tools and calling it HR , ” she said , “ They are using review tools. ” These include products , like Glint and Small Improvements , which allow employers to keep track of their workforce , along with opportunities for employees to provide formal feedback . It seems almost like a way for companies to maintain their own cultural identity without giving the illusion of a corporate structure . This denial of HR culture , she adds , is just because of the way it 's been perceived and presented for years . Now companies offer services that fix the problems as a user interface problem ; Justworks is a dashboard that automates the entire employee-management process , which seems more palatable than hiring a new , standalone department . But it leaves a gap for where a human department once was . Though these HR platforms help businesses stay compliant with state and federal labor laws , they do n't provide the same buffer that departments had before . And , perhaps most apparent , a software or automated platform can not replace the human experience of talking with someone , especially dealing with sensitive issues like health and well-being . While some may say that role can fall on leadership , having a position for just that type of conversation changes the dynamic . If an employee feels uncomfortable in the workplace , he or she ca n't log on the dashboard and report the event ( although Justworks does offer HR-specific consulting that connects founders with experts when faced with an unexpected event ) . This leads to the question of whether or not HR is really the issue at hand . If you have a small company of 10-25 people and an employee has very specific , personal needs , would a formal HR associate be what is needed to help the problem ? Oates says more often than not , these human relations issues can be boiled down to leadership , and likely are n't even part of the human resources umbrella . When a company is faced with a sensitive issue it 's never dealt with before , how a company responds is reflective of the startup 's leadership . “ Setting the tone of the organization , ” says Oates , “ that 's never going to be HR . ”

The Future .. ? All the same , there is undeniably a push to bring these legacy services into today 's companies . Though the nomenclature has changed , the problems have persisted for decades . In a follow-up email Moskowitz mused that perhaps what 's really changed is that things are more unbundled . New companies do n't like the idea that they 're using old tactics . “ It might also lead them to say that they are rejecting HR , ” she wrote , “ even though they 're really just rejecting legacy tools , not the core concepts like comp , compliance , team productivity , and employee happiness. ” Indeed some organizations are seeking out new ways to make employees feel more included . While perhaps not strictly under the human resources umbrella , a few high profile technology companies have begun hiring heads of diversity . The real question is whether these moves are lip service to look good in the public eye , or if they will help bring about actual cultural change within the white bro confines of the startup world . Part of this equation is ensuring that people have safeguards within their organization . With pushes for more diversity and safeguards in the workplace come an unspoken push for better–or more comprehensive–HR structures . Though the current trend seems to be product-oriented , there 's another quieter move toward figuring out how to make employees more comfortable , valued , and included . And when dealing with cultural differences and employee needs , the best solutions are likely not software and dashboard based .

EA 's first UFC title is looking mighty impressive . Built from the ground-up for next-gen , it 's still early days , but the tech that the team is putting in place shows a huge amount of promise . The character models are particularly impressive , and not just because they 're so detailed . It 's the subtle touches that make the difference here . Tech like full body deformation ensures the fighters ' bodies contort as they come into contact ( or when fist comes into contact with face ) , while exertion actually has an impact , making veins pop and faces go red .
We recently caught up with Brian Hayes , the game 's Creative Director , to find out a little more about what UFC fans have in store . Here are some of the most interesting tidbits .
On the team 's strong sports and martial arts background…
Brian Hayes : We 've got guys that have worked on EA Sports FIFA , guys that have worked on NHL , guys that have worked on SSX , and there 's a lot of people that worked on Fight Night 3 through Fight Night Champion . I originally started working as a designer on Fight Night 2004 . Our lead gameplay designer was the lead gameplay designer on Fight Night Round 3 . I worked in that role on Fight Night Round 4 and Fight Night Champion .
On what they 've learnt from Fight Night…
Brian Hayes : There 's a lot more variety in terms of the strikes you can perform in a game like UFC , especially with some of the fighters doing the things that they 're doing now - like the cage-based strikes that Anthony “ Showtime ” Pettis does - so we never had to worry about a guy running and jumping off the side of the cage and doing a roundhouse kick against his opponent in Fight Night , but it 's a great challenge to have now that we 're working on EA Sports UFC , and there are certainly some things we 've learnt , just about how we should approach stamina in a fighting game like this , and how should we approach health and damage , stun states and different mechanics like that . There 's a wealth of knowledge on the gameplay team to help us start with a leg up in that regard .
On whether UFC will have a Fight Night Champion-style story mode…
Brian Hayes : The thing about Fight Night Champion , to put things in perspective , the Fight Night series went through Fight Night 2004 , Round 2 , Round 3 , Round 4 and then we had Fight Night Champion . It took us a while to lock everything down , just from the core gameplay and features and modes standpoint , before we could try something really different , like Champion mode . So right now we 're heavily focused on locking down the core gameplay features and modes for EA Sports UFC . Whether or not we do a narrative-based cinematic experience in EA Sports UFC is TBD for the future .
I think there are some things that we did in Champion mode that can carry over into a more traditional career mode experience and a great example is – for any Fight Night Champion fans out there I 'll speak specifically – we had the Keyshawn Hayes fight , where we told you ‘ hey , this guy 's got a devastating left hook – you 've got to watch out for that left hook ' and then you went into that fight and almost without fail in the first 30-40 seconds of that fight he would put you on your butt with a left hook . So we made that connection mentally for the player . ‘ Okay yes , this guy 's left hook is devastating , I need to really be on the look-out for it ' .
Similarly , we can have that in our game . Say you 're fighting Dan Henderson . Well guess what ? His overhand right is a nuclear bomb . You need to watch out for that overhand right . We can do this same sort of scenario-based challenges to bring a story about that particular fight to life in a career mode experience without having to send your character to prison and be assaulted by , y'know , Aryan gangs , or whatever .
Exit Theatre Mode
On how many fighting styles will be accounted for…
Brian Hayes : We have a long term partnership with the UFC so we have the opportunity to expand and grow the library of fighting styles that are included in the game , but to start with we 're really focusing on nailing the primary , core martial arts disciplines that make up the preponderance of techniques that are used , so obviously there 's wrestling , jiu jitsu , judo , muay thai , boxing , kickboxing , karate , and that 's already a lot . There 's those and then sprinkling some spice from a few other unique fighting styles , like , say , capoeira or whatever . You can expect to see a lot of different things in there .
On the art of grappling…
Brian Hayes : With the limited amount of hands-on grappling experience that I have , one of the first things that you realise is that Brazilian jiu jitsu is a sport that you could do blindfolded . And a lot of guys will if they 're just practising rolling around on the ground . They 'll keep their eyes closed , because really , the sport itself is about feeling your opponent 's weight , leverage , and where their body is in space , and you do n't need to have your eyes open to know that ‘ hey , he 's holding my wrist ' or ‘ his hand 's on my knee ' or what have you . So that 's really an interesting challenge when we have a video game where the only information we can present to you is through your eyeballs , and you have a sport that you can play with your eyes closed…
“ When you go to the ground it 's not just button mashing
When we looked at all the previous , existing mixed martial arts games , one of the things that they all seemed to do without fail was that you would have a submission attempt button or input and then once you hit that you pretty much go right into a fully executed submission position , whether it be a fully locked on rear naked choke or a fully extended arm bar , and then there 'd be some form of battle between two players to see whether this submission will get ‘ finished ' . But what really happens in Brazilian jiu jitsu and the UFC is that there 's actually a battle between the offensive and defensive fighter to get to that final stage of a choke being fully locked on or the arm actually being fully extended . If you 're in an arm bar and your arm is extended , the fight is over . The fight is to stop the guy from getting your arm out away from your body .
We want to bring that fight to life… the strategy in terms of the battle – how are you going to defend yourself , how am I going to attack you ? And keep it… alive in each moment of the submission… one of the really cool things about our submission system and the way it 's working right now is that as we 're going through the different stages . If you – say – escape at a middle stage of the submission that might mean you escape and you get out to side control as opposed to just staying in my guard . So there may be a strategic decision on your part where you 're not actually going to defend the first two advancements . You 're going to let me get into the submission and think I 'm doing really well , and then you 're going to go for the escape because actually you 're going to try to get out to a more dominant position on the ground because you know that opening is there .
We 're trying to bring some of that stuff to life with our ground game , that hopefully just makes it more interesting and more compelling overall . When you go to the ground it 's not just ‘ oh great , we get to have a button mashing fight against each other ' . No , it 's actually ‘ I have a game-plan and I 'm going to try and do something unique here , throw some misdirection your way ' and hopefully that 'll be a lot more interesting for our players .
It 's still in early development , but there 's currently a spiritual sequel to MMO City of Heroes – an RPG shut down four years ago – being made , called Ship of Heroes .
This city will reside in the stars this time . You can spend more time in the cosmos with our list of the best space games .
Heroic Games Corporation have put a team of developers and designers together to work on this homage , headed up by company CEO Casey McGeever , who recently left mobile publishers AccuWeather to assemble this team for his dream project .
Ship of Heroes promises “ family friendly PvP/PvE gameplay ” set in a self-sustaining space biosphere , with gameplay built around fighting , crafting , missions , rewards , teamwork and deep customisation .
You can check out the in-development first large city level on the Ship of Heroes sites . A character creator , animations , movement and combat will also be showcased in the coming months , with a crowdfunding event following in April and May next year . If successful , they will build out the prototypes from there .

As our name implies , SendCoal is a site dedicated to helping you send a lump of coal , tastefully packed into a small burlap sack , to any recipient of your choosing . We also include the ability of senders to personalize this gift . There exists a long-standing tradition in Western culture of giving coal as a gift , particularly to those who are deemed to be undeserving of something more desirable or of greater value . However , while the stories of such gifts survive to this day , not nearly as many people have easy access to coal anymore . Being as we are located directly in the heart of America 's historic coal region , this is not as much a problem for us . We seek to help you keep alive this tradition , should you desire , by sending coal on your behalf ( or anonymously ) to anyone you choose . SendCoal 's operation is proud of the fact that we exclusively use high-grade anthracite coal from Centralia , Pennsylvania . While fate has not been kind to this region of the United States ( please feel free to see our section on the History of Centralia ) the coal resources within the surrounding rocks still abound , and we gather these rocks from locals who still find deposits available to those who know where to look . SendCoal is surely not the first service to help people who wish to give coal as an amusing ( or scathing ) gift to others . However , virtually all similar businesses are , in our view , grossly deficient in either of two ways ... Quality - Nearly all of the `` gift coal '' offerings one encounters -- especially on mainstream web sites -- is simulated . These gifts consist of either cheap cast plastic or simply black-painted rock ... in any such case , we think that 's a little bit of a cheat . After all , if you 're going to give someone a gift like this , why not send genuine coal ? Anonymity - Absolutely none of the other businesses of which we are aware will shield your identity when they dispatch a gift of coal at your direction . One company claims they will `` send coal to someone without revealing you as the giver '' but then goes on to state that `` if the recipient emails us and asks who sent the coal , we will tell on you . '' Screw that ! SendCoal has a very strong commitment to privacy and anonymity . If you send a gift of coal and tell us that you do not wish to be named , we will never reveal your identity to anyone . * Alright ! We are happy to help you . Stop on by our ordering page and complete the very simple process . We handle our transactions through PayPal , but ( naturally ) we do not need to ship to a verified PayPal address . It is our pleasure to send coal to any destination that you can specify !
The Jacksonville Jaguars listed their `` released '' players on Friday afternoon , the first and only team in the NFL to do so for final cutdown day . Just about every other NFL team waited until Saturday to make and announce their cuts , but because of foresight by general manager Dave Caldwell , the team was able to trade D'Anthony Smith for a draft pick rather than cutting him .
The reason the Seattle Seahawks gave up a draft pick for Smith is because they did n't think he would make it to them in the waiver order , so by announcing early who was being released , Caldwell essentially put 21 players on the public trading block . The final cuts did n't have to be turned into the NFL until 6 p.m . ET on Saturday , so this gave the NFL teams 24 hours notice that all of these players were available .
By going ahead and listing the Jaguars cuts publicly , Caldwell turned a player who was n't going to make the roster into a potential additional 2014 NFL Draft pick .
Now compare this method of cutting players to that of Gene Smith in 2012 , when Smith did n't publicly make the Jaguars cuts available until hours after the official cut deadline . Smith was apparently afraid that if the names became public , teams would become aware and claim players he was trying to stash on the practice squad .
None of the players were claimed .
It 's small things like what Caldwell did to turn a cut player into a draft pick that already magnify the drastic differences between the two general managers .

Sen. Rubio will be on the spot when he talks to Comey about the Russia investigation . Can he get to the truth without hurting President Trump ?
Senator Marco Rubio has been one of the most vocal voices in Washington wanting to know about Russia 's role in the 2016 United States Presidential elections . Sen. Rubio , sets on the Senate Intelligence Committee , where in 24 hours fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey , is set to appear before the panel on Thursday , in a highly anticipated testimony that will be closely scrutinized for its potential to raise damaging questions about President Donald Trump .
Sen. Rubio , will be watched to see if he pushes Comey on if he was fired for his investigation of members of President Donald Trump admiration and campaign staffers . Or will Sen. Rubio , play the role of White House defender , attempting to discredit the former director of the FBI .
Last night , 48 hours before Sen. Rubio , and his panel will be grilling Comey , the junior senator from Florida was having dinner at the White House with President Trump . He was joined at dinner by another member of the committee , Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-Arkansas ) , who has along with Rubio has been critical of Russian hacking .
According to The Washington Examiner , there were other Republican lawmakers eating dinner with Trump in the White House residence . The group included , Indiana Sen. Todd Young , Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner , Florida Rep. Francis Rooney and New York Rep. Lee Zeldin .
What brought Sen. Rubio and Comey together again this week was a New York Times report on a February memo in which Comey documented President Trump 's desire for the FBI to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn .
“ I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go , ” Trump told Comey , according to notes read to a Times reporter by a Comey associate . “ He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . ”
Rubio told Fox News that he and other members of Congress would want to hear from Comey directly . “ We 're not going to base our opinion solely on a news article , ” he said .
“ We need to know the facts and , so , I 'm not telling you that the news articles are wrong , ” Rubio added . “ I 'm telling you that if you 're going to deal with something of this magnitude , should n't we at least have facts before us before we establish firm positions about what we 're going to do next ? ”
So , Sen. Rubio will get his chance to talk directly to Comey about what went on between the former FBI Director and President Trump . Watch for Rubio to push Comey on his conversations with President Trump and how any of it may or may not affect the direction the committee goes in after Comey 's testimony is over .
Social media looks to fill investigative reporting gap
Updated
YouTube is considering launching a service dedicated to investigative journalism in response to the decline of in-depth reporting at traditional news outlets .
It is in discussions with a non-profit group based in California that funds investigative reporting and on-sells its reports to news outlets around America .
The Centre for Investigative Reporting ( CIR ) in Berkeley , California , has had a meeting with the video-sharing website to discuss the possibility of collaboration .
YouTube wants CIR , which is funded by private donations , to curate material for what it plans to call YouTube Investigative .
The CIR said the idea may come to fruition in the future .
Executive director Robert Rosenthal says traditional media organisations are facing budget constraints that compel them to turn to outside sources of news reporting .
`` Newsrooms are so small , they 're looking for content they ca n't produce , '' he said .
He says as newsrooms cut staff and budgets , social media and new models of news gathering , such as CIR , are stepping in .
The Centre has 35 staff , and has had journalists in Afghanistan and Egypt .
It completes about 35 investigative reports a year , and sells them to top-tier American news services including National Public Radio , Frontline and NewsHour on the Public Broadcasting Service , and the Washington Post .
Mr Rosenthal said social media platforms were also jumping into the world of investigative reporting , keen to get involved in an area once dominated by traditional press outlets .
`` There 's a revolution around information and technology , '' he said .
CIR is also in discussions with Apple and Google about possible collaborations .
Mr Rosenthal says newsrooms around the US are commissioning journalistic work from CIR .
`` We are overwhelmed by the opportunity , '' he said .
Mr Rosenthal said the backing of a traditional news outlet is no longer needed to engage in investigative reporting .
But he notes that even in the social media era , there are huge barriers to any individuals or freelancers doing investigative reports , especially the threat of legal repercussions .

Ever have to deal with Christians thinking they know more about why you deconverted than you do ? Here are five common things Christians say to rationalize the fact that they believe in an imaginary friend and you do n't , and some ready-made answers for you to actually rebut them and turn conversation back towards the evidence , experiences , and reasoning that are actually relevant .
1 . You became an atheist because you were mad at God .
Ridiculous . Atheists are n't mad at God , because they 're atheists , which , um , means they do n't believe God exists . However , as in the movie God 's Not Dead ( reviewed well by Dan Fincke , so that you do n't have to watch the eyesore ) , Christians often portray atheists as angry at God despite that clearly not making any sense . I think there might be a couple reasons why .
First , they think that if they can portray you as mad at God , that would be proof of God 's existence . But this is n't true , because you can be mad at something that does n't exist . For example , there are stories of people being catfished – or , in other words , falling in love with a made-up profile online . Later they find out it 's fake . Here , they may be angry at someone that they know does not exist for not existing . To say that this anger means that they think the fake profile is portraying a real person is ludicrous – in fact , the fact it DOES N'T portray a real person is the reason for their anger .
Second , there are many atheists who leave Christianity angry at the concept of God , and there are many who leave Christianity indifferent towards the concept of God . But , for the angry ones , it 's the CONCEPT they are angry at . God Himself does n't exist . So it 's not really relevant for you to conflate the two . In any case – quibbling over whether the person is angry at the concept of God does n't say anything about whether God exists or not . It 's a red herring .
Third , often people are angry at the things people do in the name of God . Here , the fact that they do n't believe in God fuels their anger at the actions of people who do . When Christians rail against , say , Gay Marriage or spout the conviction that if you do n't believe in God , you 're going to hell ( thus besmirching your reputation ) , anger happens because of PEOPLE , not because of a belief in God .
2 . You left Christianity because you wanted to sin
If God is the only one who determines what is sin ( as is the case in most common Christian theology ) , then this statement does n't make sense , because I do n't believe in God . But when I say that , Christians tend to respond , “ Yeah , but you 're still doing things that you would n't be able to do if you followed the Bible — is n't that convenient ? ” Which is clearly a ridiculous sentiment .
It 's as if I told you that the great and almighty Jack told you not to eat anymore , but Jack was clearly just my imaginary friend . Sure , you want to eat . And no , you do n't believe in Jack . But that does n't mean I can then come in while you 're downing a burger and say , “ Aha ! You 're eating the burger , so CLEARLY you like eating and are n't willing to give it up – which proves that the only reason you do n't believe in Jack is because you want to eat . ”
Ridiculous , is n't it ? But the analogy in real life does n't stop there , oftentimes .
Suppose I socially ostracized you for eating when Jack told you not to eat . I could tell you how much you let Jack and , by extension , your family and most of your friends down by eating when Jack told you not to eat . And I could associate all the guilt and the shame from this ostracization and people I say you 're hurting with the word “ sin ” until , under the pressure of the psychological game ( if I 'm good at it ) I get you to beg me for forgiveness – and , by extension , beg Jack for forgiveness . And then you can be in our good graces…as long as you try really , really , really hard not to eat .
And meanwhile , I 'm eating a bit myself , here and there , and when you ask me why I eat and you ca n't , I say , “ Yeah , I know eating is wrong . I feel really bad about it . But then I ask Jack for forgiveness , and He forgives me ! So that makes everything OK and means I do n't have to feel bad anymore . But because my imaginary friend Jack has n't been accepted into your heart , you ca n't do that , and you deserve to burn in hell forever every time you bite into a burger — or bite into anything else , for that matter . ”
That 's no way to treat a friend , is it ? Would n't the more relevant thing , rather than social and guilt-infused manipulation , be to actually PROVE that Jack exists and admit there was n't good evidence that he existed if there was n't ? So – replace “ eating ” with “ sin ” and “ Jack ” with “ God , ” and you have the picture here .
3 . You did n't read enough apologetics — so you gave up on Christianity too easily .
You do n't have to read all the literature of a viewpoint ( yes , even the one-sided atrocity The Case For Christ — which has been recommended to me around a zillion times ) to know that it is wrong . Think about the other religions . Christians , have you read the apologetics available for EVERY religion in the world ? No ? I 'll guess why : Perhaps you want to investigate further the route that has the most success . Well , that desire to keep investigating what seems the best path does n't stop after you find that the best path is n't Christianity . It keeps going – and you keep researching and reading in the general directions that seem to provide the best results , given your relatively short time on earth . If you 're going to convince us , defend your religion , with the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection and the Water turning into Wine and so on , in a rational manner instead of assuming you can find it somewhere . And then you can present it .
This one has a bit of history — it originated with a guy named Paul Vitz in 1999 , who claimed , based on his look at 20 famous atheists in history who had , according to his analysis , fathers who had abandoned him or who were “ weak ” , that atheists tended to be children of “ weak ” or absent parents . The glaring problem here is that he hand-picked 20 atheists . To say that this is not a representative sample of the millions of atheists is to make such an obvious statement that it 's almost embarrassing to state it .
And on top of that , even if it WERE true ( which , in many cases , it is clearly not ) , it 's irrelevant . What if you believe in God simply because you have “ good ” parents ( whatever that means ) ? Someone could easily say that , because you had such an awesome childhood , you ca n't see a realistic picture of the world through your spoiled , rose-colored glasses . I mean , two can play at the game of accusing the other that they just believe what they happened to believe because of the way they were raised .
In short , this argument is clearly a meaningless waste of time , and should be skipped to get to a more honest , evidence-based discussion concerning whether or not God exists , not an attempt to use whatever was less than rosy in your childhood to manipulate you into believing in God .
5 . You left because your church community did n't love you enough .
First of all , the most loving thing the church could do , honestly , is done away with imaginary beings to leave even more room to indiscriminately care more about real , actual flesh and blood people . So if God is imaginary – do away with Him if He gets in the way of treating someone who has found out He does n't exist with dignity and respect if you really care about him .
Second – oftentimes , churches actually use kindness to get people in the church . If people 's kindness is a good reason for someone to come to church and worship God , then it seems clear that people 's rudeness might be a good reason for someone to stop coming to church and stop worshipping God – it 's important here to be consistent .
And third , this is not an argument about the existence of God . It does nothing to prove that God exists ; it just , at the most , states that someone had an unpleasant experience at church . And besides , if Christianity is based on assumptions that are n't true , would n't it make sense for some people to have unpleasant experiences when they tried to live lives using these assumptions ?
Honorable Mention : You were never a true Christian .
I did n't include this one because , technically speaking , the person stating this is saying you were never a Christian to begin with , and thus did not deconvert . This is an example of the “ No True Scotsman ” argument . The simple fact is that , by itself , this does not explain anything . Why was the person not a true Christian ? To answer this question , we need something we can examine . We can not examine someone 's “ soul ” or “ heart. ” Give me tangible evidence .
Usually Christians respond in one or more of the five ways already discussed . They 'll say you did not have the right relationship with God ( correlates with the “ mad at God ” part ) , that you wanted to sin ( correlates with the next reason ) , that you were lacking in knowledge ( did n't read enough apologetics ) , that you were taught the “ wrong ” Christianity when younger ( bad parents ) , or that you were more focused on the church than on God ( correlates with leaving because the church community did n't love you enough ) . So…yeah . This frequently seems little more than a hub that , once you scratch the surface , takes you to one of the five other reasons .

The Justice Department is investigating whether high frequency trading violates insider trading laws , Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday .
`` This practice , which consists of financial brokers and trading firms using advanced computer algorithms and ultra-high speed data networks to execute trades , has rightly received scrutiny from regulators , '' Holder said at a House hearing . `` The department is committed to ensuring the integrity of our financial markets - and we are determined to follow this investigation wherever the facts and the law may lead . ''
It is the first public confirmation of the investigation .
High frequency trading has been in the news a lot this week . Author Michael Lewis charged in his new book `` Flash Boys '' that firms engaged in high frequency trading are gaming the system and unfairly making profits at the expense of everyone else who invests in the U.S. stock market
`` The United States stock market , the most iconic market in global capitalism , is rigged ... by a combination of the stock exchanges , the big Wall Street banks and high-frequency traders , '' he said in an interview with CBS ' `` 60 Minutes . ''

Lewis ' criticisms have been echoed by some others , including Charles Schwab , the founder of the discount trading firm , who called high frequency trading a `` growing cancer '' that needs to be outlawed .
But high frequency trading also has its defenders , including Arthur Levitt , the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission . `` I 'm not persuaded the average investor is not getting a price that is just as good as a high-frequency trader , '' he said this week . Levitt now serves as an adviser to one of the biggest high-frequency trading firms , KCG Holdings .
You know , F. Scott Fitzgerald was right about American lives having no second acts . I found that to be sadly true yesterday as I sat down at the McDonald 's near the bus station off Main and jumped teeth first into an American tragedy .
Somewhere in a cold and sterile boardroom at McDonald 's headquarters in Oak Brook , Illinois , a head of marketing surmised that you as a consumer were stupid . That you were nothing more than a mass of hair and intestines . The venerable burger people concluded that what you were clamoring for more than anything was for the ingredients of their trademark Big Mac to be shoved into a tortilla and sold for half the price of the full-size burger .
There has been an epidemic over the past few years in the fast-food industry to foist anything imaginable into a tortilla and call it a `` wrap '' for you to `` snack '' on . How busy are we that we need to have a burger put in a tortilla ? This is n't saving time for anyone , as wraps are touted as being hella timesavers . This whole mess began when you all started the Atkin 's Diet in 2003 and told corporate America to tell bread to screw off . Then they started putting anything they could in wasteful plastic bowls . I even knew a man who insisted on eating his Burger King Whoppers sans bun and instead chowed down with a fork and knife .
Oklahoma Flower Guide
Spring is finally here and flowers are starting to bloom across Oklahoma . There are few sights more beautiful than a garden full of flowers , so we have compiled our list of the best times of year for flowers to bloom in Oklahoma to help you plan your perfect spring garden .
March
Flowers that bloom in March include :
Tulips
Peonies
Hydrangeas
Cornflowers
Irises
Magnolias
In March , flowers like tulips and peonies will begin to bloom . They typically need to be planted in the fall months to ensure that they will bloom by March . Tulips should be planted in an area where they can grow under the full afternoon sun . Unlike many flowers , tulips do n't like excessive moisture , so they ca n't thrive in rainy areas , near irrigation systems , or places with wet soil .
Peonies are known as the “ Queen of Perennials ” because they are one of the easiest to grow in the spring . They can grow in many different kinds of soils and can last for years . Peonies grow best in full sun , and do not require much watering .
April
Flowers that bloom in April include :
Sunflowers
Mums
Daisies
Snapdragons
Orchids
Lillies
April is the month for sunflowers and mums . Sunflowers can begin growing indoors for an early start ; however , they can also be grown outdoors just after the last spring frost . When the soil temperature reaches 55 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit , they are safe to plant and will ensure a long growing season .
Mums require at least six hours of sun a day to thrive . Make sure not to plant mums in an area with heavy Oklahoma clay , because their roots will not be able to grow through it . Mums also require about an inch of water per week once flowered .
May
Flowers that boom in May include :
Indian Paintbrushes
Roses
Freesias
Stocks
Gerberas
In Oklahoma , May is when the weather really starts to heat up . The flowers that bloom most at this time of year are Indian paintbrushes and roses . Rose bushes must not be placed directly next to each other , and they should be planted in a rich soil . Using composts to make soil richer can improve the flowering of your roses , according to the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service .
Indian paintbrushes , the beautiful wildflowers that frequently bloom in Oklahoma , grow best in clear , raked areas and require at least six hours of sunlight a day . They grow quickly ; and do n't have to be watered constantly . They are a beautiful , low maintenance , Oklahoma summer flower .
Oklahoma is a great place to grow a garden , and there are so many flower and plant options to choose from . You can learn more on our blog , “ Choosing Plants for Central Oklahoma , ” or you can contact us today .
A newly discovered kind of neuron helps produce the buzz of nicotine and the pangs of withdrawal , according to a study led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla . Understanding how these responses are linked could lead to insights on how smokers get hooked — and how they might quit .
The neuron type is found in a part of the brain called the ventral tegmental area , just below the center . It makes dopamine , a neurotransmitter that creates the sensation of pleasure , among other things . To the researchers ' surprise , it 's also activated during the stress of nicotine withdrawal .
Moreover , the scientists said this mechanism could be involved in addiction to many other drugs . In other words , the study might pave the way for comprehending the addictive process in general . Even if the finding is limited to nicotine addiction , it could eventually result in better means of reducing the immense societal toll of smoking .
The study was published last week in Nature Neuroscience ; it can be accessed at http : //j.mp/nicotineneuron . The researchers tested mice and rodents that were given nicotine and studied donated samples of the human brain , and all the analyses showed the neuron 's paradoxical activity .
Olivier George , assistant professor at The Scripps Research Institute . — The Scripps Research Institute
The study 's first author was Taryn Grieder from the University of Toronto , while Olivier George at Scripps Research was the senior author .
Nicotine 's toll
George initially doubted the discovery , which Grieder made five years ago . But careful research confirmed that these neurons indeed exist and that they play the dual role of pleasure and pain , helping to explain why some people find it so hard to kick the habit .
Smoking reduction programs during the past half-century have greatly decreased the proportion of American adults who smoke — from 42 percent to 18 percent , according to the 50th Anniversary Surgeon General 's Report on Smoking and Health .
But that still leaves about 42 million smokers in this country , a population that 's linked to an immense medical and financial toll .
More than 16 million Americans have a disease caused by smoking , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Smoking kills more than 480,000 Americans annually . It costs the United States more than $ 289 billion a year — at least $ 133 billion in medical expenses and more than $ 156 billion in lost productivity , the CDC said .
Nicotine has long been known as the key addictive ingredient in cigarettes and other forms of tobacco . Taking nicotine without tobacco , as in nicotine gum , patches or electronic cigarettes , is considered safer than smoking , but it does n't address the underlying addiction .
Today 's most famous nicotine addict is President Barack Obama , who still chews nicotine gum years after announcing he would quit smoking . During a visit to China this month , Obama was ridiculed by Chinese media for gum-chewing .
Gum-chewing gets Obama criticism
George Koob , a co-author of the new study and director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , said this latest research supports what he has long believed to be a fundamental unity between the brain 's states of feeling good and bad . Before his appointment to the institute a year ago , he had examined addictive disorders while at Scripps Research .
The unity concept is suggested by the end result of addiction , Koob said : A substance that brings pleasure ultimately stops doing so and instead becomes a net negative .
The new study “ is definitely an advance in the field of nicotine withdrawal , ” said Manoranjan D'Souza , who studies neural mechanisms involved in drug dependence at Ohio Northern University in Ada , Ohio .
Previous research indicated that dopamine-making neurons in the ventral tegmental area might be involved in functions other than reward , D'Souza wrote by email . The paper led by Scripps Research went beyond that observation to identify a molecular mechanism that explains how these neurons switch from producing a sense of reward to producing the pain of withdrawal .
The essential finding : These neurons make not only the pleasure-giving dopamine , but also a hormone called corticotropin-releasing factor that 's linked to anxiety and depression .
Controversial pleasure
None of this science was suspected when people first began smoking tobacco . Native Americans had smoked it for ceremonial and medicinal purposes for uncounted centuries before European settlers reached North America .
Early English colonists became enamored of the plant and exported it to Europe as an important source of colonial wealth .
Smoking also incurred enemies early on , including James IV of Scotland and I of England . In 1604 , the king wrote “ A Counterblaste to Tobacco , ” an anti-smoking treatise detailing the herb 's noxious effects .
“ A custome lothsome to the eye , hatefull to the Nose , harmefull to the braine , dangerous to the Lungs , and in the blacke stinking fume thereof , neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse , ” the king wrote , imploring his subjects to renounce the “ stinking suffumigation . ”
They did n't .
In the first half of the 20th century , smoking was mostly seen as producing pleasure . It was not only socially acceptable in the United States , but even portrayed as sophisticated and healthful . People could smoke just about anywhere — at work , in bars and restaurants , even in doctors ' offices .

Cigarettes were fashionable from the top down . President Franklin D. Roosevelt was often photographed with cigarette holder jauntily perched in his mouth . Cigarettes were included in military rations for soldiers in World War II . Immediately after the war , American cigarettes even substituted for currency in devastated Europe .
More Doctors Smoke Camels
In the post war era , print and television advertisements continued the trend , depicting doctors endorsing smoking . For example , a 1946 magazine ad boasted `` More Doctors Smoke Camel Than Any Other Cigarette '' .
A similar Camel ad in 1949 on the young medium of television likewise proclaimed : `` Time out for many men of medicine usually means just long enough to smoke a cigarette ... more doctors smoked Camel than any other cigarette . ''
Flintstones smoking commercial
Beginning in the early 1950s , the uncritical adulation of smoking came under increasing attack in the media . The first outlet to take a strong anti-smoking stance was the influential Reader 's Digest . In December 1952 , the magazine published “ Cancer by the Carton , ” an article linking the rise in cancer deaths to the popularity of smoking .
The 1964 surgeon general 's report went even further in bringing the dangers of smoking to the public 's attention , said Dean Sidelinger , a child health medical officer for the county of San Diego .
“ It really laid out what we knew about the health effects of using tobacco in a comprehensive document , ” Sidelinger said . “ From that time on , people knew that smoking was bad for their health ... but it really took a while for society to change , to make it more unacceptable . ”
In 1966 , the U.S. became the first nation in the world to require warning labels on cigarettes . It started with the mild admonition , “ Caution : Cigarette Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health. ” The warning has been steadily strengthened over the years .
In 1970 , Congress banned cigarette ads on television and radio . Soon after , the concept of “ secondhand smoke ” began getting attention . The theory is that tobacco smoke is so damaging that it can harm nonsmokers who breathe exhaled smoke .
National leader
As the antismoking movement gained traction , California emerged as a leader for the rest of the country , Sidelinger said .
Proposition 99 , a statewide initiative approved in 1988 , imposed a tobacco tax to fund anti-tobacco programs and treatment and research into smoking-related diseases . In 1995 , California banned smoking inside restaurants and bars .
Today , about 18 percent of American adults smoke . California 's rate is 11.9 percent .
Government and advocacy groups continue their efforts on two fronts to further reduce those figures . One is to help the remaining smokers quit , and the other is to persuade young people to avoid taking up tobacco in the first place .
Research such as that led by George at Scripps Research may uncover new ways to reach diehard smokers , who because of their addiction do n't have an entirely free will .
“ In San Diego County , about 50 percent of our mental health clients smoke , upon entrance for treatment , ” Sidelinger said . For those with alcohol addiction seeking help , 70 percent smoke .
“ The vast majority of smokers started before the age of 18 , ” Sidelinger said . “ If we can prevent youths from starting to smoke , we expect we can keep them tobacco-free for the rest of their lives . ”
Currently this is more of a proof-of-concept work and security was a big problem when developing . NfcService requires several permissions declared as system|signed which means it has to be signed with the same certificates used to sign the remaining system . I did not manage to do that , so I patched services.jar to ignore bad certificates .
( This paragraph is deprecated ) When device boots even if NFC adapter is active , it does not get full power right away . Instead , it sets up a BroadcastReceiver to catch ACTION_SCREEN_ON and ACTION_SCREEN_OFF events to power the module only when screen is lit . However , power manager service on SmartWatch 3 never sends these broadcasts , so the module never gets a signal to turn on . I am yet to figure out why , in the meantime I patched NfcService to turn the module regardless of current screen state . It does not start consuming power until a tag is first detected , after which the battery can be drained with rate up to 50 % per hour .
Police are investigating how a man was able to escape from police custody while being detained at a police box ( `` koban '' ) in Tokyo .
The Shakujii police department said the man , who was being held on suspicion of groping a woman in a train car on the Seibu Shinjuku line , escaped from the `` koban '' opposite Kami-shakujii Station in Nerima Ward on June 18 , TBS reported .
The police sergeant on duty , a man in his 50s , made the suspect wait in a back room at around 8 p.m. while he questioned the alleged victim . When he later went to question the man , the sergeant realized that the suspect had left the station by an unlocked back door , TBS reported .
According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department , the sergeant had not yet taken the man 's name , and as such , his identity is unknown . Before being left alone in the room , the suspect reportedly told the officer , `` This has nothing to do with me . ''
There was no other officer on duty at the time .

BARGHOUTI : Why we are on Hunger Strike in Israel 's prisons
Marwan Barghouti is best known as the Palestinian Nelson Mandela . He is being held as a political prisoner of Israel along with thousands others . He wrote this op-ed for the New York Times , launching the mass hunger strike inside the jails . However , the NYT only published it in the international edition and omitted it from the US edition . The Times then added an editorial note to the article following Israeli protest . We are posting the original article here especially for readers who did n't have access to it .
The Palestine Project Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 18 , 2017
By MARWAN BARGHOUTI • New York Times •
HADARIM PRISON , Israel — Having spent the last 15 years in an Israeli prison , I have been both a witness to and a victim of Israel 's illegal system of mass arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners . After exhausting all other options , I decided there was no choice but to resist these abuses by going on a hunger strike .
Some 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have decided to take part in this hunger strike , which begins today , the day we observe here as Prisoners ' Day . Hunger striking is the most peaceful form of resistance available . It inflicts pain solely on those who participate and on their loved ones , in the hopes that their empty stomachs and their sacrifice will help the message resonate beyond the confines of their dark cells .
Decades of experience have proved that Israel 's inhumane system of colonial and military occupation aims to break the spirit of prisoners and the nation to which they belong , by inflicting suffering on their bodies , separating them from their families and communities , using humiliating measures to compel subjugation . In spite of such treatment , we will not surrender to it .
Israel , the occupying power , has violated international law in multiple ways for nearly 70 years , and yet has been granted impunity for its actions . It has committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions against the Palestinian people ; the prisoners , including men , women and children , are no exception .
I was only 15 when I was first imprisoned . I was barely 18 when an Israeli interrogator forced me to spread my legs while I stood naked in the interrogation room , before hitting my genitals . I passed out from the pain , and the resulting fall left an everlasting scar on my forehead . The interrogator mocked me afterward , saying that I would never procreate because people like me give birth only to terrorists and murderers .
A few years later , I was again in an Israeli prison , leading a hunger strike , when my first son was born . Instead of the sweets we usually distribute to celebrate such news , I handed out salt to the other prisoners . When he was barely 18 , he in turn was arrested and spent four years in Israeli prisons .
The eldest of my four children is now a man of 31 . Yet here I still am , pursuing this struggle for freedom along with thousands of prisoners , millions of Palestinians and the support of so many around the world . What is it with the arrogance of the occupier and the oppressor and their backers that makes them deaf to this simple truth : Our chains will be broken before we are , because it is human nature to heed the call for freedom regardless of the cost .
Israel has built nearly all of its prisons inside Israel rather than in the occupied territory . In doing so , it has unlawfully and forcibly transferred Palestinian civilians into captivity , and has used this situation to restrict family visits and to inflict suffering on prisoners through long transports under cruel conditions . It turned basic rights that should be guaranteed under international law — including some painfully secured through previous hunger strikes — into privileges its prison service decides to grant us or deprive us of .
Palestinian prisoners and detainees have suffered from torture , inhumane and degrading treatment , and medical negligence . Some have been killed while in detention . According to the latest count from the Palestinian Prisoners Club , about 200 Palestinian prisoners have died since 1967 because of such actions . Palestinian prisoners and their families also remain a primary target of Israel 's policy of imposing collective punishments .
Through our hunger strike , we seek an end to these abuses .
Over the past five decades , according to the human rights group Addameer , more than 800,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned or detained by Israel — equivalent to about 40 percent of the Palestinian territory 's male population . Today , about 6,500 are still imprisoned , among them some who have the dismal distinction of holding world records for the longest periods in detention of political prisoners . There is hardly a single family in Palestine that has not endured the suffering caused by the imprisonment of one or several of its members .
How to account for this unbelievable state of affairs ?
Israel has established a dual legal regime , a form of judicial apartheid , that provides virtual impunity for Israelis who commit crimes against Palestinians , while criminalizing Palestinian presence and resistance . Israel 's courts are a charade of justice , clearly instruments of colonial , military occupation . According to the State Department , the conviction rate for Palestinians in the military courts is nearly 90 percent .
Among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians whom Israel has taken captive are children , women , parliamentarians , activists , journalists , human rights defenders , academics , political figures , militants , bystanders , family members of prisoners . And all with one aim : to bury the legitimate aspirations of an entire nation .
Instead , though , Israel 's prisons have become the cradle of a lasting movement for Palestinian self-determination . This new hunger strike will demonstrate once more that the prisoners ' movement is the compass that guides our struggle , the struggle for Freedom and Dignity , the name we have chosen for this new step in our long walk to freedom .
The Israeli authorities and its prison service have turned basic rights that should be guaranteed under international law — including those painfully secured through previous hunger strikes — into privileges they decide to grant us or deprive us of . Israel has tried to brand us all as terrorists to legitimize its violations , including mass arbitrary arrests , torture , punitive measures and severe restrictions . As part of Israel 's effort to undermine the Palestinian struggle for freedom , an Israeli court sentenced me to five life sentences and 40 years in prison in a political show trial that was denounced by international observers .
Israel is not the first occupying or colonial power to resort to such expedients . Every national liberation movement in history can recall similar practices . This is why so many people who have fought against oppression , colonialism and apartheid stand with us . The International Campaign to Free Marwan Barghouti and All Palestinian Prisoners that the anti-apartheid icon Ahmed Kathrada and my wife , Fadwa , inaugurated in 2013 from Nelson Mandela 's former cell on Robben Island has enjoyed the support of eight Nobel Peace Prize laureates , 120 governments and hundreds of leaders , parliamentarians , artists and academics around the world .
Their solidarity exposes Israel 's moral and political failure . Rights are not bestowed by an oppressor . Freedom and dignity are universal rights that are inherent in humanity , to be enjoyed by every nation and all human beings . Palestinians will not be an exception . Only ending occupation will end this injustice and mark the birth of peace .
There are rumors swirling that Donald Trump 's big surprise is that he has obtained divorce papers for the Obamas . If that is indeed the case ( and I have no proof that such papers even exist ) , I hope he does n't release them .
Because if he does , it 's likely good men and women will be even further discouraged from running for president .

You can have a good character , and yet still have incidents in your life that you would rather not be subject to public scrutiny and discussion . There was plenty of speculation about whether Mitch Daniels ' reluctance to run for president was partially related to the fact that he and his wife divorced , remained separated for a few years , and then remarried . There are politicians who have messy marriages , and who have children who have made poor behavioral choices .
Why exactly does the public need to know the details of any of this ?
No , I do n't think character is irrelevant . But if a politician is doing something right now , that is a very different case than if he did it ten years ( or more ! ) ago . And among embarrassing life events , there are categories . Cheating on your spouse is not equivalent to going through a rough patch in a marriage . Having a child who uses drugs is not the same as giving someone access to drugs or using them oneself .
Unfortunately right now our culture seems interested in finding out whatever we can , instead of using discretion about what 's relevant and what 's not , and instead of thinking about whether the enormous pain we are about to inflict on the individuals involved ( including innocent family members ) is really worth it . Politicians are not the Kardashians . Their claim to fame is n't who they are , but what they do . And therefore , our focus should be on what they do , except in unusual circumstances .
Work hard and go after your dream . Can it be as simple as that ? A panel of entertainment industry vets emphatically said yes , as they offered encouragement and advice to a full house of University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa students , faculty , staff , media and guests .
Hosted by the Mānoa Career Center , A Conversation with Hawaiʻi Five-0 was the second in a series of CBS on Tour careers in entertainment events highlighting the ins and outs of the entertainment industry through the lens of people involved in one of the most influential television shows in Hawaiʻi history , Hawaiʻi Five-0 .
The panel was made up of executive producers Peter M. Lenkov and Bryan Spicer , who is also a director , local casting director Rachel Sutton and one of the show 's leading men , actor Daniel Dae Kim . CBS executive and panel moderator Tiffany Smith-Anoaʻi led the group on a wide-ranging discussion touching on their respective personal journeys , practical tips for aspiring actors , writers and producers and inspirational insights into current movements and trends .
The near capacity audience of the large auditorium was given an opportunity to ask questions of the panel . Most questions were practical details of how to get ahead in the business .
The touchstone of the evening was the shows frontrunner position in the movement toward diversity and inclusion . “ The time is right for more diverse storytelling , ” asserted Kim . “ We want to hear stories from all points of view. ” He noted the work of many minority actors regularly on Hawaiʻi Five-0 as something he is personally proud of .
A San Jose jury has handed up a verdict [ PDF ] finding that Apple does not infringe two patents owned by GPNE Corp. , a patent-holding company that has licensed its patents to more than 20 other large companies .
While the jury found that Apple did not infringe a variety of patent claims , it found the two patents at issue , numbered 7,570,954 and 7,792,492 , to be valid . The patents describe network communication technology , and they were issued in 2009 and 2010 . Both are `` continuation '' patents , based upon other continuation patents , which stretch back to an original 1994 patent filing .
Essentially , the GPNE claims are from pager-era patents that the company tried to use to extract royalty payments from iPhones and iPads .
An Apple spokeswoman sent this statement about the results :
We are pleased the jury in California saw through GPNE 's attempt to extort money from Apple for 20 year old pager patents that have expired , wasting time for everyone involved . GPNE is a patent troll with no active business other than patent litigation . They have sent more than 300 demand letters in the past year to everyone from truckers and farmers to roofers and dairies threatening costly legal entanglements if these small businesses did n't pay them off -- this is n't right . Apple invents products that revolutionize industries , and relies upon the U.S. patent system to protect our innovation . We urge congressional leaders to continue focusing on reform in this important area of patent law .
GPNE founder and CEO Edwin Wong referred Ars to his attorneys . `` It was a hard-fought trial with a tough claim construction in a case in which our firm was hired a few months ago , '' said GPNE lawyer Kalpana Srinivasan via e-mail . `` We strongly believe the Judge will address the underlying legal issues in post-verdict motions . ''
Srinivasan added that GPNE invented its own technology , and the company continues to be inventor-oriented . `` The primary inventor , Gabriel Wong , is the Chairman of GPNE 's Board of Directors , '' said Srinivasan . `` He earned an electrical engineering degree from NYU in the 1960s and worked for telecommunications companies as an engineer . He came up with the invention that is the subject of the patents and attempted to commercialize it , as Apple recognized at trial . ''
Trolls ' top target pushes back
It 's no surprise that Apple is using this win to frame GPNE as an example of why the company wants patent reform . Advocates for reform were frustrated that the Senate failed to pass some version of the Innovation Act that went through the House , and some senators—including Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D-VT ) , and Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) —have said they 're determined to bring the issue back up .
Even as it has asserted its own patents against competitors , Apple has pleaded for reform . Earlier this year , it pointed out in a Supreme Court brief that it was the top target of patent trolls , having faced 92 lawsuits over a three-year period .
The GPNE v. Apple trial began on October 6 in San Jose , and it took place over about six days spread throughout the month . It was overseen by US District Judge Lucy Koh , the same judge who oversaw both of the Apple v. Samsung litigations .
While Apple has been quick to emphasize GPNE 's status as a `` patent troll '' post-trial , it was n't allowed to use that term during the trial . A few months before the trial began , Koh issued a ruling making clear that Apple would n't be allowed to call GPNE a `` troll '' at trial , which got some attention .
`` Apple may not refer to GPNE as a ‘ patent troll , ' ‘ pirate , ' ‘ bounty hunter , ' ‘ privateer , ' ‘ bandit , ' ‘ paper patent , ' ‘ stick up , ' ‘ shakedown , ' ‘ playing the lawsuit lottery , ' ‘ corporate shell game , ' or ‘ a corporate shell , ' '' wrote Koh , whose order was reported by Forbes . `` Apple may refer to GPNE as a ‘ non-practicing entity , ' ‘ licensing entity , ' ‘ patent assertion entity , ' ‘ a company that does n't make anything , ' or ‘ a company that does n't sell anything . ' ''
When conservative pundit Ben Shapiro arrived at University of Wisconsin-Madison on Wednesday to give “ a speech about free speech , ” Wisconsin talk radio host Vicki McKenna was on-hand to cover those protesting the event .
The inevitable confrontation is a perfect illustration of modern leftism on American campuses .
As chronicled by EAGNews.org , McKenna was soon approached by several demonstrators who thought suppressing just Shapiro 's free speech rights was n't enough .
“ Back off , buddy , ” McKenna says a to large ( black ) demonstrator who walks right up into her face .
“ You back off , you 're recording me so I 'm recording you , ” the man replies . Then he begins yammering about McKenna 's “ white supremacy ” while shoving his ( phone ) camera in her face .
Then a “ Mr . Lip Ring ” — later identified as Cody Fearing who apparently uses the pronoun “ they ” — comes in and attempts to play , sort of , peacemaker :
“ Let 's leave this room now . Let 's leave this room , both of you , ” Fearing says .
“ She has just as much of a right to be here as you do , ” a person with McKenna responds .
“ Absolutely , ” Fearing says .
“ You disrupted an event tonight , how do you feel about that ? ” McKenna asks .
“ It needed to happen , ” Fearing responds . “ Let 's leave this room . ”
“ How did it feel ? ” McKenna repeats .
Fearing utters possibly the … “ best ” line of the whole ordeal when the radio host asks why she does n't have a right to be there , but he , er , they and their crew can disrupt Shapiro 's speech : “ The presence of this event on this campus is violent . ”
More :
A police officer then stepped between McKenna and a growing group of social justice protestors who surrounded her . “ Let 's talk over here , ” the officer said . “ Why am I getting shoved away ? ” she persisted . “ I do n't want to talk to you , I want to talk to that man over there. ” “ We have to make sure everything is civil , ” the officer said as he continued to move her away from the area . McKenna turned to the camera . “ This is an absolutely amazing thing . … I 'm the one person being shoved out of the way here by the police department , and I 'm 5 ' 3 ” and you can tell that I 'm scared of that man right there , and you 're shoving me away. ” “ I 'm scared of you , white supremacist . I 'm scared of you , ” the large black man shouted over the officers , who stood between McKenna and the protestors and prevented her from continuing her interview . Numerous black students waived their middle fingers at McKenna over their shoulders . “ Your whiteness scares me , ” the black man continued . “ Get this recorded , ” McKenna said . “ My whiteness scares you ? ” “ Because she has institutional systemic power . Because you have historically oppressed my people . Because you have the colonial force at your expense , ” the black man yelled back , still recording . “ That 's why I 'm scared of your white ass , ” he said . “ And to be honest , I 'm not scared . ”
He 's scared … but he 's not scared . OK , makes sense . About as much as Shapiro 's mere presence on campus being “ violent . ”
On her Twitter feed McKenna links to a comment made by Fearing on Shapiro 's Facebook page where he admits the goal was to shut down the event .
The Young America 's Foundation put up a video of the same Shapiro protesters shouting “ Fuck white supremacy ! ” … with children nearby :
McKenna tweeted that the university “ patted itself on the back ” for “ empowering the agitators ” via this statement .

As the Canadian military campaign in Afghanistan continues to produce casualties , including a second ‘ friendly fire ' incident , one might assume that some of the impact of Michael Friscolanti 's book would be diminished . This is not the case . Anyone who has been involved with a board of inquiry , or who has dealt with the next-of-kin of military personnel killed in an accident , will recognize the personal dynamics at play in Friscolanti 's account of this tragic event and its aftermath . The title certainly represents truth in advertising , for the book tells far more of that unfortunate event , and in greater detail , than what appeared in the press . Making extensive use of the various inquiries into the bombing , along with information gathered in personal interviews with the protagonists and the families of the victims , Friscolanti succeeds in putting a human face on the affair . As a journalist without any particular background in military affairs , he comes at the story from a fresh point of view , with a feel for the human dimensions of this tragedy . The result is a compelling read .
Previously a reporter for the National Post , Michael Friscolanti is now a senior writer with Maclean 's magazine . A graduate of Lakehead University and the Ryerson School of Journalism 's graduate program , he was an editor at Ryerson 's student newspaper The Eyeopener , where he won a Canadian Association of Journalists award for student journalism . It should be no surprise , then , that his approach to writing the book is that of a journalist , “ to tell the story , and let the readers draw their own conclusions ... only years later , when I started to piece together this book , did I realize just how much of this story has yet to be told . ”
Simply put , the story that he relates concerns the events surrounding how four Canadian soldiers were killed , and eight injured , by a bomb dropped on them by a formation of two US Air Force F-16 fighter aircraft on the night of 17 April 2002 , while Canadian Forces soldiers were conducting a night shoot in the Tarnak Farms training area near Kandahar , Afghanistan .
That a bomb dropped by friendly forces should cause the first four fatal causalities of Canada 's ongoing mission in Afghanistan was a tremendous shock to Canadians . News coverage of the event and its aftermath was extensive . Friscolanti sifted through tens of thousands of words from official reports , and conducted numerous in-depth interviews with survivors , the families involved , the investigators , and the two F-16 pilots who conducted the attack – as well as their legal defence teams – to put together a story that makes gripping reading . These deaths were the first four of many that have followed to date , including some from a further ‘ friendly fire ' incident in 2006 . While Canadians may have become somewhat inured to the steady parade of losses , it is not easy to forget the shock that attended the loss of those first four at the hands of an ally .
The book proceeds in chronological order from that fateful night at Tarnak Farms , through the conduct of the inquiries and hearings , to the final interviews between the author and the pilots . Written in the present tense , and making liberal use of quoted dialogue from reports and interviews , the style is very much journalistic , placing the reader at the scene of the action throughout . While at times the text verges on the banal , in the style of the ‘ adventures in real life ' genre well known to Readers Digest fans , the material is gripping enough to keep the reader engaged as the story unfolds .
Friscolanti does an excellent job of explaining military jargon and procedures , so that even a reader unfamiliar with military terms and the lexicon of battlefield airspace control measures can understand the complicated issues involved . While occasionally slipping up , ( calling a C8 a ‘ machine-gun , ' for example ) , Friscolanti displays an admirable facility for laying out how all the ‘ bits and pieces ' of the military command and control structure in theatre worked , or failed to work . The elaboration of the shortcoming of the Airspace Control Order , Special Instructions ( SPINS ) and other control measures , so familiar to those of us who have flown in operational theatres , is well presented for the reader 's comprehension . The excerpts from the official investigations , combined with the statements he obtained from the persons involved , lead the reader to a clear understanding of what occurred that night when Major Harry Schmidt , USAF , dropped the bomb that killed the four Canadian soldiers .
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that one gains the illusion of understanding . The military investigations present an unambiguous case of two pilots , who , after flying long , boring missions over Iraq and Afghanistan , saw the ground fire at Tarnak Farms as their chance to finally get into the war . Invoking self-defence as an excuse to circumvent the Rules of Engagement that prevented them from engaging what they perceived to be a legitimate ground target , they dropped a bomb on their Canadian allies . However , understanding dissolves at the Article 32 hearing conducted by the US Air Force to decide whether to proceed with charges against the pilots . The high-powered lawyers of the defence team do their best to confuse the issues , deflect responsibility from their clients and generally blame anyone but the pilots for killing the Canadians . Apart from the obfuscation of the lawyers , the military judge saw a clear legal problem with the charges : the pilots intended to kill their target , and therefore they could not likely be found guilty of negligent homicide . Rather , they could be more properly charged with murder , a charge the US Air Force was not willing to bring against pilots in time of war . The outcome generally satisfies no one : not the families , not the US Air Force , and not the pilots .
Friscolanti purports not to have taken any particular side as he chronicles what he terms , “ the story of that mistake ... I draw no conclusions , nor do I pass any judgement. ” Notwithstanding this assertion , Friscolanti had to choose from thousands of pages of testimony and hundreds of hours of interviews for the material he used in the book , and what he did use ends up as complimentary for some and damning for others . The human parade passes before the reader . Some are either praised or blamed , according to their nature , and how they reacted to the stresses of the situation . A few relatives of the victims became obsessed with financial compensation , while others presented a more noble public face to honour their lost sons or lovers . Of the two pilots , only Major Umbach , the flight leader , seems to find a kind of redemption through making an unreserved apology to the families at the end of the Article 32 hearing . As for the other pilot – a Hollywood screenwriter could not have created a more stereotypical ‘ Top Gun ' than Major Harry ‘ Psycho ' Schmidt . The pilot who actually dropped the bomb , he escalates from one increasingly bizarre justification for his action to another , and he remains obstinately unrepentant to the end . The letter of reprimand Major Schmidt received from US Air Force General Mosely is a classic – it is worth buying the book just to read it . A more stunning denunciation would be harder to find . Schmidt never truly apologized , unlike Umbach , and he never saw the requirement . He comes across as arrogant , incapable of remorse , and forever unredeemed .
The result is both disturbing and unsatisfying . But life is often that way , and if that is what Friscolanti aimed to present – he succeeded . Friendly Fire should be on the reading list of every military professional .
ALAMEDA — Will Reggie McKenzie again display quick-strike capability ?
The Raiders ' general manager wasted no time in bringing in high-profile players on Day 1 of free agency in each of the last two seasons , signing center Rodney Hudson in 2015 and guard Kelechi Osemele , linebacker Bruce Irvin and cornerback Sean Smith a year ago .
The buzz has been quiet regarding the Raiders through the two-day negotiating period , with teams able to sign free agents Thursday starting at 1 p.m. ( Pacific time ) . The Raiders are comfortably $ 43 million under the salary cap , giving McKenzie the flexibility to sign a big name .
Besides Hudson , the Raiders signed defensive tackle Dan Williams , linebackers Malcolm Smith and Curtis Lofton , tight end Lee Smith and running back Roy Helu Jr. all on the first day of free agency in 2015 .
“ Reggie and I know our roster best , we 'll put together a plan , ” coach Jack Del Rio told reporters at the NFL scouting combine . “ That 's how we 've done it the last couple of years and I imagine we 'll do it exactly the same way this year . ”
The most prominent of their own free agents set to hit the open market is running back Latavius Murray , who had 797 yards rushing and 12 touchdowns this past season . It 's conceivable Murray could return should he not find a mega-deal elsewhere .
If not , speculation has centered on Minnesota 's Adrian Peterson , who reportedly will accept an incentive-laden deal and prefers to play with a contending team . Peterson 's father , Nelson Peterson , told the St. Paul Pioneer Press the Raiders ' offensive line was appealing for the 31-year-old running back .
“ The offensive line , they have n't been playing around , ” Nelson Peterson said . “ They have n't been trying to get O-linemen from the bottom of the barrel and trying to make them into something . ”
Besides age and injury , other concerns regarding Peterson include the fact that he is not considered a good pass blocker or receiver and that most of his career he has run out of a formation with the quarterback under center .

The Raiders , on the other hand , did much of their running out of the shotgun last season with the notable exception of a regular-season win over Denver . Quarterback Derek Carr told SiriusXM radio in a recent interview that he was hoping Murray would return , citing his strength as a pass blocker .
“ He 's an amazing pass protector , ” Carr said . “ If your running back loses in protection , all that money ( paid ) to that O-line does n't mean anything . ”
Other options for a bigger back to team with change-of-pace runners Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington include Pittsburgh veteran DeAngelo Williams , New England 's LaGarrette Blount and Green Bay 's Eddie Lacy .
Premium free agents linked with the Raiders include Arizona lineman Calais Campbell , New England linebacker Don'ta Hightower and New England tight end Martellus Bennett , although only McKenzie knows if he 's willing to give the kind of deals he gave to Hudson , Osemele and Irvin .
Aside from Murray , other Raiders scheduled for unrestricted free agency include linebacker Malcolm Smith , safety Nate Allen , cornerback DJ Hayden , quarterback Matt McGloin , wide receiver Andre Holmes , tackle Menelik Watson , long-snapper Jon Condo , safety Brynden Trawick , linebacker Perry Riley , linebacker Darren Bates , tight end Mychal Rivera and defensive tackle Stacy McGee .
Smith according to Peter Schrager of Fox Sports , is drawing interest from the 49ers . A two-year starter for the Raiders , Smith played in Seattle when new 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh was on the Seahawks ' staff .
Restricted free agent Denico Autry , given a low-round tender according to CSN Bay Area , can seek a deal with another team with the Raiders having an opportunity to match . Should the Raiders decline to match any offer , they would not receive compensation .
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Luckey said it was up to Apple to make machines that work well with the Oculus headset
The Rift headset will be available on Mac machines when Apple releases a `` good computer , '' said the founder of the Oculus virtual reality firm .
In an interview , Palmer Luckey said currently no single Apple computer met the minimum specifications for the Rift .
The problem lay in the fact that Apple did not prioritise powerful graphics hardware , he added .
By contrast , HTC said its headset would work with Apple machines at launch .
Questioned at a Microsoft Xbox press event , Mr Luckey said support for the Oculus Rift headset on Macs depended on the way Apple built its machines .
`` If they ever release a good computer , we will do it , '' he said .
`` It just boils down to the fact that Apple does n't prioritise high-end GPUs , '' he told the Shack News site . The Rift , and other headsets , typically require the computer to which they are connected to possess a powerful graphics card or GPU . Buying or building a machine to support the Rift has been estimated to cost about £1,000 ( $ 1,500 ) .
Some research suggests that fewer than 1 % of the world 's PCs are running hardware that can support VR headsets .
`` You can buy a $ 6,000 Mac Pro with the top-of-the-line AMD FirePro D700 , and it still does n't match our recommended specs , '' he said , adding that the company would `` love '' to support Mac machines .
Apple has not responded to Mr Luckey 's criticism .
In May last year , Oculus `` paused '' development of support for Mac and Linux computers in favour of getting everything ready for machines running Windows .
Oculus 's stance is at odds with HTC which has said that its Vive headset would work with Linux and Mac machines from `` day one '' . However , a VR testing tool released by HTC partner Valve last week currently only works on Windows .
The Oculus Rift headset is scheduled for release on 28 March and the HTC Vive headset will start shipping soon after on 5 April .
The U.S. presidential primary race is getting interesting — perhaps more interesting than it has been for the past 80 years or so . I 'm talking about the Democratic primary , although the Republican side is usually interested in its own special way . Beltway pundits are beginning to think that Bernie Sanders has a good shot at the nomination . And it may be even better than they think .
A New York Times/CBS poll released late Wednesday showed Hillary Clinton leading Sanders , 48 to 41 percent — down from a 20 point lead a month ago . Sanders showed a nearly 2-to-1 lead among voters under 45 years old . A Monmouth University poll released on Jan. 12 showed Sanders ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire by 14 percentage points ( 53 to 39 ) . A Quinnipiac poll released the same day showed Sanders erased Clinton 's lead in Iowa and was ahead by 5 percentage points .
On the standard political story , victories in Iowa and New Hampshire could provide momentum for Sanders and change the dynamics of the race . But the way in which this happens is also important for understanding the present situation . The Iowa caucuses will be held on Feb. 1 , just 18 days from now . New Hampshire Democrats will vote on Feb. 9 . The voters in these contests are the ones who have been paying the most attention to the candidates and to the issues . And Sanders is leading in both of them . This means that the national polls , which still show Clinton in the lead , may be skewed by the lack of engagement of these voters . The numbers could change quickly once people get to know a little bit more about Clinton 's challenger .
This is what happened in 2008 , when a freshman senator from Illinois named Barack Obama scored an upset victory against Clinton , whose nomination had been considered inevitable . In fact , two and a half weeks before the Iowa caucuses — which is where we are now , Obama was trailing Clinton by 6 points there and was about even in New Hampshire . And he was down by as much as 29 points to her nationally .
And at that time in the 2008 presidential primary race , Obama was not quite even with Clinton in South Carolina . But after he won Iowa and voters got a closer look at him , he beat Clinton there by 29 percentage points .
History could repeat itself , and it is clear from Clinton 's escalating criticisms of Sanders that she is worried about it . Another hefty chunk of déjà vu : MoveOn.org , one of the most powerful Internet grass-roots forces in the Democratic primary — or the country , for that matter — voted overwhelming on Sunday to endorse Bernie Sanders . MoveOn was a key player in the 2008 primary and mobilized tens of thousands of volunteers as well as money for Obama . With its endorsement this week , it has pledged to organize its 43,000 members in Iowa and 30,000 in New Hampshire . This could easily make the difference in Iowa , where 239,000 votes were cast in the 2008 caucuses ( a record turnout ) .

The wonderpus octopus ( Wunderpus photogenicus ) is a species of octopus in the monotypic genus Wunderpus . It is found in shallow waters from Bali and Sulawesi north to the Philippines and east to Vanuatu . [ 2 ] W. photogenicus is a long-armed species characterised by `` small eyes on elongate stalks , a long , conical papilla over each eye and a dramatic and fixed colour pattern of white bars and spots over a brown-red background . `` [ 2 ]
Identification [ edit ]
W. photogenicus is often confused with the similarly coloured mimic octopus , Thaumoctopus mimicus . Both T. mimicus and W. photogenicus can have variable activity patterns ; however , T. mimicus is most often diurnal , while Wunderpus tends to emerge very slowly from dens in the sand at dusk and dawn and is a crepuscular hunter .
W. photogenicus , showing its distinctive colour patterns Close up of , showing its distinctive colour patterns
Wunderpus photogenicus has well-defined white spots on the mantle , and bars on the arms . They lack a white border at the base of the suckers . These are some of the traits that distinguish it from T. mimicus , which has poorly defined dark and white markings on the mantle , and a bright white line along the base of the suckers .

One of the big requests from # GamerGate has been : ethics reform in journalism . It 's amazing that such a noble request was punted under the table while the skullduggery of the games and mainstream media pitched a series of lies over # GamerGate being nothing more than a harassment campaign . Well , narrative thread weaving has done little to stop angry consumers from making their voices heard , and whether people want to admit or not… mega-entities like Gawker are listening .
Kotaku In Action has been a stalwart frontrunner in maintaining a watchful eye on the ethics and reform in both games and mainstream media policy reform . There was a recent post about Gawker making some significant changes in their disclosure and affiliate policies ahead of the FTC 's new consumer information addendum due out in early 2015 .
The updated privacy policy at Gawker went live on December 17th , 2014 over on the Kinja platform . It discusses information collection , advertising affiliation , business relations and legal disclaimers .
As mentioned on the Kinja legal page…
“ Hi Kinja Users ! For the first time in several years , we 've updated our Privacy Policy . While we 're not legally obligated , it 's our intention to highlight the changes — most of which are clarifications to help you better understand how our Services work . ”
This is n't just preaching without practice . Gawker 's subsidiary , Kotaku , is already putting disclosure measures into effect right away , as you can see at the bottom of the article about the Logitech gaming mouse houses a small disclosure about Logitech paying for the trip to their campus , or this article about LG monitors where a disclosure clause makes it known that two review units were provided by the company .
Gawker 's full policy overhaul will go into full effect beginning January 19th , 2015 .
Thank you .
A lot of this has been put into effect after massive complaints were sent to the Federal Trade Commission about the lack of disclosure regarding native advertising and Gawker 's undisclosed affiliate links . The FTC recently addressed these concerns but did not divulge their involvement with any ongoing investigations . At present , there is already an open consumer complaint within the FTC 's database regarding Polygon and Gone Home under the “ deceptive advertising ” label , according to a FOIA consumer request .
Nevertheless , we 're seeing Gawker bend to the will of the consumer and this is a beautiful thing . It does n't matter at this point if any part of the media is misrepresenting or misappropriating their platforms to slander consumers using the # GamerGate hashtag to expose corruption scandals , because change is coming whether the scoundrels like it or not .

Late last month , the Japanese government declared a 20-kilometre radius no-entry zone around the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant . In effect , this was a mandatory evacuation order for all those remaining within the zone . There have also been reports that more and more people could be evacuated by the end of May .
Despite this , many people still reside within Fukushima . One of the most at risk demographics is children . Not only are these children sometimes being bullied by other students once they evacuate , but in a sense the Japanese government is hurting them as well : last month the government took the step of increasing the maximum safe amount of radiation exposure for children to 20 mSv/year . For comparison , 20 mSv/year is the current average limit of exposure for nuclear industry workers . This has led some to characterize the increase as ‘ unconscionable ' and ‘ inexcusable . ' The government has defended itself by saying this is still within the limits set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICRP ) . But , the ICRP limits that the government referred to were only general guidelines :
'When the radiation source is under control contaminated areas may remain . Authorities will often implement all necessary protective measures to allow people to continue to live there rather than abandoning these areas . In this case the Commission continues to recommend choosing reference levels in the band of 1 to 20 mSv per year , with the long-term goal of reducing reference levels to 1 mSv per year ( ICRP 2009b , paragraphs 48-50 ) . '
Because these were general guidelines , it 's possible they may not be wholly applicable to children , a point admitted by a ministry official . According to the Physicians for Social Responsibility ( PSR ) , a US-based physician-led non-profit organization , ‘ Children are much more vulnerable than adults to the effects of radiation , and foetuses are even more vulnerable . ' What gives the PSR statements weight in this situation is the fact that they were based on a comprehensive study of radiation 's effects on both adults and children by the National Research Council , not mere guidelines .
In response to protests by concerned parents , on May 27 the Japanese government reduced its recommended yearly exposure to radiation for school children down to 1 mSv/year , adding that where this level was exceeded , the government would bear the cost for removing the topsoil on school grounds—a technique which has been effective at significantly reducing radiation readings on the surface . Fortunately , in the interim , some municipal governments rejected the government 's prior 20 mSv/year figure and took it upon themselves to take additional , stricter precautions on behalf of the children .
Unfortunately for Prime Minister Naoto Kan , the reduction in recommended exposure levels has come too late for the government to avoid political damage . In addition to incurring the disapproval of organizations like the PSR and the distrust of municipal governments in Fukushima , Toshiso Kosako , an expert advisor to the Cabinet—handpicked by Kan—resigned in protest at the government 's prior decision to increase the recommended exposure levels . This disparity between experts ' opinions and the government 's actions has n't helped Kan 's image among the public . It 's certainly given the opposition another stick with which to beat him .
In early April , a 28-year-old student activist was brutally hacked and shot dead in the capital city of Bangladesh , Dhaka . Two weeks later , an English professor in northwestern Bangladesh was hacked to death in public because he was suspected of being an atheist . And just two days after that , an LGBT activist and his friend were murdered in a similar fashion at his residence .
All of these slain people had two things in common : Their thinking was unorthodox and they died in the same brutal way . The heinous killings that took place during April alone shows Bangladesh has become increasingly unsafe for people like them .
Ansar-al-Islam , a Bangladeshi militant group affiliated to Al Qaeda , is said to have claimed responsibility for the killing of the student activist Nazimuddin Samad , while the Islamic State was reportedly behind the murder of Professor Rezaul Karim Siddique .
Samad was active in blogging , guided by his secular principles . He was among the 84 people on a so-called 'hit list ' by the Islamists . According to Islamic State 's media agency Amaq , Siddique was targeted for his suspected atheist beliefs—a claim that was refuted by his family .
Ansar-al-Islam has reportedly claimed responsibility for the latest killings . Xulhaz Mannan was the editor of Bangladesh 's first LGBT magazine , Roopban . He was also a local hire at USAID 's Bangladesh operation . Mannan 's friend Mahbub Tonoy was a theater actor and activist . Ansar-al-Islam called them “ the pioneers of practicing and promoting homosexuality in Bangladesh . ”
Although global Islamist groups are suspected in the series of killings of social activists and educators , Bangladesh 's government flatly rejects it . Instead , the authorities maintain these killings were committed to put the government in trouble . Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina lays the blame for these killings on the opposition parties , the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami , which the parties themselves vehemently deny .
As the blame game between the government and the opposition parties drags on , Bangladeshi activists are being killed one after another . Last year , seven people were convicted of an attack that took place in 2013 . But aside from that , little progress has been made on the government 's efforts to bring the culprits to justice , leaving the activist groups with a feeling of hopelessness .
However , the government has offered a prescription for their safety : exercise self-restraint . For instance , Prime Minister Hasina rebuked the `` filthy words '' by the so-called `` free thinkers '' who attack religion . She wondered why the government had to take responsibility for any mishap that happens as a result of such writings . To many , Hasina 's comments would only embolden the radical groups that take offense at the words of those advocating liberal , secular ideologies .
Human rights group Amnesty International says the government has failed to check the increasingly disturbing trends in Bangladesh . The president of the London-based International Humanists and Ethical Union ( IHEU ) puts it more bluntly , saying the response from the Bangladeshi government is a `` sick joke . '' The U.S. administration has also released statements condemning these brutal attacks against the Bangladeshi activists with the latest coming from Secretary John Kerry in the aftermath of the pair 's killings .
Bangladesh 's government has been under sharp international criticism . But it seems to be ignoring the global outcry for the time being , lest it be seen to imply that it is tacitly acknowledging the presence of global terrorist networks operating within the country .
The alternative is to take firm , concerted actions to hunt down the perpetrators behind these killings . However , the authorities ' lackluster performance in protecting activists like these indicates that they either lack sincerity or the capacity to tackle this problem .
The international community , which includes the U.S. , has reiterated that it is ready to offer technical and expert assistance to Bangladesh . It is not certain whether Bangladesh has responded to the offer , though . Even if it has , it is also not certain to what extent .
Given that top government officials think that these heinous crimes are devious tricks of the opposition parties , it might be difficult for the country 's largely politicized law enforcement authorities to address the issue from a different perspective . This also means that any potential for building a national consensus as to how to deal with this threat is remote .
One ca n't help but conclude the situation looks dicey in Bangladesh . The political leadership needs to refrain from exploiting these killings for political gains lest Bangladesh—once promising—become a country where progressive voices fall silent .

Up to 150 homes in the West Midlands have been flooded after a 36in ( 91.4cm ) water main burst .
The pipe leading to the Barr Beacon reservoir burst in the early hours , flooding properties in the Blackwood Estate in Streetly .
South Staffs Water said it was made aware of the problem at about 05:30 GMT and that engineers isolated the burst .
Workers for the water company and Walsall Council will stay in the area over the weekend .
West Midlands Fire Service said flood water , which has since receded , had been 3ft ( 0.91m ) deep in places .
'Gushing noise '
Sheila Howard , who lives on the estate , said she had been alerted by the `` roar of the water '' .
Image caption Samantha Morris said her house had been `` ruined '' by the flood water
Ms Howard , whose basement was in 5ft of water , said : `` It frightened me to death because I 'm here all alone . ''
Samantha Morris , who lives near Ms Howard , was also woken by the `` gushing noise '' .
She said : `` I came downstairs and the settees were floating and all my daughter 's toys were everywhere . The house is ruined .
`` We have n't bothered clearing up because we do n't know where to start . I do n't know how we 're going to replace things . ''
'Team effort '
A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said one man had suffered an electric shock as he stood in water while a woman had suffered a minor head injury after falling .
He said crews remained at the scene until 12.30 GMT , helping the fire service who were running a boat in the more flooded areas .
Mac McGregor , area commander for the service , said it had been a `` real team effort '' to get the situation under control .
`` The water has just gulfed into the main housing estate and followed a natural path because the estate is on a hill and it 's just gone downhill .
`` Wherever the stream of water has gone it 's had an impact on all the houses . ''
About 60 firefighters attended the flood with many working in individuals ' homes .
Mr McGregor added that the council had organised the cleaning of drains and gullies to help the water filter away from the estate .
A spokesman for South Staffs Water said it was trying to contact all residents affected by the flood .
A NEW wonder fuel dubbed “ fire ice ” could be buried under the Scottish coast , according to government ministers and experts .
They suspect that massive quantities of methane hydrates reserves are locked of the coast of western Shetland , and that there is possibly enough to last 300 years .
The sherbet-like substance , which consists of methane trapped in ice , has already been tipped by energy experts to be the next major energy resource .
The wonder fuel was initially thought only to exist in the outer reaches of the solar system .
But fire ice has been discovered under the permafrost in the Arctic Circle and on some seabeds .
UK Energy Minister Charles Hendry said the government believes it is “ possible ” that the substance is buried in Scottish waters .
He said : “ The presence of methane hydrates in deep waters west of Shetland is possible , but has not been established . In the absence of any commercial technology for exploiting such resources , no estimate of reserves can be made at the present time . ”
Japanese experts are already carrying out test drilling off the south east coast of Japan and commercial production could start as soon as 2016 .
And global reserves of the substance could be more than the total for all other fossil fuels put together .
Potential
Professor Bahman Tohidi , director of the Centre for Gas Hydrate Research at Heriot-Watt University , Edinburgh said : “ For methane hydrate you need water depths of more than 1,640ft .
“ The only place we have those water depths is west of Shetland . We have n't seen any hydrates yet but there could be some there .
“ If there is a potential , it needs to be investigated .
“ I would say there are chances of it being in UK waters , but even if there is nothing in the UK we should be developing the technology .
“ It definitely will be a major industry . I always say it is far too big to be ignored – it 's like the elephant sitting outside your doorstep and we ca n't ignore it . Sooner or later we will develop the technology . ”
Despite fears that disrupting the seabed could release methane and accelerate climate change , scientists believe replacing the methane with oxygen could help tackle global warming .
A spokeswoman for industry body Oil and Gas UK said : “ We 're not aware of anyone investigating it in the UK but the volume of methane trapped in hydrates is believed to be very large worldwide . ”
Alex Kemp , renowned Aberdeen University professor of petroleum economics , said : “ I have n't heard of it being present in any significant amounts in the UK continental shelf .
“ In other countries , for example New Zealand , it is regarded as having a big potential . They think they have large amounts . There is the question of what technology to use to extract it . It 's all very futuristic . ”
Methane hydrate has long been regarded by oil and gas companies as a nuisance , because it can block marine drilling rigs .
The substance is formed within marine sediments where the gas is generated by chemical reactions or by microbes breaking down organic matter .
The gas then works its way up to the sea bed where sediments tend to be much cooler .
The cooling allows the methane molecules to form weak chemical bonds with the surrounding water molecules , producing solid methane hydrate .
However , such bonds also require high pressure — so methane hydrate forms only in deep water

Las Vegas police are investigating Chris Brown for possible misdemeanor battery and theft after a woman claimed he assaulted her and took her cell phone during an altercation at a party in a hotel room .
The 26-year-old R & B star was not arrested or charged with a crime . His rep told E ! News in a statement that the woman 's accusations are `` completely false . '' She has not commented publicly . Brown has undergone much legal turmoil involving other incidents over the past six years , including a 2009 attack against Rihanna , and his probation ended last March .
Police said that on Saturday morning , they were notified about a report of battery that had allegedly occurred inside a hotel suite at the Palms Casino Resort . Officers arrived at the scene and encountered a woman who `` appeared to have minor injuries sustained as a result of a battery . '' They said an investigation indicated she had attended a party inside a hotel room and that an altercation took place over a cell phone when she went to take a picture of Brown .
`` The victim was alleged to have been battered by Brown , who at the same time took her cell phone , '' police said in a statement .
`` A crime report has been taken for misdemeanor theft and misdemeanor battery listing Mr. Brown as a suspect , '' the statement read , adding that the investigation was ongoing and that detectives have not been able to contact the singer .

Cover Story : Two nights of fan riots at WWF live events
Subheadline : Michaels and Hunter refuse to wrestle two straight nights due to fan unruliness , leads to fights among fans
Cover Story by Wade Keller , PWTorch Newsletter
Fan riots broke out two nights in a row at WWF house shows over the weekend . Dec. 14 in Memphis , Tenn. and Dec. 15 in Little Rock , Ark. , debris throwing by fans got so bad that the main event each night was cancelled . Each night , when it was announced to the crowd that the card was over and the main event was cancelled , fans became even more unruly . In Little Rock , the chaos did n't quell until over 30 minutes later .
In Memphis , Shawn Michaels and Hunter Hearst Helmsley walked out before wrestling their match because fans threw garbage at them , ending the card on an extremely flat note . DX were scheduled to wrestle Jerry Lawler & Jeff Jarrett in the customized Memphis main event . Everyone was on edge leading up to the main event for a variety of reasons . Michaels 's fuse was especially short because before the match Lawler put up a fuss about doing a job to him in the tag match , even though after the match Lawler , Jarrett , and Brian Christopher were booked to clear the ring of DX and end the show on an up note . Ironically , Lawler used to always tell wrestlers in the Memphis circuit when he was champion , `` If you ca n't lose to the champion , who can you lose to ? '' Lawler pulled a Bret Hart or a Pierre Lafitte by not wanting to job `` in front of his hometown fans . ''
Undertaker wrestled the last match before intermission in Memphis . When he returned from the back , his ring outfit was soaked with spit . Fans were not just throwing debris at wrestlers , but they took to spitting at them as they walked to and from the ring . Security did n't do anything about it , thinking it was part of the show . That upset the wrestlers even more .
Fans had started throwing garbage at Henry Godwinn , who stood at ringside for the semi-final . When he got backstage afterward , he was so upset he began kicking at chairs in frustration with the lack of order in the arena . When Michaels , Hunter , and Chyna came to the ring for their match , Hunter did some heel mic work . Michaels followed with heel comments of his own . As fans began tossing bottles and cups at the ring , Michaels said , `` We 're leaving . '' They left , and at first it appeared to be part of an angle .
Dude Love eventually came out and introduced Lawler & Jarrett , who had n't come out yet . He also said DX would not come back out if fans did n't stop throwing things at the ring . As they talked , some debris continued to be thrown into the ring . Dude said , `` Maybe if we all close our eyes and make a wish , DX will be back in the ring . '' The road agents were running back and forth from the ring to the locker room , making it appear as if what was happening was n't a planned angle at all . In reality , as Dude was trying to calm the fans , Michaels and Hunter had already changed into street clothes . Management was behind Michaels and Hunter totally and agreed the situation was unsafe .
The referee eventually came back out and said that due to `` unsportsmanlike conduct by the crowd , '' DX was refusing to return , and therefore declared Lawler and Jarrett the winners via forfeit . A full cup of beer was then thrown into the ring and hit Lawler in the head . Some fights in the crowd broke out as some fans were upset with those fans who threw things , costing everyone the main event match they paid to see . Security had to separate some of the fans . Fans were upset with the WWF and other fans as they left .
On the WWF 900 line , Ross said the decision for DX not to return to the ring was a decision by management backstage , and not a refusal to return to the ring by Michaels and Hunter . He said the debris thrown at the wrestlers reached dangerous levels , although eyewitness reports said it did n't seem quite that excessive . Ross said : `` The WWF made the right decision . The safety of the performers and the fans comes first . It 's sad a certain small segment of ignorant drunks ruined the show for everybody else . ''
The next day local television affiliates in Memphis were bombarded with calls complaining about the situation . When the box office refused to offer refunds , a group of several dozen fans protested outside of the television news station .
The next night in Little Rock , in an apparent coincident , pretty much the same situation played out . Throughout the show fans were throwing debris and spitting at the wrestlers despite several warnings throughout the night by the ring announcer to stop . Security was casual about the conduct of the fans , which allowed the situation to snowball as the card progressed . They even threw debris during a presentation of a plaque by Shawn Michaels to an area celebrity during the card .......

Life in North Korea
Trying to find out what life is like in North Korea is a bit like trying to find out if the light turns off when you close the fridge door . You can never truly look inside and discover anything with certainty , but by talking with people and keeping your eyes open , you can start to get a basic sense of things .
The capital : Pyongyang
For citizens in the Pyongyang , life is certainly better than in the countryside .
North Koreans need permission to live in the capital ( there are roadblocks on the country 's streets that stop you moving around without permission ) and the city is generally made up of people loyal to the party and those who have a higher position in society .
At some special events we went to like a funfair and a FIFA soccer game , it was n't unusual to see people with mobile phones and digital cameras . But this certainly was n't a common sight on the streets , presumably because technology like that is too expensive for most people .
On the streets of North Korea 's capital themselves , there 's an eerie feeling of vacuity – an emptiness evident by the lack of vehicles , sounds of traffic or crowds of pedestrians .
In theory there are 3 million people in Pyongyang but it seemed quieter than a small country town . It felt a bit like one of those post-apocalyptic movies , with the irony being that the world thinks it will be North Korea that will wreak the apocalypse .
There is a sense on normalcy , though , on the public transport . The old buses and trams are full of people ( obviously they do n't own cars ) and the subway was packed at peak hour when we took a ride .
The average North Korean is n't commuting from home to the office , though . Many are employed in construction , manufacturing or the military . None of this is easy work , by the way , and the construction teams we saw were doing a lot more by hand than you would expect in any developed economy .
A department store on a main street was deserted every time we drove by it , just a lonely attendant standing behind a counter . Unlike a normal capital city , there were n't restaurants , cafes , bars or shops lining the streets .
The Pyongyang skyline was filled with the grey concrete apartment buildings that house the population , where they presumably spend a lot of their time . At night , though , many of the windows were dark ( either because of power shortages or because they were uninhabited ) and it felt like a city designed with the promise of a metropolis but without the ability to deliver .
Glimpses inside some of the lit apartments revealed simple , bare abodes with prominent photos of the leaders on the wall .
While most people seem to live in these rudimentary apartments , there is still a lot of grandeur in the public buildings and it 's hard to know whether the residents see the contrast as an insult or a source of pride .
One of the more impressive buildings is the Children 's Palace , which we were told is a place where schoolchildren come after class to learn music , sport and arts . Inside is a massive marble foyer , which seems a bit excessive for some young kids .
We were treated to a concert , which was extremely impressive , though . In keeping with the ideals of the regime ( and The Dear Leader Kim Jong Il 's artistic bent ) , children spend a lot of their spare time practicing singing , dancing and gymnastics .
Rural North Korea
Outside of the capital , any buildings of grandeur quickly disappear , save for the large bronze statues of the Eternal President Kim Il Sung . Green fields of corn and rice stretch from the road to the mountains on the horizon . The countryside is lush and green but this belies the poverty and rustic lifestyles of the citizens .
Everywhere we look there is hard manual labour . This is not a region with cars , let alone any machinery to tend to the land . Old women , backs bent , work in the rice paddies ; young boys carry large sacks in the arms along the side of the road ; a man cycles past with a dead pig strapped to the back of his bike .
It looked like extremely basic living , the kind of life that may not have changed for decades , and it was similar to a lot of the simple farming in South-East Asian countries . Except , of course , for the large signs in the fields and on the mountains , the messages of affirmation from Kim Jong Il in red and white , inspiring everyone to work harder for the good of the fatherland .
As I mentioned earlier , there are military checkpoints on the main roads to stop people leaving their area without permission . As we passed through the small cities along the way you could see they remained true to the communist architectural style of concrete with concrete . The larger apartment buildings looked like housing commission of yesteryear , while the small houses seemed to be in a constant state of construction .
In the regional cities , like most places , there was a noticeable lack of cars . But people did n't gather on the streets to socialise , they walked the footpaths with purpose but without determination .
Military personnel strolled through the cities , while schoolchildren travelled in small groups .
It also struck us that everyone outside the capital , regardless of rank or position , is thin . It was hard not to notice how gaunt each person is , still easily noticeable even under their drab pragmatic outfits .
We stopped at a small factory in one of the cities to see the ‘ great industriousness ' of the North Korean people . It was a water bottling plant and was staffed exclusively by women . Clean and basic , it seemed effective but had a lot less automation than you would expect in 2011 ( and you have to assume this was one of the better factories if tourists were allowed to see it ) .
Poverty and torture ?
Stories from citizens who have escaped North Korea paint a picture of daily life as full of back-breaking work , with so little food that they scavenge in the bush , and with the constant fear of retribution from the government if they step out of line or dare question the conditions .
With our tour guide minders controlling our accessibility , we certainly did n't see anything along those lines . But , at the same time , you never got the sense that people were particularly joyous . There was rarely laughter on the street or spirited conversation between friends that you would expect in a normal country .
To my eyes it seemed as though people were resigned to monotonous daily lives and were simply going through the motions because it was easier than challenging the situation .
Having said that , the North Koreans were always happy to smile and wave at us as we passed by . When we were able to catch those moments , you could see the warmth in their hearts and realise that there was a lot more going in inside than their dispassionate expressions let on .
There were a few times in Pyongyang when we saw the locals relax and truly enjoy themselves . At the soccer game between North Korea and that other football powerhouse Tajikistan , for instance . Or at the funfair , for which there is a weeks-long waiting list .
Our final day in Pyongyang was also National Day and there were celebrations of singing , dancing and games in the park ( with a little too much alcohol for some of the locals ) and the highlight – a mass dance with thousands of people in the square at dusk ( which we all joined in ) .
Regardless of what life has been forced upon these people – and we will probably never truly understand what that life is – they are still innately human .
It was nice to see the moments when that came out , when their teeth flashed into a smile , when the rhythm of the dance came naturally and not from education , and when they found enjoyment in the simple things in life .
A Toronto woman says she is appalled by her futile attempts to find a school for her 12-year-old son , who is confined to a wheelchair , to attend this fall .
Set to enter Grade 6 next year , Jacob Trossman is like any other child his age . He has a typical sense of humour , and enjoys telling jokes through his communication device , says his mother Marcy White . Using specially designed equipment , he 's able to swim 200 metres and even goes skiing and horseshoeing in the winter .
Born with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease , an incurable neurodegenerative illness that prevents him from walking or talking , Jacob overcame the odds to graduate from Grade 5 at Elkhorn Public School , near Bayview Avenue and Sheppard Avenue E. , on June 24 , winning the principal 's award for leadership .
“ Seeing him graduate , one of the children wheeled him to the front of the room to get his diploma . He was just one of the kids , ” said Ms. White . “ It just seems that the consensus is that as much as Jacob got out of his experience at Elkhorn , he gave just as much , if not more , to the community there… Jacob proved to everybody there that he can do it . ”
That 's why Ms. White ca n't wrap her head around the difficulties she 's having in finding Jacob a school for next year . The process started last August when she sat down with administrators at Dublin Heights Elementary and Middle School about an intensive support care program for Jacob .
“ Coming away from that meeting , I was shaking my head because the principal was saying the kids in wheelchairs are n't allowed to go outside in the winter because it 's too dangerous , ” she said . “ The kids in the wheelchairs do n't eat in the lunchroom with the other students . It 's all very segregated and everything I was trying to do was work towards an inclusion model for Jacob . ”
A later meeting left her feeling even more unwelcome , as staff told her they would n't be able to accommodate Jacob 's need for positional changes when he feels uncomfortable . This was a far cry from Jacob 's experience at Elkhorn , said Ms. White , where he was integrated into the regular classroom , along with his educational assistant .
So Ms. White suggested a similar set-up when she met with administrators of another school , the Deer Park Junior and Senior Public School . But she said the principal informed her that the Grade 6 teacher there has been teaching the same way for so long that her suggestion likely would n't work .
“ We have n't been able to find a school that 's willing to treat him , to recognize him as a person and not just a body in a wheelchair , ” she said .
Toronto District School Board spokesperson Ryan Bird said the school board has been working closely with the family and “ accommodations have been made ” to this point .
“ There are a number of schools that can meet the student 's needs and are happy to welcome him in September , ” Mr. Bird said in a statement . “ Of note , the TDSB has schools that solely support students with special needs and programs within regular schools that can also support students with special needs . ”
But Ms. White said Jacob should n't be “ relegated ” to a program for children with special needs “ just because their common issue is that they 're all in a wheelchair . ”
Ms. White said the current situation is especially hard to take because she has been through it before . In 2012 , she spent seven months advocating for Jacob to spend three days a week at Elkhorn , instead of the one half-day the school board would allow . Eventually , Ms. White 's work paid off .
But with less than two months left to find a new school , she does n't know what to do next .
“ He 's too social a kid , too smart a kid to just stay at home , ” she said . “ But I also do n't want to demean him by putting him in a place where they 're going to put him in a room and keep him isolated . ”
Ms. White said the struggle breaks her heart .
“ It 's something that should just be a natural flow from one school to another , ” she said . “ Parents should n't have to fight to get their kids recognized as people , just because they ca n't speak or they ca n't move on their own . ”

Nugent is one of many conservative commentators who have reacted to the election 's result by revealing his contempt for American voters .
The National Rifle Association board member also comments that he has `` a rotting fence post smarter than these mouth breathers '' and declares , `` Twenty years ago , the results would have been different . America was n't nearly as stupid back then as we are today . ''
Ted Nugent is continuing to attack Americans for re-electing President Obama , using his latest Washington Times column to state , `` If you voted for Mr. Obama , you are thunderously dumb and incredibly naïve . ''
From Nugent 's column :
We have fallen far and fast .
Instead of electing a serious-minded , proven professional , America went once again with a guy whose most impressive qualification is that of a questionable `` Chicago '' community organizer . I do n't mean Chicago in a geographic sense .
President John F. Kennedy would have been appalled . Instead of asking not what our country can do for us but what we can do for our country , in just 50 years since Kennedy uttered that famous phrase , it appears that a majority of Americans now demand that their country do for them . It 's America turned upside-down .
We have decayed into a nation of gluttonous , soulless pigs who feast on whatever Fedzilla provides by taking from one group of Americans ( the producers ) and giving to others ( the takers ) who have n't earned it and do n't deserve it .
[ ... ]
I 'm not nearly as surprised with the outcome of the presidential election as I 'm disheartened and disgusted that my fellow Americans can be this woefully uninformed , easily manipulated and thunderously ignorant . I 've got a rotting fence post smarter than these mouth breathers .
If you voted for Mr. Obama , you are thunderously dumb and incredibly naive . Believe it . For your intentional ignorance , you will ultimately pay a heavy price that you are obviously too ignorant to understand . Your children and grandchildren will pay an even heavier burden . America will pay the heaviest burden . Thanks for nothing , numbskulls .
[ ... ]
Twenty years ago , the results would have been different . America was n't nearly as stupid back then as we are today . The presidential election proves that the dumbing down of America is complete .
The cultural tapestry of America is changing with more people of color inhabiting America and voting . I have no issue with that . What I have issue with is anyone believing he is owed something without working for it and a president who agrees . That 's considered un-American by the roughly 50 percent of us smart enough to have voted for Mr. Romney , the far better choice .
Warning : this topic has not been posted in for at least 360 days .
Unless you 're sure you want to reply , please consider starting a new topic .
Well , despite this message : I think that a new topic is unnecessary , as my post is completely in line of the already existing topic . Therefore , please forgive me for bumping this back to the front page.Well , on topic ! Seeing this concept , and after reading it 's history ( both the true events and the `` What might have happened part '' ) from Zack Parson 's `` Final Book '' I have given this thing some thought.As mentioned on various forums and other websites , this thing is almost certainly too big and heavy to be of use . Good thing Speer cancelled it . Well , for Nazi Germany at least . In a historical context it might have been better if they did finish three of these monsters , as it would have depleted their resources and wasted man power which would have helped end the war a year or two earlier . * WE WILL RETURN AFTER THESE MESSAGES * ================================== * WE 'RE BACK , READY FOR ROUND TWO ! ! * Sorry about that , my Modem needed to be rebooted.As I was saying , the P. 1000 Ratter and the P. 1500 Monster are unpractical designs , despite how attractive they might seem at first . A bit like the giant walking Viggers/Centinental HWR-00 Monster Mk II Heavy Weight Robot from the Japanese anime Macross . It looks good and effective on the show , but it 's a slow walking 24 meters tall , 40 meter long giant . Might just as well been painted red with a big sign `` shoot me '' on top . I still love the design though , and some smaller walking armor / vehicles might not be totally out of the question , despite the fact that they would look nothing like this , or like any of the other Manga/anime shows.However , I think there 's a way to put a big Naval gun on a land mobile vehicle . And the answer to that is this : Yup , an Electromagnetic Rail gun from BAE . Read the article , it 's very interesting ! Imagine , a 15 kg projectile ( lighter than standard tank ammunition ) flying towards the target with a speed of Mach 7 ( ca . 8,568 km/h or 5,324 mph ) over a distance of about 500 km ( 310 miles ) and still hit the target with a speed of Mach 5 ( ca . 6,120 km/h or 3,803 mph ) . No matter what kind of armor you have , nothing will protect you against that ! You wo n't even need explosives , the speed and shockwave alone would be devastating enough.Of course the gun needs a huge power source , but surely this will be developed in the next couple of decades . After all , we can now build a laser inside a Boeing 747 . A rail gun of 32 MegaJoule mounted on a big tank-like vehicle should also be possible in the future . Because ultra-thick armor is getting more obsolete these days , and speed and mobility are more important , a lighter vehicle , say 300 metric tons maximum ( yes , still over three times the weight of the heaviest tanks around ) should be possible . The size of the vehicle would also be smaller than the P. 1000 but still large , say about 20 meters long . Powerful gasturbines or the latest issue diesel engines could be used to power it . The gun itself could use some kind of re chargable ( flywheel technology ? ) batteries , to power the magnets.Self defense of the beast would be provided by Goalkeeper or Phalanx CIWS , AMRAAM missiles ( as used on the HMMWV ) or even small VLS systems would give it good protection against aircraft and helicopters.There would be a big problem though . How would you deploy a monster like that to a warzone ? Sure , by ship , but you 'll need a very big LCAC or LCU to bring it ashore . Hmm ... Might be an idea to take the LST 's out of the mothballs . At least the Russians have the capability with their Ivan Rogov or Ivan Gren large landing ships.Well , closing off , here are some more interesting images of the original Ratter , as well as some other futuristic tanks , and possible candidates for the rail-gun super tank.Ratter ... Concept image I found on the net ( looks pretty defendable , but probably still easy prey for aircraft ) : Amazingly interesting ( German language ) website following the build of a 1/87 P. 1000 Ratter can be found here @ www.Panzerbaer.de Some large tank designs by Kemp Remillard . Looks like a beefed up Abrams with some Merkava influences . Not as big as the Ratter , but likely to be more `` Maus '' sized.Turret deployed and stowed ... Well , so far my contribution to the topic . Hopefully it was worth it , and a new discussion starts from it . I like to design futuristic vehicles myself , and will try to work out some sketches ( yes , with pencil and paper ! ) of the Rail-gun super tank .
Prison overcrowding : A boon for the for-profit industry New deals with private prison firms in California show who really benefits from mass incarceration
A Huffington Post report Friday highlights how the private prison industry relies on and benefits from mass incarceration and attendant prison overcrowding in this country .
Eerily , the article notes , the president of for-profit prison leviathan Corrections Corporation of America ( CCA ) , David Myers , foretold , `` If we build it , they will come . ''

And indeed a spate of recent federal and state deals have enabled the continuing growth of the Prison Industrial Complex . Overcrowding in federal and state prisons is not prompting the sort of reform desperately needed to bring down the U.S. prison population ( we boast the highest incarceration rates in the entire world ) . Rather , the situation is proving a boon for private prisons .
`` Instead of facing the sort of politically tougher questions of how to revise the sentencing structure , the state uses the private prisons as the release valve , '' Donald Specter , who heads the Prison Law Office , a Berkeley-based public interest firm , told HuffPo .
In attempts to close budget shortfalls and relieve overcrowded public prisons , the for-profit players are brought in , and incarceration rates continue to rise . Myer 's comment was all too prescient .
As HuffPo reported :
Pwn2own 2016 day 1 : Hackers expose issues with Google Chrome , Apple Safari and Adobe Reader
Hackers at Pwn2own , the annual browser-hacking competition in Vancouver , Canada , have successfully unveiled new security flaws in Google Chrome , Apple Safari and Adobe Reader , among others , taking home around $ 282,500 ( £195,300 ) .
The 2016 Pwn2own event is being sponsored by Hewlett Packard and Trend Micro . The event is held each year , with leading tech giants like Google , Apple and others in attendance , encouraging researchers and hackers to actually attempt to hack into their browsers .
Commenting on the flaws uncovered , Trend Micro 's Global Threat Communications manager Christopher Budd said , “ The [ Windows ] kernel vulnerability was a use-after-free vulnerability . They successfully chained both of these to compromise the target at the system level . One of the vulnerabilities was in Safari , the other three were vulnerabilities within Mac OS X . ”

Hackers unveiled vulnerabilities within Mac OS X , Windows 10 , Chrome , Safari and Adobe . A group of hackers called the 360Vulcan Team won $ 132,500 after hacking into Adobe and Chrome and exposing vulnerabilities . The team exposed a issue in Windows Kernel and an out-of-bounds vulnerability within Chrome .
JungHoon Lee , an independent security researcher won $ 60,000 after exploiting Apple 's Safari and exposing several vulnerabilities in the tech firm 's OS X desktop software . One of the three teams of Chinese firm Tencent 's , Shield , uncovered new vulnerabilities within Apple 's Safari , which led them to winning $ 40,000 . Further , Tencent 's Team Sniper successfully targeted and exploited Flash , winning the team a $ 50,000 award .
Day two of the event will involve Team Sniper taking yet another aim at Safari , while Lee is slated to take on both Chrome and Microsoft 's Edge browser , according to a report .
The event is advantageous to both hackers and tech companies , as it provides the former with a chance to showcase their talent and the latter with the information required to tighten security flaws in their products .
BONN , Germany — Increasing the use of hydrogen in power , transport , heat and industry could deliver around one fifth of the total carbon emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to safe levels by mid-century , a report by the Hydrogen Council said on Monday .
To encourage industries to use hydrogen , Toyota and Air Liquide helped set up the Hydrogen Council , a global lobby launched in January this year .
Its 27 members include automakers Audi , BMW , Daimler , Honda and Hyundai , and energy firms such as Shell and Total .
The council said using hydrogen for transport , energy generation , energy storage , industry , heat and power could cut annual carbon emissions by 6 billion tonnes by 2050 .
`` This would ... contribute roughly 20 percent of the additional abatement required to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius , '' the council said in a report released on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference in Bonn .
To achieve a two-degree limit this century agreed by governments in Paris in 2015 , the world must reduce energy-related carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2050 .
The report said one in 12 cars sold in California , Germany and Japan were expected to be powered by hydrogen by 2030 .
By 2050 , hydrogen could power 400 million cars , 15 million to 20 million trucks , around 5 million buses , a quarter of passenger ships and a fifth of non-electrified train tracks , as well as some airplanes and freight ships .
Achieving this shift in transport and other sectors would require investment of $ 280 billion by 2030 , with about $ 110 billion to fund hydrogen output , $ 80 billion for storage , transport and distribution , and $ 70 billion to develop products .
Fuel cell vehicles combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity to power an electric motor , producing water as a byproduct . However , making hydrogen from fossil fuels , a common route , also produces some greenhouse gas emissions .
So far the take-up of hydrogen vehicles is tiny and industry experts say their wider use is years away , with high purchase prices and a lack of refueling stations the major barriers .
But some firms , such as miner Anglo American and carmaker Toyota , are pushing for fuel cell cars to play a role even with the rise of battery-powered electric vehicles ( EVs ) .
Woong-chul Yang , vice chairman of automotive research and development at Hyundai said EVs and hydrogen fuel cell cars were needed because EVs were better for city driving and fuel cell vehicles better for longer journeys .
Some countries have set targets for hydrogen use , such as China , which aims to have 1 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2030 . Britain has a 23 million pounds ( $ 30 million ) fund to accelerate the take-up of hydrogen vehicles .
Some Chinese firms are interested in joining the Hydrogen Council , Pierre Etienne Franc , vice president of the hydrogen initiative at Air Liquide , told Reuters . `` Most probably we will have a Chinese member in the next six months , '' he said .
The council believes that , with the right policies , the investment needed was `` feasible '' and the hydrogen market could see revenues of more than $ 2.5 trillion a year .

EVEN two decades after the Indian technology miracle began it is hard not to be impressed by the scale of the achievement . Particularly considering the obstacles . The roads in Bangalore , the city at the heart of the revolution , still suck . Power cuts still periodically kill the lights and air conditioning on the campuses of the big IT firms , until back-up generators come to the rescue . This is a world-class industry built from nothing , that won most of its business abroad , while overcoming India 's lousy infrastructure and inept , and sometimes venal , state .
Indian IT has made shareholders and employees rich and now boosts the country 's balance of payments by $ 59 billion a year . Yet its impact goes far beyond the numbers . The big firms were among the first to win blue-chip American and European clients and to adopt blue-chip governance and accounting norms themselves . This won acclaim from foreign investors . The industry “ changed perceptions of India as a third world country , ” says S. Gopalakrishnan , the chief executive of Infosys who heads upstairs to become co-chairman in August . On the other side of town , Suresh Senapaty , the chief financial officer of Wipro , says the industry “ created a global brand for India ” that helped firms in other sectors to compete abroad .
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor 's Picks .
Yet there is a slight whiff of a mid-life crisis . So far this year both Infosys and Wipro , two of India 's “ big three ” IT firms , have given guidance for profits that has disappointed analysts . Both are restructuring their operations and have had turbulence at the top . Infosys muddled the transfer of power among its founders . Wipro , a firm still controlled by its long-time leader , whose villa can be spotted through a forest glade next to its headquarters , lost its joint-chief executives . Only the largest , Mumbai-based TCS , is firing on all cylinders .
In the grand scheme of things these companies ' performance is still strong , with sales growth and margins which are , by global standards , impressive . Although many Western multinationals initially slashed their budgets in response to the financial crisis , they quickly performed a U-turn and increased spending , as they redoubled their efforts to redesign and outsource key parts of their businesses . Still , there is a growing drumbeat among the IT providers about the need to create “ non-linearity ” . Translated into English , this means severing the umbilical link between sales growth and employee growth . Indian IT companies are desperate to escape their tag as “ body shops ” whose main competitive advantage is low labour costs .
That advantage is still formidable . The cost arbitrage available by employing Indian engineers rather than Western ones is still at least 50 % . The strategic worry probably reflects three things , though . First , large Western rivals have come a long way in replicating some of the advantages of Indian firms . Wipro 's Mr Senapaty says that for many years they dismissed the Indian model as a temporary phenomenon boosted by the dotcom bubble and the Y2K scare : “ It was only in 2003 and 2004 that they realised the Indian model would survive. ” Now firms such as IBM and Accenture have vast employee bases in India too , and although they still struggle to grow as consistently or as profitably as Indian firms , they can compete better .
Second , there are long-term worries about the supply of cheap labour . Wages for employees in India are rising at over 10 % this year , and as the economy develops there will be more competition for talent from other industries . The solution is to improve the supply , and the quality , of graduates – only about a quarter of job applicants are typically considered employable – but that will take time and patience .
Third , there are echoes of a political backlash , particularly in America , over the granting of work permits to Indian engineers and of outsourcing jobs more generally . One state , Ohio , has banned the use of public funds for services that are provided offshore . Mr Gopalakrishnan looks pained when discussing this . His view is that the industry has created new jobs not stolen old ones . Still , he admits , that “ recently the disparity in growth rates and in job creation have created renewed focus on domestic job generation ” in rich countries .
What might the next stage of the industry look like ? Most firms want to build their presence in emerging markets . Today they usually serve the local operations of multinationals . Tomorrow , with luck and effort , they may win the business of big companies based in countries such as Brazil and China . With existing Western customers , however , the urge of all three of the big Indian IT firms is to embed themselves deeper in the client – providing not just a laundry list of specific services at a low cost , but becoming a more integral part of how they run their business .
This has its own risks – a rising portion of Indian IT firms ' revenues come from fixed price , long-term contracts , for which they must estimate their outlays over years and attempt to deliver on budget . In may other industries , from catering to infrastructure , such contracts mean taking more risk , and accepting higher upfront investments in return for the promise of an influx of cash at the end of the contract . Mr Senapaty 's response is measured . He says that the hope is that after many years of doing business with its clients , Wipro knows its stuff well enough to understand how its costs will pan out . All the same , it has beefed up its risk management as the nature of pricing has changed .
Alongside expanding geographically and deepening client relationships , all three firms are also exploring the outer reaches of technology and how society will use it . From the impact of cloud computing and mobile services , to clients ' desire to make their businesses more environmentally sustainable , projects are afoot to anticipate the future . Coming from most companies such speculations would be dismissed as guff . But in time India 's IT firms will surely invent new products and markets . After all , they are past masters of taking something that only exists in their imaginations and turning it into a multi billion dollar reality .
Strange error when installing npm package globally on Ubuntu
10th February 2014 | by Adam Beres-Deak | npm , ubuntu , node.js
Installing modules globally has never been a problem for me , neither on Windows nor on Ubuntu . At least until today , when I ran into a somewhat strange problem .
I tried to install the pm2 package on an Ubuntu 12.04 Server ( sudo npm install -g pm2 @ latest ) , but the package just did n't want to install correctly . I kept getting gyp error messages and this one : `` OSError : [ Errno 13 ] Permission denied '' . I thought it was impossible to get this error since I was running the installation command as root ( sudo ) .
Installing modules with the unsafe-perm flag
And after a while I found the solution : using the unsafe-perm flag . sudo npm install -g pm2 @ latest -- unsafe-perm
What the docs say about this flag :
If npm was invoked with root privileges , then it will change the uid to the user account or uid specified by the user config , which defaults to nobody . Set the unsafe-perm flag to run scripts with root privileges .
And it worked for me like a charm !
Honestly , I have to admit , that it is not 100 % clear to me , why it made any difference in this case . I suspect that it was because of gyp . Does anybody maybe have a better explanation ?

Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome was asked Tuesday night about the team 's interest in recently released cornerback Kyle Arrington .
`` There are a lot of players available right now that I have been on the phone talking to representatives of , '' Newsome said in a conference call with season-ticket holders .
Newsome rarely gives out much information when talking about the team 's plans , but there 's a little intrigue at this point . Newsome and coach John Harbaugh both acknowledged the interest to add another cornerback , and the top target is clearly Arrington ( pictured ) after he was surprisingly released by the New England Patriots on Monday .
In terms of the free agents available , it 's Arrington and there 's everyone else . He 's a tough cover man who is strong in run support and on special teams . Arrington can fill the void at nickelback and serve as quality insurance if Jimmy Smith or Lardarius Webb get injured .
The other viable options are Tarell Brown , a four-year starter for the Raiders and 49ers who is coming off season-ending foot injury , and Carlos Rogers , a 33-year-old defender who was limited to seven games last season because of a knee injury . The Ravens can also bring back the likes of Antoine Cason or Danny Gorrer .
No one is suggesting Arrington is a Pro Bowl cornerback , but he might as well be viewed that way when looking at the alternatives . For that reason , Arrington is n't going to come cheap . He 's going to want to get as close to that $ 3 million that he was originally scheduled to earn this year with New England . Every cornerback-needy team is going to pursue Arrington , and there is still a chance Arrington will return to the Patriots on a cheaper deal , according to ESPN Patriots reporter Mike Reiss .
The Ravens have the cap room to sign Arrington . When Baltimore signed Smith to a four-year , $ 48 million extension last month , the Ravens reduced Smith 's cap number by $ 3.2 million . The Ravens should use a chunk of that space to get a tested veteran like Arrington .
Cornerback was the weak link last season , and it remains the biggest concern right now . Free agents such as Perrish Cox and Cary Williams -- whose deals averaged over $ 5 million per season -- were too expensive . Top draft picks such as Kevin Johnson and Marcus Peters did n't fall to the Ravens in the first round .
The Ravens drafted Texas Southern 's Tray Walker in the fourth round , but it 's unknown how much impact he can provide as a rookie . Baltimore understands the need for experienced depth at that position . When the Ravens won the Super Bowl in 2012 , they were able to withstand the season-ending knee injury to Webb because they still had Williams , Smith and Corey Graham .
Right now , the Ravens have Smith , Webb and some question marks . The hope is for Asa Jackson or Rashaan Melvin to step into the nickelback role , but there are no guarantees of that happening .
It 's clear the Ravens need Arrington . It 's just a matter of whether they can make it happen .
`` We are still looking for defensive backs , '' Harbaugh said . `` There 's no doubt about it . We want to add some competition in there . Ozzie is working on that right now . Ozzie has said , 'We 're not finished there . ' ''
First Principles¶ In 2000 , as his dissertation , Roy Fielding , one of the cofounders of the Apache open source HTTP server project , proposed a new standard for Internet-facing APIs . Rather than having proprietary communications protocols spewing complicated binary data back and forth , Fielding thought that communications should take place over HTTP , using HTTP standard forms of communication , and using representations of the state of the application , rather than actually transmitting the application 's state . This document describes what we now know as REST APIs , and it is fundamental to how the Internet works today . One of the key principles of REST APIs is that each request contains within itself all of the context needed to act on that request – and each response is similar . There are no “ sessions ” in REST APIs ; a request sent one time should do exactly the same thing if sent again . This simplifies some things , but complicates others . Another key principle written by Fielding in his paper was the concept of “ Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State ” , or HATEOAS . The idea was that a client application could automatically “ discover ” all of the resources that an API provided , as well as the methods and variables exposed to work with those resources . If the state of the server changed , and one of those methods was no longer available , then the client library would become aware of that as part of the normal course of operations ; similarly , a new resource would be immediately available for consumption .
Simplification¶ The use of idempotent operations ( the same action should have the same result ) and of context wholly contained within the request significantly simplifies serverside programming . Rather than maintaining a table full of active session information for its clients , a server needs only to listen for requests , and map them to the relevant data based on the query received . For example , a server that receives a “ GET ” request at the “ Widgets ” endpoint , with an ID parameter of 123 can simply know that it should query the Widgets table of its database and return the entry with an internal ID of 123 . This also simplifies things for the client . Rather than having to maintain an idea about “ where ” in the application it is , it can simply perform requests for particular pieces of information as needed , with the understanding that there wo n't be any undue side effects . When using a REST API , the application can be confident that , in general , requests do n't need to be performed in any particular order .
Complication¶ While RESTful principles certainly make communication simpler , there are still some missing pieces . RESTful requests are made over HTTP ; we know that . However , there are any number of different ways to do that , and almost every single one has been used by some API , in some form or another . And , what 's worse , HATEOAS has not been widely implemented , even though it would have solved many of these difficulties . As a result , when working with RESTful APIs , developers have to spend significant periods of time interpreting exactly what the request for a particular resource ought to have in order to be properly interpreted by that particular API . Since the code becomes largely specific to the task at hand , it ca n't be reused for other purposes , even though the protocols for communication between various REST APIs are , at a base level , quite similar . The developers of each API might also have a specific idea of what a REST API ought to look like , and might push that agenda by forming their API in a particular way , or with a particular style . This makes the issue even more difficult , by causing APIs to have less and less in common .
Existing Solutions¶ There are some solutions today that aim to make working with REST APIs simpler and easier . The largest of these in Python is the “ Requests ” library . Request aims to simplify RESTful requests by condensing commonly-used resources into a single library , and stitching them together so that they can be used within a single line of code . For example : resp = requests . get ( 'domain.tld/api/resource ' ) . json ( ) The above code succinctly describes exactly what the developer wants to do - and then does it . It uses the HTTP GET method at the web address “ domain.tld/api/resource ” , takes the response , and parses it from a string in JSON format into a native Python dictionary . Requests also provides other useful features , such as cookie persistence and automatic handling of URL parameters and headers . However , Requests does n't actually deal with any of the fundamental problems that are at play in modern REST APIs . Does it make it easier to work within the constraints of the existing system ? Sure – but because the Requests library is as fundamentally stateless as the APIs it 's interacting with , it has no way of eliminating them entirely . A variable that 's defined as being passed in a URL parameter must be passed to Requests as a URL parameter , or the request wo n't work .
The Problem Remains¶ What 's more , many modern REST APIs do n't do a good job of descriptively converting their internal state hierarchy into a set of resource URIs that can be accessed programmatically . This is best exemplified by Wikipedia , whose REST API has but a single endpoint which accesses any resource according to the parameters passed to it : https : //en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php To access any resources on the API , the developer has to delve into the ( often-lacking ) API documentation and figure out exactly what parameters are needed for which resources . She then has to build a class or method that encodes that information into a programmatic form for later use , because knowing that https : //en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php ? format=json & action=query & prop=revisions & rvprop=content & titles=Wisconsin will return the article for the state of Wisconsin in JSON format is hardly useful or memorable . The Requests method is n't much better : payload = { 'format ' : 'json ' , 'action ' : 'query ' , 'prop ' : 'revisions ' , 'rvprop ' : 'content ' , 'titles ' : 'Wisconsin ' } resp = requests . get ( 'https : //en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php ' , params = payload ) . json ( ) This situation is made worse by the fact that a URL parameter is only one type of variable . A given API might not only require the developer to remember ( or memorialize in code ) that several different variables exist , but also which of five or more variable types each is , some of which might be handled by Requests natively , but some others of which nmight take some manual labor to get working .
Already the markers were being laid in the propaganda war with the reported brutality and barbarism of the Germans and Austrians laid bare to readers in a number of articles ( see pages 6-8 ) . Their practice of mine-laying for example , which had caused the sinking of the Amphion , was condemned as a crime against civilisation . The hysteria over supposed activities of their countrymen in Britain showed no sign of abating , with numerous reports of suspicious behaviour on page 9 .

As of last month , 7,370 child abuse cases are under investigation by Child Protective Services in Harris County
The News interviewed current and former caseworkers and reviewed nearly 10,000 child abuse cases from Region 6 , which includes Harris and a dozen nearby counties . It found CPS ' performance and the plight of kids in Harris County was far worse than the agency previously acknowledged :

“ That is crazy to put that kind of incentive in when you 've got people 's lives at stake , ” Stephanie Taylor , a former Houston CPS investigator , said of the party contest .
Some have resorted to promising pizza and ice cream parties for workers who can catch up on extreme case backlogs , The News found . Agency chiefs , alarmed at recent media reports of children in trouble , prod workers with mandatory overtime and help from other CPS offices in the state , as they did last weekend . They achieve modest but short-lived gains .
While leaders in Austin have yet to offer a permanent solution to stem the tide of exiting caseworkers , regional CPS bosses are scrambling to check on more and more kids with fewer and fewer experienced workers .
Exhausted and demoralized workers flee the job , sometimes suddenly , and their caseloads are often inherited by investigators and supervisors who ca n't even keep up with the children and families they already have . And the agency ca n't stabilize the workforce the way child-welfare experts recommend , by paying a more competitive salary and reducing caseloads , because Republican state leaders do n't want to spend the necessary money .
“ We have a complete array of efforts in place in Harris County and Region 6 to ensure that more kids will be seen , ” he said .
After The News shared its findings with him , Crimmins released statistics showing that between Sept. 12 and Monday , Harris County investigators reduced by about half — to 740 from 1,494 — the number of children in open cases who had n't been seen .
Those include assigning some units to focus solely on departing workers ' abandoned caseloads ; possibly expanding an experiment in which a Harris County unit works 10-hour shifts from Thursday through Sunday , to keep late-in-the-week tips from growing stale ; and maybe revamping Harris ' current assignment of cases by ZIP code , which produces uneven workloads , he said .
Patrick Crimmins , spokesman for CPS ' parent agency , the Department of Family and Protective Services , said the agency is aware of problems with Houston-area investigations and is rushing to make improvements .
“ These numbers are shocking , ” said Scott McCown , who runs the Children 's Rights Clinic at the University of Texas law school and , for decades , has urged state leaders to plow more resources into CPS . “ You court disaster by waiting months to go see a kid . And the lack of urgency about this problem from our state leadership is deeply troubling . ”
As of Sept. 11 , about half of children referred to the county 's CPS investigators were n't being seen on time , The News ' analysis shows . And in 1 out of every 5 open cases there , children were n't being seen at all .
Child-abuse investigators in Harris County are failing to make initial contact with at-risk children more so than in any other of the state 's largest counties .
But the Harris County CPS office — by far the worst when it comes to seeing children on time , if ever — is failing to check on kids far more often than officials have previously disclosed .
A.J. , N.T . and C.W . are only a few of tens of thousands of potentially endangered Texas children who have n't had a timely visit from CPS workers who , faced with low pay and untenable caseloads , have been quitting in droves .
The database shows in new detail the magnitude of dysfunction within Texas ' child welfare system . It tracks hundreds of at-risk children who are slipping through the state 's grasp as leaders fail to stem an exodus of experienced child-welfare workers .
Their names and specifics of their cases are among more than 7,300 Harris County child abuse cases detailed in an agency database obtained and analyzed by The Dallas Morning News .
C.W. , an infant whose parents are suspected of extreme neglect , was last seen in a hospital in April 2015 , according to state data . In over 500 days , no caseworker has documented an attempt to follow up , a crucial step in ensuring his safety .
Two-year-old N.T . was believed to be at risk of sexual abuse . But as of last month , the Houston-area girl had gone more than 96 days without being seen by a child-abuse investigator .
Under state law , a Child Protective Services investigator should have seen her within 24 hours of receiving her report of abuse . But according to the agency 's own accounting , as of mid-September , no one had checked on her in at least 170 days .
A.J . is a 4-year-old Houston-area girl believed to be at risk of serious harm or death from physical abuse .
After The News shared its findings with the governor 's office Tuesday , the next day Gov . Greg Abbott , Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick and House Speaker Joe Straus , all Republicans , released a joint letter in which they condemned the agency 's failure to check on at-risk children promptly .
That letter , addressed to department chief Henry “ Hank ” Whitman , ordered the department to develop an “ innovative plan ” to hire and train more child abuse investigators to address the extreme backlogs .
While the letter acknowledged “ associated financial costs , ” it directed Whitman to essentially bolster existing efforts and fell short of calling for higher wages for caseworkers and child abuse investigators , which advocates say is the necessary fix .
Whac-A-Mole
High-level staffers at the Health and Human Services Commission , which oversees Whitman 's department , and Abbott 's office have known since at least February that tens of thousands of endangered Texas kids are n't being seen by caseworkers promptly — while thousands are n't seen at all .
In Dallas County , spiraling caseworker turnover and punitive management policies set off a crisis more than a year ago .
Last spring , the fatal beating of 4-year-old Leiliana Wright of Grand Prairie highlighted systemic failures and the potentially deadly consequences of the agency 's high turnover of low-paid caseworkers buried beneath extreme case backlogs . The News also reported that Harris County was headed for trouble , possibly disaster .
Yet , internal records and data show little statewide improvement , while Harris County has gotten worse when it comes to seeing endangered children promptly .
Houston-area personnel cited a Whac-A-Mole effect : Over the winter and spring , dozens of the the area 's investigative caseworkers were sent to help rescue Dallas County , which sent Houston workloads spiraling .
Then , over the summer , two investigative supervisors abruptly walked off the job , each leaving about a half-dozen workers demoralized and in the lurch . Many of them soon quit , dumping on remaining workers cases that were growing old — sometimes “ delinquent , ” or open for over 60 days , and with kids never seen .
CPS ' new leaders , installed by Abbott 's social services czar last spring , have kept top state officials abreast of problems with Houston-area operations , Crimmins said .
“ We communicate regularly with the governor 's office and state leadership , and legislative offices , about CPS issues , ” he said .
Trends in the data , which are updated daily and used by managers to assess investigators ' performance , have clearly alarmed the region 's CPS leaders .
Abbott has promised an agency “ overhaul , ” which has come in the form of replacing four of 10 CPS regional directors . A review of all regional managers under them , and whether “ they are helping caseworkers make correct decisions in the field , ” is under way , Crimmins said .
Neither Abbott nor protective services chief Whitman has embraced what many child advocates and state employee union leaders say is the solution to sky-high turnover among investigators : better pay and working conditions to retain experienced caseworkers .
Instead , officials in Austin have lowered the education requirements to become a caseworker , which allows the state to expand pools of applicants for jobs where the average salaries remain about $ 18,000 below those of public schoolteachers and $ 24,000 below those of police officers . CPS pays a starting investigative caseworker about $ 39,000 . The department also has asked the Legislature for money to create more positions , even though the agency 's own data show it is struggling to fill the low-paid vacancies it already has .
Meanwhile , as more children with increasingly difficult needs are referred to CPS , the agency 's ranks grow less experienced by the day .
And , veteran workers suggest , top leaders have little clue what motivates the beleaguered caseworkers and investigators to try to clean up the mess .
In late August , managers eager to improve numbers announced a new initiative .
Noting that on average , more than 20 percent of children referred to the office are n't seen — state rules say it should n't surpass 5 percent — a top CPS manager in Harris County announced that regional leaders would throw pizza and ice cream parties each week for units that met new benchmarks in seeing children .
Eligible units would have to bring down the share of Priority 1 children who have n't been seen to 5 percent or less , Deputy Director Debra Reyna wrote in an email obtained by The News .
A flyer obtained by The News to incentivize CPS workers to see more Priority 1 children .
“ Let 's show everyone how we can turn it around and have the largest improvements in the state ! ! ” she said in a later email .
Quick tracking of sometimes dysfunctional and highly mobile families is paramount in investigations , experts say . Visiting families swiftly can mean the difference between life and death .
But some workers see the contest as suggesting that laziness and lack of motivation among workers are the problem , rather than high caseworker turnover and impossible workloads .
Crimmins described the parties as a show of appreciation by management . “ It may brighten a caseworker 's day , and we see nothing wrong with that , ” he said .
Crushing workloads
About half of full-time Houston-area investigators , those with at least 10 active cases , are juggling 30 or more children , the new Region 6 data show . Of them , 10 caseworkers have over 70 children under their purview . The Child Welfare League of America , a national advocacy group , says the ideal caseload is 12 .
Jess McDonald , who ran the Illinois child welfare system in the 1990s and early 2000s and is credited with turning it around , said the missed or late visits in the Houston area are “ very serious ” lapses .
“ How important is it that people get out timely ? If your fire department got out as timely as your CPS system is , think of what the consequences would be to neighborhoods in any large city , ” he said .
Thirty-two percent of CPS investigators in the 12-county Houston region quit each year . McDonald said low pay , heavy workloads and inexperienced unit supervisors — “ your most important management position in these agencies ” — create an unsolvable mess .
“ You 're never going to escape turnover at the front end , ” he said , without a major infusion of resources and creation of a cadre of supervisors who can keep rookies “ calm and focused , and help them manage their time . ”
Child-abuse investigator case load While inexperienced investigators are assigned just a few cases as they learn the job , many workers in Region 6 , which includes Harris County , are responsible for checking on 50 or more children and families .

Agency dysfunction
Some current and former caseworkers take issue with being graded by face-to-face contacts because the data can contain errors . Some are caused by inputting missteps , which can be hard to avoid , given the clunkiness of the state 's aging computer system .
Chronic miscommunication between swamped caseworkers and data-focused higher-ups is also a factor , they said . Often , children and family have n't been seen because caseworkers have been unable to locate them . Confusion about which county a child resides in can also lead to the case being shuffled back and forth among units , while potentially endangered children remain unseen .
Taylor , the former Houston investigator , said regional managers do n't support workers . Instead , they insist on rapid-fire decisions about children and parents before investigators have time to properly analyze families , she said .
“ They want you to close the cases like clockwork [ but ] you ca n't do that , ” said Taylor , 41 , who quit in April after 2½ years of what she called unceasing misery in the job .
“ Then you know what happens ? That 's when we get the news that one of these kids died , ” she said . “ My heart wo n't let me do that . ”
On a given day , statewide , over 3,400 children who were on CPS ' radar had n't been seen once by a caseworker , The News reported in May . That figure has risen steadily , however , to reach about 4,700 children as of Sept. 12 , according to data released this month .
Last spring , about 1,300 Harris County children who were supposed to have already had a face-to-face contact with a caseworker had n't been seen . On average , 13 percent of Priority 1 children were n't being seen on time in the first few months of 2016 .
By September , more than one-third of Priority 1 children were n't being visited on time , The News ' analysis found . According to its own data , Harris County has gotten worse , with about half of all cases logged as not timely by child abuse investigators .
Across Texas , this alarming trend also has n't budged . Nearly 10 percent of all credible Texas child abuse calls are n't resulting in caseworker contact with children , newly released state data show .
In Region 3 , which includes the Dallas-Fort Worth region , about 8.4 percent of children have n't had a caseworker visit , internal agency memos show .
Absent higher pay , the agency 's tracking of worker retention indicates CPS probably ca n't keep workers on board . It costs the state $ 54,000 to train a new hire — money wasted if the worker quits . Last year , CPS lost 1,543 caseworkers , meaning it blew $ 83.3 million , Crimmins said .
McDonald , the Illinois child welfare leader , said there 's no breaking the cycle on the cheap .
“ If you 're working on this kind of job and you 're getting clobbered every time you walk into the office and you feel like you 're going to be held responsible for something bad that happens to a kid — and you 're getting paid [ s -- t ] wages — if you 're not thinking of another job , you ought to be , ” he said .

“ If no one ever looked at art , would anybody even create it ? And how much does art actually need buyers. ” Extremely reasonable questions put forth by the 2014 BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors , these queries appeared especially intriguing during the latest iteration of Art Basel in Miami Beach ( ABMB ) . A positively gilded affair that looks increasingly beholden to a global art-as-asset aesthetic , this year 's ABMB featured lots of shiny surfaces , stacks of joke paintings , and enough zombie abstraction to inspire several remakes of World War Z . The fair 's thronged aisles of mostly uniform wares also sparked a few less politic questions . Among them : Who buys all this shit ?
The answer , of course , is a growing connoisseur class that has developed a special predilection for what is , without a doubt , the new art of the 21st century—art fair art . Because a growing number of financial players increasingly see art as having permanent value , these masters of the universe have successfully redrawn the global art world ( as well as its proliferating entertainments ) in their plutocratic likeness . Among the signs of the new times is the newfound comfort many artists have developed with art entrepreneurship 's boldface names . These are the Aby Rosens , Alberto Mugrabis , and Stefan Simchowitzes of the world . More powerful still are their growing legion of imitators .
Where artists were once predictably wary of such dealer-collectors , they are now extremely solicitous of their money—if the loads of sunny paintings and mirrored sculptures on view at this year 's ABMB are any indication . Among the latter , there are Bertrand Lavier 's transparent acrylic painting on mirror Harrogate ( 2014 ) at Kewenig and Doug Aitken 's EXIT ( large ) ( 2014 ) , a flashy take on the “ Exit ” sign , composed of powder coated steel and mirror at Regen Projects . Artists and their galleries shipped in scads more mirrored works and upbeat art fair art to match the Black Friday-like consumption that would follow . It did , in money-laden spades . More reason , it would seem , for artists up and down the art market ladder to scrap their critical inhibitions , stop worrying and love the M-bomb .
At ABMB 2014 , that love officially became infatuation . Today , the 13-year-old fair can be said to specialize not just in blue chip art ( everything from Basquiat and Bacon paintings to photo-based works by Cindy Sherman and Richard Prince ) , but in a cheery brand of content-free stuff that actively caters to the tastes of the global collecting class . Handsome , glitzy , and insubstantial to the point of being as light as air , this kind of art perfectly patronizes the tastes of today 's high net worth individuals . Not unlike the effects of 19th century academic painting on the French bourgeoisie , this newfangled art Pompier is designed to be overblown and insincere ( or ironic , take your pick ) , yet hold or increase its value while providing , in turn , an exquisite reflection of the worldview of the new overclass . But what to do when the triumph of pretty pictures—sometimes extremely pretty pictures—leaves art in the lurch with regard to the globe 's other 99.99 percent ?
Inside the Miami Beach Convention Center , it was as if Ferguson and the Eric Garner verdict had never happened—though angry pilots did protest ABMB 's longtime sponsor NetJets outside the fair entrance over planned cuts and shrinking benefits , and Ferguson-related protests sprang up elsewhere in the city . With the notable exception of the very few artworks that featured critical content—among them , Kendell Geers 's police baton sculpture in the shape of a pentagram at Goodman Gallery and Ana Mendieta 's wrenching video of a 1975 blood strewn performance at Lelong—the vast majority of objects on view at the fair flattered or directly reflected the superior , detached ideal of today 's megarich . But like with the smooth , artificial academic painting of the 19th century , there are consequences to art fair art 's frivolous disengagement from the world . Here 's one in a golden nugget : beauty is passing , dumb is forever .
Besides Pop-inflected art fair tchotchkes by the usual suspects—Josh Smith ( at Mnuchin ) , Cory Arcangel ( at Team ) , and Sterling Ruby ( at Xavier Hufkens ) —veteran artists like Mel Bochner also got into the sales act with gusto . One of his dealers counted at least six chuckle-headed text paintings at the fair , while I spied two peppy colorful works from the Blah , Blah , Blah series ( 2008-2012 ) in the same aisle . Bjarne Melgaard , a purveyor of highly sexualized and misogynistic provocation , opted to show eight brightly hued primitive gestural paintings at Gavin Brown 's booth—several resembling expressionistic smiley faces . Other artists and galleries making hay while the sun shone last weekend included Damien Hirst 's bright , pharmaceutically-inspired sculptures at Paul Stolper , Sherrie Levine 's suite of hanging colored mirrors at Paula Cooper , and a blithe graffiti canvas by the late Keith Haring at Edward Tyler Nahem .
Another indication that works at art fairs have literally thematized the idea of art as retail therapy were Eric Fischl 's paintings of well-heeled buyers standing around perusing the displays at—where else ? —art fairs ( one such painting incredibly features a figure in front of an edition of Aitken 's Exit ( large ) , the very same one hung at the booth at Regen Projects ) . Works like these lead to a natural conclusion : artists across the board are as comfortable as luxury department store clerks with romancing the billfold . But the new art fair art is not just sales-savvy , it 's cynical . Exhibit A is Arcangel 's Going Negative/Lakes ( 2014 ) , a flatscreen TV turned on its side . Its linguistic jiu-jitsu reads : “ Fuck Negativity . ”
Of course , even a small Jeff Koons work is capable of encapsulating the artistic zeitgeist better than his legions of zombie children . His mirror piece at Gagosian 's stand is not just the costly vanity piece that launched tens of thousands reflective objects , it is the perfect synecdoche for a vastly improved brand of strategic art that may have finally relegated contemporary art 's critical power to the dustbin of history . In the words of New York magazine 's Carl Swanson , Koons ' vapid works routinely repeat the question that matters most in today 's art world : “ Who 's the fairest collector of them all ? ”
But the last word on the material that dominated the floor of ABMB 13 goes to Rafael Ferrer , an underknown artist whose neon sign Red , White & Blue ARTFORHUM ( 1971/2014 ) ( at Henrique Faria Fine Art ) presciently antedates the use of this now ubiquitous material . More than four decades after it was conceived , the answer to Ferrer 's implied question is all too obvious . Without the winners of a lopsided global economy and the artists who dutifully butter them up , the vast majority of the crap on view last week in Miami would not exist .

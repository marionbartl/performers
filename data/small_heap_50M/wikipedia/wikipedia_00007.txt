John Bard ( February 1 , 1716 – ) was an American physician . He was the first in the United States to take part in a systematic dissection for the purpose of instruction and he was the first in that country to report a case of extra-uterine pregnancy .
John Bard was born on February 1 , 1716 , in Burlington , New Jersey . His father , Peter Bard , a Huguenot refugee from France on the revocation of the edict of Nantes , went first to London , and then to Delaware in 1703 , on a mercantile venture . This is not proving successful he settled in Burlington , where he was appointed judge of the supreme court and a member of the governor 's council , dying at an early age and leaving his widow , a daughter of an English physician named Marmion , with a family of seven children to educate on very slender means . John , her third son , was sent to Philadelphia where he received the rudiments of a classical education , partly at the hands of a Scotch gentleman , Annan by name , a man of reduced circumstances but an accomplished teacher of Latin and an exponent of polished manners .
At the age of fifteen John was bound apprentice , according to the custom of the day , to John Kearsly , an English surgeon of good talents but of an unhappy temper . He treated his pupils with great severity and subjected them to most menial employments to which John would have scarcely submitted , as he said , were it not for the fear of disappointing his mother and because of his affection for Mrs. Kearsley , who showed him the greatest kindness . For seven tedious years he stayed with the doctor , stealing his hours of study from sleep , after the family had gone to bed and before they got up in the morning .
An early intimacy with Benjamin Franklin , of kindred mind and no unequal fortune , served to brighten Bard 's leisure hours and to stimulate his industry . They were members of the same club and they corresponded and kept up their friendship throughout life .
Bard settled in practice first in Philadelphia where he married a Miss Valleau , a niece of Mrs. Kearsley , like himself a descendant of a refugee and equally destitute of the goods of this world . Of this union was born Samuel Bard , organizer of the first medical college in New York and a noted writer on midwifery . After practicing six or seven years in Philadelphia , Bard was induced by Franklin to move to New York in the year 1746 , to take the place of Dr. Dubois and Dr. Dupie , who had died there of yellow fever . His cheerfulness , conversational ability and tact , coupled with sound professional attainments , soon won for him a large practice . Bard read much in the medical literature of the day and also in the English authors and his retentive memory enabled him to delight his friends with long and appropriate quotations .
Upon the arrival in New York harbor of a Dutch ship in 1759 containing cases of a malignant ship fever , Bard was employed by the corporation to take proper quarantine measures . Every nurse and attendant in the hospital had the disease . Thus , Bard was impelled to draw up a memorial urging the expediency of providing a pest house against similar occurrences and the result was the purchase of Bedloe 's Island and the building upon it , Bard becoming health officer . He was likewise appointed surgeon and agent for the sick and wounded seamen of the British navy at New York , retaining the position until he retired from practice . He was a friend of Peter Middleton , one of the noted medical men of the time and a founder of the medical department of King 's College , and Bard assisted Middleton in the first recorded dissection .
As regards this , David Hosack says : `` As early , however , as 1750 , the body of Hermannus Carroll , executed for murder , was dissected in this city by two of the most eminent physicians of that day , Drs . John Bard and Peter Middleton , and the blood vessels injected for the instruction of the youth then engaged in the study of medicine ; this was the first essay made in the United States for the purpose of imparting medical knowledge by the dissection of the human body , of which we have any record . ''
In 1778 , Bard retired from practice and settled on a farm he owned at Hyde Park , on the Hudson River , in Dutchess County , but being reduced in fortune by the American Revolution he returned to New York at the peace of 1783 and resumed practice . On the establishment of the Medical Society of the State of New York in 1788 he was unanimously chosen its first president .
Bard was not a voluminous writer . In a letter to John Fothergill of London , dated December 25 , 1759 , he communicated `` A case of an extra-uterine foetus , '' that was read to `` A society of physicians in London , '' March 24 , 1760 , and published subsequently in Medical Observations and Inquiries , in 1762 . It was a woman of 28 years who went through her second pregnancy with only slight abnormal symptoms and at the end of nine months had a few labor pains , but delivery did not take place . In spite of the presence of a large right-sided abdominal tumor she had another healthy child by a normal labor , but five days after delivery pain and fever began and at the end of nine weeks of treatment by fomentations , fluctuation in the tumor could be determined . Bard in the presence of Dr. Huck , an army physician , opened the abdomen by a long incision and delivered a macerated full-time fetus and much pus , the patient then nursing her child and making a good recovery .
Several papers on yellow fever from Bard 's pen are to be found in the files of the American Medical and Philosophical Register , and after his death there appeared in the same publication ( April 1811 , i , 409–421 ) an essay on the nature and cause of malignant pleurisy that had been delivered before `` A weekly society of gentlemen in New York , '' in January 1749 . Here we have a reference to probably the earliest medical society in the country . It was patterned after Dr. Fothergill 's London society apparently and , according to Peter Middleton , was in existence twenty years later .
In 1795 Bard , then being in his eightieth year , gave an address before the state medical society calling attention to the presence of yellow fever in the city , meeting much opposition and some obloquy by so doing . Nevertheless , his advice as to treatment of this dread disease—sweating the patient—proved more successful than other methods . In 1798 he gave up practice and retired to Hyde Park where he died , March 30 , 1799 , at the age of 83 .

Frederik Iversen ( 1864–1948 ) was a Danish traditional musician and composer . He became famous through the dances he held in from 1912 to 1939 at his restaurant Trædballehus west of Vejle , in Western Jutland . He played the clarinet and fiddle and composed many of the tunes that are now the stock of Danish traditional music , such as his famous version of `` trædballehus polka '' ( which he probably adapted from other local fiddlers ) . At Trædballehus he performed with his musical partner the fiddler Jens Andersen , and the duo achieved national fame , with the Danish National Radio even transmitting live from some of their dances .

The Maison Mantin ( ; `` Mantin House '' ) is a late 19th-century French mansion located in the town of Moulins ( Arrondissement de Moulins )
in the Allier department of central France .
The mansion , shuttered for more than a century , opened its doors to the public in November 2010 as a museum .
History
Maison Mantin was commissioned by Louis Mantin , a wealthy man from Moulins , who wanted to showcase his art and antiques collection . It was designed by a noted local architect , René-Justin Moreau ( April 28 , 1858 - September 18 , 1924 ) , in collaboration with his father , Jean-Bélizaire Moreau ( 1828–1899 ) , also an architect , and built in 1893 .
Mantin bequeathed the mansion to the town of Moulins in his will , written before his death in 1905 . The will stated that the house be kept intact , so as to show to visitors in 100 years `` a specimen of a bourgeois home of the nineteenth century '' .
Consequently , the house was kept shuttered for over a century , with all its original contents , and fell into disrepair . After extensive restoration , it was opened as a museum , and a showcase for the eclectic taste of its former owner .
The Building
The first draft of the architects ' design for Maison Mantin was akin to a Gothic mansion , but the final design was more picturesque , borrowing many of the elements of a seaside villa . The architect gave free rein to his taste for eclecticism : in the study and dining room with wood paneling , and the neo-renaissance decor of the `` room of the four seasons '' with plaster decorations and paintings in the style of Louis XVIII ; the modern bathroom has stained glass and paintings in the Art Nouveau style . The project is important in that it paved the way for the design trend of the `` castle-villa '' .
The house incorporates the technological innovations of its period : electrical lighting , hot-and-cold faucets , overhead shower and flushing toilet .
The Collection
The museum contains a dizzying maze of paintings , books , photographs , miniature objects , stuffed animals , ceramics , minerals , carvings and rare and unusual objects gathered by Louis Mantin from his travels in different parts of the world .
The rich collection and the ornamentation of the house give it a unique character .
The museum also has a screening room .
Visitor Information
The entrance to La Maison Mantin is in common with the Anne de Beaujeu Museum , and permitted only with a guide-lecturer .

The 2006 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup , sometimes called the Al Amoudi Senior Challenge Cup due to being sponsored by Ethiopian millionaire Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi , was the 30th edition of the international football tournament , which involved teams from Southern and Central Africa . The matches were all played in Addis Ababa from 25 November to 10 December . It was competed between the same teams as the previous tournament , except for Eritrea , who did not enter due to their long-running clash with Ethiopia regarding borders , and Kenya , the five-time champions , were serving a ban which was issued on 18 October 2006 , which was then an indefinite from international football by the decree of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( 'International Federation of Association Football ' ) , or FIFA ; this after Kenya `` regularly violated or ignored '' `` Fifa 's statutes , regulations and decisions '' . Malawi and Zambia joined the tournament after being invited , and competed as guest teams as they were from the federation Council of Southern Africa Football Associations ( COSAFA ) , whereas the rest of the teams were from the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations ( CECAFA ) . The reasoning behind their invitation was that it would `` boost the competitiveness of this year 's tournament '' . The defending champions , Ethiopia , were knocked out in the quarter-finals after coming second in their group , and Sudan claimed their second title despite being beaten by Zambia , as Zambia were guests .
Background
The CECAFA Cup is considered Africa 's oldest football tournament , and involves teams from Central and Southern Africa . The matches in the 1973 tournament were played from 22 September 1973 until 29 September 1973 . The tournament was originally the Gossage Cup , contested by the four nations of Kenya , Uganda , Tanganyika ( modern day Tanzania ) , and Zanzibar , running from 1929 until 1965 . In 1967 , this became the East and Central African Senior Challenge Cup , often shortened to simply the Challenge Cup , which was competed for five years , until 1971 , before the CECAFA Cup was introduced in 1973 . Ethiopia were the defending champions , having won the 2005 tournament in Rwanda , after finishing second in their group , and going on to beat Zanzibar and Rwanda in the final . The 2006 champions Sudan failed , however , to emerge from the 2005 group stages .
Participants
11 teams competed , four teams from the original tournament competed ( excluding Tanganyika , which changed names and is currently called Tanzania ) .
Group stages
The group stage began on 25 November and ended on 3 December with Group C 's final matches between Rwanda against Sudan , and Uganda against Somalia . Groups A and C contained four teams , but as there were only 11 partaking teams , group B contained only the three teams of Burundi , Zambia , and Zanzibar . At the end of the group stage , the team who finished bottom of their group was eliminated , whereas the teams who finished in positions other than last in the group progressed to the knock-out rounds .
If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches , the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings ( in descending order ) :
Number of points obtained in games between the teams involved ;
Goal difference in games between the teams involved ;
Goals scored in games between the teams involved ;
Away goals scored in games between the teams involved ;
Goal difference in all games ;
Goals scored in all games ;
Drawing of lots .

Quarter-finals
The second quarter-final match , which was held on 6 December between Ethiopia and Zambia , was subject of an emergency meeting between Ugandan chair Dennis Obua , Ethiopian Ashebir W'Giorgis , Sundanian Ahmed Maazal , and the match commissioner who hailed from Zanzibar , Ali Ferej . At the meeting on the same day as the match , it was adjudged that the referee , Rwandan Issa Kagabi , had blown the final whistle to end the game too soon . Zambia stated that they would not partake in any rematch with Ethiopia , and in a similar fashion , the CECAFA secretary general Nicholas Musonye , absent from the meeting , cast aside the idea of a replay and called the makers of the decision `` old farts '' , and delivered the ultimatum that if any replay went ahead , he would cancel the entirety of the tournament . After this , the Ethiopian Football Association did not seek a replay , and left the tournament after their loss .
Semi-finals
Third place play-off
The third place play-off was between Rwanda and Uganda . Rwanda were the 2005 runners-up , and in that tournament beat Uganda in the semi-finals , in 2006 they beat Uganda 4–2 on penalties to clinch third-place in the tournament .
Final
The final between Zambia and Sudan finished 0–0 after extra time , but Zambia won on penalties . Although Zambia won the final , the trophy was awarded to Sudan , who Zambia beat in the final . This was as Zambia were only a guest team , from the COSAFA federation , therefore the trophy was awarded to the highest finishing CECAFA federation team : Sudan .

The Severn-Wye Cable Tunnel , also known as the Severn Cable Tunnel , carries high-voltage ( 400 kV ) electricity transmission lines beneath the estuaries of the River Severn and River Wye between Newhouse ( Mathern ) , Monmouthshire and Aust , South Gloucestershire .
History
To exploit the generating capacity of new power stations being built in the late 1960s at Pembroke ( 2,000 MW ) and Aberthaw ( ' A ' 600 MW , ' B ' 1,400 MW ) , the Central Electricity Generating Board ( CEGB ) planned to construct 400 kV supergrid lines through South Wales and Gloucestershire to National Grid connection points at Gloucester and Melksham , Wiltshire . The CEGB intended the line to Melksham substation to cross the River Severn at Sharpness using overhead cables . A public inquiry was held in 1967 and objections were raised by the Council for the Preservation of Rural England and several District and Parish Councils . The principal objection was to the impact of the power lines on the scenery of the Cotswolds and of the Vale of Berkeley . Following the inquiry the CEGB was directed by the Minister of Power to plan a more southerly route . The amended route across the Severn was 11 miles downstream from Sharpness , and close to the existing overhead crossing at Aust , but using a tunnel instead of overhead lines . The additional cost of tunneling was estimated to be about £4 million .
Specification
The Severn-Wye Cable Tunnel carries two 400 kV electricity circuits on the transmission line between the National Grid 400 kV substations at Whitson and Melksham . Each circuit has a rating of 2,600 MVA . The tunnel is 3.1 m ( 10 ft ) in diameter , is 3.6 km ( 2.25 miles ) long , and has a maximum depth of 48.8 m ( 160 ft ) . The two principal access shafts are on the East bank of the Severn at Aust , South Gloucestershire ( 51.608459°N 2.615454°W ) and on the West bank of the Wye at Newhouse ( Mathern ) , Monmouthshire , ( 51.610878°N 2.669090°W ) where each of the two cable sealing end compounds are located . There is also an intermediate access shaft at Beachley , Gloucestershire ( 51.609761°N 2.652498°W ) .
Construction
The tunnel was engineered by Charles Haswell and Partners and constructed by Charles Brand and Sons Ltd . It was built using three access shafts : at Aust ( at a depth of 47.9 m ) , at Beachley ( 48.5 m deep ) and at Newhouse ( 34.7 m deep ) ; two tunnel boring machines were used . In December 1970 the machines were boring at a rate of 9.1–15.2 m per week but this increased to 46 m per week in 1971 . Difficulties were encountered with the ingress of water from the natural springs in the geology of the area .
The civil engineering work cost about £2 million and the electrical installation an additional £1.5 million ( 1970 prices ) . The cables were manufactured and installed by British Insulated Callender 's Cables Ltd .
In April 1972 a lift at the Aust construction shaft failed and fell 30 m ( 100 ft ) , injuring four men .
Operation
Each of the six cables in the tunnel is installed within a PVC pipe though which cooling water is pumped . The circulating water is cooled in air/water heat exchangers . At full power ( 2,600 MVA for each circuit ) the cable joints are cooled by circulating oil through the hollow conductors . Water ingress into the tunnel is managed by a pumping system . Initially pumping took place at both ends of the tunnel , but in about 2005 this was reduced to pumping at the Aust end only . There are four 18.5 kW rotary lobe pumps manufactured by Börger . Each pump has a capacity of 40 m3 per hour at a discharge head of 70 m. Normally only two pumps are in operation but if the ingress of water increases all four pumps automatically operate .
A powered trolley to move equipment , and in an emergency injured personnel , is provided in the tunnel .

Jenna Lepomäki was an 18-year-old Finnish woman , who was found dead in Fuengirola , Spain , on 6 October 2011 .
Lepomäki was last seen alive in June 2011 . After months of searching , her mummified body was found in the terrain , wrapped in a sleeping bag , in October 2011 . The Finnish Criminal Police investigated the matter in conjunction with the Espoo police and the Spanish police . Three days after the discovery of the body , 19-year-old Joona Mikael Hasselqvist and 20-year-old Joel Aarne Esaias Lilo were arrested , suspected of having killed Lepomäki . They were subsequently charged with murder .
Because Hasselqvist and Lilo were from Tampere , the process started on 5 June 2012 in the Pirkanmaa District Court , where they were charged with murder and illegal possession of drugs . According to the prosecution , Hasselqvist and Lilo had tried to enlist Lepomäki as a drug courier , but after she refused and reported the matter to the Guardia Civil , Hasselqvist and Lilo decided to kill her . On 24 August 2012 , Hasselqvist and Lilo were sentenced to life imprisonment for murder . Hasselqvist was also sentenced for fraud and illegal possession of drugs , and Lilo for fraud , money laundering and illegal possession of drugs . Hasselqvist 's stepfather was also sentenced to two years in prison without parole for illegal possession of drugs . His mother was sentenced to prison with parole .
The sentence was appealed to the Turku Court of Appeal . The court gave its sentence in October 2013 , where it decided that the crime was manslaughter and assisted manslaughter instead of murder . According to the court , the killing had not been pre-meditated . The reasons for this included that the crime had happened in the perpetrator 's apartment , where it had been difficult to remove the traces of the crime . Furthermore , there was no evidence that Lepomäki had been enticed to the apartment in order to kill her . Joona Hasselqvist 's sentence was lowered to 12 years in prison for manslaughter , and Joel Lilo 's sentence was lowered to 6 years in prison for assisted manslaughter . The sentences differed , because the district court judge had sentenced both for murder . After the sentence had been declared , Lilo was released , because Finnish law grants parole for crimes committed under the age of 21 after one third of the sentence has been served .
Lilo 's parole caused disapproval among the public , because after being paroled , he disgraced Lepomäki 's on-line memorial with indecent comments . Lepomäki 's father reported this to the Finnish police , and Lilo was arrested for a few days suspected of dishonouring Lepomäki 's memory . According to Parliament of Finland member Kari Tolvanen , the Finnish criminal law should be changed in regards to first-time offenders , and he left a proposal of the matter . Minister of Interior Päivi Räsänen remarked that according to her , the notion of first-time offenders should be removed entirely in cases of serious crimes . Former Minister of Justice Tuija Brax has a more negative view in regard to altering the law .
The prosecutor and Lepomäki 's family sought permission to appeal the sentence to the Finnish Supreme Court . The court declined permission , so the sentence from the Turku Court of Appeal stayed .

Overspill parking is the parking of vehicles beyond a defined area specifically designed for this purpose . It can occur because provided parking spaces are insufficient for demand or considered unsatisfactory , and may have unintended consequences on its surroundings . Additional official parking may be provided for an event , or at some distance from the intended destination .
Overspill car parking may simply be parking further away from a place than desirable . In some circumstances it may involve parking violations or other unauthorised or anti-social parking such as double-parking , parking on verges or on sidewalks and can on occasions create difficulties for others .
Available parking may be insufficient , unsuitable , expensive or otherwise undesirable . Parking may be limited because the urban form historically made little provision for the parking of private vehicles , or because the transport authority zoning policies consciously limit the provision of parking spaces to discourage car use . Overspill parking is commonplace near shops , schools , hospitals , sports grounds and train/metro stations and at other locations that attract people and vehicles . Commuters prevented from parking for the day close to train stations may resort to parking elsewhere , for example on side streets , verges or other locations .
Overspill parking may conflict with other road users including other motorists , emergency vehicles , cyclists , pedestrians and members of various vulnerable groups including the blind , wheel-chair users and people with small children . Vehicles parked on grass , authorised or not , can turn the area to mud in wet weather and parking on sidewalks can cause damage and additional maintenance/repair costs . Such cases may prompt preventative action .
Reaction
policymakers may choose to accept overspill parking as inevitable , they may choose to provide more parking spaces or may introduce legislative or physical measures to control the places where vehicles can be parked . Design elements may include bollards , high kerbs , railings , benches , raised planters , and other street furniture to prevent parking on footways .
Restrictions can limit parking to particular times of day , for limited periods of time , and may discriminate among users . Examples include residential zoned parking , disabled parking bays , metered bays , and no-parking restrictions .
In a referendum in Amsterdam in 1992 the population voted for reducing the level of parking provision in the city .
More parking spaces
The relevant authority will sometimes attempt to provide additional parking opportunities and direct users to those facilities . Consideration was given to overspill parking when Chelsea Football Club was developing the 'Chelsea Football Club Academy ' on days when the reserve team were expected to play there and the popular seaside town of Southwold creates additional parking during busy summer periods .

Many transport authorities run campaigns to highlight the costs and inconvenience of overspill parking .
Living Streets in the United Kingdom runs a 'Campaign for combat pavement parking ' suggesting various things that people can do to reduce the problem .
Voluntary or compulsory 'Car Exclusion zones ' around schools at school drop-off/collection times are used to create a more attractive environment for pedestrians and discourage parents from using cars to schools where there is insufficient space to accommodate them .
Streetfilms has produced a number of videos highlighting the issues , highlighting the benefits to pedestrians if the issue is addressed and approaches that can be adopted .
Regional issues
United Kingdom
The House of Commons Transport Select Committee published a report on 'Parking Policy and Enforcement ' in June 2006 . The report acknowledged that the problem of parking on pavements and in particular parking outside schools , hospital entrances and on corners , junctions and bus stops was `` a large one and that a major effort would be required to enforce the law '' . It criticised the Department for Transport for what it saw as a 'do-nothing ' attitude to the problem and said that the government `` must grip the problem of pavement parking once and for all and ensure that it is outlawed throughout the country '' .

The main rock formations are the Pottsville Group and the Mauch Chunk Formation . The stream itself is considered to be a high quality coldwater fishery and Class A Wild Trout Waters .
Course
Furnace Run begins on Catawissa Mountain in eastern Catawissa Township . It flows northeast in a valley and enters Main Township after approximately a thousand feet . After continuing northeast for a few tenths of a mile , it turns east-southeast . A short distance downstream , it receives an unnamed tributary and turns east-northeast and crosses a road . More than a mile further downstream , the stream reaches its confluence with Catawissa Creek .
Furnace Run joins Catawissa Creek upstream of its mouth .
Tributaries
Furnace Run has one unnamed tributary . It is known as `` Trib 27545 to Furnace Run '' .
Geography , geology , and hydrology
The elevation near the mouth of Furnace Run is above sea level . The elevation of the stream at its source is between and above sea level .
The main rock formation in the watershed of Furnace Run is the Pocono Formation . However , the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in the watershed 's lower reaches . The main soils in the watershed are the Hazleton soil and the Leck Kill soil .
The total concentration of alkalinity in the watershed of Furnace Run is 2 milligrams per liter .
Watershed
The watershed of Furnace Run has an area of . The upper reaches of the watershed are in the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 . The watershed of the stream is mostly in southwestern Main Township , but a portion of it is in southeastern Catawissa Township .
History
A furnace known as the Catawissa Furnace was constructed on Furnace Run near Mainville in 1815 by John Hauck .
Furnace Run was named in the middle of the 1800s after an iron furnace that was located in its vicinity . A nineteenth-century school district or geographical district known as the Furnace District was located in Cleveland Township . It was named after Furnace Run .

Something Else by the Kinks , often referred to simply as Something Else , is the fifth UK studio album by the Kinks , released in September 1967 . The album continued the Kinks ' trend toward an eccentric baroque pop and music hall-influenced style defined by Ray Davies ' observational and introspective lyrics . It also marks the final involvement of American producer Shel Talmy in the Kinks ' 1960s studio recordings ; henceforth Ray Davies would produce the group 's recordings . Many of the songs feature the keyboard work of Nicky Hopkins and the backing vocals of Davies 's wife , Rasa . The album was preceded by the singles `` Waterloo Sunset '' , one of the group 's most acclaimed songs , and the Dave Davies solo record `` Death of a Clown '' , both of which charted in the UK top 3 .
Though it contained two major European hits and earned positive notices from the music press in both the UK and US , Something Else sold poorly and became the Kinks ' lowest-charting album in both countries at the time . As with the group 's other albums from the period , however , it found retrospective praise and became a cult favourite . The album was ranked No . 288 on Rolling Stone magazine 's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . It was voted number 237 in Colin Larkin 's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition ( 2000 ) .
Recording
Ray Davies assumed control over production after the departure of Shel Talmy ; hence Something Else marked a change in the sound and production style of the Kinks . Davies felt unsure of his skill in mixing and recording the group 's records , and later commented : `` I feel that I should n't have been allowed to produce Something Else . What went into an album required someone whose approach was a little bit more mundane '' .
Apart from `` End of the Season '' ( done in April 1966 ) , the album was recorded between the autumn of 1966 and the summer of 1967 , when the Kinks had cut back on touring and had begun recording and stockpiling songs for Davies 's as-yet poorly defined `` village green '' project . The song `` Village Green '' was recorded in November 1966 during the sessions for the album , but was released on a French EP in 1967 and did not appear on a Kinks LP until the next release , The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society .
Composition
Musically , Something Else features multiple different genres and stylistic influences , from the chamber pop of `` Death of a Clown '' to the bossa nova of `` No Return '' . With the exception of the garage rock-style `` Love Me Till the Sun Shines '' the album was a departure from the hard-edged rock and roll of the group 's earlier material , instead featuring mellower , acoustic baroque pop ballads , English music hall , and `` tempered '' R & B .
Ray Davies 's lyrics on the album deal with English-inspired subject matter , particularly the harpsichord-laden `` Two Sisters '' , the lazy shuffle `` End of the Season '' , and the sardonic `` David Watts '' .
The album includes three songs composed by Dave Davies , including the hit single `` Death of a Clown '' .
Reception
The album sold poorly in the UK , in part because it competed with budget-priced compilation albums of early Kinks hits from 1964 to 1966 ; also , Pye Records had released `` Waterloo Sunset '' , `` Death of a Clown '' and other songs before the album appeared . Something Else also sold poorly in the US upon release there in January 1968 , where the group was still the subject of a US ban on live and television performances .
James Pomeroy , in a March 1968 review in Rolling Stone , felt it was the best album the Kinks had made to that point , praising the `` humor , cynicism , perception and irony '' where he felt the band are at their best . He picked out `` David Watts '' and `` Waterloo Sunset '' as the best tracks , and also praised the three contributions of Dave Davies .
In a retrospective review for AllMusic , Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that the work was characterised by `` nostalgic and sentimental '' songwriting , and that part of `` the album 's power lies in its calm music , since it provides an elegant support for Davies ' character portraits and vignettes '' .
In 2003 , Something Else was ranked No . 288 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time , No . 289 in a 2012 revised list , and later at No . 478 in the 2020 revised list .

Monsieur Samatam Krishnayya ( Samatam Kistaya ) ( Yanam c. 1875 – 13 June 1954 ) was a poet , historian and ayurvedic doctor . He wrote many books in Telugu . He was a loyal pro-French politician .
Life
During 1954 , Monsieur Maddimsetti fled from Yanam to join pro-merger group , which brought anger in its people that led to pillage of his home . Then a 78-year-old , Monsieur Samatam Krouschnaya became the Mayor of Yanam ( interim ) who was the lone pro-French leader to fight against pro-merger leaders .
Death
He died during the Coup d'État de Yanaon on Sunday , 13 June 1954 at the age of 78 years . It was declared that he was killed by Indian Military while seizing Yanam . But it is still a mystery about the actual causes and real persons behind his death .
Major view about his death
On the day of the coup , he fought a lone battle to maintain French sovereignty in Yanam against all the pro-merger groups . When he was trying to jump from a wall ( at Pydikondala house ) and take shelter , he was shot by Maddimchetty Satianandam who had a pistol which had been given to him by one of his close friends . It was known that Maddimchetty thought that because of Monsieur Samatam that only his house had been pillaged . The 78-year-old , Acting Mayor Monsieur Samatam collapsed mortally wounded , but even as he was dying he did not stop shouting Vive la France . It was declared that Monsieur Samatam was killed by shots fired by the Indian Military which brought tears to many people in Yanam . The death of Monsieur Samatam is still considered by the French even now as a political conspiracy perpetrated by the Indian side . For locals of Yanam , it is still a mystery , who was the real murderer of their beloved leader .
A popular view is that it was only personal interests that drove the leaders to help in the merger of Yanam rather than that of the cause of Indian nationalism .
French patriot
The French Government identified him as a patriot of France with Citation à l'Ordre de la Nation on 19 November 1954 .

Speed Demon is a land speed racing car built in 2010 by Ron Main for George Poteet .
In September 2010 , George Poteet made a serious attempt to break the flying mile and flying kilometer record for piston-engined wheel-driven cars . Speed Demon is powered by a aluminum block 'Hellfire ' V8 , built by Kenny Duttweiler . Their effort was thwarted by a number of parts failures . The team stated their intention to return in 2011 to set a record over , and at the 2011 Bonneville Speed Week , Poteet achieved
After making `` the fastest piston engine pass ever '' , turning in a two-way average of . ( Because this was not done within the two-hour limit demanded by FIA , the record is not considered official . )
In 2012 , Speed Demon set an official record at .
Speed Demon was displayed at the 2018 Detroit Autorama .
Poteet intends to attempt the absolute record for wheel-driven cars , currently held by Don Vesco 's Turbinator .

In music , the dynamics of a piece is the variation in loudness between notes or phrases . Dynamics are indicated by specific musical notation , often in some detail . However , dynamics markings still require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context : for instance , the forte marking ( meaning loud ) in one part of a piece might have quite different objective loudness in another piece or even a different section of the same piece . The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in timbre and sometimes tempo rubato .
Purpose and interpretation
Dynamics are one of the expressive elements of music . Used effectively , dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance , and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling .
Dynamic markings are always relative . never indicates a precise level of loudness ; it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than . There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking . For instance , the middle of a musical phrase will normally be played louder than the beginning or end , to ensure the phrase is properly shaped , even where a passage is marked throughout . Similarly , in multi-part music , some voices will naturally be played louder than others , for instance , to emphasize the melody and the bass line , even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level . Some instruments are naturally louder than others – for instance , a tuba playing piano will likely be louder than a guitar playing fortissimo , while a high-pitched instrument like the piccolo playing in its upper register can usually sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments .
Dynamic markings
The two basic dynamic indications in music are :
or piano , meaning `` quiet '' .
or forte , meaning `` loud or strong '' .
More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by :
, standing for mezzo-piano , meaning `` moderately quiet '' .
, standing for mezzo-forte , meaning `` moderately loud '' .
, standing for più piano and meaning `` more quiet '' .
, standing for più forte and meaning `` more loud '' .
Use of up to three consecutive s or s is also common :
, standing for pianissimo and meaning `` very quiet '' .
, standing for fortissimo and meaning `` very loud '' .
( `` triple piano '' ) , standing for pianississimo and meaning `` very very quiet '' .
( `` triple forte '' ) , standing for fortississimo and meaning `` very very loud '' .

Changes
Three Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume :
crescendo ( abbreviated ) translates as `` increasing '' ( literally `` growing '' )
decrescendo ( abbreviated to ) translates as `` decreasing '' .
diminuendo ( abbreviated ) translates as `` diminishing '' .
Signs sometimes referred to as `` hairpins '' are also used to stand for these words ( See image ) . If the angle lines open up ( ) , then the indication is to get louder ; if they close gradually ( ) , the indication is to get softer . The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong , then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter :
Hairpins are usually written below the staff ( or between the two staves in a grand staff ) , but are sometimes found above , especially in music for singers or in music with multiple melody lines being played by a single performer . They tend to be used for dynamic changes over a relatively short space of time ( at most a few bars ) , while , and are generally used for changes over a longer period . Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate over what time the event should occur , which may be as long as multiple pages . The word morendo ( `` dying '' ) is also sometimes used for a gradual reduction in dynamics ( and tempo ) .
For greater changes in dynamics , and are often used , where the molto means `` much '' . Similarly , for more gradual changes and are used , where `` poco '' translates as a little , or alternatively with poco a poco meaning `` little by little '' .
Sudden changes in dynamics may be notated by adding the word subito ( meaning `` suddenly '' ) as a prefix or suffix to the new dynamic notation . Subito piano ( abbreviated or ) ( `` suddenly soft '' ) indicates that the dynamics quickly , almost abruptly , lower the volume to approximately the range . It is often purposefully used to subvert the listener 's expectation and will signify an intimate expression . Although it uses the piano dynamic symbol , the performer has slight freedom in their interpretation , causing it to vary based on the preceding loudness or character of the piece . Likewise , subito can be used to mark suddenly louder changes , like subito forte , or subito fortissimo , however in these cases it 's usually only used to add a particular amount of accent to one note or chord . If subito is used to note a sudden change to an entire louder passage , something like or should be used to leave out any ambiguity .
Accented notes are typically notated with the accent sign > above or below the note , giving it a general emphasis relative to the current dynamics . A harder and shorter emphasis is usually marked with the marcato mark ^ above the note instead . If a very particular emphasis is needed instead , it can be marked with a variation of subito , forzando/forzato or fortepiano .
forzando/forzato indicates a forceful accent and is abbreviated as . To emphasize the effect , it is most often preceded with subito as ( subito forzato/forzando , sforzando/sforzato ) . How these should be interpreted and played in the music is up to the judgement of the performer , but a rule of thumb is that a forzato/forzando can be considered as a variation on marcato while subito forzando/forzato can be considered a variation on marcato with added tenuto .
The fortepiano notation indicates a forte followed immediately by piano . By contrast , is an abbreviation for poco forte , literally `` a little loud '' but ( according to Brahms ) meaning with the character of forte , but the sound of piano , though rarely used because of possible confusion with pianoforte .
Extreme dynamic markings
While the typical range of dynamic markings is from to , some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis . Extreme dynamic markings imply an extreme range of loudness , or , alternatively , imply an extremely subtle distinction between very small differences of loudness within a normal range . This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th century onwards . Generally , these markings are supported by the orchestration of the work , with heavy forte markings brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once .
In Holst 's The Planets , occurs twice in `` Mars '' and once in `` Uranus '' , often punctuated by organ .
Tchaikovsky marks a bassoon solo ( 6 s ) in his Pathétique Symphony and uses in passages of his 1812 Overture and his Fifth Symphony .
The baritone passage `` Era la notte '' from Verdi 's opera Otello uses , though the same spot is marked in the full score .
Igor Stravinsky used at the end of the finale of the 1919 Firebird Suite .
Sergei Rachmaninoff uses in his Prelude in C , Op . 3 No . 2 .
Gustav Mahler , in the third movement of his Seventh Symphony , gives the celli and basses a marking of ( 5 s ) , along with a footnote directing 'pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood ' .
On the other extreme , Carl Nielsen , in the second movement of his Fifth Symphony , marked a passage for woodwinds a diminuendo to ( 5 s ) ,
The original piano version of F. W. Meacham 's American Patrol begins at and ends at .
György Ligeti uses extreme dynamics in his music : the Cello Concerto begins with a passage marked ( 8 s ) , in his Piano Études Étude No . 9 ( Vertige ) ends with a diminuendo to ( 8 s ) , while Étude No . 13 ( L'Escalier du Diable ) contains a passage marked ( 6 s ) that progresses to a ( 8 s ) and his opera Le Grand Macabre has ( 10 s ) with the stroke of a hammer .
History
On Music , one of the Moralia attributed to the philosopher Plutarch in the first century AD , suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does rhythm or harmony .
The Renaissance composer Giovanni Gabrieli was one of the first to indicate dynamics in music notation , but dynamics were used sparingly by composers until the late 18th century . J.S . Bach used some dynamic terms , including forte , piano , più piano , and pianissimo ( although written out as full words ) , and in some cases it may be that was considered to mean pianissimo in this period .
The fact that the harpsichord could play only `` terraced '' dynamics ( either loud or soft , but not in between ) , and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores , has led to the `` somewhat misleading suggestion that baroque dynamics are 'terraced dynamics ' , '' writes Robert Donington . In fact , baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics : in 1752 , Johann Joachim Quantz wrote that `` Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft . '' In addition to this , the harpsichord in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture ( four notes are louder than two ) . This allowed composers like J.S . Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions , without the need for notation .
In the Romantic period , composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores . Where Haydn and Mozart specified six levels ( to ) , Beethoven used also and ( the latter less frequently ) , and Brahms used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted . In the slow movement of Brahms 's trio for violin , horn and piano ( Opus 40 ) , he uses the expressions , molto piano , and quasi niente to express different qualities of quiet . Many Romantic and later composers added and , making for a total of ten levels between and .
An example of how effective contrasting dynamics can be may be found in the overture to Smetana 's opera The Bartered Bride . The fast scurrying quavers played pianissimo by the second violins form a sharply differentiated background to the incisive thematic statement played fortissimo by the firsts .
Interpretation by notation programs
In some music notation programs , there are default MIDI key velocity values associated with these indications , but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed .

( 2021 ) . MIDI specifies the range of key velocities as an integer between 0 and 127 :
The velocity effect on volume depends on the particular instrument . For instance , a grand piano has a much greater volume range than a recorder .
Relation to audio dynamics
The introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music . Dynamic range compression is used to control the dynamic range of a recording , or a single instrument . This can affect loudness variations , both at the micro- and macro scale . In many contexts , the meaning of the term dynamics is therefore not immediately clear . To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics , the term performed dynamics can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer .

Hörgertshausen is a municipality in the district of Freising in Bavaria in Germany .
History
Pre-Christian Celtic graves shows that there has been settlement for a long time . But the first official mention of the village called `` Herigoldshusa '' ( the house of Herigold ) was in a donation of Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia to his vasal Earl Luitbold Cholo in 899 . In 1081 the possessions of Kuno II . of Rott were founded to the Cloister Rott while he fell in military service for Emperor Henry IV . From 1549 until the 19. century it was the so-called Hofmark by the Earls of Seyboltsdorf . In 1550 , they built the Castle Hörgertshausen . In 1661 , half of the village was destroyed by a blaze but also reconstructed in the same year . In 1848 , Hörgertshausen became an autonomous municipality . In 1852 , the Castle was destructed . Since 1978 , Hörgertshausen is part of the association of administrations Mauern , which consists of the municipalities of Hörgertshausen , Mauern , Gammelsdorf and Wang .

`` Yiwenzhi '' ( ) , or the `` Treatise on Literature '' , is the bibliographical section of the Hanshu ( Book of Han ) by the Chinese historian Ban Gu ( 32–92 AD ) , who completed the work begun by his father Ban Biao . The bibliographical catalog is the last of its ten treatises , and scroll 30 of the 100 scrolls comprising the Hanshu .
The basis for the catalog came from Liu Xin 's Qilüe ( 七略 ) , which gives detailed bibliographical information about holdings in the Imperial Library , which itself was an extension on Bielu ( 別錄 ) by Liu Xin 's father Liu Xiang , on which the two had collaborated . The catalog provides important insights into the literature of the various Chinese intellectual currents of the pre-Qin period ( Nine Schools of Thought ) , of which only some 20 % are presently known .
Origin of the bibliography
`` Yiwenzhi '' closely adheres to the bibliographical system devised by Liu Xiang and Liu Xin with minor exceptions . The introductory paragraph of the treatise , most likely taken verbatim from Qilue , is quite informative :
`` Many books were in great disarray in the time of Chengdi , upon which Chen Nong ( 陳農 ) was ordered to collect all the books in the world , and high officials to collate books in the Imperial Library ; Luminous Grand Master , Liu Xiang , was put in charge of works by the Confucians , the philosophers , and the shi and fu poets ; Lieutenant General of the Shanglin Imperial Garden Garrison , Ren Hong ( 任宏 ) , of works by militarists , Grand Astronomer-Historian , Yin Xian ( 尹咸 ) , of works by astrologers and diviners , and Surgeon to the Emperor , Li Zhuguo ( 李柱國 ) , of works by herbalists and alchemists . Liu Xiang wrote an abstract for each completed work , catalogued , and memorialized it to the emperor . Liu Xin expanded the system to cover a great many books , and memorialized the Seven Abstracts , or the Qilue . ''
Liu Xin created a seventh domain Jilue ( 輯略 ) to separate books he himself wrote , but Ban Gu , while using Liu Xin 's Qilue material , reverted to the six-domain system of Liu Xiang , and reclassified Liu Xin 's works into the other six domains . Furthermore , Ban Gu added titles that appeared after Qilue ( before 23 ) and before his time of writing the Hanshu ( before 92 ) , including some of his own .
Material and morphology of books in the `` Yiwenzhi ''
Scrolls in bamboo strips , mostly for text , were referred to as pian ( 篇 ) , while those in woven silk , mostly for large pictorial representations , as juan ( 卷 ) ; both are called scrolls because they were rolled up , bound , and tagged for identification . The practice of using scroll pouches called ji ( 帙 ) to hold five to ten scrolls had been in existence ( Shuowen Jiezi defines the character as `` book clothes '' ) , but paper had not been invented by Cai Lun until 13 years after Ban Gu 's death . The earliest form of back-bone binding of books , the butterfly binding ( 蝴蝶裝 ) , was not invented until around 1000 .
Contents
Research
Commentaries on `` Yiwenzhi '' were done by Yan Shigu ( 581–645 ) and Wang Yinglin ( 王應麟 ; 1223–1296 ) . Modern researchers on the topic include Gu Shi ( 顾实 ) , Chen Guoqing and others .
Comparison to the Pinake of Alexandria
The Hanshu Yiwenzhi catalogued the Former Han Imperial Library holdings under `` 6 domains , 38 classes , 596 families ; 13,269 scrolls in all '' ( 大凡書，六略三十八種，五百九十六家，萬三千二百六十九卷。 ) concludes the treatise . An estimated 20 % of the titles are extant today . This compares favourably with the estimated 10 % survival of the Pinakes titles that consisted of works in Greek , Egyptian , Aramiac , Hebrew , Persian , and other languages , in the Great Library of Alexandria of the 3rd century BCE , which according to one tradition , at one time held some 120,000 parchment scrolls and papyri .

Anopheles claviger is a mosquito species found in Palearctic realm covering Europe , North Africa , northern Arabian Peninsula , and northern Asia . It is responsible for transmitting malaria in some of these regions . The mosquito is made up of a species complex consisting of An . claviger sensu stricto and An . petragnani Del Vecchio . An . petragnani is found only in western Mediterranean region , and is reported to bite only animals , hence , it is not involved in human malaria .
It was on An . claviger that Giovanni Battista Grassi established the fact that only the female mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum in humans .
An . claviger was known for breeding abundantly in Åland . As a result , malaria was endemic in the islands for at least 150 years , with severe malaria outbreaks being recorded in the 17th century , and in 1853 and 1862 .
Scientific name
Anopheles claviger was first described by Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1804 . However due to its close resemblance with other anopheline mosquitoes , the systematics was variously changed . Originally Meigen named it Culex claviger which he changed it to An . bifurcutus in 1818 . This was for a long period the accepted binomial but soon they realised that Carl Linnaeus had already used the name for the males of Culex pipiens . After a decade James Francis Stephens renamed it An . grisescens in 1828 . A number of scientific names was introduced after they were discovered from one region after another . Some recognised synonyms are :
An . amaurus Martini
An . grisescens Stephens
An . habibi Mulligan and Puri
An . missiroli Del Vecchio
An . pollutus Canamares
An . turkestani Shingarev
An . villosus Robineau-Desvoidy
Italian biologists G. Del Vecchio in 1939 and G. Lupascu in 1941 were the first to notice that An . claviger comprised two morphologically distinct species . In 1962 M. Coluzzi revised the taxonomic status by classifying An . claviger as a species complex inclusive of An . petragnani . The species could be identified only on small structural variation in the pupal stages , but is now identified using biochemical and molecular tools .
Distribution
Anopheles claviger is found throughout Palearctic ecozone including Afghanistan , Albania , Armenia , Austria , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Belgium , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bulgaria , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Georgia , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iran , Iraq , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Jordan , Kyrgyzstan , Latvia , Lebanon , Lithuania , Moldova , Netherlands , Norway , Pakistan , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Russia , Slovakia , Slovenia , Spain , Sweden , Syria , Tajikistan , Turkey , Turkmenistan , Ukraine , United Kingdom , Uzbekistan , Serbia and Montenegro , extending to the Middle East , China and Siberia . Member of the species complex An . petragnani is found only in western Mediterranean including France and Spain , up to Turkey , and absent from beyond .
Description
Female An . claviger is distinguished from other related species from its brownish colour and dark palps . It is also generally larger than others . The proboscis is dark-brown while the antennae are brown . The scales on the wings are dark , evenly distributed without any dark spot . The thorax and abdomen are brown with lighter colour at the posterior end . An . petragnani are generally darker than typical An . claviger . Males are basically similar but have complex arrangements of setae with dinstinct gonostyle .
Biology
An . claviger adults are most abundant in May and September during which maximum biting on humans takes place . The larval forms are most abundant during cold season from October to the next April . Larvae are generally found in cool and clean water . In the Mediterranean region they are commonly found in wells and water containers ( very common in cisterns ) . In cold area the larvae hibernate during winter but in warmer climate , they do not hibernate although development is slow . Larvae of An . petragnani are slightly different in that they can tolerate higher water temperature . Therefore they can be found during summer under rockholes , ditches , canals and river banks . Mature larvae develop in the eggs 5 to 7 days after oviposition . Most eggs hatch within the next three days , but some may take up to one month . Females of the second generation ( September ) generally lay fewer eggs than those of the first generation ( May ) . Egg maturation requires blood meal and about six days are required for blood digestion . Females attack human soon after they mate with males . They bite during broad daylight . Females hardly live inside houses so that biting occurs in open places . Unlike other anopheline mosquitoes which deposit their eggs directly on the water surface , female An . claviger lays eggs just above the water level but still in the wet area . They are zoophilic in that they bite mostly of large mammals including humans . There is no report An . petragnani in transmission of human malaria , indicating that they are exclusively zoophilic .
Scientific importance
An . claviger was experimentally used to discover the transmission of human malarial parasite P. falciparum , along with the fact that only female anophelines can transmit malaria . Before 1898 it was not known how malaria was transmitted . The Italian biologist Giovanni Battista Grassi started investigating different mosquito species in the early 1898 on the basis of mosquito-malaria theory . He suspected that only certain species were involved in transmission of malaria . In September Battista reported the presence of malarial parasite in An . claviger indicating it as malaria vector . Battista performed human experimentation on Abele Sola , who had been a patient for six years in the Hospital of the Holy Spirit ( Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia ) in Rome . With mutual consent Sola was bitten by malaria-infected mosquitoes for ten nights , and after few weeks he was down with tertian malaria . Battista and his colleagues Amico Bignami , Giuseppe Bastianelli and Ettore Marchiafava continued to demonstrate the same experiments in other patients and were always successful . In November they found the parasites on the gut wall of the infected mosquitoes . P. falciparum-carrying mosquito was no doubt the causative vector of malaria . They formally announced the discovery at the session of the Accademia dei Lincei on 4 December 1898 . This experiment further established that An . claviger is the sole mosquito species responsible for human malaria in Italy , and other European countries . ( In other parts of the world other species of Anopheles are responsible . ) In addition the discovery laid the foundation for prevention of malaria by vector control of mosquitoes .

The 2020 District of Columbia Democratic presidential primary took place on June 2 , 2020 , as one of the Democratic Party presidential primaries for the 2020 presidential election . The District of Columbia primary was a closed primary , with the district awarding 45 delegates , of whom 20 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary .
Former Vice President Joe Biden won the primary with 76 % of the vote , earning 19 delegates . Senator Elizabeth Warren saw her only second-place finish in the 2020 primaries with 12.9 % and won 1 delegate , while Senator Bernie Sanders came in third with 10 % , although Warren had withdrawn from the race long before following Super Tuesday and in difference to Sanders had not sought to win any more delegates . As almost all news articles only published the preliminary results and did not update on the final certified results ( which were higher for Warren ) , they do not show a delegate for Warren .
Procedure
A law passed in December 2019 had moved the election from June 16 to June 2 . Voting took place across the district from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. local time . In the closed primary , candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 % at municipal districts or the whole federal district in order to be considered viable . The 20 pledged delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results . Of these delegates , 6 and 7 were allocated to the two municipal districts ( each consisting of 4 wards ) and another 2 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials ( PLEO delegates ) , in addition to 5 at-large pledged delegates . Originally planned with 17 delegates , the final number included a 20 % bonus of 3 additional delegates by the Democratic National Committee due to the June date , which belonged to Stage III on the primary timetable .
The pre-primary caucus should have been held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on May 9 , 2020 , in order to designate the different presidential candidates ' municipal district-level delegate slates , who would then be elected to the national convention through the primary . The state party committee would then meet after the primary on June 4 to vote on the 2 PLEO delegates , on June 9 to finally vote on the 13 municipal delegates , and on June 11 to vote on the 5 pledged at-large delegates . The 20 pledged delegates the District of Columbia sent to the national convention were to be joined by 26 unpledged PLEO delegates ( 22 members of the Democratic National Committee ; 3 members of Congress , consisting of the district 's delegation of its nonvoting delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and two shadow Senators ; and the mayor , Muriel Bowser , in place of the place usually allotted to state governors ) . Finally , there was one DNC member less .
Candidates
The following individuals appeared on the ballot in the District of Columbia :
Joe Biden
Tulsi Gabbard ( withdrawn )
Bernie Sanders ( withdrawn )
Elizabeth Warren ( withdrawn )

The Harrison-Gibson House , at 309 11th St. in Columbus , Georgia , was built around 1896 . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 .
It is a two-story Victorian Gothic-style house with hipped and gable roof .
It was deemed significant partly for association with persons who lived there : it `` was the home of Joseph Harrison , a salesman of shoes and boots , from 1896-1900 . Also , this was the home of Carleton B. Gibson , who was superintendent of Columbus ' public schools and who was largely responsible for the founding of Columbus ' Industrial High School ( in 1906 ) — the first of its kind in the United States . The purpose of the Industrial School was to provide the children whose parents worked in nearbv cottonmills with an academic trade school of high school ranking . ''

Rev . Don Speed Smith Goodloe ( June 2 , 1878 – September 2 , 1959 ) , born in the Lowell community , near Paint Lick , Kentucky , was a black teacher who became a pioneer for racial integration in the Unitarian church . He was the first principal of the Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie for the Training of Colored Youth , also known as Maryland State Normal School No . 3—which later became Bowie State University .
Biography
Education
Goodloe first attended the Grammar School and Academy of Berea College , a racially integrated school in Berea , Kentucky , from 1893 to 1898 . He completed his sophomore year in the Academy [ Berea ( KY ) College Archives ] . Berea College was founded in 1855 by Presbyterian abolitionist John G. Fee , who made the school 's motto `` God had made of one blood all peoples of the earth '' , quoting Biblical scripture .
Berea claims to have been the only racially integrated college in the South until 1904 , when Kentucky passed the Day Law , requiring all its schools to be segregated .
From 1898 to 1899 , Goodloe attended a segregated normal school for the training of black teachers–Knoxville College in Knoxville , Tennessee , which was founded by the United Presbyterian Church . Here he met his future wife , Fannie Carey of Knoxville . They were married in Knoxville on June 9 , 1899 , after Fannie graduated from the college . Knoxville College offered classics , science , theology , agriculture , industrial arts , and medicine , as well as industrial training on the model of Hampton Institute , Booker T. Washington 's Tuskegee Institute , and later , Bowie Normal School . Students at Knoxville cut timber , made bricks , and helped construct most buildings on campus .
Early career
Goodloe began his career as principal of a black public school at Newport , Tennessee
fifty miles east of Knoxville . He held the post from 1899 to 1900 . The Goodloes ' first son , Don Burrowes , was born in Newport .
In 1900 , the Goodloes moved to Greenville , Tennessee , near [ Nashville ] , where Goodloe was a teacher and principal at Greenville College , a black normal school . Goodloe served there from 1900 to 1901 . The next year they moved back to Lowell , where Goodloe taught from 1901 to 1903 . Fannie gave birth to a second son , Wallis , in Lowell .
Meadville
The Goodloes moved to Meadville , Pennsylvania in 1904 , so that Goodloe to complete his Bachelor of Arts degree at Allegheny College . He was also attracted to the Unitarian seminary there , Meadville Theological School . In Meadville , with two boys—and Fannie pregnant with their third child , Carey—Goodloe was quick to find work to help support them . He then enrolled at both Allegheny College and Meadville Theological School .
Goodloe was the fifth black to attend Meadville , and the first to graduate from the school . Others followed , and Goodloe can be said to have integrated the school . Although he did not face the angry resistance of George Wallace standing in the schoolhouse doorway , he likely encountered racial prejudice from some students and faculty . Unitarian Universalist minister Reverend Mark Morrison-Reed discussed this period of Goodloe 's life in his book `` Black Pioneers in a White Denomination . ''
In a 1903 letter , Meadville president Franklin Southworth states that Goodloe was a `` residing elder in the Methodist Episcopal Church '' , and that although
Goodloe came to Meadville even though he knew it was unlikely he would be ordained by a Unitarian church , because none would accept a black minister . President Southworth wrote , `` I find this morning in putting the possibilities squarely before him that he has come here with his eyes open , knowing that it is probably not a good way into the orthodox ministry , but ready to take the consequences . ''
Southworth continued , `` What the negroes need in ... [ Goodloe 's ] judgement more than emotionalism in religion and more even than industrialism in education , is moral teaching and preaching . '' Goodloe proposed , said Southworth , `` with the help of his wife , to start a small school composed of carefully selected and choice students , and to run the school along with his Sunday preaching . ''
Danville , KY
After graduating from both Allegheny College and Meadville Theological School in 1906 , Goodloe resumed his career as a teacher at Danville Industrial Normal School and as a businessman in Danville—which was just twenty miles west of his family home in Lowell—from 1906 until 1910 .
In 1910 , the Goodloes left Danville , and Goodloe became vice-principal for a year at the Manassas Industrial School in Manassas , Virginia .
Maryland State Normal School No . 3
Later in 1910 , Goodloe responded to the opportunity to build a new school near Baltimore and Washington , D.C. , the Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie for the Training of Colored Youth , also known as Maryland State Normal School No . 3 .
When the Goodloes arrived at the school , it had a farmhouse , barn , chicken house , and a new brick building , the new building having been constructed by the State of Maryland . The state had just taken over the funding of the Normal School and moved it from Baltimore to Bowie . The Goodloes lived in the brick building with the female students . Male students were housed in the loft of the barn , previously used for horses and cows .
The Maryland Legislature was controlled by farmers in rural counties who were short on labor and feared that education would draw blacks away from the farm . The school 's 1911–1912 catalog emphasized the importance of teaching skills to black students–carpentry , painting , blacksmithing , plastering , papering , and shoemaking for the men , and domestic science , sewing and millinery work for the women . The school also aimed to prepare black teachers . The academic curriculum was equal to the ordinary high school course , with English , arithmetic , algebra , history , geography , music , government , physics , botany , and Latin or German . There were six teachers ; Mrs. Goodloe taught music .
In 1911 , the school enrolled 58 students : 23 preparatory , 22 first-year , 6 second-year , and 7 third-year . Incoming students had to be at least 15 years old and to have completed `` six grades in the best public schools of that state . '' Thus , for most of Goodloe 's tenure , the school was the only place in the state for black students to receive an education past the sixth-grade level . The first black high school in the state was started in Cambridge in 1917 , followed by one in Baltimore , and then Annapolis . During the first year , the black elementary school at the corner of 11th Street and Normal School Road , just east of the old town of Bowie , was placed under the direction of the Normal School , thus giving teachers-in-training a model school for practice with 86 students .
In 1914 , the school 's name was changed to the Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie .
The Goodloes decided to build a house for themselves in 1915 . They hired John A. Moore , a black architect from Washington , D.C. , to design the home , and black workers built the home . Lumber for the framing was cut , and bricks for the veneer were made , on the property . It was completed in 1916 . In 1988 , the Don S. S. Goodloe House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places .
The house , built on the school grounds , is now the Goodloe Alumni House of Bowie State University .
In 1917 , household chemistry , farm physics , and practice school work were introduced at the school . The terms `` household '' and `` farm '' may have been added to satisfy the farmers who controlled politics in Annapolis , while still allowing chemistry and physics to be taught .
In the fall of 1918 , student enrollment declined sharply to 36 students as a result of World War I , the international outbreak of influenza , and the high cost of living . In 1919 , it bounced back up to 69 students , and the faculty was increased from 7 to 10 . Goodloe established the first summer session for the school in 1920 .
In 1920 , the secretary of the Maryland State Colored Teachers ' Association sent Goodloe a letter of commendation `` for the constant and progressive fight he has made toward enriching of the curriculum and the uplifting of the standards of the Bowie State Normal School . ''
During his tenure in Bowie , from 1911 until 1921 , Goodloe established a faculty of ten members , an enrollment of 80 students , completion of the seventh grade as an admission requirement , a model school for student teachers at Horsepen Hill School–the first school for black children in Bowie , a summer session , a new dormitory for women , and renovation of living quarters for men . One additional year was added to the course , which led to a second-grade certificate and the opportunity for students to perform two years of additional work to earn a first-grade certificate . He made many pleas for additional funding before the legislature in Annapolis , which might have brought more rapid development to the school , but the state seemed to favor the white normal schools in Towson and Frostburg in its appropriations .
In 1921 , at the age of 43 , Goodloe resigned his post at Bowie . Goodloe told a friend of his in Washington that he resigned because he was just tired of being principal .
Goodloe 's liberal religion may have been a cause of conflict at the school . His successor as Principal , Dr. Leonidas S. James , according to his daughter , considered it `` very important to be guided by sound philosophy in an environment that was sprinkled with many Christian liberals . '' His daughter may have been referring to Goodloe .
Baltimore
After leaving the school , Goodloe moved to Baltimore , where a directory of black businesses listed him as President of Standard Benefit Society in 1923-24 . Other records show him owning rental housing in Baltimore . Later he moved to Washington , and is said to have owned extensive property in the District . In 1924 , he testified in Congress on behalf of a bill creating an inter-racial commission . Fannie and two of their sons , Wallis and Donald B. , continued to live in the two-story house on Jericho Park Road . Both sons graduated from Howard University , became teachers in Baltimore , and later in Washington . Donald B. Goodloe taught at Dunbar High School .
In 1949 , at the age of 71 , Goodloe divorced Fannie and remarried .
He died in Washington , D.C. in 1959 .
An article in the Danville ( Kentucky ) Advocate-Messenger , Sunday , March 10 , 2013 , page C-7 , profiles his life .
Philosophical views
According to his son Wallis , Goodloe was a persuasive speaker . His writing skills are demonstrated in his school catalogs and reports . The 1911–1912 Maryland State Normal School No . 3 catalog states ,
The 1911/12 school catalog also espouses a philosophy in harmony with that of Booker T. Washington . Goodloe states that `` now and perhaps for many years to come , agricultural and industrial training are plainly indicated for the Negro by the situation itself ... [ It is important to teach ] the negro boy and girl to love and live successfully the agricultural life ... ''
Honors
In 1915 , Goodloe was honored by inclusion in Who 's Who of the Colored Race , which listed essential bibliographical information , including his membership in the Knights of Pythias , a secular fraternal order .
Pythians promoted friendship , universal peace , kindness , and tolerance , and had rituals based on Greek philosophy circa 400 B.C .
In 1916 , Goodloe was included in Who 's Who in America .
In 2005 , the Unitarian Universalist congregation located in Bowie , Maryland changed its name from the Bowie Unitarian Universalist Fellowship to the Goodloe Memorial Unitarian Universalist Congregation , in honor of Goodloe .

The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople ( ; Western , Badriark'ut'iun Hayots ' Gosdantnubolsoy ) is an autonomous See . The seat of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople is the Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church ( Holy Mother of God Patriarchal Church ) in the Kumkapı neighborhood of Istanbul .
Its head is the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople ( also known as Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul ) .
Establishment of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1461
During the Byzantine period , the Armenian Apostolic Church had not been allowed to operate in Constantinople because the two churches ( Armenian Church and Orthodox Church ) mutually regarded each other as heretical . The schism was rooted in the rejection of the Council of Chalcedon by the Oriental Orthodox Churches , of which the Armenian Church is a part , while the Byzantine Church and the rest of Eastern Orthodoxy had accepted .
After conquering Constantinople , the Ottoman Empire allowed the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople to stay in the city . But Sultan Mehmed II asked the Armenians to establish their own church in the new Ottoman capital , as part of the Millet system . From then on the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople acted as a superior religious institution in the Ottoman Empire , even standing over the Armenian Catholicos . For a short period , the Syriac Orthodox Church was also placed under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Patriarchate .
The first Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople was Hovakim I , who was at the time the Metropolitan of Bursa . In 1461 , he was brought to Constantinople by Sultan Mehmed II and established as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople . Hovakim I was recognized as the religious and secular leader of all Armenians in the Ottoman Empire , and carried the title of milletbaşı or ethnarch as well as patriarch .
There have been 84 individual Patriarchs since establishment of the Patriarchate :
75 patriarchs during the Ottoman period ( 1461-1908 )
4 patriarchs in the Young Turks period ( 1908–1922 )
5 patriarchs in the current secular Republic of Turkey ( 1923–present )
Ottoman period , 1461–1908
The Armenian Patriarchate served the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire with a line of Patriarchs in Constantinople .
However like the Greek Patriarchate , the Armenians suffered severely from intervention by the state in their internal affairs .
Although there have been 115 pontificates since 1461 , there have only been 84 individual Patriarchs .
In 1861 , a national constitution ( Sahmanadrootiun in Armenian ) was granted to Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire by Sultan Abdülaziz .
In 1896 Patriarch Madteos III ( Izmirlian ) was deposed and exiled to Jerusalem by Sultan Abdülhamid II for boldly denouncing the 1896 massacre . The constitution governing the Armenians was suspended by the Sultan .
Young Turks period , 1908–1922
The Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople Madteos III ( Izmirlian ) was permitted to return to Istanbul in 1908 when Sultan Abdulhamid II was deposed by the Young Turks .
The new Turkish administration also restored the constitution . In the initial period of the reign of the Young Turks , the Armenians enjoyed a brief period of restoration of civil liberties between 1908 and 1915 .
However , in 1915 the Armenians suffered great hardship under the Young Turk administration owing to the desire of the Turkish government for its peoples to be religiously homogeneous ( i.e. , Muslim ) , motivated perhaps by an imagined threat of Armenians from Russian influences with whom Turkey was at war . The Armenian community of Turkey in 1915 was accordingly decimated by mass deportations and killings . The events surrounding this ethnic cleansing of Armenians from Turkey have become known as the Armenian genocide . The inability of Turkey to acknowledge these events has been a source of significant angst among Armenians worldwide for the past hundred years . Prior to 1915 , almost two million Armenians lived in Turkey ; today ( 2015 ) less than 100,000 reside there .
With this backdrop of turmoil for Armenians , the post of the Patriarch remained vacant from 1915 to 1919 . It was restored for a brief period from 1919 to 1922 with Patriarch Zaven I Der Yeghiayan residing . To alleviate the fate of the survivors of the Armenian genocide the Patriarchate founded a Committee for Orphan Relief , a Central Committee for Deportees and was also involved in the establishment of the National Relief Mission .
Four Armenian Patriarchs served under the rule of the Young Turks .
Republic of Turkey ; secularism , 1923–present
Despite a huge diminution in the number of its faithful during the Armenian genocide , the patriarchate remains the spiritual head of the largest Christian community presently living in Turkey .
Today , the Armenian Patriarchs are recognized as the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Turkey and he is invited to state ceremonies .
Five Armenian Patriarchs have served after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey . The synod of the Patriarchate has designated , with the votes of 25 of its 26 members , Aram Ateşyan as Patrik Genel Vekili ( Turkish for Acting Patriarch ) in 2010 because of the illness of the Patriarch Mesrob II Mutafyan . Some members of the Armenian community of Turkey criticised this move and asked for the election of a new Patriarch by universal suffrage instead . ( It is estimated that some 20 thousand members of the community are eligible to vote in such an election . ) At last , the synod decided to retire the Patriarch Mesrob II Mutafyan on October 26 , 2016 and to organize an election for a new patriarch . Following the death of Patriarch Mesrob II , Abp . Sahak II Mashalian was elected Patriarch of İstanbul in 2019 .
Publications
The Patriarchate publishes an annual review in Armenian called Shoghagat ( Rays from Above ) , containing theological , liturgical , historical and cultural articles .
A small , illustrated bulletin Lraper is published weekly ( monthly in the summer months ) . The bilingual Lraper is in Armenian and Turkish .

Poria Illit ( , lit . `` Upper Poria '' ) is a community settlement in northern Israel . Located near the southwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee , it falls under the jurisdiction of Emek HaYarden Regional Council . In it had a population of .
History
Poria was first settled in 1912 and operated as a farm run by Jewish immigrants from the Second Aliyah . However , the original residents left after the outbreak of World War I , and the land was abandoned until 1940 .
That year a group of settlers ( kvutza ) affiliated with the socialist-Zionist Noar HaOved ( Working Youth ) movement , Alumot , settled in the area . They renovated the original basalt stone houses , naming the village Poria Alumot . In 1947 they were given a permanent site for their kibbutz at Bitania Illit , on a hill opposite Poria . The new kibbutz was named Alumot .
Another kibbutz founded in its place was dissolved in 1949 and most of the residents moved to Alumot . Poria Illit was established in 1955 . In 1991 it was officially recognized as distinct from Poria – Neve Oved .
According to the Company for Location and Restitution of Holocaust Victims ' Assets , there are 65 plots in Poria that were purchased by Jews who were later murdered in the Holocaust .
Health care
Poriya Medical Center was founded in 1955 , replacing Schweitzer Hospital . The center incorporates a maternity hospital owned by the Scottish Church that was previously located in Tiberias . In 2005 , the center was renamed for Prof. Baruch Padeh , former director-general of the Ministry of Health , who headed the hospital in 1974–1976 . Located on Poriya Ridge above Tiberias , it serves the population of Tiberias , Golan Heights , Jordan Valley , Lower Galilee , kibbutzim and moshavim .

Upon publication , TIME said : Because it makes Marxist theory , aims and tactics intelligible to any literate non-Marxist mind , To the Finland Station is an invaluable book . It is an advantage that , like Milton with the character of Satan , Author Wilson is half in love with the human side of the curious specimens he describes .
To the Finland Station was one of the first four books ever published by major Brazilian publisher Companhia das Letras . The book 's translation proved to be a successful seller .
In popular culture
This book is mentioned as the reading matter of a young Bill Clinton in Hillary Clinton 's biography Living History .
A tongue in cheek reference is made in the Pet Shop Boys ' song West End Girls in the lyrics `` from Lake Geneva to the Finland Station '' .
The Harvard Lampoon 's Bored Of The Rings includes a tongue-in-cheek dedication , `` TO The Finland Station '' .

Robert was the Archdeacon of Totnes before 1184 . He was the second son of Gille , or Egidia , of Salisbury and he appeared as Robert fitzGille in at least one document of Bartholomew Iscanus . His second brother was John of Salisbury . Robert and his younger brothers ( John and Richard , who became a canon of Merton Priory ) were close , and Robert even seems at some point to have bailed Richard out of trouble . Despite being a canon of Exeter , and therefore bound by clerical celibacy , Robert was married and had a son . He was also styled 'magister ' and described as a physician : he left all his medical books to Plympton Priory , whither he retired sometime before his death in 1186 .

Malakwal–Khushab branch line ( ) is one of several branch lines in Pakistan , operated and maintained by Pakistan Railways . The line begins from Malakwal Junction station and ends at Khushab Junction station . The total length of this railway line is . There are 14 railway stations from Malakwal Junction to Khushab Junction . At present , rail traffic on this line is suspended .
History
The Malakwal–Khushab branch line was built as part of the Sind–Sagar Railway between 1884 and 1939 . In May 1887 , the Victoria Bridge was completed over the Jhelum river between Malakwal and Chak Nizam and a railway line was constructed from Malakwal to Khushab . The line was conceived to haul freight from the mining rich region and served two important smaller railways : the Gharibwal Cement Works Railway and the Dandot Light Railway ( serving the Khewra Salt Mine ) . In 1939 , the Victoria bridge had to be completely re-girdered on the old piers when the bridge proved to be incapable of taking increased rail traffic .
Dandot Light Railway
The Dandot Light Railway opened in 1905 as a narrow gauge railway from Dandot railway station to Chalisa Junction railway station . It was built to serve the Khewra Salt Mine .
Gharibwal Cement Works Railway
The Gharibwal Cement Works Railway opened in May 1886 as a railway from Haranpur Junction to Gharibwal . It was built to serve the Gharibwal quarry .

Stauroteuthis syrtensis , also known as the glowing sucker octopus or bioluminescent octopus , is a species of small pelagic octopus found at great depths in the north Atlantic Ocean . It is one of a very small number of octopuses to exhibit bioluminescence .
Taxonomy
The cirrate octopuses are deep sea species that have been relatively little studied . Some have been described on the basis of a single , poorly preserved specimen , and this makes deducing their phylogenetic relationships difficult . Some authorities adopt the traditional view that the genus Stauroteuthis is part of the family Stauroteuthidae that is characterized by the presence of a secondary web . The World Register of Marine Species , however , considers that it should be placed in the family Cirroteuthidae , basing this decision on ribosomal DNA and other evidence , and that Stauroteuthidae is a synonym of this family .
Description
The mantle length of Stauroteuthis syrtensis is about and its width about . The fins are some in width . The eight arms are of unequal length , the longest extending to about . These are joined for two-thirds of their length by two webs , a dorsal complete membrane and a ventral partial one , giving the animal an umbrella-like shape . The number of adhesive suckers ranges from 55 to 65 . These suckers vary in size and distance among males and females . However , suckers generally decrease in diameter and distance as they extend down the arm . Female suckers reach a maximum diameter of 6.5 mm at suckers 1 to 3 while male suckers , on the other hand , are relatively larger . Between suckers 8 to 25 there are conspicuous cirri . These are elongate , fleshy tendrils borne on the sides of the oral surface of the arms , the longest being at sucker 20 which can be up to 50 mm in length . The oral cavity and mouth area are pink or purple in color that extends towards the arms and lightens as it reaches the tips . The general texture is gelatinous and the animal is reddish-brown and translucent , with the internal organs being visible through the skin . A vestigial , U-shaped , internal shell supports the fins , the only other hard part of the animal being the two-part beak .
Distribution
Stauroteuthis syrtensis is found in the North Atlantic at an extreme depth range of . It is most frequently found a few hundred metres from the bottom of the ocean at depths between . It seems to be fairly common off the edge of the continental shelf on the eastern coast of the United States , and has also been observed at similar depths off the British Isles .
Bioluminescence
Stauroteuthis is one of only two genera of octopuses to exhibit bioluminescence . S. syrtensis emits a blue-green light from about 40 modified suckers known as photophores situated in a single row between the pairs of cirri on the underside of each arm . The distance between these decreases towards the ends of the arms with the light becoming fainter . The animal does not emit light continuously , but can do so for a period of five minutes after suitable stimulation . Some of the photophores emit a continuous stream of faint light , while others are much brighter and switch on and off in a cyclical pattern , producing a twinkling effect . The function of the bioluminescence is believed to be for defence , being used by the animal to scare off predators , and also as a lure for the planktonic crustaceans that form its main diet . The light may also be used for sexual signaling , but this is considered to be an unlikely function , as the light is deployed by both sexes and by immature , as well as mature , individuals .

The River Brethren are a group of historically related Anabaptist Christian denominations denominations originating in 1770 , during the Radical Pietist movement among German colonists in Pennsylvania . In the 17th century , Mennonite refugees from Switzerland had settled their homes near the Susquehanna River in the northeastern United States .
Their religious guides , Jacob and John Engle , joined with the revival , and their followers were often known by their locality : a group of brethren from north of Marietta , Pennsylvania , on the east side of the Susquehanna River came to be known as the River Brethren .
The initial spiritual leader of the brethren was Martin Boehm , evangelical preacher , who was excluded from the Mennonite Church . He later became bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ .
The River Brethren distanced themselves from Boehm and the United Brethren movement .
Influenced by the Schwarzenau Brethren ( named Dunkers ) , the River Brethren developed a conviction that trine ( triple , in allusion to the Trinity ) immersion , foot washing , adherence to plain dress , the wearing of a headcovering by women and teetotalism was the scriptural form of religion . They oppose war , alcohol , tobacco , and worldly pleasures .
Nevertheless , they maintained their identity and did not join the Dunker movement . Jacob Engle is one of the early leaders who promoted trine immersion . The first confessional statement of this group was formulated around 1780 .
As of 2010 there are four bodies of River Brethren in about 300 congregations :
Brethren in Christ Church
Calvary Holiness Church
Old Order River Brethren ( also called Yorker Brethren )
United Zion Church
Common to the Radical Piestic tradition , the River Brethren hold experience meetings , in which `` members [ are seen ] testifying of God 's work in their lives in bringing them to salvation and daily living . '' When a member has a conversion experience , he or she begins taking part in the experience meeting and then requests baptism . The Old Order River Brethren continue the practice of plain dress .
Several factions of the River Brethren withdrew in the middle of the 19th century , including the Yorker Brethren and the United Zion Church , while the main body took the name Brethren in Christ , by which a group of Mennonites is also known .
There were about 11,000 members in the United States and Canada in 1992 . They carry out missionary work in Asia and Africa .

William Henry Dines BA FRS ( 5 August 1855 – 24 December 1927 ) was an English meteorologist .
Dines was born in London , the son of George Dines , also a meteorologist . He was educated at Woodcote House School , Windlesham , and afterwards entered Corpus Christi College , Cambridge , where he obtained a first-class in the mathematical tripos in 1881 . He afterwards carried out investigations for the Royal Meteorological Society on the subject of wind forces , and in connexion with this work designed the Dines pressure-tube anemometer .
In 1901 he commenced researches into the problems of the upper air , and designed or perfected several instruments for use with kites , as well as a form of the Hargraves box-kite , which proved of great value . In 1905 he was appointed by the Meteorological Office director of experiments in connexion with the investigation of the upper air , and in 1907 designed a meteorograph for use with balloons . He also produced , in conjunction with Dr. Napier Shaw , the microbarograph and a recording mercury barometer , as well as various other instruments .

The COMILOG Cableway was one of the longest cableways in the world , until its closure in 1986 . The ropeway conveyor ran for 76 km from Moanda in the Haut-Ogooué Province of south eastern Gabon to Mbinda in the Republic of Congo .
In 1954 , the Compagnie Minière de l'Ogooué ( COMILOG ) , a French-American company formed the previous year , decided to begin mining manganese in the Gabonese town of Moanda . The town lay deep in the rainforest , and export of the metal was a problem . The nearest reliable transport route was the Congo-Ocean Railway , but this lay more than 250km away , across difficult terrain . George Perrineau was charged with constructing a transport link between the two .
It was decided to construct a cableway from Moanda to Mbinda , and then branch of the Congo-Ocean Railway to Mont Bello , from which the existing railway would link to the port of Pointe-Noire . The conveyor was routed via the small town of Bakoumba , which became the centre for the maintenance of the structure . The mine opened in 1957 , and the Cableway was opened in 1959 , the link finally being completed when the Congo-Ocean Railway branch opened in 1962 .
The Cableway consisted of ten sections , and had 858 supports of between 5 and 74m in height . One tonne cars carried the manganese twenty-four hours a day .
The government of Gabon was keen to ship the valuable manganese ore through its own ports , and routed a new railway , the Transgabonais , from the national capital Libreville to Moanda , and on to Franceville . When this opened , in 1986 , the cableway was closed . While Moanda continued to prosper , Bakoumba and Mbinda suffered from the withdrawal of their main industry . COMILOG funded the creation of the Lékédi Park at Bakoumba to encourage the development of a tourist industry , but some groups in Congo felt that unemployment there was not addressed .

Hardwick House is a Tudor house on the banks of the River Thames on a slight rise at Whitchurch-on-Thames in the English county of Oxfordshire . It is reputed to have been the inspiration for E. H. Shepard 's illustrations of Toad Hall in the book The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame , although this is also claimed by Mapledurham House , Fowey Hall Hotel , Foxwarren Park and Fawley Court .
History
King Charles I of England visited the house while he was a prisoner on escort from Oxford .
Hardwick House was bought by Richard Lybbe in 1526 ; that family ended in an heiress Isabella Lybbe who married Philip Powys in 1730 and their Powys descendants had their home there for a further 130 years . Caroline Powys , wife of Philip Lybbe Powys of Hardwick House maintained a diary from 1756 which recorded the daily social round of her class in gossipy detail . She wrote of visits to neighbouring country houses , the winter balls and assemblies in Henley and the seasons in London and Bath with their plays , concerts and balls . Their great-grandson Philip Lybbe Powys , who later assumed the additional surname of Lybbe , was a rower and MP . He recalled as a child rowing from Hardwick to Mapledurham on Sunday afternoons .
Charles Day Rose purchased Hardwick House shortly before he was created a baronet of `` Hardwick House in the Parish of Whitchurch in the County of Oxford '' on 19 July 1909 . Rose is said to have been one of the models for `` Toad '' of Toad Hall in The Wind in the Willows . Hardwick House and its surrounding estate have been in the ownership of the Baronets Rose of Hardwick for several generations and the current owner is Sir Julian Rose , 4th Baronet , who succeeded his father in 1966 . In 1979 he also succeeded to the Rose Baronetcy of Montreal , and became the 5th Baronet in that line .
Hardwick House is a Grade I listed building , as is the adjacent dower house . The stables , and garden wall and gate pier have their own Grade II listings .
Quotations
To Nature in my earliest youth ,
I vowed my constancy and truth ;
Wherein lie Hardwick 's much loved shade ,
Enamoured of her charms I strayed ,
And as I roved the woods among ,
Her praise in lisping numbers sung .
— Dean Powys
A little above Mapledurham lock you pass Hardwick House , where Charles I played bowls .
— Jerome K. Jerome

Röttenbach is a town in the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt , in Bavaria , Germany .
Geography
Neighboring villages
The neighboring villages surrounding Röttenbach are Adelsdorf , Baiersdorf , Heßdorf , and Hemhofen .
History
Middle Ages
Around the year 1000 , settlers came in search of land in the wooded , rolling hills , which form the foothills of the Steigerwald . They settled near a creek and cleared parts of the forest to create arable land . The name Röttenbach was originally Rodenbach , derived from the German word for stream or creek ( Bach ) and the verb roden ( to clear land ) . Wide marshes , which rested on the impermeable layers of brick clay that lie on the Keupere , were not conducive to productive agriculture . Over the centuries the inhabitants cultivated the marshes creating many of the series of ponds used often for carp farming and other aquaculture that still divide the forests to the north , east and west of Röttenbach .
In the 13th century a descendant from seneschal ( Truchseß ) of Pommersfelden took the area in possession , named themselves the ‘ Truchseß von Röttenbach ' and founded Röttenbach . Deeds show that farms and estates were divided among landlords and changed owners several times . In 1322 an Estate went to the abbot of the monastery Michaelsberg , in 1329 another to the bailiff at Nuremberg Castle . In 1476 the Bamberger cloister founded its Court in Röttenbach .
The main courtyard of the area , from which the manor later emerged , is first mentioned in a deed of gift from Bamberg dated 1433 for the Stewards Peter und Veit . On this farm , now the area around the Brauerei Sauer ( Sauer Brewery ) , stood a castle which was protected by a moat . Nevertheless , insurgent peasants burned down the castle during the Peasants ' War of 1525 . The main residence later was rebuilt and remains to this day , as well as a sandstone coat of arms from 1591 which still exists on the south wall of the brewery . In 1610 , the possession of the residence was promised to the Steward of Pappenheim . In 1710 it fell into the possession of the Bishopric of Bamberg . Part of the goods and the people of the estate then belonged to the Imperial City of Nürnberg and the Baron Winkler von Mohrenfels ( Hemhofen ) . In the 1803 during the Napoleonic era , Röttenbach was awarded to the Prussian crown , but fell in 1810 , as well as the whole of Franconia , to the Kingdom of Bavaria .
Until the mid-20th Century most of the population remained poor and lived mostly as day laborers . A small additional income for many was to gather mushrooms and berries , pinecones , as well as water lilies and sundews ( drosera ) . The majority of these natural products were brought to Erlangen for sale . Others drove through southern Germany , Switzerland , and Austria and sold horseradish , for which the region was famous . The strong sense of salesmanship laid the foundation during the difficult years after the 2nd World War for an unforeseen economic boom in the region . The low-level Franconian timber-framed farmhouses disappeared quickly and were replaced by modern housing . As a result , unfortunately the only remaining historically significant buildings are forester 's house with a half-timbered barn & storage building , and the rectory , both of which were built in the Baroque style .
In 1972 during the regional reform of Upper Franconia , Röttenbach became part of Middle Franconia . In turn , more and more new residents streamed from the metropolitan region of Nuremberg-Erlangen-Fürth to the then quiet village . Röttenbach grew rapidly and took on its present form . In 1980 , the short lived era of municipal association with Hemhofen was dissolved .
Population growth
Röttenbach had less than 1000 inhabitants up into the 1940s . After World War II the population rose sharply . As of December 31 , 2009 , Röttenbach had 4628 inhabitants of which 2,357 were female and 2,271 were male .
Nature
Röttenbach is part of the sand axis of Franconia ( Sandachse Franken ) and has numerous small sections of neglected grassland , sand fields and dry edges of forest that serve many specialized animals as a living environment . A prominent part of the surroundings of Röttenbach are the many chains of ponds .
Economy
Traffic
From Röttenbach , the Autobahn 3 via Dechsendorf , as well as the Autobahn 73 via Baiersdorf can be reached in a few minutes . The Bundesstraße 470 runs to the north . Bus line number 205 of the Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg ( VGN ) stops in Röttenbach on its way between Erlangen and Höchstadt .

It was found in the calcareous meadows of the provinces of Liège and Luxembourg in Belgium , notably around the towns of Rochefort , Beauraing and Comblain-au-Pont , where it was first discovered in 1821 . It was thought to be extinct since the 1930s until preserved seeds were rediscovered in collections of the Belgian National Botanic Garden by English botanist David Aplin and as a result of the publicity , seeds in other locations came to light in 2005 .
In 2009 the National Botanic Garden of Belgium announced that some hundred thousand seeds have been germinated .

Francis Minor ( August 15 , 1820 , Orange County , Virginia – February 19 , 1892 , St. Louis , Missouri ) , husband of suffragist Virginia Minor , was a lawyer and a women 's rights advocate . Turning Point Suffragist Memorial lists Francis along with six others ( including Frederick Douglass ) as `` Suffragist Men '' and `` the Importance of Allies . ''
Early life and education
Minor was born on August 20 , 1820 . He graduated from Princeton University and the University of Virginia before he and his wife ( a distant cousin ) , moved to St. Louis in 1845 from Virginia .
They had only one child , a son named Francis Gilmer Minor , who was born in 1852 and died in 1866 as a result of a `` shooting accident . ''
Women 's suffrage activist
When the Minors arrived in St. Louis , Francis purchased a home valued at $ 6,000 . `` The law said that only the man could be the owner of property , so in the spring of 1846 , Francis put all their property in a trust in his wife 's name , thus circumventing the law and allowing her to legally own the property and thus have the power to buy and sell said property . ''
In 1869 a national woman suffrage convention was held in St. Louis . In preparation , Francis drafted a pamphlet and set of resolutions asserting national women 's suffrage was already legal based on the verbiage of section one of the Fourteenth Amendment which makes no reference to sex or gender , only `` citizens '' and `` persons . ''
A few years later , in 1872 , seeking judicial judgment of Francis 's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment , Virginia went to the Old Courthouse in St. Louis ( the same courthouse where the Dred Scott case was argued in 1846 and 1850 ) to register to vote . When the registrar , Reese Happersett , refused to allow her to do so , Francis filed a lawsuit . `` Since women were not allowed to file suit on their own behalf , Virginia was named as co-plaintiff . The suit demanded that Reese Happersett be ordered to register Virginia Minor to vote and pay damages in the sum of $ 10,000 . ''
After losing in circuit court , Francis appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri , where he had served as a clerk until stepping down on May 1 , 1873 , so as not to give the appearance of a conflict of interest . After also losing there , Francis appealed his wife 's case to the Supreme Court of the United States , argued the case , and lost in a unanimous decision . Minor v. Happersett , 88 U.S. 162 ( 1874 ) .
Death and tributes
When Francis Minor died at age 71 , on February 19 , 1892 ( two years before his wife ) , Susan B. Anthony wrote about him , “ No man has contributed to the woman suffrage movement so much valuable constitutional argument and proof as Mr. Minor . ”
Francis is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery next to his wife and their only child . `` Coincidentally , in a unmarked grave just across the cemetery road , less than two-hundred feet away , sits the grave of [ their ] adversary Reese Happersett . ''

Leonard Arthur Miller Boyd ( 11 November 1923 − 14 February 2008 ) was an English professional footballer who played 333 matches in the Football League in the 1940s and 1950s . After serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War , Boyd signed for Second Division club Plymouth Argyle , where he spent two seasons playing as an inside forward . When he began playing as a wing half , a position to which he was better suited , he attracted attention , and soon secured a transfer to the First Division with Birmingham City for what was for Plymouth a record fee .
Though his club was soon relegated , Boyd established himself in the first team and was appointed captain . He was chosen to represent England at `` B '' international level . An industrious , dynamic player , described by his goalkeeper Gil Merrick as `` a good player and a bloody good captain '' , Boyd led the team to the championship of the Second Division in the 1954–55 season and to the FA Cup Final and sixth place in the league , still , , Birmingham 's record league placing , the following year . He played only once more for Birmingham , forced to retire by the back injury which had disrupted his final season with the club .
Playing career
Early career
Boyd was born in Plaistow , Essex . He played for the West Ham Schools team alongside Ken Green , who was later to be a Birmingham teammate , and as a youth played for Ilford . The outbreak of the Second World War when Boyd was 15 delayed his entry into football as a career . He joined the Royal Navy , and while serving in Malta was spotted playing for a Navy team by a Plymouth Argyle supporter , who recommended him to the club . After a trial , Boyd signed professional forms in December 1945 .
He made his debut on 12 October 1946 , taking over at centre-half from Alf Miller for a Second Division match away at Leicester City which Plymouth lost 4–1 . In his first season , Boyd played 16 league matches , mainly in the inside left position , and scored four of his five Plymouth goals . He played regularly on the right side of the forward line in the following season , but failed to score , and was regarded as `` a promising but not exceptional inside-forward '' . When manager Jack Tresadern switched him to right half for the 1948–49 season , it became clear he was better suited to that position . After three consecutive seasons helping the Devon club avoid relegation from the Second Division , Boyd was sold to First Division club Birmingham City in January 1949 for a fee of £17,500 , the first five-figure fee ever received by Plymouth for a player .
Birmingham City
He went straight into the first team as replacement for Frank Mitchell who had joined Chelsea earlier that month , and made his debut in a goalless draw away at Preston North End . In the 1949–50 season , his first full season with Birmingham , he established himself in the first team but was unable to prevent his new team 's relegation to the Second Division . When Fred Harris retired at the end of that season , manager Bob Brocklebank appointed Boyd as his successor as club captain , a post which he retained for the remainder of his Birmingham career .
Under Boyd 's captaincy Birmingham reached the semifinals of the 1950–51 FA Cup , when they were defeated by the powerful Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen only after a replay . They twice came close to winning promotion , missing out by three points in the 1950–51 season and then on goal average the following year . Boyd 's performances were rewarded with selection for England B against the Netherlands B , a match played in front of a crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam , but this , and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954 , was as close as he came to full international honours .
Manager Brocklebank significantly strengthened Birmingham 's playing staff , but although the club nearly reached another semifinal in the 1952–53 FA Cup , losing in the sixth round to Tottenham Hotspur after two replays , their league results failed to improve . In late 1954 , Arthur Turner was appointed manager , and his ability to instil a positive approach in the players transformed a team stagnating in mid-table into one needing to win the last match of the season , away at Doncaster Rovers , in order to be promoted as champions on goal average . Boyd led the team to a 5–1 win , later recalling :
The same squad of players carried their promotion form into the 1955–56 season in the First Division , achieving the club 's highest league finish of sixth place , and reaching the FA Cup final . They became attractive to the media ; after the FA Cup semifinal victory , Boyd signed an exclusive contract committing himself and his teammates to appearing only on BBC programmes in the weeks leading up to the final .
Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst injured a thigh in the sixth round at Arsenal and played no further part in the season . Boyd himself had for some time been suffering from a debilitating back problem , and relied on injections to keep him playing ; he missed five of the last seven matches of the season , but was passed fit on the Wednesday before the match . In the event , Boyd played , in Warhurst 's position at left-half , and the 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right . With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully match-fit , Birmingham 's strength and balance was disrupted , leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City 's unconventional style of play , known as the `` Revie Plan '' . At half-time , a row erupted between the manager and some of the players , Boyd included , about their fitness ; in the second half , whether due to physical and mental exhaustion or the effects of the row , Birmingham were soundly beaten .
On their return to Birmingham , the team received a civic welcome ; Boyd told the thousands outside the Council House that the team felt they had let the supporters down . Though the crowd roared `` No ! `` , recriminations followed . Speaking fifty years later , goalkeeper Gil Merrick refused to attribute blame for the loss to Boyd 's lack of fitness :
Boyd played only one more match for the club , two weeks after the Cup Final . Not risked in their first match in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup , against Internazionale on a hard pitch in the San Siro , he played in their next , a 1–0 win against a Zagreb Select XI in Yugoslavia . Following a favourable specialist 's report during the close season , Boyd took part in pre-season training , but his back still troubled him . On 17 August 1956 , the day before Birmingham were to open their 1956–57 League campaign , Boyd 's contract with the club was terminated at his own request .
Style of play
Boyd was a tall man with a long stride . He was hard-working , combining industry with composure and skill on the ball . His dynamism was regularly mentioned ; The Times match report of the 1953 FA Cup sixth round replay against Tottenham Hotspur , a 2–2 draw in which Boyd scored the equalising goal and had his name taken , attributed Birmingham 's second-half comeback to their captain 's performance :
Against Arsenal in the 1956 cup run he was `` a champion who covered every inch of Highbury 's mud , a dynamo and a man of steel '' , and , later the same season , The Times correspondent wondered rhetorically `` was there ever such a human dynamo at wing-half ? ''
Birmingham based their success of the 1950s on `` their acutely drilled and disciplined defence – founded upon the authority of their half-backs Boyd , Smith and Warhurst '' , though these three did much more than protect their defenders .
They acquired a fearsome reputation : Boyd himself once played four matches carrying an injury which turned out to be a hairline fracture of his leg . Teammate Alex Govan , preferring to describe Boyd as `` hard , very hard '' rather than a `` dirty player '' , recalled :
Life outside football
Boyd was married to Dolly , and had two children . He enjoyed oil painting as a hobby . According to Govan , `` Len was a typical cockney really . He was hard on the pitch but soft off the field , he would n't do anybody a bad turn . ''
Boyd suffered from a fear of flying , which had on occasion caused difficulties in his football career . Chosen by the Birmingham County Football Association for a representative match in Hamburg in 1953 , the players were already at the airport when he requested to be omitted from the team . While his teammates flew to Birmingham 's Fairs Cup match in Milan , Boyd travelled across the English Channel by boat and then across France and into Italy by train .
When Boyd retired from professional football , the Birmingham City directors `` had stated their readiness to help him in any venture he decided to take up '' . He chose to enter the licensed trade , and kept a public house in Birmingham . Having once said that `` if I ca n't play in first-class football , I do n't want to play any football at all '' , after two-and-a-half years out of the game he changed his mind . In early 1959 he attempted a comeback with Leicestershire club Hinckley Athletic , but found himself unable to play a full match . He remained involved with football for a few more years , acting as coach and scout for Redditch of the West Midlands ( Regional ) League between 1960 and 1965 . Settling in Melton Mowbray , Leicestershire , he went on to become one of the town 's first traffic wardens . In later life he moved into a care home in Melton , where he died in February 2008 at the age of 84 .

Peter Teichner ( born June 30 , 1963 in Bratislava , Czechoslovakia ) is a German mathematician and one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn . His main areas of work are topology and geometry .
Life
In 1988 , Peter Teichner graduated from the University of Mainz with a degree in mathematics . After graduating , he worked for one year in Canada , funded by the `` Government of Canada Award '' , at McMaster University in Hamilton ( Ontario ) . From 1989 to 1990 he was affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics . From 1990 to 1992 he worked at the University of Mainz as a research assistant , and in 1992 he received his doctorate with Matthias Kreck as his advisor . The title of his doctoral thesis was Topological four-manifolds with finite fundamental group .
With a Feodor Lynen Scholarship from the Humboldt Foundation , he went to UC San Diego from 1992 to 1995 and collaborated with Michael Freedman . In 1995 he worked at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in Bures-sur-Yvette , France . From 1995 to 1996 he was again at the University of Mainz . From 1996 to 1997 he was at UC Berkeley as a Miller Research Fellow . From 1996 he was an associate professor at UC San Diego , and in 1999 he was granted tenure . He stayed at UC San Diego until 2004 , since then he has been a full professor at UC Berkeley , where he retired in 2019 . He has been a director at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn since 2008 . He has also been the managing director from 2011 until 2019 .
His students include Arthur Bartels , James Conant , and Christopher Schommer-Pries .
Academic work
Peter Teichner 's work lies in the field of topology , which deals with qualitative properties of geometric objects .
His early achievements were on the classification of 4-manifolds . Together with the Fields medalist Mike Freedman , Peter Teichner made contributions to the classification of 4-manifolds whose fundamental group only grows sub-exponentially .
Later in his career , he moved on to study Euclidean and topological field theories . In particular , in an ongoing project , Peter Teichner and Stephan Stolz try to refine the mathematical term quantum field theory in such a way that deformation classes of quantum field theories can be interpreted as a qualitative property of a manifold . More specifically , these should form a cohomology theory . The emerging language should be flexible enough to formulate new physical theories , but also so precise that predictions can be made about the impossibility of certain combinations of space-time and quantum fields .

St. Mark 's Pro-Cathedral is an Episcopal Church building located in Hastings , Nebraska , United States . It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1987 . In 2020 , it reported 247 members , average attendance of 64 , and $ 120,307 in plate and pledge financial support .
History
When the Rev . John W. Greenwood arrived in Hastings in 1880 to organize the parish , St. Mark 's was an unorganized mission with no property or building , and with very few members . He held the first service on April 25 , 1880 in a public hall ( possibly a pub ) . The parish was organized and given its name on May 3 , 1880 at a meeting in Charles Cameron 's store at the corner of Hastings Avenue and First Street . Bishop Robert Harper Clarkson of the Diocese of Nebraska pledged $ 400 to build a church building . A wooden structure was built at a cost of $ 1,200 . It was dedicated by Bishop Clarkson on January 23 , 1881 .
The Daughters of Saint Mark 's suggested that a new church be built in memory of the rector 's late wife Jessie Hornbrook Young . In 1912 , they raised $ 10,000 after Bishop George Beecher suggested that Hastings be made a see city and the new church become the cathedral . St. Mark 's was designated as a pro-cathedral in 1918 and served as the cathedral for the Missionary District of Western Nebraska until it merged with the Diocese of Nebraska in 1946 . As part of the merger , it was agreed that St. Mark 's would retain its designation as a pro-cathedral as a way of symbolizing the history and missionary tradition of the western part of the diocese .
Noted Boston architect Ralph Adams Cram was chosen to design the new church . The cornerstone was laid by Bishop Beecher on December 5 , 1922 . The crypt and part of the walls were completed and a chapel was made in the crypt when money to complete the structure ran out . The parishioners were reluctant to go into debt for the building project . As additional funds became available , the structure was completed in 1929 , but without its original central tower . The Edward R. Green Company completed the construction ; the total spent to build the church amounted to $ 125,000 . The education wing , which was part of Cram 's plan for the cathedral complex , was completed in 1959 . The square-shaped tower at the crossing was not completed until 2001 .
Architecture
The church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 . In its National Register nomination , the cathedral design is described as typical of the Late Gothic Revival style , which is more subdued than the earlier High Victorian Gothic style . The rock face of the limestone structure contributes to an overall impression of monochromaticity . The plan of the building has characteristics of English Gothic churches , including an emphasis on length , a moderately pitched roof , and a tower at the crossing . Two octagons shaped towers flank the main façade . The main entry projects from the front of the building . Its double doors are flanked by buttresses and topped by a parapet gable . A triple lancet window is above the entrance in the upper section of the building .
In its interior , the cathedral has a rectangular nave with arcades on both sides . The roof structure , described in the National Register nomination as `` an elaborate beam system of king post trusses '' , is exposed in the ceiling . Walls are plastered and stained glass is included in all of the windows . The pulpit , lectern and seating for the choir are located at the crossing . A rood screen and the altar have been placed in the chancel .

Khamerernebty I was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 4th dynasty . She was probably a wife of King Khafre and the mother of King Menkaure and Queen Khamerernebty II . It is possible that she was a daughter of Khufu , based on the fact that inscriptions identify her as a King 's daughter .
Life
Khamerernebty I is identified with the king 's mother whose partial name was found inscribed on a flint knife in the mortuary temple of Menkaure . She is thought to be the mother of Menkaure and was likely married to King Khafre . There are no inscriptions that explicitly mention her as a wife of Khafre however .
The Galarza tomb in Giza was originally probably built for Khamerernebty I , but was finished for her daughter Khamerernebty II . The inscriptions in this tomb are an important source of information about Khamerernebty I . The lintel above the entrance to the chapel included an inscription mentioning both Khamerernebty I and her daughter Khamerernebty II :
Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt , Daughter of [ the King of Upper and Lower Egypt , and Daughter of ] the God , She who sees Horus and Seth , Great one of the hetes-sceptre , One great of praise , Priestess of Djehuty , Priestess of Tjasepef , the Greatly loved Wife of the King , King 's Daughter of his body , revered mistress , honored by the Great God , Khamerernebty ( I ) .
Her eldest daughter , She who sees Horus and Seth , Great one of the hetes-sceptre , One great of praise , Priestess of Djehuty , Priestess of Tjazepef , One who sits with Horus , She who is united with the one beloved of the Two Ladies , Greatly loved Wife of the King , King 's Daughter of his body , revered mistress , honored by her father , Khamerernebty ( II ) . ( Callender and Jánosi )
A priest named Nimaetre is mentioned in the Galarza tomb , and his tomb nearby refers to the queen-mother .
Baud suggests that an anonymous rock-cut tomb discovered by Selim Hassan south of the tomb of Rawer may have belonged to Queen Khamerernebty I. Callender and Janosi argue against this identification for a variety of reasons .
Titles
Khamerernebty I 's titles were : great of praises ( wrt-hzwt ) , great one of the hetes-sceptre ( wrt-hetes ) , she who sees Horus and Seth ( m33t-hrw-stsh ) , mother of the dual king ( mwt-niswt-biti ) , god 's daughter ( s3t-ntr ) , priestess of Thoth ( hmt-ntr-dhwty ) , priestess of Tjazepef ( hmt-ntr-t3-zp.f ) , and king 's wife , his beloved ( hmt-nisw meryt.f ) .

Rudolph `` Rudy '' Fratto ( born December 12 , 1943 ) has been identified by federal authorities and several Chicago newspapers as a high-ranking member of the Chicago Outfit crime organization .
Chicago Outfit career
In 2002 , the Chicago Sun-Times called Fratto a `` reputed Elmwood Park street lieutenant . '' His name had come up during a sentencing hearing for a former Chicago police Chief of Detectives , in which Fratto was shown on FBI surveillance tapes to have held meetings with the former Chief of Detectives .
In 2005 , Fratto was identified in the Chicago Sun-Times as having met with Michael `` Mickey '' Marcello , the half-brother of reputed mob boss James Marcello , to approve efforts by the Marcellos to take over the video poker in several Chicago suburbs , including Cicero and Berwyn . Later that year , Fratto was reported to have been one of five mob bosses who invited Chicago Outfit Consigliere Marco D'Amico and son-in-law Jacques Darrow Carr to a meeting at an Elmwood Park , Illinois restaurant with the mayor of Rosemont , Illinois because they were clients of Carr 's legal document assistance firm J.D.C . Legal Document Assistants at Law . Carr is a Los Angeles legal profession LDA and protege of now deceased mob attorney Sidney Korshak . At that meeting they discussed how the Chicago Outfit would control contracts at a casino in Rosemont , according to testimony by FBI agent John Mallul . The other bosses at the meeting were Joseph Lombardo , Joseph Andriacchi , John DiFronzo and Peter DiFronzo .
Recent indictments and convictions
In September 2009 , Fratto was indicted on tax evasion charges for allegedly not having reported nearly $ 200,000 in income in 2005 . Also in 2009 , Fratto and John DiFronzo were alleged in a civil lawsuit by Joseph Fosco , the son of late Teamsters treasurer Armando Fosco , to have tried to extort $ 400,000 from Fosco .
Fratto subsequently was convicted for evading federal income tax payments for seven years . On January 27 , 2010 , he was sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $ 141,000 . He was released in July 2011 . It was reported in May 2017 that Fratto had stopped paying the restitution since at least early 2016 .
On October 27 , 2011 , Fratto pleaded guilty in a separate bid-rigging scheme involving forklift contracts for two trade exhibitions at a large exposition center in Chicago . On September 26 , 2012 , Judge Harry Daniel Leinenweber sentenced Fratto to about 1 year in federal prison , which was significantly less than the up to 2 years in prison that federal sentencing guidelines had called for .
Personal
Fratto is the nephew of Louis Fratto , an associate of Al Capone and reputed Des Moines , Iowa mob boss from 1930 until 1967 . Fratto was reportedly made in 1988 . Possibly in the same ceremony as Salvatore `` Solly D '' DeLaurentis and John `` Pudgy '' Matassa .

The following is a list of characters from Class of 3000 , an American animated television series on Cartoon Network created and produced by André 3000 of the hip hop group OutKast . He also starred as superstar and music teacher Sunny Bridges . The show was set in Atlanta 's fictitious middle school called Westley School of Performing Arts .
Main
Sunny Bridges
The hometown hero of Lil ' D , Sunny is a musical genius who left Georgia to become a recording artist . Over the years in the employment of his money-grabbing manager , however , he lost his passion for music and returned to his old neighborhood . He intended to go into permanent retirement ; instead , Lil ' D convinces him to become the new music teacher at the Westley School of Performing Arts . Sunny is devoted to his students , but he is forced to keep a low profile in order to avoid media attention . Sunny is known to have a crush on Leela Lopez . While he can play many instruments , his favorite is the saxophone . He has mentioned that he owns over 65,000 shirts . His shoe closet was also mentioned to be able to be seen from space . Sunny 's character is strongly based on the show 's creator and
actor .
Lil ' D
Lil ' Dwight `` D Evil '' the Devil proclaims himself as the unofficial/bumbling leader of the Westley School 's music class , whether they like it or not . He is bright , talented , confident to a fault , and is incredibly tenacious when it comes to music . Through sheer determination ( as well as breaking and entering ) , he manages to recruit Sunny Bridges as the class 's new music teacher . Although Li ' l D considers himself remarkably streetwise , his overconfidence often leads him into trouble . He is considered the shortest member of the class ( despite being taller than Kim and Eddie if not for his hair ) , standing about 4 ' 6 '' .
Lil ' D has never met his father , although he does n't seem bothered by it . He likes to say , `` Then it 's settled . '' after he thinks that a plan was agreed upon ( whether or not it actually was ) which usually results in something horrible happening , and on occasion he will say `` Let 's crank this thang up ! '' His instrument is the drums . In some songs , he plays a different instrument like in `` The Hunt for Red Blobtober '' . Although he has never revealed his actual name , no one seems to notice . He is 12 years old . He is voiced by Sylvia `` Small Fire '' Holloway .
Madison Spaghettini Papadopoulos
She wears a colorful dress , pink bracelet , necklace and white headband . She is an extremely optimistic child with a semi-Southern accent and a hippie-child appearance . She is perpetually happy , no matter true circumstance , though she is occasionally shown to reach a breaking point and cry as shown in the episode `` Am I Blue ? '' . She enjoys the company of animals and baby creatures . She has a secret crush on Lil D. Her parents are never shown like all the other children . She constantly displays a bubbly personality . She claims her hair has the special ability of getting frizzy whenever love is in the air . In the pilot episode , she mentions that she has a grandmother who is of Colombian descent . However , her last name suggests she is of Greek descent . Her instrument is the high-pitched violin , but in the game Funk Box , she also plays a cello . She is 12 years old . The character is voiced by Jennifer Hale .
Tamika Jones
Aloof Tamika makes it her business to keep the other students in line , giving her the title of `` Toughest Girl in School '' . She is also extremely stubborn ; the slightest misstep is grounds for a threatening fist . `` Prove it or move it '' is her trademark phrase , but she is not sure what to do if someone chooses `` prove it . '' Despite her sharp tongue and cold disposition , Tamika shares a close bond with her classmates and will protect them as often as she teases them . Eddie is in love with her . Her instrument is the harp . In the song `` Throwdown '' , she also says she plays the guitar . But in the episode `` Tamika and the Beast '' she shows a soft and sensitive side . She is usually disgusted by Eddie 's attempts for her affection , although she showed feelings to him in the show 's Christmas special after he paid Santa Claus to visit her . She is 12 years old . She is voiced by Crystal Scales .
Edward `` Eddie '' Phillip James Lawrence III
The richest kid in the school , being the heir to the Lawrence fortune ( according to the first episode , his father is the head of the Earth division of Cola Cola ) . A cultured aristocrat , he has something of a high-and-mighty attitude concerning the other students , naively believing that all problems can be solved with money ; he uses his wealth to help his friends . He is not completely spoiled , either . When Philly Phil 's machine tells him he should never have a job because his dad is rich , Eddie says , `` But I want to get a job ! '' He is the only character to have ten fingers at any time ( he will usually have eight , but for at least one scene he has had 10 . Eddie 's explanation for his 10 fingers is that it is due to his wealth ) . He is in love with Tamika , as suggested in Home and Westley Side Story and confirmed by Tamika in Love is in the Hair ... Net . Eddie has spoken of having Swiss ancestry . His instrument is the clarinet , but in the game funkbox he also plays a trumpet . He also plays many horns and woodwinds such as the trombone seen in The Devil and Lil 'D . He is 12 years old . He speaks in a Cajun accent . Once he said that his dad owns all of the stations on TV . He is voiced by Tom Kenny .
Phillip `` Philly '' P. Phil
Brilliant and imaginative , tends to stand out for his unusual fashion sense . Philly Phil can invent useful devices on the spot , although they often end in malfunction . Though Li ' l D and the other students do not fully understand Philly Phil 's many eccentricities , they are willing to accept him as one of their own . He also might have a crush on Kim as shown in Nothin To it But to Do it . Philly Phil has an appetite for any type of food , particularly sweets such as chocolate . His height did n't seem to be consistent from episode to episode ( He was about as tall as Principal Luna in The Hunt for Red Blobtober and only a few inches taller than Madison in Funky Monkey ) . In Eddie 's Money , he is shown to have a decent singing voice . His instrument is the double bass , also with the bass guitar . In Free Philly , it is revealed that he is very weak and needs the help of technology ( Although he does save all of his classmates and Sunny at the end of the episode without any help ) , though in Big Robot on Campus it shows that he is fairly strong and can use his own physical strength . He is 13-years-old . He is voiced by Phil LaMarr .
Kim Chin
She is Kam 's twin sister and his polar opposite down to even their instruments . She and Kam are the youngest of the Westley Side School First Years and she is the shortest , despite Li ' l D 's reputation as the `` shortest member of the class '' . Kim sometimes feels that fashion is more of a concern than music and loves to follow fashion trends . She is very energetic , free-spirited , sometimes to the point of mischief , sleeps with a stuffed rabbit due to her fear of the dark , and loves to torment her more old-fashioned sibling . Kim and Kam 's parents are never shown . She was born in Columbus , Ohio and is of Cantonese-Chinese descent . Her instrument is the xylophone , also with other percussion instruments . She is presumably 12 years old . Voiced by Janice Kawaye .
Kam Chin
He is Kim 's twin brother and her polar opposite , born in Columbus , Ohio and is of Chinese descent . He and his sister are the youngest of the Westley Side School First Years and he is considered to be the smartest in school . He generally projects an air of refinement and class . Unlike the other kids , Kam has common sense and maturity and is the voice of reason , besides Sunny ( but he was oblivious to Santa in the Christmas episode ) . However , the kids do n't listen to him and do what they want instead . Kam tends to be interested in many dull things such as high-grade bread . He is very eager about learning to the point that if Sunny is late to class , his brain is hurting from not learning . Kam has an irrational fear of hang gliding into a flock of angry mallards . Kam appears to have comically terrible things happen to him at the time where he resents these things . He does not have any sweat glands ( and does n't take showers because of this , yet he always appears clean ) and he goes insane whenever he is too hot , as shown in Study Buddies . His instrument is the keyboard or the piano . In `` Love Is in the Hair ... Net '' , he plays the accordion . He is presumably 12 years old . Voiced by Janice Kawaye .
Principal Luna
He is the principal at Westley School of Performing Arts . He is of Hispanic descent . He has a tendency to over-use the word `` fantastic '' and is always trying to make money for the school . He has a crush on the substitute lunch lady , Ms. Petunia Squatenchowder . He owns 36 out of the only known 37 of a rare type of spatula . Luna is Sunny 's rival for coolness . He is voiced by Jeff Bennett .

Also known as Charles , he is one of Sunny 's friends . He specialises in selling cheeses , fixing helicopters , doing teeth , and being a Con Artist . He 's something of a shady character and is often seen selling contraband goods and services out of his car , like `` Mr. Bristle '' action figures that are really used toothbrushes , and bootleg movies which he shoots and in which he plays every part . He is known to be part of Sunny 's old band , the `` Sunny Bridges ' Funkaneers , '' He has also been the kids ' manager in `` Am I Blue ? '' . He is voiced by Phil LaMarr .
Leela Lopez

Jannet `` Jan '' Rongetes
Jan is a Swedish janitor at Westley . He is a former member of Sunny Funkaneers . He has a secret chocolate treasure . He likes to play Swedish air guitar in his free time .

Zealand Notch ( el . 2457 ft./749 m. ) is a mountain pass in the White Mountains of New Hampshire , United States . It is located in the towns of Bethlehem and Lincoln , near the northeastern corner of the Pemigewasset Wilderness . The center of the notch is traversed by hiking trails and is approximately from the nearest road . Zealand Pond , Zealand Falls , and the Zealand Falls hut are located near the height of land .
Similarly to Crawford Notch to the east , the main body of Zealand Notch comprises a steep-walled , U-shaped valley running southwards from the height of land . Whitewall Brook flows through the bottom of the notch , reaching the North Fork of the Pemigewasset River at the south end of the notch . Water from Whitewall Brook flows via branches and the main stem of the Pemigewasset to the Merrimack River and ultimately the Gulf of Maine . North of the notch 's height of land , the Zealand River flows north to the Ammonoosuc River near the village of Twin Mountain , with the streamflow eventually reaching the Connecticut River and turning south again to ultimately reach Long Island Sound .
The notch lies between Whitewall Mountain ( 3,405 ft./1,038 m. ) to the east and Zeacliff ( approx . 3,600 ft./1,097 m. ) , an eastern arm of Zealand Mountain , to the west . The Appalachian Trail traverses Zealand Notch . From the west , the trail ( paired with the Twinway trail ) descends from Zeacliff past Zealand Falls ( a long series of smooth granite ledges ending in a drop over vertical granite ) and Zealand Falls Hut to the center of the notch . Here the Twinway ends , and the Appalachian Trail turns south and follows the Ethan Pond Trail along an old railroad grade through the notch , along the side of Whitewall Mountain , exiting the south end of the notch and continuing east towards Crawford Notch . Other trails in Zealand Notch include the Zealand Trail approaching along the Zealand River from the north , the Lend-a-Hand Trail which reaches Zealand Falls Hut from Mount Hale to the northwest , and the Zeacliff Trail , which descends from the top of Zeacliff straight down the notch wall to Whitewall Brook and the Ethan Pond Trail . The–Z Trail leaves the Zealand Trail just north of the height of land of the notch and leads east to Crawford Notch at its height of land .

Palmietfontein Airport was an airport situated to the south of Johannesburg ( Katlehong ) , South Africa , from 1945 to 1952 .
Latitude : -26° 20 ' 7.20 '' S
Longitude : 28° 08 ' 28.80 '' E
History
Palmietfontein Airport was a wartime air force base which was converted to a temporary airport to serve Johannesburg whilst the new airport , Jan Smuts Airport ( now O. R. Tambo International Airport ) , was being built . The airport serving Johannesburg at the time , Rand Airport , was unable to accommodate the size of aircraft to be operated on a new service to Great Britain . In 1948 , South African Airways moved its terminal to Palmietfontein Airport .
Several historical flights terminated at Palmietfontein Airport . A Qantas Airways Avro Lancastrian completed an unprecedented flight from Sydney 's Kingsford Smith Airport in Australia to Palmietfontein , landing on 20 November 1948 at 15h15 , and having been in the air a total of 41 hours and 52 minutes at an average speed of . En-route stops were made at Perth , Cocos Islands and Mauritius . The objective , to establish viable air links between South Africa and Australia , had been accomplished .
The world 's first passenger jet service took place on 3 May 1952 when a BOAC de Havilland Comet 1 landed at Palmietfontein on a flight from the UK .
Airport layout
There were three runways , the relative positions of which formed a triangle . Runway 17/35 was the longest , being and . Runway 04/22 was and runway 13/31 was . Both 17/35 and 04/22 were tarred ; 13/31 was grass . The apron and control tower were situated to the west of runway 04/22 . The airport elevation was given as . The information is derived from an old map and airport layout diagram courtesy of E. Du Plessis .

Accidents and Incidents
Accidents at the airport
On 5 January 1948 , a Lockheed 18-08-01 Lodestar , ZS-ASW , was damaged beyond repair when it struck a water drain after running off the runway during the landing rollout .
Aircraft bound to or from Palmietfontein
On 15 May 1948 , a Douglas C-49K ( DC-3 ) ZS-BWY , was en route to Palmietfontein from Stamford Hill Airport , Durban , when it crashed into a hill in bad weather with the loss of all 13 on board .
On 15 September 1952 , a South African Airways Douglas C-47A-30-DL ( DC-3 ) ZS-AVI with 19 occupants was written off when they landed at Carolina after becoming lost on a flight from Livingstone , Zambia to Palmietfontein . The landing occurred at night and the strip was unlighted . There were no fatalities .
Palmietfontein today
Palmietfontein was transformed into a motor racing circuit for the 1956 Rand Grand Prix , which was won by Peter Whitehead . The township of Katlehong was eventually established on the site , although parts of the original runway are still visible on Google Maps to this day .

Octiabr ' V. Emelianenko ( 7 November 1926 , Leningrad - 27 May 2012 , Saint Petersburg ) was a Soviet physicist , Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematical Sciences . He did fundamental work in physics of III-V compound semiconductors , and made significant contributions to pave the way for the creation of the first semiconductor laser , optoelectronics , LEDs , solar cells , infrared detectors and other semiconductor devices .
Biography
In 1945 he was called up for military service at the age of seventeen . Location Service - Eastern Front . After the Second World War was to re-enlist . While serving in the army in absentia received secondary and higher education . He graduated from the Physics Faculty of Saint Petersburg State University , enrolled in graduate school . From 1955 to 1989 he worked in the Laboratory of Semiconductor Nasledov D. ( Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences )
Scientific work
Studies of III–V compounds in the Soviet Union were started in the early 1950s at the Physical-Technical Institute , USSR Academy of Sciences . In 1950 , N. Goryunovа and A. Regel opened their semiconducting properties of III-V compounds on the example of indium antimonide
In the 1950s only the laboratory of Professor Heinrich Welker in Germany , and laboratory Dmitriy N. Nasledov in the Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute , USSR Academy of Sciences were engaged in studies of III–V compounds . All scientists in the field of semiconductors concentrated almost exclusively on germanium and silicon . It seemed that these elemental semiconductors , which brought electronics to a new level , could not be surpassed by any compound semiconductor .
The first significant report on studies of III–V semi-conductors ( InSb , InAs ) at the Physical-Technical Institute was made by Nasledov at the First All-Union Conference on Semiconductors ( Leningrad , 1956 ) . He mentioned ( among other phenomena ) that neither electrical conductivity nor the Hall effect depend on temperature in new III–V compounds . Many scientists considered this observation strange and even accidental . However , it was found shortly afterwards that the above temperature independence is the consequence of profound degeneracy in the electron gas , which is typical of heavily doped ( then , simply “ impure ” ) III–V crystals . Fundamentally new phenomena in these crystals gave rise to a new field in the physics of semiconductors , specifically , the physics of heavily doped semiconductors . These researches were conducted group headed by O. Emelianenko in the laboratory D. Nasledov
A team led by O. Emelianenko continued fundamental research of phenomena transport in a wide class of III-V compounds ( solid solutions and structures ) . The most interesting were : the study of the impurity band ; Later , discovery of giant magnetoresistance when driving vehicles on impurities ; the investigation of the metal–semiconductor transition in various materials compounds III–V , as well as the determination of the origin of negative ( quantum ) magnetoresistance ( discovered by a team Emelianenko even earlier , in 1958 ) .
The results obtained by O. Emelianenko and his team are included in the modern understanding of semiconducting properties of compounds III-V .

Be Yourself Tonight is the fourth album by British pop duo Eurythmics , released on 29 April 1985 by RCA Records .
Background
Largely recorded in Paris , with additional recording in Detroit and Los Angeles , this album saw Eurythmics move away from their previous more experimental , synthesizer-based songs , to a more commercial pop/rock sound . Combining elements of Motown and rock music , the album incorporates a more traditional band line-up/instrumentation . Nonetheless , the recordings still possessed an atmospheric and cutting edge sound , winning David A. Stewart awards for his production work on the album . The release of the album coincided with a new look for singer Annie Lennox , who ditched the androgynous look of the previous albums and became , in biographer Lucy O'Brien 's words , `` a bleach-blonde rock 'n ' roller '' . Be Yourself Tonight includes guest appearances by notable artists such as Aretha Franklin , Stevie Wonder , and Elvis Costello .
Chart performance
Be Yourself Tonight reached the top 3 in the UK and top 10 in the US , as well as spawning several hit singles . The album includes the duo 's first ( and only ) UK number-one `` There Must Be an Angel ( Playing with My Heart ) '' . The first single released was `` Would I Lie to You ? '' . It would hit # 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 , # 6 on the Cash Box Top 100 and also hit # 1 in Australia .
No tour followed the album 's release , due to Lennox 's recuperation from vocal fold nodules ( which also caused her to miss 1985 's Live Aid concert ) .
On 14 November 2005 , Sony BMG repackaged and released Eurythmics ' back catalogue as `` 2005 Deluxe Edition Reissues '' . Each of their eight studio albums ' original track listings were supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes .
Track listing
Notes
Track 9 is incorrectly labelled `` Better to Have Lost in Love ( Then Never to Have Loved at All ) '' on the 2005 remastered reissue .
Track 13 of the 2005 remastered reissue is listed as the `` ET Mix '' , but it is actually the `` Extended Mix '' from the `` Would I Lie to You ? '' 12-inch single .

Taghazout ( Berber : ⵜⴰⵖⴰⵣⵓⵜ , Taɣazut ; Arabic : تاغازوت ) is a small fishing village north of the city of Agadir in southwestern Morocco . The inhabitants are mostly of Berber origin . Fishing , tourism , and the production of Argan oil being the main source of income . In recent years , tourism has been increasing in importance to the local economy .
Geography
Taghazout is located on Morocco 's Atlantic Ocean coastline , 19 km north of Agadir and 152 km south of Essaouira . Inland it is surrounded by the western foothills of the High Atlas .
Demography
The inhabitants of earlier times were exclusively Berbers from the Ida Oufella tribe , but due to the increasing modernization ( connection to the electricity , water and telephone network ) and the associated construction boom in the surroundings of Agadir , many newcomers from other regions of Morocco have joined . Moroccan Arabic is the main language , but French and English are also spoken . The regional Berber dialect is still being used in the hinterland .
History
Like almost all Berber villages in southern Morocco , virtually nothing is known about the earlier history of Taghazout ; oral traditions only report of clashes of the united Berber tribes with the Portuguese in the 16th century . The Berber inhabitants originally resided in the foothills of the surrounding mountains and used the village purely as a place to store their fishing equipment .
As the Spanish increased their hold on the area in the 19th Century , factories and Mosques were built in order to house the Berber people and the village grew into a larger community .
In a similar fashion to Calangute beach in Goa India and Kuta on the island of Bali Indonesia , a beach just south of the village became famous in the late 1960s as a destination for young people to base themselves while exploring southern Morocco . On occasion , several hundred would reside in tents , makeshift buildings , and camper vans . However , the camp has been banned and instead replaced with fully equipped hotels and resorts for tourists .
Since 1992 Taghazout is the center of an independent municipality , which also includes several villages in the hinterland .
Tourism
Tourism is an important source of income of locals . Though , they are worrying about the urbanization projects in process ( Taghazout Bay ) . The Moroccan Minister of Tourism underlined the importance of the ecological and sustainable component adopted as part of the project , for the benefit of the local populations of Taghazout and Tamraght , through the construction of public facilities and of income generating activities and jobs .
The project is supposed to attract 300,000 more tourists in the current period ( from 2015 to 2020 ) .
In addition to its beaches and points that have quality surf for beginner , intermediate and expert surfers , Taghazout also attracts visitors looking for calm and tranquility away from more visited destinations such as Marrakech and Agadir . Taghazout also serves as a convenient base to do other activities such as day trips to Paradise Valley trip , visiting Argan oil factories , camel riding on the beach , yoga retreats , paddle boarding and kayaking .
Beaches
There are several beaches north of Agadir , which all offer a good alternative to the local beach in town . The setting of these beaches can be most attractive , with mountains on all sides , yet with a wide and clean beach with all necessary amenities . The largest and popular are : Tamawanza ( 12 km ) , Aitswal Beach , Imouran ( 17 km ) , Taghazout beach ( 19 km ) , Du lkhmiss 20 , Bouyirdn ( 21 km ) , Timzguida allal ( 22 km ) , Imiouadar ( 27 km ) , Aghroud ( 30 km ) .
Surfing is now a common activity for visitors . Morocco is known for its long right-hand point breaks which are consistent and relatively uncrowded . The most famous of which , Anchor Point , is located 3km to the north of the village . In the right conditions this point can take you on a 2 km ride , starting at Anchor Point , joining up with Hash Point and ending on the beach break at Panorama 's . There are several other beaches in and around the area making it an ideal destination for all levels of surfing skill . The waves work best between September to April especially for advanced surfers , receiving similar conditions to that of mainland Europe , but with the warm waters of the Moroccan Atlantic up to 21 degrees .
Taghazout Bay
The site Taghazout-Argana Bay is 15 kilometres north of Agadir . It is intended to become the first seaside resort in Morocco , 300 km from Marrakesh , the first cultural and tourist centr of the country and 180 kilometers from the city of Essaouira .
Taghazout Bay is part of the Moroccan national tourism strategy ‘ Vision 2030 ' . It is expected ( September 2018 ) to provide the implementation of 8000 beds ( 5800 hotel ) , with a closer and more environmentally friendly tourism development , `` Taghazout eco-resort . '' It further provides for a village of surfers , a village green holiday , camping with international standards , an 17-hole golf course , cafes , restaurants , shops and galleries .

Snežana Sedlar ( ; born 16 August 1960 ) , formerly known as Snežana Sedlar Kenig , is a politician in Serbia . She has served in the Assembly of Vojvodina since 2016 as a member of the Serbian Progressive Party . She was previously a member of the National Assembly of Serbia from 2008 to 2012 as a member of G17 Plus .
Early life and career
Sedlar was born in Odžaci , Autonomous Province of Vojvodina , in what was then the People 's Republic of Serbia in the People 's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . She graduated from the University of Novi Sad 's Faculty of Law in 1983 and has worked for the chemical industry HIPOL in Odžaci and for the National Employment Service in Novi Sad .
Politician
Member of the National Assembly
Sedlar received the 202nd position on the electoral list of G17 Plus in the 2007 Serbian parliamentary election . The list won nineteen seats , and she was not awarded a mandate . ( From 2000 to 2011 , parliamentary mandates in Serbian elections were awarded at the discretion of successful parties or alliances , and it was common practice for mandates to be assigned out of numerical order . Sedlar 's position on the list – which was in any event mostly alphabetical – had no bearing on whether or not she received a mandate . )
G17 Plus contested the 2008 parliamentary election as part of the Democratic Party 's For a European Serbia list , and Sedlar received the 191st position . She was not initially awarded a mandate , but she was able to enter the assembly as the replacement for another party member on 16 July 2008 , after G17 Plus entered the government of Serbia . She served in the assembly as a supporter of the administration for the next four years . In May 2010 , she was elected to the presidency of G17 Plus in Vojvodina .
Serbia 's electoral system was reformed in 2011 , such that mandates were awarded to candidates on successful lists in numerical order . G17 Plus contested the 2012 parliamentary election as part of the United Regions of Serbia alliance , and Sedlar received the fifty-first position on their list . The United Regions of Serbia won sixteen mandates , and she was not returned . She subsequently left G17 Plus and joined the Progressive Party .
Municipal politics
Sedlar has served a number of terms in the Odžaci municipal assembly . In 2011 , she has chosen as speaker of the assembly . She was given the third position on the Progressive Party 's list for Odžaci in the 2013 Serbian local elections and was re-elected when the list won sixteen mandates . She did not seek re-election in 2017 .
Assembly of Vojvodina
Sedlar contested the 2012 Vojvodina provincial election as a United Regions of Serbia candidate in the Odžaci constituency and was defeated .
Vojvodina switched to a system of full proportional representation for the 2016 provincial election . Sedlar received the thirteenth position on the Progressive Party 's list and was elected when the list won a majority of victory with sixty-three mandates . She was chosen as a vice-president of the assembly following the election and held this role for the next four years . She was also appointed as director of the provincial employment service of Serbia 's National Employment Service on 8 July 2017 .
She was promoted to the third position on the Progressive list for the 2020 provincial election and was elected to a second term when the list won an increased majority with seventy-six seats . She is now a member of the assembly committee on regulations and the committee on economy .

Tenpin bowling is a popular and recreational sport in India . The activity is administered by the Bangalore-based Tenpin Bowling Federation of India . It organises the National Bowling League comprising championships for amateurs , corporate team tournaments as well as a national tour for professionals . Many Indians take up bowling for fitness , rather than for recreation . Bowling alleys in India are commonly a part of multiplexes and malls .
In Chennai , the sport was widely known as `` snow bowling '' in the late 1990s and early 2000s , owing to its presence in the 'Snow Bowling ' Centre in Chennai . The term `` snow bowling '' has been referenced in songs such as `` Dey Nandakumara '' from Seenu ( 2000 ) , `` Oh Mama Mama '' from Minnale ( 2001 ) , `` Sandhippoma '' in Enakku 20 Unakku 18 ( 2003 ) and `` Kannin Maniye '' from Gambeeram ( 2004 ) .
In 2008 , the Indian team participated in the WTBA World Tenpin Bowling Championships in Bangkok and the Commonwealth Tenpin Bowling Championships in Belfast .

Abuelhawa v. United States , 556 U.S. 816 ( 2009 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a defendant who used a cellphone for the misdemeanor purchase of cocaine could not be charged with a felony for using a `` communication facility '' to facilitate the distribution of an illegal drug under 21 U.S.C . § 843 ( b ) . In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Souter , the Court reasoned that the Government 's interpretation of `` facilitate '' exposed a first-time buyer using a phone `` to punishment 12 times more severe than a purchase by a recidivist offender and 8 times more severe than the unauthorized possession of a drug used by rapists , '' and was clearly not in line with Congress 's intent , since it conflicted with the classification of the drug sale itself as a misdemeanor .

Count Eduard Clam-Gallas ( , in Prague – , in Vienna ) was an Austrian general . He was the eldest son of Count Christian Christoph Clam-Gallas ( 1771–1838 ) , patron of Beethoven , and Countess Josephine Clary-Aldringen ( 1777–1828 ) .
Career
In 1823 Clam-Gallas joined the Army , at first as a Rittmeister ( Captain ) of the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1831 , then Commander ( 1835 ) , Colonel ( 1840 ) and General in Prague ( 1846 ) .
In 1848 , called to Italy under the orders of General Joseph Radetzky , he commanded a brigade which distinguished itself at Santa Lucia , Vicenza and the Battle of Custoza . He was decorated with the Military Order of Maria Theresa and promoted to Field Marshal Lieutenant ( equivalent of two-star general ) .
In April 1849 he became commander of the Transylvanian Army Corps which needed to return to Turkey ( 7,000 infantry , 1,600 horse and 36 cannon ) . At the beginning of July he was moving into Hungary to ( now ) , to support Alexander von Lüders on the right flank . In this month there were a few battles between Lüders , Józef Bem and Sándor Gál . During the Transylvanian summer campaign , Clam-Gallas was defeated by Bem , but after that was able to defeat Sándor Gál and his Székels Army . After occupying Székely Land he joined Lüders and together they defeated Bem at Segesvár .
In 1850 , he was head of the Army Corps of Bohemia in Vienna , and in the Second Italian War of Independence ( 1859 ) took part in the Battle of Magenta and the Battle of Solferino . This army corps was one of the first to be repelled , but this failure had no personal consequences for Clam-Gallas , who was promoted to General der Kavallerie .
In 1861 he was admitted to the Aulic Council before becoming , in 1865 , Imperial Hofmeister .
At the start of the Austro-Prussian War Clam-Gallas , still in command of I Corps , was given command of units ( 60.000 men ) detached from North Army , called Iser Army and consisting out of his own I Corps , the retreating Royal Saxon Army Corps , the Austrian brigade evacuated out of Holstein , and an Austrian light cavalry division . In the course of the War , he suffered defeats at Podol , Münchengrätz and Jičín . After reuniting his force with North Army under Ludwig von Benedek he reverted to command of I Corps . He was relieved of his command and replaced by Count Leopold Gondrecourt in the early morning of 3 July 1866 and thus took no part in the defeat of the Austrian main army at Königgrätz that day .
For his defeat at Jičín he was court-martialled , but he was acquitted because of his position in society . He spent his final years in retirement in Frýdlant and Liberec in Bohemia ( now the Czech Republic ) .
Family
In 1850 he married Clothilde von Dietrichstein ( 1828-1899 ) , heiress of Prince Joseph-Franz von Dietrichstein ( 1798-1858 ) and sister-in-law of Alexander von Mensdorff-Pouilly , a senior minister of the Austrian Empire and a brother-in-arms during the Battle of Magenta . They had one son , Franz and two daughters , Eduardine and Clotilde .

The Cine Las Americas International Film Festival is an annual film festival based in Austin , Texas featuring Latin American and indigenous films from the Americas . In its 14th year in 2011 , the Festival has grown into a citywide event , with over 100 screenings in a nine-day span . Patrons of the festival are offered a wide variety of films to choose from including narrative and documentary features , short films , animation and youth films .
Organization
Cine Las Americas , a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) non-profit organization , is a multicultural organization that offers cultural experiences and business opportunities for Latinos in film and media arts , and brings media arts education to minority youth in Austin . While the international film festival seeks to become an institution in the international film business and trade , fostering multi-national film production , and accessing emerging markets and diverse audiences , Cine Las Americas remains a community oriented Media Arts Center , offering diverse opportunities for culture , education and fun .
Festival history
The Cine Las Americas International Film festival began in 1997 as a Cuban film retrospective sponsored by the Mexic-Arte Museum in Austin , Texas . While programming the initial event , the organizers realized that although Austin was building its reputation as an important city for producing and showcasing independent film , films made by and about Latinos were largely absent from the community 's cultural landscape . In 2001 , Cine Las Americas partnered with the Austin Independent School District ( AISD ) and moved the organization 's offices to Johnston High School in East Austin , where it established a Media Arts Center , implementing educational and mentoring programs to support the District 's Dropout Prevention Campaign . During this time the organization offered the school 's students hands-on bilingual opportunities in multimedia production , event production , and non-profit organization management .
Festival-related programs and milestones
The training students received in the Cine Las Americas-school district partnership culminated in students producing Emergencia , the youth component of the film festival . In Emergencia they receive entries from around the country , preview them in order to curate a program , grant awards for the best work , and produce a day of free screenings within the context of the festival . Emergencia remains a special competitive section of the festival open to filmmakers ages 19 and under and is curated by students participating in Cine Las Americas ' multicultural Media Literacy programs .
In 2003 , professional musicians and other guest artists began to instruct and mentor dozens of students at a recording studio inside the organization 's classroom at the school . There , students were able to write and record music and lyrics in a professional studio environment within a bilingual Digital Music Production curriculum in the after-school program BeatLab . Many students have used skills learned there in preparing work for subsequent Festivals . BeatLab has continued at other area schools since the organization 's offices moved to East Austin after its contract with the school expired .
Also in 2003 , the festival extended its program to include indigenous work from the Americas , established competitive sections granting juried and audience awards .
By 2005 , the organization had presented more than 300 films at the annual Festival and at various screenings throughout Texas , collaborating with institutions such as The Museum of Fine Arts , Houston ( MFAH ) , the South By Southwest film festival ( SXSW ) , and the Austin Film Festival .
In 2007 , the Festival expanded to its current format in celebration of Cine Las Americas ' 10th anniversary .
The 13th annual Cine Las Americas International Film Festival was held April 21–29 , 2010 , and featured Mexico as the invited country in celebration of Mexico 's bicentennial .

Olympia Apartments is an historic structure located in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in Washington , D.C. 's Northwest Quadrant . Albert B. Morgan designed this apartment building and it was completed in 1898 .
The official District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites states `` Stylistically , the Olympia is also notable as a transitional mixture of Victorian and Beaux Arts design , reflecting the period from about 1895 to 1905 when monumental classicism returned to favor in Washington . '' The building is the last remaining of the first phase of apartment blocks that were constructed near the 14th Street streetcar line . They formed Washington 's first apartment corridor . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 .

The siege of Namur ( 21 November - 2 December 1792 ) took place during the Flanders campaign of the War of the First Coalition . The Army of the Ardennes under the Count of Valence captured the city which was then part of the Austrian Netherlands .
Background
After the Battle of Jemappes , the Count of Valence divided his forces and sent 35,000 men towards the Meuse . A detachment entered Liège on November 28 under the acclamations of the inhabitants ; the rest was sent to undertake the siege of Namur .
Due to the proximity of the Austrian army under Johann Peter Beaulieu , Valence devoted this operation to the Army of the Ardennes which would be reinforced by the Harville division . Beaulieu , avoiding battle with the Army of the Ardennes , fell back towards the Aische Forest . Three French brigades encamped around the citadel of Namur awaiting the arrival of their artillery from the Fortress of Charlemont near Givet . The strategist Antoine-Henri Jomini pointed out that by advancing more quickly , Valence could have trapped the entire Austrian army which he did not , allowing Beaulieu and his force to escape .
Battle
On 21 November , the main town opened its doors and surrendered ; however the Austrians still held the citadel with 2,300 well-supplied men . The trench was opened on November 27 and the bombardment began using the artillery that arrived from Givet . Under heavy French bombardment , the citadel capitulated on December 2 and Valence took the garrison prisoner .

A specular highlight is the bright spot of light that appears on shiny objects when illuminated ( for example , see image on right ) . Specular highlights are important in 3D computer graphics , as they provide a strong visual cue for the shape of an object and its location with respect to light sources in the scene .
Microfacets
The term specular means that light is perfectly reflected in a mirror-like way from the light source to the viewer . Specular reflection is visible only where the surface normal is oriented precisely halfway between the direction of incoming light and the direction of the viewer ; this is called the half-angle direction because it bisects ( divides into halves ) the angle between the incoming light and the viewer . Thus , a specularly reflecting surface would show a specular highlight as the perfectly sharp reflected image of a light source . However , many shiny objects show blurred specular highlights .
This can be explained by the existence of microfacets . We assume that surfaces that are not perfectly smooth are composed of many very tiny facets , each of which is a perfect specular reflector . These microfacets have normals that are distributed about the normal of the approximating smooth surface . The degree to which microfacet normals differ from the smooth surface normal is determined by the roughness of the surface . At points on the object where the smooth normal is close to the half-angle direction , many of the microfacets point in the half-angle direction and so the specular highlight is bright . As one moves away from the center of the highlight , the smooth normal and the half-angle direction get farther apart ; the number of microfacets oriented in the half-angle direction falls , and so the intensity of the highlight falls off to zero .
The specular highlight often reflects the color of the light source , not the color of the reflecting object . This is because many materials have a thin layer of clear material above the surface of the pigmented material . For example , plastic is made up of tiny beads of color suspended in a clear polymer and human skin often has a thin layer of oil or sweat above the pigmented cells . Such materials will show specular highlights in which all parts of the color spectrum are reflected equally . On metallic materials such as gold the color of the specular highlight will reflect the color of the material .
Models
A number of different models exist to predict the distribution of microfacets . Most assume that the microfacet normals are distributed evenly around the normal ; these models are called isotropic . If microfacets are distributed with a preference for a certain direction along the surface , the distribution is anisotropic .
NOTE : In most equations , when it says it means
Phong distribution
In the Phong reflection model , the intensity of the specular highlight is calculated as :
Where R is the mirror reflection of the light vector off the surface , and V is the viewpoint vector .
In the Blinn–Phong shading model , the intensity of a specular highlight is calculated as :
Where N is the smooth surface normal and H is the half-angle direction ( the direction vector midway between L , the vector to the light , and V , the viewpoint vector ) .
The number n is called the Phong exponent , and is a user-chosen value that controls the apparent smoothness of the surface . These equations imply that the distribution of microfacet normals is an approximately Gaussian distribution ( for large ) , or approximately Pearson type II distribution , of the corresponding angle . While this is a useful heuristic and produces believable results , it is not a physically based model .
Another similar formula , but only calculated differently :
where R is an eye reflection vector , E is an eye vector ( view vector ) , N is surface normal vector . All vectors are normalized ( ) . L is a light vector . For example , then :
Approximate formula is this :
If vector H is normalized then
Gaussian distribution
A slightly better model of microfacet distribution can be created using a Gaussian distribution . The usual function calculates specular highlight intensity as :
where m is a constant between 0 and 1 that controls the apparent smoothness of the surface .
Beckmann distribution
A physically based model of microfacet distribution is the Beckmann distribution :
where m is the rms slope of the surface microfacets ( the roughness of the material ) . Compared to the empirical models above , this function `` gives the absolute magnitude of the reflectance without introducing arbitrary constants ; the disadvantage is that it requires more computation '' .
However , this model can be simplified since .
Also note that the product of and a surface distribution function is normalized over the half-sphere which
is obeyed by this function .
Heidrich–Seidel anisotropic distribution
The Heidrich–Seidel . distribution is a simple anisotropic distribution , based on the Phong model . It can be used to model surfaces that have small parallel grooves or fibers , such as brushed metal , satin , and hair .
Parameters
Input parameters :
D = Thread direction ( In original papers this appears as T )
s = Shininess exponent . Values are between 0 and infinity
N = Real surface normal
L = Vector from point to light
V = Vector from point to viewer
T = Thread direction based on real surface normal .
P = Projection of vector L onto plane with normal T ( in original paper this appears as N ) .
R = Reflected incoming light ray against T. Incoming light ray is equal to negative L .
All vectors are unit .
Conditions
If some of the conditions are not satisfied from the list then the color is zero
Note : This list is not optimized .
Formula
First we need to correct original direction of fiber D to be perpendicular to real surface normal N .
This can be done by projection fiber direction on to plane with normal N :
It is expected that fiber is cylindrical . Note the fact that normal of fiber depends on light position .
Normal of fiber at given point is :
Reflected ray needed for specular calculation :
Final calculation
Optimization
Calculation of R and P are expensive operation . To avoid their calculation original formula can be rewritten in next form :
Diffuse
Specular
Comments
T can be observed as bump normal and after that it is possible to apply other BRDF than Phong .
The anisotropic should be used in conjunction with an isotropic distribution like a Phong distribution to produce the correct specular highlight
Ward anisotropic distribution
The Ward anisotropic distribution uses two user-controllable parameters αx and αy to control the anisotropy . If the two parameters are equal , then an isotropic highlight results . The specular term in the distribution is :
The specular term is zero if N·L < 0 or N·V < 0 . All vectors are unit vectors . The vector V is the viewing direction , L is the direction from the surface point to the light , H is the half-angle direction between V and L , N is the surface normal , and X and Y are two orthogonal vectors in the normal plane which specify the anisotropic directions .
Cook–Torrance model
The Cook–Torrance model uses a specular term of the form
.
Here D is the Beckmann distribution factor as above and F is the Fresnel term . For performance reasons , in real-time 3D graphics Schlick 's approximation is often used to approximate the Fresnel term .
G is the geometric attenuation term , describing selfshadowing due to the microfacets , and is of the form
.
In these formulas V is the vector to the camera or eye , H is the half-angle vector , L is the vector to the light source and N is the normal vector , and α is the angle between H and N .
Using multiple distributions
If desired , different distributions ( usually , using the same distribution function with different values of m or n ) can be combined using a weighted average . This is useful for modelling , for example , surfaces that have small smooth and rough patches rather than uniform roughness .

EQUAL was a Community Initiative within the European Social Fund of the European Union . It concerned “ transnational co-operation to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market ” . It ran from 2001 till 2007 with a budget of some €3 billion of EU resources , matched by a similar sum from national resources .
EQUAL was part of the European Union 's strategy for `` more and better jobs '' and for ensuring that no-one is denied access to them . It tested new ways of tackling discrimination and inequality experienced by those in work and those looking for a job . From 2008 it has been discontinued , but its principles were intended to be incorporated into the mainstream Structural Funds . In practice , in the 2007-2013 period transnational work in the ESF was virtually limited to the 17 Learning Networks or Communities of practice that were established under the Learning for Change programme . These involved the 117 ESF Managing Authorities ( mostly national ministries and regions ) and their key external partners , but had a much more limited budget and reach than EQUAL did .
EQUAL co-financed activities in all 27 EU Member States - the 12 new countries actually joined in January 2004 , 4 months before their official accession . The EU contribution to EQUAL of €3.274 billion was matched by national funding . EQUAL differed from the European Social Fund mainstream programmes in its function as a laboratory ( principle of innovation ) and in its emphasis on active co-operation between Member States . Two calls for proposals for EQUAL projects in the Member States took place , the first in 2001 and the second in 2004 . Responsibility for the implementation of the Community Initiative programmes in the Member States lay with the national authorities .
Themes
EQUAL projects were classified into the four pillars of the European Employment Strategy , and more precisely into nine themes :
1 . Employability
a ) Facilitating access and return to the labour market for those who have difficulty in being integrated or re-integrated into a labour market which must be open to all

The building blocks of EQUAL
EQUAL adopted an innovative way of working designed to ensure that its lessons were long-lasting . Support was given not to time-limited projects but to some 3,500 ‘ development partnerships ' ( DPs ) which brought different types of institution together . Typically they included for instance local authorities , businesses , colleges and trade unions . One of the effects of obliging different types of organisation to work together in order to gain financial support has been to build up the relationship and habits necessary for continued partnership working .
Secondly , DPs were obliged to attempt to ‘ mainstream ' their results , that is to go beyond simply ‘ disseminating ' them to other potential practitioners , but also to make serious attempts to influence policy-makers .
Thirdly , EQUAL was a uniquely self-conscious programme , that studied numerous process issues such as the way innovation is created , the way people can best work together and the way policies are changed .
It followed these principles :
Partnership : to bring together key actors ( local and regional authorities , training bodies , public employment services , NGOs , enterprises , social partners ) in Development Partnerships ( DPs ) on a geographical or sectoral level to tackle discrimination and inequality .
Thematic approach : to concentrate actions on thematic fields in keeping with the European Employment Strategy .
Innovation : to explore and test innovative approaches in formulating , delivering and implementing employment and training policies .
Empowerment : to strengthen capacity building by making all relevant actors , including beneficiaries , work together on an equal footing .
Transnationality : to render it possible for individual DPs and national authorities to learn from each other and co-operate productively across borders .
Mainstreaming : to develop and test new ways of integrating best practices into employment and social inclusion policies .
Follow-up
2007-2013
For the 2007-13 Structural Funds programming period , the decision was taken to abolish the Community Initiative in the European Social Fund . Transnational co-operation was carried out only on an ad hoc basis organised multilaterally among Member States , and was in consequence much diminished . However 17 Learning Networks operated at EU level .
2014-2020
In the 2014-20 programming period , a structure to co-ordinate transnational co-operation was re-established in the form of the ESF Transnational Platform , which was managed by AEIDL . This comprised :
nine thematic networks which engaged in mutual learning activities and co-ordinated calls for proposals which allowed projects in different EU countries to work together
a website to facilitate collaboration
database to manage these co-ordinated calls for proposals
information , publications and annual events
The common themes were :
employment
inclusion
youth employment ( including youth mobility )
learning and skills
social economy
governance and public administration
simplification ( of ESF financing procedures )
migrants
Mutual learning : The thematic networks met three times in each year , in Brussels or by invitation in other capital cities . They each involved on average 10 Member States ( representatives of ESF Managing Authorities and ministries responsible for the policy area concerned ) and 5 other stakeholders such as NGOs and social partners . The largest network was that on simplification , which had 25 of the 28 Member States in membership . The networks ' mutual learning activities included conducting seminars , study visits and peer reviews , preparing white papers and studies of good practice , and holding workshops as part of larger conferences .
Co-ordinated calls : During the 2014-2020 programming period , the Platform supported two rounds of co-ordinated calls for proposals . The first took place in 2016 , but only four countries or regions - Finland , Flanders , Poland and Sweden - took part . This resulted in approximately 100 transnational projects with a combined budget of approximately €14 million . The second round of calls took place in 2018 .
2021-2027
In the 2021-27 programming period , support to transnational cooperation in the ESF has been even more limited . Four communities of practice , which are working on the following themses :
social innovation - social innovation in ESF+ , community-led local development ( CLLD ) , scaling up innovations
employment , education and skills - NEETs , long-term unemployment , education and training
results-based management - simplification
social inclusion - child poverty , deinstitutionalisation , homelessness ( Housing First )
A new website has been established .

Toni Ebel ( born 10 November 1881 in Berlin ; died 9 June 1961 in Berlin ) was a German painter , housekeeping staff of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft and one of the first trans women who received a sex reassignment surgery , possibly before Lili Elbe .
Life and work
Toni Ebel was born as Arno Ebel , the oldest of eleven children of an evangelical family . After graduating from high school , Ebel apprenticed as a decorator and businessman , and for the first earned money bought a wig and a dress , discovered and burnt by parents . Around 1901 she fell in love with a man , which caused arguments with family , and so she left home , studied painting in Munich and also traveled around Germany , Austria and Italy . In Venice Ebel met an elderly American man , who became her patron and partner for few years . In 1908 Ebel went back to Berlin and lived as a man , married a woman named Olga and had a son . Ebel did not feel comfortable in a man 's and husband 's role and tried four times to commit suicide . Around this period , `` Arno Ebel '' gained a good reputation in the artistic circles of Käthe Kollwitz . In 1916 she was drafted into the army , fighting in trenches in Champagne , and then discarded to reserves after suffering a mental breakdown . In 1925 Ebel became temporarily a member of the USPD , she also later described herself as `` always a proletarian painter '' .
After Olga fell ill and died in 1928 , Toni , who lived and worked as a painter first in Berlin-Steglitz , then in Wedding , decided to transition . Around this time she met Charlotte Charlaque , also transitioning . She made a formal application for a legal name change to Annie in 1929 , which was rejected , and an accepted application for the name Toni in 1930 . With the support of Hirschfeld , Toni underwent five sex reassignment surgeries conducted by Erwin Gohrbandt , Felix Abraham and Ludwig Levy-Lenz . It was one of the first sex reassignment surgeries . According to the surgeons , the first operation for both Toni and Charlotte took place `` between 6 January 1929 and 14 November 1930 '' and according to Ragnar Ahlsted , Toni was the third patient of that procedure ever . In 1931 Felix Abraham published a paper giving the details of the vaginoplasty operations on Richter and Ebel in Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft und Sexualpolitik .
In 1933 footage of Toni , Charlotte and Dora Richter ( all anonymously/uncredited ) was used as a documentary segment in an Austrian movie Mysterium des Geschlechtes ( Mystery of Sex ) about contemporary sexology . The same year Toni and Charlotte hosted Swede Ragnar Ahlsted , who wrote about them in a book Män , som blivit kvinnor ( Men , who became women ) , but they did not mention Dora to him . When Institut Fur Sexualwissenschaft was attacked in 1933 , a collection of Ebel 's drawings and paintings was destroyed .
In 1933 Toni Ebel converted to Judaism , the faith of her partner Charlaque . Both lived in modest circumstances , sublet at Nollendorfstrasse 24 in Berlin-Schöneberg . Toni Ebel received a small pension and earned some additional income from the sale of pictures . They were repeatedly harassed by their neighbors , and in 1942 they were forced to separate . After a warning from Ebels ' half-sister , Toni Ebel fled to Czechoslovakia with Charlotte Charlaque in 1934 . Until 1935 they lived in the Karlovy Vary ( Rybáře ) , where Ebel painted pictures for Karlovy Vary spa guests . Then they moved to Prague and in 1937 to Brno , where they kept in touch with Karl Giese before his suicide . Ebel lived in Prague under the name Antonia Ebelova and worked as a painter . In 1942 Charlotte Charlaque was arrested by the Aliens Police . She later managed to come to the USA .
After the end of the war , Toni Ebel lived in East Germany , where she received a small pension as a victim of `` racial prejudice '' of National Socialism and worked as a painter . She mainly created landscape pictures and portraits and received attention in the East Germany since the 1950s . She was a member of the Association of Visual Artists of the East Germany and was represented at the German art exhibitions in Dresden in 1953 , 1958/1959 and 1962/1963 . Her gender was not questioned , even with many noticing her `` low voice '' .

The Gladstone–MacDonald pact of 1903 was a secret informal electoral agreement negotiated by Herbert Gladstone , Liberal Party Chief Whip , and Ramsay MacDonald , Secretary of the Labour Representation Committee ( LRC ) . The Liberal Party agreed to withdraw parliamentary candidates in some constituencies where the LRC was also standing in order to make sure the anti-Conservative vote was not split .
There was increasing tension between the Liberal Party and the LRC since the latter 's formation in 1900 . For example , in the by-election for Clitheroe in 1902 , local cotton weavers refused to withdraw their candidate , David Shackleton , who was not an approved Lib-Lab candidate . Gladstone therefore withdrew the Liberal candidate and Shackleton was elected unopposed . This was one of the main reasons behind the formation of the pact .
In the general election of 1906 , 31 of the 50 LRC candidates contested seats where the Liberals agreed not to put up a candidate . 24 of the 29 LRC MPs elected in that election were in seats where the Liberals did not stand .

Sir Thomas Fairfax ( – 31 March 1505 ) was the first member of the Fairfax family to own Gilling Castle , near Gilling East , North Riding of Yorkshire , England .
He was born Thomas Fairfax of Walton and was presumably a supporter of the House of York in the Wars of the Roses . Fairfax 's original home was near the Battle of Towton , which decided the outcome of that war . From 1489 to 1492 , he successfully claimed the ownership of the Gilling Estate during two inquisitions . Before Fairfax , the de Etton family had owned this estate . However , in 1349 , Margaret de Etton , the sister of Thomas de Etton—who owned the estate at that time and erected its tower keep—married Fairfax 's ancestor , also named Thomas Fairfax . She entered an agreement that , should the de Etton family fail , the estate would be inherited by the Fairfax family . Thus , historian John Marwood wrote that `` it could be argued that the rightful heirs had at last come home . '' When Fairfax received the estate , he became the Fairfax of Walton and Gilling .
In 1505 , the castle was essentially a large tower designed to be defensible against hit-and-run Scottish raiders , but not a long siege . According to historian John Marwood , this was the largest tower house in England . The estate consisted of a water mill , 30 houses , 300 acres of attached land , 300 acres of wood and 1,000 acres of moor .
Fairfax became a Knight of the Bath in 1495 . He married Elizabeth Shireburn of Stonyhurst in Lancashire and had 10 children : his eldest son Thomas , who inherited the estate upon the elder Thomas ' death ; three other sons named Richard , Robert and John ; and five daughters named Margaret , Jane , Elizabeth , Isabel , Anne and Dorothy . According to Marwood , `` there appears little to report from Thomas ' life . ''

The scanning laser vibrometer or scanning laser Doppler vibrometer , was first developed by the British loudspeaker company , Celestion , around 1979 , further developed in the 1980s , and commercially introduced by Ometron , Ltd around 1986 . It is an instrument for rapid non-contact measurement and imaging of vibration .
Fields where they are applied include automotive , medical , aerospace , micro system and information technology as well as for quality and production control . The optimization of vibration and acoustic behavior are important goals of product development in all of these fields because they are often among the key characteristics that determine a product 's success in the market . They are also in widespread use throughout many universities conducting basic and applied research in areas that include structural dynamics , modal analysis , acoustic optimization and non-destructive evaluation .
The operating principle is based on the Doppler effect , which occurs when light is back-scattered from a vibrating surface . Both velocity and displacement can be determined by analyzing the optical signals in different ways . A scanning laser vibrometer integrates computer-controlled X , Y scanning mirrors and a video camera inside an optical head . The laser is scanned point-by-point over the test object 's surface to provide a large number of very high spatial resolution measurements . This sequentially measured vibration data can be used to calculate and visualize animated deflection shapes in the relevant frequency bands from frequency domain analysis . Alternatively , data can be acquired in the time domain to , for example , generate animations showing wave propagation across structures . In contrast to contact measuring methods , the test object is unaffected by the vibration measuring process .
Vibrometry covers a huge range of applications such as the study of microstructures moving only a few pm at frequencies up to 2.5 GHz , all the way up to the intense dynamics occurring in Formula 1 engines with vibration velocities approaching 30 m/s .
A 3D scanning vibrometer combines three optical sensors that accurately detect dynamic movement from different directions in space in order to completely determine the 3D vectors of motion . The software allows each individual x- , y- or z-direction component to be displayed independently , or combined into a single representation . Data can be exported for finite element model validation at nodes previously imported from the model for scan grid definition .

Gravity spreading is a phenomenon in which a geological body laterally extends and vertically contracts to reduce its gravitational potential energy . It has been observed on many different scales , and at numerous locations on Earth , from rhyolite lava flows to passive margins . Additionally , gravity spreading is likely to have occurred on both Mars and Venus .
Distinction from Gravity Gliding
Historically , geologists have used the terms `` gravity spreading '' and `` gravity gliding '' interchangeably , or with little distinction . This article follows the convention of `` Excursus on gravity gliding and gravity spreading '' by D.D . Schultz-Ela , which defines gravity spreading as a lateral extension and vertical contraction , which thus must be applied to a non-rigid body . Gravity gliding , however , is applied to a block that is not being deformed , and is therefore less common to observe . However , it can be difficult to distinguish between the two in real world scenarios , and often both occur simultaneously .
Mechanism
For gravity spreading to occur , a rock mass must be driven to deformation by gravity . As long as the center of gravity of the system descends , portions of the system may rise . Of course , a material normally resists such deformation . For gravity spreading to occur , the differential stress must be greater than that rock body 's yield strength . Gravity spreading can be thought of as a mound of molasses that spreads out , and gravity gliding can be imagined as a wooden block sliding down a slope .
Examples
Earth
Mountains
Heart Mountain in Wyoming , United States , has been extensively studied , because Ordovician age carbonates ( Madison Limestone ) , sit on top of a much younger ( ~50Ma ) sedimentary formation ( Willwood Formation ) . It is now largely accepted that this juxtaposition of old rocks on top of young is the result of gravity spreading and gliding . Field observations , such as slight internal deformations of the older formation , indicate the gravity gliding and spreading of the Madison Limestones . The specific details of the gravity spreading event are unclear , but it is thought that it was induced by the Laramide Orogeny , approximately 50 Ma . This caused the Madison Limestones to slide into the nearby Bighorn Basin , where it came to rest on top of the Willwood Formation . The cause for block motion is debated , with numerous models to explain how such a large block could have moved tens of kilometers down a slope of less than 2° . Models have ranged from lubrication by hydrothermal circulation , movement initiation from volcanogenic seismicity , to frictional heating dissociating CO2 from the carbonates , resulting in dramatically reduced friction . The last of these theories is among the most recent , and by far the most spectacular . The authors envisage initially slow sliding , likely as the result of a volcanic eruption , until frictional heating of the carbonate rocks creates a supercritical CO2 layer , decreasing the friction tremendously . From this point , the sliding would occur rapidly , perhaps as high as 150 km/h .
Passive Margins
Gravity spreading in passive margins occurs when gravitational forces are strong enough to overcome the overburdens resistance to motion along its basal surface , and the internal strength . The gravitational forces are a function of the dip of the slope and the dip of the décollement layer .
Lava Flows
Rhyolite lava flows in northeastern New South Wales , Australia show recumbent folds that record a history of vertical shortening and lateral extension during deposition , consistent with what one would expect from gravity spreading . This is the result of lava being displaced by new lava extruding from the vent .
Mars
Satellite images of Mars have shown that the Thaumasia Plateau has large amounts of thrust faults , normal faults , and ridges . This rifting has resulted in canyons , and compression at the front of the `` mega-slide '' has caused the ridges and thrust faults observed at low end of the region . To explain these faults and ridges , a four-stage model involving gravity spreading is used :
A thick salt layer is deposited . This is possible in either wet or dry conditions .
Tharsis , a volcanic plateau , was emplaced . This increased both the heat flux of the area , and the topographic slope . Volcanism associated with Tharsis also deposited ash and lava flows .
The layers of salt and ice beneath the volcanics provided detachment points for the initiation of gravity spreading to the southeast .
Fractures from the basal detachment plane opened an aquifer , resulting in the release of water and incision of outflow channels .
Venus
It has been suggested that the `` blocky '' surface of Venus is the result of gravity spreading . This is thought because of flow-like structures correlated with topography , and as well as potential regions of thermal uplift , and has been reinforced by terrestrial analogues .

The Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage , also known as the Berkeley Castle or Berkeley Springs Castle , is located on a hill above Berkeley Springs , West Virginia . The castle-like house was built for Colonel Samuel Taylor Suit of Washington , D.C. as a personal retreat near the spa town , beginning in 1885 . It was not complete by the time of his death in 1888 and was finished in the early 1890s for his young widow , Rosa Pelham Suit , whom Suit had first met at Berkeley Springs , and their three children . The post 1888 work is of noticeably inferior quality .
The fifteen-room interior features a ballroom wide and long . The design is attributed to Washington architect Alfred B. Mullett , who is alleged to have drawn a rough sketch of the plan on a tablecloth at the Berkeley Springs Hotel . The design may have been based on elements of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire , United Kingdom . Detailed design and construction supervision was carried out by Snowden Ashford , who designed Washington 's Eastern Market , apprenticed for Mullett and is also credited as an architect . Mrs. Suit entertained lavishly at the house until her money ran out and the property was sold in 1913 .
Purchase by the VDare Foundation
In February 2020 , the property was purchased by the VDARE Foundation , a tax-exempt affiliate of anti-immigration organization VDARE .
The purchase was met with resistance from residents and leaders in Berkeley Springs .
VDARE founder and editor Peter Brimelow stated “ We absolutely will not be having rallies , marches or demonstrations . We 've never been involved in anything like that , and we never will be , ” and “ We just want to be quiet , good neighbors . “ The only public events we 're anticipating right now are the local charitable functions that we understand the castle has traditionally hosted . We hope to have some private meetings and functions , but do n't have plans for any public VDARE events. ” VDARE purchased the house for $ 1.4 million and the source of the money is unknown .
In popular culture
Berkeley Springs , including the Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage , inspired a location in the online multiplayer game Fallout 76 .

This name reaction , first reported in the 1960s by David W. Allen , Ian T. Millar , and Stuart Trippett , occurs by alkylation or acylation of the phosphorus , followed by reaction with hydroxide to give a rearranged product . The hydroxide first attacks the phosphonium atom , followed by collapse to the phosphine oxide with one of the groups migrating off of the phosphorus .

Maria Antónia Palla ( born 10 January 1933 ) is a journalist , writer and feminist who was one of the first female journalists in Portugal . She played an important role in the legalization of abortion in the country , by promoting the practice in interviews and television programmes . In 2004 Palla was awarded the title of Commander of the Order of Liberty . She is the mother of António Costa , the current Prime Minister of Portugal .
Early life
Maria Antónia Palla was born Maria Antónia de Assis dos Santos in Seixal , Portugal in January 1933 at the home of her paternal grandparents . At the age of four she moved to Sintra . She was brought up in an atheist , communist , and republican family . Her paternal grandfather and grandmother were Republicans and Freemasons . Her father , Ítalo Ferrer dos Santos , was the first in his family not to be baptised as a Catholic . Her mother was Angelina Painço de Assis . In contrast to her father 's parents , her mother 's parents were very conservative atheists . She claimed that from the time she had learnt to read her toys were books . Palla attended the Lycée français Charles Lepierre in Lisbon and graduated in Historical-Philosophical Sciences from the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon . At university she briefly became a member of the Movement of Democratic Unity ( MUD ) , which was a quasi-legal body opposed to the Estado Novo dictatorship .
After graduating in 1953 , she married one of her lovers - the Goan-origin Communist writer Orlando da Costa - and became a housewife . He had been imprisoned six months earlier in Caxias prison near Lisbon . She was not allowed to have conjugal visits with him in prison because she was not his wife , and so she convinced him when he was released that they should get married in case he was arrested again . She gave birth to their only daughter , Isabel dos Santos da Costa , in 1957 . Palla supported the 1958 presidential campaign of the pro-American independent candidate Humberto Delgado , in spite of his condemnation by the Portuguese Communist Party , because she was strongly anti-Salazar . In 1960 , Isabel died in a road accident .
Palla gave birth to her only son António Costa on 17 July 1961 . She then divorced his father Orlando da Costa in 1962 to marry her extra-marital lover , the Portuguese architect Victor Palla , as his third wife . This marriage also ended in divorce , but she kept Palla 's surname . After her second divorce , she lived alone with her son . She worked as a secretary and was also the mistress for several men .
Becoming a journalist
Convinced that she wanted to be a journalist she used her savings to go to Brazil for a month . Her report of that trip was published by Diário Popular and was a great success . This enabled her to obtain a permanent assignment with Diário Popular in 1968 , when she was among the first group of women journalists to be admitted to the editorial staff of that daily newspaper . In the Diário Popular and later , she showed a particular interest in stories that revealed the violence suffered by women , children and the elderly . Three months after joining she was awarded a prize for an article about alcoholic wives , buying a television with the prize money . Her forensic approach to journalism made her claim that had she not been a journalist she would have been a member of Portugal 's Judicial police . She was , however , dismissed from the Diário Popular for writing , without formal authorisation , a review of the events in Paris of May 1968 , which involved widespread strikes and student protests . The following year she published a book entitled Revolução , meu amor – Maio 68 , um ano depois ( Revolution , My Love - May 68 , a year on ) , including interviews with diverse observers , such as the singer/songwriter , actor and director Jacques Brel , the film director Jean Luc Godard , the cartoonist Siné , the sociologist Alain Touraine , the journalist and politician Françoise Giroud , and the student leader Jacques Sauvageot . This book , in turn , was banned by the Salazar-led Estado Novo regime , fearing a repetition of events in Paris in Portugal .
O Século
Palla then began to work for the O Século newspaper , particularly for its weekly magazine O Século Ilustrado , being the first woman to join the editorial staff of the company and rapidly becoming editor-in-chief . In order to employ her the publisher had to be assured that , although she was a woman , she `` writes like a man '' . She stayed with O Século Ilustrado for 11 years , travelling all over Portugal and working with the well-known photographers Eduardo Gageiro , Fernando Baião and Alfredo Cunha . She also carried out overseas missions , including one to prepare an article on the Rio Carnival and another to write about colonialism in the Bissagos Islands in Guinea-Bissau , which presented a view of this Portuguese colony that conflicted with the regime 's claim that Portugal and its colonies were one country where all were treated equally , and which led to a threat by the regime to close O Século Ilustrado . She has also worked for the Agência Noticiosa Portuguesa ( ANOP ) , now the Lusa News Agency , and for Diário de Notícias , among others .
After the Carnation Revolution
She married a Portuguese colonel , Manuel Pedroso Marques , as her third husband in 1974 . On the day of the Carnation Revolution , which led to the overthrow of the Estado Novo , Palla was on the streets of Lisbon witnessing events , including the release of prisoners from the Caxias prison , in which her first husband had been incarcerated . Between 1974 and 1976 , together with Antónia de Sousa , she made a fortnightly television series for the state broadcaster , RTP , called Nome Mulher ( Woman 's name ) , which featured 46 reports , each of 50 minutes . The first was shown in August 1974 , and was dedicated to the early feminist and journalist Maria Lamas , who had a strong influence on Palla when she was a student . Another in the series looked at the writer and feminist Elina Guimarães .
In 1976 they produced a programme titled Aborto não é Crime ( Abortion is not a crime ) . This programme , broadcast in February 1976 , showed images of a woman having an abortion . Palla also gave an interview to the New York Times ( published 13 March 1976 , page 39 ) where she freely admitted to having had `` several abortions '' during her lifetime . Palla was accused of `` offence to modesty and incitement to crime '' after a complaint by a Lisbon maternity hospital . The series Nome Mulher was suspended from broadcast by the then president of RTP , who was ironically , also her then husband . Criminal proceedings were instituted and she went to court but was acquitted in 1979 . Her strong pro-abortion stance led to the establishment of the National Campaign for Contraception and Abortion . However , it was not until 2007 that abortion was allowed in Portugal . In 1979 she published Só acontece aos Outros – crónicas de violência ( It only happens to others –stories of violence ) on the subject of domestic violence .
Palla was the first woman to be a member of the Portuguese Union of Journalists , eventually becoming its vice-president . She worked closely on the Union with Maria Antónia de Sousa and Maria Antónia Fiadeiro , and they were called `` the three Antónias '' by the future prime minister Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo . She was also the first woman to assume the presidency of the Journalists Pension Fund , holding the position for twelve years . She was one of the promoters of the Feminist Library , dedicated to the memory of Ana de Castro Osório , which is housed in the Municipal Library of Belém , near Lisbon and was only the second feminist library to be established in Europe . Palla was an early member of UMAR , which was active in supporting her during her court case . When it was founded in September 1976 the acronym stood for Union of Anti-Fascist and Revolutionary Women but in 1999 it was changed to Alternative and Answer Women 's Union . She was president of the League of Women 's Rights , a feminist association formed in 1985 .
Awards and honours
On 25 April 2004 Palla was awarded the title of Commander of the Order of Liberty .

Joaquín Calomarde Gramage ( 30 November 1956 – 20 March 2019 ) was a Spanish politician and former deputy who belonged to the People 's Party ( PP ) .
Early political career
Born in Valencia , Spain and married , with one son , Calomarde holds a degree in philosophy and educational sciences . He entered politics in 1991 when he was elected as a PP deputy to the Cortes Valencianas , the Valencian regional parliament , serving until 1995 . He also served as the president of the Valencian education council and the vice president of the Valencian culture council .
In 2000 he was elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies representing Valencia region for the PP and was re-elected in 2004 .
Resignation from the PP
On 29 March 2007 Calomarde published an article in the newspaper El País . This contravened a PP directive which the party had issued days earlier advising its members to cease cooperation with the newspaper following statements by its owner Jesús de Polanco , which the party considered offensive . Consequently , the PP parliamentary party removed Calomarde from all positions held in the parliament . Days later , Calomarde published another article in El País , criticising the leadership 's positions on terrorism and accusing them of using the issue for purely electoral ends . On 14 April 2007 Calomarde published an open letter to the PP leadership announcing his resignation from the party . However he retained his parliamentary seat and subsequently sat in the mixed group of deputies which consists of parties unable to form a technical group of five deputies . He did not stand in the 2008 election .
He also taught philosophy at the IES Ramon Llull , Valencia .

In the history of labor , socialism , and revolutions , the historiography of the Paris Commune connects its 1871 events with the revolutions of 1848 and 1917 . Historical interpretation of the Commune influenced subsequent revolutionary ideology and sociopolitical events . As of the late 20th century , there were two main historiographical schools of thought : the political interpretation , that the Commune was a patriotic eruption of fury in response to circumstantial hardship following the Siege of Paris ; and the social interpretation , that the Commune was the result of macro socioeconomic forces boiling over , e.g. , that it was a war of class struggle . Histories in the latter interpretation have used the Commune 's events to make ideological points on behalf of their authors , either that the Commune was an illegitimate , criminal aggression , or that the Commune was the consummation of revolutionary momentum . Similarly , historians within both the political and social interpretations have disagreed as to whether the Commune was inevitable or accidental ( though there is agreement that the uprising was unplanned ) , a harbinger of the future or a sunset for revolutionary zeal .
Shortly after the brutal end of the Commune , which killed , imprisoned , or exiled 100,000 Parisians , the Commune quickly became subject to polarizing legend . Conservative contemporaries of the Commune attributed the insurrection to revolutionary conspiracy by the First International and its affiliates . Partly in response , revolutionary socialists did not acknowledge organizations as contributing to the Commune . Their sense of the revolution 's legitimacy rested in its popular spontaneity , as compared to the deliberate planning of a coup . Scholarship of the Commune began with Georges Bourgin 's Histoire de la Commune just prior to World War I , and thus became viewed through the lens of 1917 . It received treatments from preeminent scholars including C.L.R . James and Henri Lefebvre , and was the subject of most of Jacques Rougerie 's career . Communist historiography fell out of favor by the end of the 20th century . Where there had previously been debate over whether the Commune was a revolutionary socialist movement or a movement of artisans , Rougerie 's La Commune : 1871 ( 1988 ) attributed the Commune to an amalgam of both . Roger Gould 's 1995 Insurgent Identities challenged Marxist ( David Harvey ) and humanist urban theory ( Lefebvre and Manuel Castells ) narratives of the Commune .

The 2017 Gothenburg Synagogue attack took place on 9 December 2017 when individuals in a large gang threw firebombs at the synagogue in Gothenburg , which hosted an event with about 40 youth inside . The people inside fled to the basement but nobody was hurt . The incendiaries started a fire among the parked vehicles in the yard but the building did not catch fire . Of the about ten masked individuals at the scene , two stateless Palestinians and one Syrian could later be identified and they were sentenced to jail for having committed a hate crime .
Background
The attack was done the day after activists in Malmö had shouted slogans about killing or shooting Jews at a demonstration .
Aftermath
Political impact
The attack was condemned by National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson . Prime minister Stefan Löfven condemned the attack as well as the antisemitic propaganda in Malmö .
Investigation and trial
The suspects could be identified using recordings by security cameras .
The trial began on 12 June 2018 and prosecutor Stina Lundqvist charged the defendants with aggravated arson and a hate crime and demanded an eight year prison sentence for each and deportation for all .
All three suspects , who were aged 19 to 24 , were sentenced by the District Court of Gothenburg 25 June 2018 for having committed a hate crime , gross unlawful threat ( Swedish : ) and attempting to commit gross damage to property ( Swedish : försök till grov skadegörelse ) against the Jewish congregation and Jews in general , but did not uphold the charge of aggravated arson as the firebombs were not considered powerful enough . The main suspect was a 22-year-old asylum seeker from Gaza , but his asylum application to Sweden rejected . He received a sentence of two years in prison and deportation with an attendant ban on returning until 2028 . According to the District Court of Gothenburg , the crime was serious enough to motivate deportation of all three , but the Swedish Migration Agency had given the other two perpetrators permanent residence permits .

The COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020 has significantly impacted liturgical celebrations of the Catholic Church worldwide . The Pontifical Foundation Aid to the Church in Need ( ACN ) stated that the pandemic has become not `` just a medical , social and economic problem , but also a pastoral problem '' , which led ACN to start encouraging a special program for the actions of priests and religious against the virus spread .
Public masses
In March 2020 , all public Masses were suspended in Vatican City and Italy due to the COVID-19 pandemic . These suspensions began in late-February in the Archdioceses of Milan and Venice and were extended to the rest of the Italian peninsula on 8 March . Setting an example for churches unable to celebrate public Masses due to the lockdown , Pope Francis began livestreaming daily Mass from his residence at Domus Sanctae Marthae on 9 March . Outside Italy , Mass in cities around the world were suspended in the days that followed . At the height of the outbreak in Italy , on 27 March , Pope Francis imparted the Urbi et Orbi blessing , normally reserved for Christmas and Easter , from an empty Saint Peter 's Square following a prayer for the health of all the world . For the prayer service , Francis brought the crucifix from San Marcello al Corso which had processed through the streets of Rome during the miraculous plague cure of 1522 . The prayer service concluded with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament , as church bells were rung and sirens blared across Rome . The spread of COVID-19 soon slowed in Italy , and public Masses were allowed to resume on 18 May , with Pope Francis celebrating his last daily live-stream Mass and first public Mass since the lockdown on the centenary of the birth of Pope John Paul II .
All over the world , many churches have suspended the presence of the faithful in their Masses , and resorted to virtual services for broadcasting the celebrations , such as live streaming or other ones , like television and radio . The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome , which take place at the end of Lent—Christian penitential period—would be canceled . Some dioceses ordered their churches to be closed to the public , while in other dioceses , such as the Archdiocese of New York , although they canceled the Masses , their churches remained open for prayer . In Spain , many cities canceled their Holy Week festivities . This event is usually celebrated with parades and significant collections with tourism ; in Seville , it was the first time that events were canceled since 1933 . Due to the interruption of several Catholic religious activities ( if not their totality ) , Pope Francis greatly encouraged the prayer of the Holy Rosary .
Commentary on vaccine
On February 26 , 2021 , the Archdiocese of New Orleans issued a statement calling the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine `` morally compromised , '' as it uses an abortion-derived cell line in vaccine production . According to The Washington Post , the Catholic Church have embraced the COVID-19 vaccines , and that `` Catholic religious leaders across the United States are supporting coronavirus vaccination '' . On January 10 , 2022 , Pope Francis issued a statement on COVID-19 vaccines , Pope Francis stated that COVID-19 vaccines was a `` moral obligation '' and denounced `` how people had been swayed by `` baseless information '' to refuse one of the most effective measures to save lives '' .
Impact on finances
The 2020 fiscal report for the Vatican showed a decrease in revenue of about 50 % , but the Institute for the Works of Religion contributed more income . Expenses were reduced by $ 3.88 million . The Vatican also planned to increase their liquid capital in response to market uncertainty in order to avoid selling Church assets in unfavorable market conditions .

Come and See ( ; ) is a Thai documentary film directed by Nottapon Boonprakob and produced by UnderDoc Film . The film focuses on the alleged controversies regarding the teachings and practices of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and chronicles the events of the 23-day lockdown of the temple by the Thai military junta in 2017 . The film was initially screened at the Busan International Film Festival in South Korea in 2019 before being released in Thailand in April 2021 following approval by Thai media censors .
The film 's original Thai language name , Ehipassiko , comes from a phrase commonly used in a Pali language Theravada Buddhist chant , meaning literally `` come and see '' , hence the name .
Production
The film was initially produced by Nottapon Boonprakob as his thesis at the School of Visual Arts in New York City . The film focused on the alleged controversies surrounding Wat Phra Dhammakaya 's teachings and practices , and highlighted the conflict and lawsuits between Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Thailand 's 2014 military junta , which put the temple under intense scrutiny in the Thai media for a period and resulted in a 23-day lockdown and siege of the temple in 2017 by the military junta .
The 84-minute film included extensive interviews with both supporters and critics of Wat Phra Dhammakaya regarding its teachings and practices , and included footage shot in real time during the siege in 2017 . The film includes interviews with well known Dhammakaya critics such as Thai Senator Paiboon Nititawan and former monk Mano Laohavanich ; as well as Thai Buddhist academics such as Phra Paisal Visalo and Nidhi Eoseewong .
Release
Cinema
The film was selected to be screened at the 24th Busan International Film Festival in 2019 but was banned in Thailand by Thai media censors . Thai Film Archive screened the film once in 2020 . The ban on the film was lifted after two years , with the film premiering in Thai cinemas in April 2021 . Boonprakob expressed surprise for the film 's approval by the Thai Censorship Board . News analysts described the film 's approval as a possible attempt by Thailand 's military-backed government to moderate its image in the wake of the 2020-2022 Thai Protests .
Home media
The film became available on Thai Netflix in August 2021 .
Reception
The film received critical acclaim as a type of long-form journalism that presented a wide range of views and provided a unique investigation into the temple and its alleged controversies that provided insight and perspectives about Wat Phra Dhammakaya that could not be found in mainstream media reports .

Eastcote House Gardens is an area of public parkland in Eastcote , within the London Borough of Hillingdon . The site covers and incorporates the walled garden , dovecote and coach house of Eastcote House . The house was demolished in 1964 by the then Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council ( RNUDC ) , one of the predecessors of the London Borough of Hillingdon which was formed the following year . At the public 's request , the garden and outbuildings were retained and are now maintained by a group of volunteers , the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens , in partnership with the local authority .
Eastcote House was one of three largest in Eastcote , together with Highgrove House and Haydon Hall . All came to be owned by the RNUDC , but only Highgrove House remains in its original form ; Haydon Hall was demolished in 1967 by the RNUDC 's successor .
The coach house , dovecote , and garden walls received Grade II listed status on 6 September 1974 . Ecological surveys have found fifty types of trees in the gardens , and numerous species of birds , mammals and insects have been recorded . The gardens received the Green Flag Award in September 2011 following an earlier inspection .
History
Eastcote House
Eastcote House is first recorded in 1507 , when it was known as `` Hopkyttes '' , under the ownership of the Walleston family . In 1525 , Ralph Hawtrey married Winifred Walleston , and they made Hopkyttes their marital home , renaming it Eastcote House . The house was extended by either Ralph Hawtrey or his son John , and the brick exterior added . The original timber framework was not revealed again until the house was demolished . John Hawtrey built the dovecote without applying for the required licence . After his death in 1593 , his nephew Ralph Hawtrey applied retrospectively , and the licence was granted . During the 18th century , the dovecote was substantially rebuilt , leaving only the original first few rows of bricks . The Hawtrey family , later the Hawtrey-Deanes , continued to live in the house until Francis Deane moved to East View in Uxbridge in 1878 . Eastcote House was then let to tenants and parts of the estate sold for housing developments .
The Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council purchased the house and grounds , totalling , in 1931 after it became endangered by the proposed new housing development by the builders Comben & Wakeling . Eastcote House became a public building for the use of the Scouts , Guides , Women 's Institute and a welfare clinic , though under the ownership of the council , the condition of the house deteriorated . In 1962 the house was declared unsafe , and it was demolished two years later after the council ruled there were no features of the house worth retaining .
The Eastcote Billiards Club began using the coach house in 1938 . The club 's lease of the building expired in 2005 , but the club remained in residence , rent-free . In 2013 , the club had moved to nearby Haydon Hall .
Gardens
The narrow bricks in the garden walls have been dated to around the 17th century . The walled garden would originally have been used predominantly for growing fruit , vegetables , and herbs for the household 's consumption , as well as flowers to exhibit at shows and for pleasure .
The walled garden , coach house , and dovecote were retained at the public 's request when the house was demolished . On 6 September 1974 , the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status . The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II . These included Artemisia , catmint , Santolina and curry plants . To keep the plants within the beds , each was lined by box in 1983 .
The eastern wall was rebuilt in 1981 , at which point the northern wall was reduced by seven layers of brick . An area of topiary with seven specimens was planted in 1983 with box , behind the coach house . Lilacs , weeping cherries and hibiscus were planted in 1984 along the garden wall near the coach house . A pergola covered with laburnum and wisteria was introduced in 1986 leading to the entrance into the walled garden . Between 1986 and 1988 , two iron gates and a sundial were added . In the 1990s , the orchard near the walled garden was supplemented by black mulberry , walnut and quince trees .
A footbridge crossing the River Pinn and leading to Long Meadow was replaced in 2007 ; the original had been built in 1977 . In 2008 , the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens was formed to care for the gardens and ensure they remain protected . The group received a £24,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund for the replanting of the gardens , which went ahead in April 2010 . The Mayor of Hillingdon officially reopened the gardens on 17 July 2010 .
A survey completed in November 2009 found 50 types of trees in the gardens . Bats were found in the coach house during an ecological survey , but were not believed to be roosting there long-term . Species of birds observed in the gardens have included song thrush , jay , wren , robin , kingfisher and tawny owl . Mammals regularly observed include hedgehogs , grey squirrels and foxes . Butterflies including the holly blue and painted lady have been recorded .
Hillingdon Council provided a £150,000 grant in September 2010 for the restoration of the buildings . In April 2011 , the council joined with the Friends to seek funding of up to £1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund , to support restoration work . It is planned that the coach house could be converted into a tearoom .
The gardens received the Green Flag Award in 2011 following an earlier inspection . The flag was raised in a ceremony on 14 September 2011 .

The Beaver Meadow Complex Prehistoric Archeological District is a grouping of archaeological sites in Peoples State Forest , Barkhamsted , Connecticut . It consists of eight separate sites in the Beaver Meadow area of the forest , from which radiocarbon dates from the Archaic to the Middle and Late Woodland Period have been obtained . The sites were identified during surveys conducted 1983-85 by teams from Central Connecticut State University . This work was done as part of a larger scale survey of the Connecticut sections of the upper Farmington River valley .
The complex consists of a number of sites around the edges of Beaver Meadow , a large swampy area in the center of the state forest . Large numbers of stone tools , projectile points , and debitage ( remains from stone tool manufacture ) were recovered during the surveys of the 1980s . These objects were formed out of a variety of materials , including flint , slate , quartz , and hornfels . The quantity and type of tools found at these sites suggest that at least some of them were the result of long-term seasonal occupation , rather than temporary use as an upland hunting camp , which is a departure from other settlement areas of the period , which are normally found closer to rivers in this region . Hearth features were also found , which had burned seeds and nuts .
The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 .

In Māori mythology , Tāwhirimātea ( or Tāwhiri ) is the god of weather , including thunder and lightning , wind , clouds and storms . He is a son of Papatūānuku ( earth mother ) and Ranginui ( sky father ) . Tawhirimatea is the second oldest of 7 children , all of whom are boys . In his anger at his brothers for separating their parents , Tāwhirimātea destroyed the forests of Tāne ( god of forests ) , drove Tangaroa ( god of the sea ) and his progeny into the sea , pursued Rongo and Haumia-tiketike till they had to take refuge in the bosom of their mother Papa , and only found in Tūmatauenga a worthy opponent and eternal enemy ( Tregear 1891:499 ) . To fight his brothers , Tāwhirimātea gathered an army of his children , winds and clouds of different kinds - including Apū-hau ( `` fierce squall '' ) , Apū-matangi , Ao-nui , Ao-roa , Ao-pōuri , Ao-pōtango , Ao-whētuma , Ao-whekere , Ao-kāhiwahiwa , Ao-kānapanapa , Ao-pākinakina , Ao-pakarea , and Ao-tākawe ( Grey 1971 ) . Grey translates these as 'fierce squalls , whirlwinds , dense clouds , massy clouds , dark clouds , gloomy thick clouds , fiery clouds , clouds which preceded hurricanes , clouds of fiery black , clouds reflecting glowing red light , clouds wildly drifting from all quarters and wildly bursting , clouds of thunderstorms , and clouds hurriedly flying on ' ( Grey 1956:5 ) .
Other children of Tāwhirimātea are the various kinds of rain , mists and fog . Tāwhirimātea 's attacks on his brothers led to the flooding of large areas of the land . The names of the beings involved in this flooding include Ua-nui ( terrible rain ) , Ua-roa ( long-continued rain ) , Ua-whatu ( fierce hailstorms ) , and Ua-nganga ( sleet ) ; after these , their children in turn took up the fight : Hau-maringi ( mist ) , Hau-marotoroto ( heavy dew ) , and Tōmairangi ( light mist ) ( Grey 1956:10-11 , Grey 1971:5 ) . Tregear mentions Hau-maringiringi as a personification of mists ( Tregear 1891:54 ) .
Tāwhirimātea lives on the sky with his father Rangi and brother , the star Rehua .
The Divine War and Tāwhirimātea 's conquest over his brothers
Eons ago , Rangi , the Sky Father , and Papa , the Earth Mother , were in an eternal embrace because of their love for each other . Their union gave rise to many powerful sons , who lived in between their parents .
As their sons grew up , they soon began to grow tired of living in a cramped up space , forever in darkness . One brother , Tūmatūenga , the God of War and Humans , suggested that they slay their parents . However , his brother , Tāne , the God of Forests , suggested that they separate their parents forever .
Except for Tāwhirimātea , all other brothers accepted the proposal . The brothers individually tried to separate their parents , but Tāne put his head on the earth and feet in the sky and pushed them apart .
Tāwhirimātea was enraged , as he saw it as a move to usurp his kingdom . So the god flew to the sky and communed with his father . Rangi reluctantly agreed to help his son wage a brutal war on his siblings . They were the spirits of winds , storms , and rain . Tāwhirimātea assembled his huge army and set out to conquer his brothers .
Tāwhirimātea first attacked Tāne , and razed his forests , causing Tāne to flee . Next , Tāwhirimātea attacked his brother , Tangaroa , the Sea God . He caused huge storms and waves , spreading panic in Tangaroa . Tangaroa was himself helpless before Tāwhirimātea , as the sea was in such a chaotic rage , harming all living beings . Having never seen such chaos at sea , many of Tangaroa 's children deserted their father and took shelter with Tāne . Since then Tangaroa is at war with Tāne .
Tāwhirimātea pursued his brother , Rongo , and Haumea , the gods of cultivated and uncultivated food , but they were cleverly hidden by their mother , Papa , who still loved her children . Finally , Tāwhirimātea began to fight Tumatuenga .
This time , however , Tumatuenga firmly embedded his feet in the earth , saving him from Tāwhirimātea 's storms . He cast spells , which turned the storms into gentle weather , suitable for humans . But neither brother could prevail against each other . Tāwhirimātea slowly withdrew .
To punish his brothers for cowardice , Tumatuenga invented the arts of hunting , woodcutting , agriculture , cooking , and fishing , to subjugate their respective denizens as food for humans . However , Tumatuenga and Tawhirimatea still fight each other to this day . Another result of the war was that most of the land was submerged into the ocean , because of Tāwhirimātea causing heavy rains and thunderstorms . He was maybe the only brother out of all of them to want their parents together .

KDRW ( 88.7 MHz ) is a non-commercial FM radio station that is licensed to Santa Barbara , California . The station is owned by Santa Monica College and mostly simulcasts KCRW and its public radio format , a mix of news , talk and specialty music programs , some produced by KCRW and some from NPR . However , KDRW also originates some programming locally from its studios on the campus of Antioch University Santa Barbara .
KDRW has an effective radiated power ( ERP ) of 12,000 watts , using HD Radio technology . The transmitter is off Gibraltar Road in Santa Barbara , amid the towers for other local FM and TV stations .
History
In , the station signed on as KSCA . Owned by the University of Southern California ( USC ) , the non-commercial KSCA broadcast classical music programming as a simulcast of KUSC . The call letters changed to KFAC in 1991 , then to KQSC in 2004 .
In February 2014 , public radio station KCRW , based in Santa Monica , California , purchased Santa Barbara classical station KDB for $ 1 million . The acquisition allowed KCRW to extend its reach into the Santa Barbara area . With the Santa Barbara market facing the possible elimination of classical radio programming , USC purchased KDB and that station began relaying KUSC 's programming . Upon closing the transaction on August 27 , 2014 — a deal which also saw KQSC going to KCRW — KQSC changed its call sign to KDRW-FM and began simulcasting KCRW . The station 's call letters changed again on October 1 , 2014 , to simply KDRW .
Unlike a typical repeater station that simply rebroadcasts its parent station 's programming , KDRW offers some locally originated programming . The station 's Santa Barbara studios are located on the campus of Antioch University Santa Barbara . Local news reports are made in cooperation with the Santa Barbara Independent weekly newspaper and a local nonprofit organization specializing in investigative journalism .

William Evans Burton ( 24 September 180410 February 1860 ) was an English actor , playwright , theatre manager and publisher who relocated to the United States .
Life and work
Early life
Born in London on 24 September 1804 , Burton was the son of William George Burton ( 1774–1825 ) , a printer and the author of Research into the religions of the Eastern nations as illustrative of the scriptures in 1805 . Intended for a career in the church , Burton was a pupil at St. Paul 's School in London , an institution associated also with the dramatic names of Robert William Elliston and Charles Mathews . At the age of 18 , in consequence of the death of his father , the youth was called to take charge of the printing office , and also to be the support of a widowed mother . His first effort was to establish a monthly magazine . The attempt was a failure , but it brought him theatrical acquaintances , and under their influence he presently drifted toward the stage .
The first step in his theatrical career , as usual , was to join an amateur dramatic society , and it is said that about this time he gave a performance of Hamlet somewhere on the Strand . In 1825 he was associated with a provincial company acting at Norwich , and elsewhere in England , and he played low comedy . His aspirations at the start were for the tragic , and it is known that late in life he still at times entertained the fancy that nature had intended him to be a tragedian . Burton was one of the funniest creatures that ever lived , but his interior nature was thoughtful and saturnine . He thought , felt , and understood tragedy , but when he came to act , he was all comedian .
At the outset of his career he led the usual life of an itinerant actor . There is a tradition that in the course of his wanderings he once played before George IV at Windsor . After several years in the provinces , he made his first London appearance in 1831 at the Pavilion Theatre as Wormwood in The Lottery Ticket , in which part he was much admired , and which he then acted there upward of fifty consecutive times . John Liston was then the reigning favourite in London ( Joseph Shepherd Munden , who died in 1832 , being in decadence ) , and next to Liston stood John Reeve , upon whom it is thought that the earlier style of Burton was in a measure founded .
In 1832 Burton obtained a chance to show his talents at the Haymarket Theatre—Liston having temporarily withdrawn—and there he played Marall to Edmund Kean as Sir Giles Overreach , and Mrs. Glover as Meg in A New Way to Pay Old Debts , a circumstance which he always remembered , and often mentioned with pride and pleasure . His talents as a writer likewise displayed themselves at an early age . In May 1833 , a play from his pen , called Ellen Wareham , was first presented , and it is mentioned that this piece had the somewhat unusual fortune of being acted at five different theatres of London on the same evening . Burton went on to a large number of plays during his career .
Relocation to the United States
On 10 April 1823 Burton had married Elizabeth Loft , by whom in 1824 he had a son . The marriage was not a success , and partly due to this in 1834 Burton relocated to the United States , where he appeared in Philadelphia as Dr. Ollapod in The Poor Gentleman . He took a prominent place , both as actor and manager , in New York City , Philadelphia and Baltimore , the theatre which he leased in New York being renamed Burton 's Theatre . He was very successful as Captain Cuttle in John Brougham 's dramatisation of Dombey and Son , and in other low comedy parts in plays from Charles Dickens 's novels .

In 1837 in Philadelphia he established the Gentlemen 's Magazine , of which Edgar Allan Poe was for some time the editor . His magazine was intended for a general audience , incorporating the standard fare of poetry and fiction , but had a focus on sporting life like hunting and sailing . For the September 1837 issue Burton wrote an early example of the detective story , 'The Secret Cell ' , detailing a London policeman 's efforts to trace an abducted girl and arrest her kidnappers . Burton likely served as a literary critic himself for the magazine . To remain competitive , the magazine included better paper , more illustrations , and higher-quality printing , making production costs high . Poe became an editor in 1839 , though Burton disliked Poe 's harsh style of criticism . Even so , Poe 's responsibilities increased whenever Burton left town to perform at other venues . It was under Burton that Poe began what has since been termed the `` Longfellow War '' , with Poe using his role as critic to anonymously accuse the popular poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism . Another critic , Willis Gaylord Clark , blamed Burton for allowing these literary attacks , telling Longfellow that Burton was : `` a vagrant from England , who has left a wife and offspring behind him there , and plays the bigamist in this with another wife , and his whore besides ; one who can not write a paragraph in English to save his life '' .
Poe was fired by Burton in June 1840 . Burton and Poe had a tumultuous working relationship . Burton tried selling the magazine without telling Poe , and Poe made plans to launch his own competing Philadelphia-based magazine called The Penn without mentioning it to Burton . Additionally , Burton may have written a particularly scathing negative review of Poe 's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and spread rumours of his drunkenness , which Poe denied . Poe told a friend that Burton was a `` blackguard and a villain . '' Poe 's friend Joseph E. Snodgrass thought Burton 's rumour-mongering was enough for Poe to sue for slander but Poe noted his own name-calling was enough for a countersuit .
Later life
In late 1840 , Burton sold his magazine to George Rex Graham for the price of $ 3,500 ( one dollar for each subscriber ) , who transformed it into Graham 's Magazine . Burton used the money from the sale to renovate his theatre , which eventually failed . Burton went on to become the editor of the Cambridge Quarterly and the Souvenir . He also wrote several books , including a Cyclopaedia of Wit and Humour in 1857 .
Burton died on 10 February 1860 in New York City . At the time of his death , he had collected a library of over 100,000 volumes , especially rich in books by and relating to William Shakespeare . He left his fortune to charity but his wife Elizabeth , from whom he had separated 26 years earlier , arrived from England to claim dower . Judgment initially went against her but after a series of appeals the Supreme Court upheld her claim , thus establishing the rights of an alien to dower in the United States .
William Evans Burton was the father of the English painter William Shakespeare Burton .

Don ‘ t Think About White Monkeys ( `` Не думай про белых обезьян '' ) is a Russian social satirical tragicomedy film , directed by Yuri Mamin . The screenplay was written by Yuri Mamin and Vladimir Vardunas , translated into verse by Vyacheslav Leikin .
The film has a second name : `` Chaldean Face '' , presented in the opening titles ; in contemporary Russian slang , the word `` Chaldean '' ( `` халдей '' ) denotes a greedy lackey .
The form of the film is unusual : all dialogues are in verse accompanied by a strict musical rhythm . The creators of the film define its genre as a tragic farce .
Plot
A hero of our time , the young bartender Vova Smorodin ( Mikhail Tarabukin ) , receives the task of opening a small , but prestigious restaurant called `` Paradise Corner '' from his boss Gavrilych , the father of Vova 's fiancée , Larisa . Perceiving this task as the first step in his financial career , Vova Smorodin develops the magic-touch of enterprise . If he needs to drain and repair the selected basement , he may recall an entire fire brigade from a fire emergency , or a company of soldiers from a mission .
After taking over an empty attic for his office , Vova discovers there three Bohemian artists who have escaped from a mental hospital : the suicidal model Dasha ( Katerina Ksenyeva ) , the alcoholic artist Gena ( Aleksei Devotchenko ) and the mute Buddhist known by the nickname Khu-Pun ' ( Anvar Libabov ) . This meeting becomes a turning point in Vova 's previously confident life . Having realized that the homeless artists could paint appetizing food on the walls of his basement restaurant in exchange for room and board , he allows them to live in his attic . While exploiting their work , Vova does not notice that he begins to fall under the influence of his uninvited guests , discovering for himself a heretofore unknown world of spiritual values .
Gradually , he begins to understand that beauty is not measured by fashion , that love is not limited to sex , that material riches do not replace spiritual enrichment . The artist Gena , who is supposed to draw still lifes , gets caught up in creativity and covers the walls of the basement with frescoes of the Last Judgment - an assembly of hellish monsters and sinners . Vova is shocked ; what will his boss Gavrilych and his fellow waiters say ?
However , the increasing flow of curious tourists convinces Vova that the artist was right . As a result , instead of `` Paradise Corner '' , Vova opens the café `` Inferno '' . Gavrilych 's reaction comes as no surprise ; the boss shows up with a pack of `` Chaldeans '' and destroys all of the artist 's work , tearing down the unique murals from the basement walls . Vova , who tries to prevent the vandalism , is cruelly beaten .
The second half of the film is devoted to Vova 's time in the attic , which he spends with his new friends , who help him to recover and introduce him to a vegetarian diet and to regular meditations on the roof . Vova begins to see strange dreams , where the past and future are intermingled . He begins to understand that his path has been predetermined , and that his future actions , including the betrayal of his friends , have been predicted by someone . And so it happens : unable to withstand the trials of an ascetic lifestyle , Vova ends the relationship with his friends and leaves them defenseless in the face of the cruel Gavrilych .
Vova returns to his usual environment among the `` Chaldeans '' and continues his successful career in the restaurant business .
However , Vova begins to be pursued more and more often by the image of white monkeys , which reminds him of his unsuccessful attempt to become a person of depth , and of the treason he had committed against his friends .

History
`` Do n't Think About White Monkeys '' became Yuri Mamin 's first feature film after a ten-year break . The film company `` Paradise '' was responsible for the distribution of the film . Twenty copies of the film were prepared , only twelve of which ended up in theaters .
According to the film 's creators , `` Do n't Think About White Monkeys '' has been deprived of television publicity due to its sharp satirical spirit . People who measure everything by money are called in the film `` Chaldeans '' , i.e . lackeys , and a financially successful Russian businessman is the subject of ridicule due to his ignorance and primitiveness . The satire of the film , which offends , to some degree , even the television investors and advertisers , is not palatable for the masters of show business in today 's Russia .
The company `` Paradise '' produced the DVDs of the film , which appeared in commercial centers ; unauthorized copies of the DVDs , which appeared on the market simultaneously with the licensed discs , were so successful in sales that the store chain `` Titanic '' named the film a `` sales hit '' in its informational pages for April 2009 . All of the director 's attempts to defend his copyright and to fight with the infringers were by far unsuccessful .
Successful premiere showings of the film took place in Russia , England , the USA , Ukraine , Canada , Germany , France , Italy , Portugal and Lithuania at a number of film festivals .
At the end of April , 2011 , the directors of the Russian Gazette ( `` Rossiyskaya Gazeta '' ) organized the first online film festival `` Double 2 '' , as an alternative to the commercial mass media festivals .
During this film festival , eight films were placed on the Internet for viewers ' judgment and were watched in 56 countries around the world . Russia led in the number of viewers , followed by Germany , the USA , Ukraine , Israel , Great Britain , New Zealand , Canada , France , China , and Sweden . Rounding out this list were Brazil , Ecuador , Egypt , Cameroon , Thailand and Mongolia . The film `` Do n't Think About White Monkeys '' received the grand prize .
International distribution of the film begins in 2011 .
Philosophy
The creators of the film accuse the contemporary commercial mass media in `` dumbing down the world culture and losing the cultural traditions in cinematography '' . They believe that the most prominent `` food for the soul '' in the history of cinema is non-commercial in spirit , such as the films of Andrei Tarkovsky , Luchino Visconti , Michael Cimino , John and Nick Cassavetes , Federico Fellini , Robert Zemeckis , Ingmar Bergman and Oliver Stone .
`` Do n't Think About White Monkeys '' is not only social satire , but also a film about love , about the search for the meaning of life and the ways of men , about treachery , and about `` white monkeys , '' which symbolize human conscience . The main theme of the film is the eternal dichotomic struggle between business and spirituality ; a person whose life is dedicated only to the material , and not to spiritual enrichment , can not truly be happy , because his world is narrow and his soul is deprived of beauty .
The official website recommends the film to `` all young people , punks , rockers , non-conformists , Buddhists , students and those who have not lost the ability to think and feel '' and does n't recommend it to the `` fans of the official mass cinema films , of pop culture films , of fast-food films ; and also the Chaldeans '' .
Actress Katerina Ksenyeva , who played the leading female role , received a blessing for the film from the Dalai Lama in India , along with her friend , Tibetan monk Tenchoe . Film director Yuri Mamin is a member of the International Tibet Support Network and also received a blessing from envoys of the Dalai Lama in Saint Petersburg , Russia . The Dalai Lama 's envoys said that the film is very relevant in our difficult times for the whole world and contains the energy of enlightenment , which affirms the power of kindness and mercy over the desires of the `` masters of life '' for money grubbing and barbarity .
English version
Ray Gillon , the renown British sound producer , liked the film very much and offered to dub it into English . In his words , there have been very few films in recent times that have touched his soul as much as this powerful parable in verse . Because of this , a poetic English translation was made for dubbing the film in London . For the first time in history , a Russian film in verse will be dubbed into English verse .

Humphrey Fenn ( died 1634 ) , was an English puritan divine .
Life
Fenn was matriculated as sizar of Queens ' College , Cambridge , on 12 November 1568 , and graduated B.A . in 1573 . He migrated to Peterhouse , and graduated M.A . in 1576 . In the same year he began his ministry at Northampton , and at once got into trouble for his nonconformity , and was committed to gaol . The inhabitants of Northampton petitioned Queen Elizabeth for his release , giving him a high character as a preacher and a loyal subject .
On 21 Feb. 1578 he succeeded Anthony Fletcher as vicar of Holy Trinity , Coventry , and became a prominent man in the party headed by Thomas Cartwright ( 1535–1603 ) . At the request of the London puritans he accompanied the Earl of Leicester to represent their grievances to the queen . On the issue of Whitgift 's three articles ( 1583 ) , he refused to subscribe . He was cited to Lambeth ( 1584 ) , and suspended . An account of his examination is given by Brook , from Roger Morrice 's manuscript . His place was taken by ‘ one Griffen , a Welchman , ' between whom and Fenn , according to the manuscript city annals , there was ‘ a great contention ' for the vicarage in 1584 or 1585 . Fenn was restored to his vicarage shortly after 14 July 1585 , through the intercession of Leicester . But in 1590 he was again suspended , owing to the active part which he took in the ‘ associations ' of the Warwickshire puritan divines , was committed to the Fleet by the high commission , with Cartwright and others , and , refusing the purgation by oath , was deprived .
His successor , Richard Eaton , was instituted on 12 Jan. 1591 . On 13 May Fenn and his companions were brought before the Star-chamber . Articles , dealing mainly with their ‘ book of discipline , ' were exhibited against them . They denied that in their ‘ associations ' they exercised any jurisdiction , or meddled with sedition . Fenn ‘ seemed more stiff than Cartwright . ' The Star-chamber remanded them without bail . James VI of Scotland interceded ( 12 June ) for their release ; on 4 Dec. they petitioned for bail ; Fenn 's signature stands second in the list , immediately after Cartwright 's . In April 1592 they again petitioned for release , this time successfully . ( Leicester 's letter of thanks is dated 21 May . )
Fenn returned to Coventry , and resumed his ministry , probably preaching only on week-days . On 24 April 1624 ‘ Mr . Humphrey Fenn , preacher , ' was appointed to the Sunday lectureship at St. John the Baptist 's ( Bablake ) . This was a new lectureship ; the church , which had been in ruins , was repaired in 1608 , and a week-day lectureship established in favour of John Oxenbridge . In 1626 or soon after ‘ old Mr. Fenn ' joined with the mayor and leading citizens in inviting Samuel Clarke ( 1599–1683 ) , the martyrologist , to become a lecturer at Coventry . This is the last notice of Fenn . Tong says that he ‘ spent above forty years ' with the Coventry people ; we must correct this to ‘ above fifty , ' even if we deduct his enforced absences . He died early in 1633–4 , and was buried on 8 Feb. in Holy Trinity churchyard , Coventry . He seems to have had a son and grandson of the same name .
His will , made in 1631 , was prefaced by ‘ so full and so open a protestation against the hierarchy and the ceremonies , that the prelatical party would not suffer it to be put among the records of the court when the will was tendred to be proved ' ( Clark , in Life of Julines Herring ) . On 21 Feb. 1634 a copy of the introduction to the will of ‘ Humphrey Fen the eldest ' was received by Archbishop Laud from the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield . This preamble ( only ) was printed as ‘ The Last Will and Testament with the Profession of Faith of Humphrey Fenn , ' & c. , 1641 , sm . 8vo ( no place of printing ) .

François Vatable ( late 15th century – 16 March 1547 ) was a French humanist scholar , a hellenist and hebraist .
Life
Born in Gamaches , Picardy , he was for a time rector of Bramet in Valois . In 1530 Francis I of France appointed him as one of his Royal Lecturers in what afterwards became known as the Collège de France . Vatable got the chair of Hebrew . At a later date a royal grant conferred upon Vatable the title of Abbot of Bellozane , with the benefices attached thereto . Vatable is regarded as the restorer of Hebrew scholarship in France , and his lectures in Paris attracted a large audience including Jews . He was known by his immense erudition , his gift of communication , his talent as a teacher and the support of his listeners . His work is not very extensive , but very admired .
Vatable died in Paris .
Work
Vatablus published no works of his own , but in his early years ( 1518 onwards as an assistant to Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples ) he procured new Latin translations and editions from the Greek works by The Philosopher , as Aristotle was known . These works were inquiries in physics , human and animal nature , psychology , astronomy , and meteorology ( Physica , De caelo , De anima , De generatione et corruptione , Meteorologica , and the so-called Parva naturalia ( minor tracts on physical phenomena ) ) . These became standard textbooks of Universities throughout Europe .
As a Royal lecturer he actively participated in the edition of a better text of the different Books of the Bible . He procured Hebrew editions for scholarly use ( published by Robert Estienne , or in English Robert Stephens ) . To the edition of the Minor Prophets he added the commentary of the famous Jewish Rabbi David Kimhi . From the lecture notes taken by Vatable 's pupils , Robert Estienne also drew material for the scholia which he added to his edition of the Latin Bible in two columns , juxtaposing the new Latin translation of the Zurich Bible by Leo Jud to the standard Latin text of the Vulgate . Afterwards the Sorbonne doctors sharply inveighed against the Lutheran tendencies of some of the notes in Estienne 's Bible . By then Vatable had already died . The notes in Estienne 's Bible are a model of clear , concise literary , and critical exegesis . The Salamanca theologians , with the authorization of the Spanish Inquisition , issued a new thoroughly-revised edition of them in their Latin Bible of 1584 .
From the edition of 1729 which Jacques Paul Migne republished in his Scripturae sacrae cursus completus ( 1841 ) , the scholia on the Book of Esdras and Book of Nehemiah . The notes on the Psalms , published separately in 1545 were re-edited ( and augmented ) in Estienne 's Liber Psalmorum Davidis ( 1557 ) , published in Geneva . These were reprinted together with remarks of Hugo Grotius , by Vogel , under the misleading title : Francisci Vatabli annotationes in Psalmos ( 1767 ) .

John Barnard ( born c. 1661–2 ; floruit 1685–93 ) was a supporter of James II of England .
Barnard was the son of Dr. John Barnard , fellow of Lincoln College , Oxford , and sometime rector of Waddington , near Lincoln , by Lettice , daughter of Dr. Peter Heylyn . He became a student of Lincoln College ( matriculating 17 November 1676 at the age of fifteen ) , and was elected fellow of Brasenose College ( being then B.A . ) in 1682 . This date ( which we learn from Anthony à Wood ) gives us 1661–2 for the date of his birth . He proceeded afterwards to holy orders in the church of England .
According to Wood , in December 1685 , after James II 's accession , Barnard ‘ took all occasions to talk at Bal . coffee house on behalf of popery . ' Later he declared himself a papist , and took the name of Joh . Augustine Barnard ( or Bernard ) ‘ protected by the king ' ( May 1686 ) , ‘ for what he should do or omit . ' He was ‘ dispenc 'd ' ‘ from going to common prayer , rarely to sacrament . ' On 3 January 1686–7 ‘ came a mandamus from the king that he should succeed Mr. —— Halton , of Queen 's College [ Oxford ] , in the [ White 's ] moral philosophy lecture . ' On 28 March 1687 he was elected and admitted moral philosophy reader . In October 1688 he left the university , and soon afterwards sent in his resignation of his fellowship at Brasenose upon a forethought ‘ that the Prince of Orange would turn the scales , as he did . ' He likewise resigned the moral philosophy lecture 5 January 1688–9 . He is found in Ireland with King James when he landed there . He was ‘ taken notice of ' by his majesty , who ‘ talk 'd familiarly with him . ' In September 1690 he returned from Ireland and came to Chester , ‘ poor and bare . ' He was reconciled to the church of England , ‘ as 't is said , ' and was ‘ maintain 'd with dole for some time by the Bishop of Chester ( Stratford ) . '
Wood states that he ‘ wrote some little things that were printed . ' His only known literary performance was that he ‘ continued , corrected , and enlarged , with great additions throughout , ' the ‘ great Geographical Dictionary of Edmund Bohun , Esq . ' ( 1693 , folio ) , and placed before it ‘ A Reflection upon the Grand Dictionary Historique , or the Great Historical Dictionary of Lewis Morery , D.D. , printed at Utrecht 1692 . ' The date of his death is unrecorded .

Jamaica Hills is a small middle class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens . The neighborhood is surrounded by Hillcrest ( at the Grand Central Parkway to the north ) , Jamaica Estates ( at Homelawn Street , a continuation of Utopia Parkway , to the east ) , Jamaica ( at Hillside Avenue to the south ) , and Briarwood ( at Parsons Boulevard to the west ) . It is centered on the terminal moraine which runs the length of Long Island . Originally populated with people who left neighborhoods under ethnic transition , Jamaica Hills started to become more ethnically diverse after 1964 . The population today is very mixed with a large South Asian population and smaller populations from the Caribbean , Central America , and China . Because of the opening of a Greek Orthodox church in the 1960s , many Greek immigrants also live in the area . Jamaica Hills is patrolled by the New York City Police Department 's 107th Precinct .

USS Volunteer ( SP-207 ) was the proposed name and designation of a civilian motorboat considered for United States Navy service as a patrol vessel in World War I but never acquired by the Navy .
Volunteer was a wooden-hulled motorboat built in 1906 at East Boothbay , Maine . The U.S. Navy inspected her during the summer of 1918 for possible World War I duty as a patrol vessel with the section patrol , and she was assigned the section patrol boat number SP-207 . However , the Navy apparently never acquired her .
The 1918 Naval Vessel Register listed Volunteer as a `` water boat '' and indicated that she was commissioned in the Navy on 23 August 1918 . However , that information is probably erroneous for two reasons . First , the 1919 edition of the Naval Vessel Register indicated that she was `` not taken over , '' and she is not listed in the lists of vessels assigned to naval districts found in the 1918 and 1919 issues of the Navy Directory . Second , there was another USS Volunteer ( ID-3242 ) during World War I , a collier which served in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service in 1918 and 1919 and was commissioned on 23 August 1918 . It seems likely that the compilers of the 1918 Naval Vessel Register confused the two ships and that Volunteer ( SP-207 ) never saw service with the Navy .

Valadi is a zone in Trichy city located on 5 miles from Chathram Bus Terminus in Trichy , Tamil Nadu along the Trichy-Chennai railway . Its size and importance today is much lesser than its status in the pre-independence era , due to massive emigration over the last few decades in search for better career , and its diaspora numbering a few thousands is spread all across the world .
Economy
Valadi is a primarily agricultural economy and is located in the fertile rice belt of Trichy-Thanjavur region . The presence of the river Kaveri in the region and its supporting canals like Kollidam made three crops a year possible and hence the region became prosperous . One of the first major dams in history , Kallanai built by the Chola king Karikala cholan around 2000 years ago is located few miles from this place . Many of inhabitants also find work in the nearby places of Lalgudi , and with the economic boom in India , there has been a growth in the service industry too . A number of expensive houses have started to come in this region both out of the economic growth and
the investment from the diaspora is yet to come due to the long distance from the major financial centers like Chennai and Bangalore .
Places of worship
The old Shiva temple , Vishwanathasamy temple , and the native goddess abode of Shri Ulaganayaki temple are the main places of worship in Valadi . The Lakshminarayana swamy temple is the key highlight to Keezha Valadi . There is also the Keezha Sivan Kovil that was visited and worshipped by Mahaperiyaval Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi Swamigal . The famous Vishnu temple of Ranganathaswamy temple , Ganesh temple at Rockfort and the Shiva temple at Thiruvanaikaval are all located in a 5-mile radius from Valadi . Also the famous Lord Sri Muthumariyamman Temple is located in Kavalkara Street & Also one of the oldest Temple of Elamanadichi Amman Temple with big water tank is located at Thathanoor kallar street Valadi .
Also the famous Lord Goddess Prithyunga Devi temple is located in Sempalani Street .
Valadi is known for its tradition building and temples . Even the bus stop of Valadi is Known as Shivan kovil stop . Shiva temple is well known temple which is near the road and yearly we do have some festivals .
Cultural Wealth
Valadi is a place of great cultural heritage ; It was the home of many great musicians and scholars . Valadi Krishnaiyer , Lalgudi Jayaraman , V. Seshasayee are some of the natives of Valadi .
Transport
Valadi is a few miles from Trichy airport that services national and international flights . It has frequent flights to Chennai and the flight time is around 30 mins . From the airport , a taxi cab should cost around Rs.250 ( $ 5 ) .
By Train , the closest station is Lalgudi that services a lot of regional trains and almost all major trains operating in the region ( Rockfort Express , Guruvayur Express , Rameswaram Express , Pallavan Express , Mangalore express ) stop at Srirangam and from there you could get a local bus or an autorickshaw . Typical journey time from the station is less than 30 mins . From Chennai , the total time is approximately 7 hours .
By Bus , you can reach Trichy Central bus stand ( or ) Junction from any place in Tamil Nadu , and from there you could take a city bus towards Lalgudi . Alternatively , you could go to Chathram Bus Stand and it has frequent bus services to Valadi . For people coming from north of Trichy , the buses generally stop in tollgate , and you could take an autorickshaw for around Rs.50 .
Now it has the long bridge over the railway track , which makes the people easy to travel without waiting for the train . Now we also could see the lot of call taxi , autorickshaws , mini tempo which are accessible anytime .
Bank , Post Office , school and railway station
This is one of the very few villages which has post office and Bank . It also has the automated teller machine outside the bank . People can use this ATM during the bank official hours .
Post office is also used by the other nearby villages , which is big help for the neighboring villages .
There is a Government Higher secondary school and railway station where the local passenger trains stop .

Children of Heracles ( , Hērakleidai ; also translated as Herakles ' Children and Heracleidae ) is an Athenian tragedy by Euripides that was first performed c. 430 BC . It follows the children of Heracles ( known as the Heracleidae ) as they seek protection from Eurystheus . It is the first of two surviving tragedies by Euripides where the children of Heracles are suppliants ( the second being Heracles ) .
Background
Eurystheus was responsible for many of the troubles of Heracles . In order to prevent the children of Heracles from taking revenge on him , he sought to kill them . They flee under the protection of Iolaus , Heracles ' close friend and nephew .
Plot synopsis
The play begins at the altar of Zeus at Marathon . The herald Copreus , in the employ of King Eurystheus of Mycenae , attempts to seize the children of Heracles , together with Heracles 's old friend , Iolaus . When King Demophon , son of Theseus , insists that Iolaus and Heracles 's children are under his protection , Copreus threatens to return with an army . Demophon is prepared to protect the children even at the cost of fighting a war against Eurystheus , but after consulting the oracles , he learns that the Athenians will be victorious only if they sacrifice a maiden of noble birth to Persephone . Demophon tells Iolaus that as much as he would like to help , he will not sacrifice his own child or force any of the Athenians to do so . Iolaus , realizing that he and the children will have to leave Athens and seek refuge elsewhere , despairs .
When Macaria , a daughter of Heracles , hears about the oracle 's pronouncement and realizes her family 's predicament , she offers herself as the victim , refusing a lottery . Bidding farewell to her siblings and to Iolaus , she leaves to be sacrificed . At the same time , Hyllus arrives with reinforcements . Although Iolaus is old and feeble , he insists on going out to the battle . Once there , he miraculously regains his youth and captures Eurystheus . A debate about executing him follows . Alcmene , Heracles 's aged mother , insists that Eurystheus be executed at once , though such an execution is against Athenian law . Finally , Eurystheus tells them a prophecy of how his spirit will protect the city from the descendants of Heracles 's children if they slay and bury him , and so it is done .

The Pearl District is an area of Portland , Oregon , formerly occupied by warehouses , light industry and railroad classification yards and now noted for its art galleries , upscale businesses and residences . The area has been undergoing significant urban renewal since the mid-1980s when it was reclassified as mixed use from industrial , including the arrival of artists , the removal of a viaduct and construction of the Portland Streetcar . It now consists of industrial building conversion to offices , high-rise condominiums and warehouse-to-loft conversions .
The increase of high-rise condominiums and warehouse-to-loft conversions was made evident with the construction of the Cosmopolitan on the Park building , which opened in Summer 2016 . The Cosmopolitan on the Park residential building is now the tallest building in the Pearl District and the 8th tallest building in Portland , contributing to the changing Portland skyline .
Geography and features
The area is located just northwest of downtown between West Burnside Street on the south , the Willamette River on the north , NW Broadway on the east and the Interstate 405 freeway on the west .
The area is home to several Portland icons , including Powell 's City of Books . The former Weinhard Brewery , which operated continuously from 1864 to September 1999 , was shut down by Stroh 's upon the purchase of the Weinhard 's brand by Miller Brewing and sold for redevelopment as the Brewery Blocks .
There are art galleries and institutions such as the Elizabeth Leach Gallery and Blue Sky Gallery ( many who stage monthly receptions ) , boutiques , and restaurants abound , and also a number of small clubs and bars , a combination that has led to Pearl District being named one of the 15 coolest neighborhoods in the world in 2016 .
The United States Post Office main processing facility for all of Oregon and southwestern Washington was built in the Pearl District in 1964 , next to Union Station . This location was chosen in order for the post office to be able to better serve towns outside the Portland metro area .
The district is part of Multnomah County 's District 1 , Oregon Metro 's 5th district , Oregon 's 33rd House district , Oregon 's 17th Senate district and Oregon 's 1st congressional district .
Parks
The district includes most of the historic North Park Blocks ( 1869 ) , as well as three public plazas :
Jamison Square ( 2002 ) is built around a fountain which simulates a tidal pool that is periodically filled by artificial waterfalls and then drained into grating .
Tanner Springs Park ( 2005 ) is a re-created natural area featuring wetlands , a walking trail , and creek .
The Fields Park ( 2013 ) is a Neighborhood and Dog Park in the Northern part of the Pearl . The Park provides space for visual or performing arts , for community-building activities and has a large paved walking loop .
History
The area was formerly used for warehousing , light industrial purposes and a railroad yard .
The Pearl District was first named in print in March 1987 , in an article titled “ The Pearl District ” by Terry Hammond in The Rose Arts Magazine , a free local periodical in Portland . Marty Smith uncovered the origin story and corrected rumors in his humorous Dr. Know column in Willamette Week in January 2014 . “ Hammond says he wrote it with the express purpose of getting the name to stick. ” He “ stumped hard ” for the name in the neighborhood while selling ads and distributing the paper .
At the time , the city was calling the area the Triangle , though the NW Triangle Planning District explicitly referred only to the railroad yards on the far side of NW Lovejoy Street . The NW Triangle Business Association for the area was calling it the Triangle , too , but found the name unsatisfactory , and recognized other options , like the Brewery District and others . An article in The Rose Arts Magazine presented the alternate names , and argued `` The Pearl District '' was best to refer to the treasury of art and artists inhabiting the interiors of so many of the crusty warehouses . The article included photos of the area and a map , and profiled individual artists with studios in several of the warehouses , including photographer Hiroshi Iwaya , glass artist Liz Mapelli , sculptor Martin Eichinger , ceramic artist Geoffrey Pagen , and silkscreen printers Elizabeth Harris and Russ Mahler .
Terry Hammond acknowledged in an endnote that the name `` the Pearl '' originated from Thomas Augustine of the Augustine Gallery , then located at NW 13th & Hoyt St . He tracked the progress of the name over the next two years , and reported in October 1989 the identity of the Pearl District “ is now firmly established , ” when he found investors adopted the name . The second Rose Arts article reported a brochure for the newly remodeled Irving Street Lofts , formerly the McKesson Building , named the area “ Portland 's emerging Pearl District. ” The building was the first converted warehouse up to code for residences .
The second news story showed another map of the district with 37 numbered locations indicating special events organized by local artists and businesses for the third annual Pearl Arts Festival . The editor gave the following series of Pearl landmarks : ( a ) Victoria Frey of Quartersaw Gallery , 528 NW 12th Ave. , was enthusiastic about the name , and organized the first annual Pearl Arts Festival in September 1987 , six months after the initial article ; like others , she had not heard the name before , ( b ) Sunset Magazine picked up the story in January 1988 , and adopted the name in quotation marks in the title as the `` Pearl District , '' ( c ) The Oregonian daily newspaper first adopted the name in September 1988 , at the time of the second annual Pearl Arts Festival , following the original Pearl District article in The Rose Arts Magazine with a map and profiles of some of the same artists , ( d ) Investors adopted the name in promotional materials as converted warehouses turned residential , starting in 1989 .
In the 1990s , the Lovejoy Viaduct , an elevated portion of NW Lovejoy Street from the Broadway Bridge past NW 10th Avenue was demolished , opening dozens of surrounding blocks ( including some brownfield sites ) for development , which peaked in the 2000s . The viaduct was notable for the Lovejoy Columns , painted by a railroad watchman who worked below ; two of them have been saved . The increasing density has attracted a mix of restaurants , brewpubs , shops , and art galleries . The movie Drugstore Cowboy ( 1989 ) , by Gus Van Sant , has several scenes shot in the neighborhood .

Harper 's Choice is one of the ten villages that comprise Columbia , Maryland , United States . It lies in the northwest part of Columbia and consists of the neighborhoods of Longfellow , Swansfield , and Hobbit 's Glen and had a December 1998 population of 8,695 .
Etymology
Harper 's Choice is named after Robert Goodloe Harper , a South Carolina representative who relocated to Baltimore to practice law . He was part of the Federalist mobs that stabbed , tarred and feathered British loyalists in Baltimore in June 1812 . Harper later served in the War of 1812 , Maryland State Senate , and United States Senate . He lived on his Oakland estate in the Roland Park area , where he was buried , although his grave was later moved to Baltimore 's Greenmount Cemetery .
The Longfellow community was named for the American poet , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and the street names are taken from his works . Hobbit 's Glen was taken from the works of English author J. R. R. Tolkien , along with the street names . Swansfield 's name was inspired by the etching The Swan by James McNeill Whistler , and the street names derive from the works of Winslow Homer .
History
The majority of Harper 's Choice is built on the original Carroll slave plantation tract Doughoregan Manor . The Harper family farm `` Jericho '' was built on a portion of the estate , and sold by the Harper family between 1962 and 1964 to the Rouse Company before the announcement of the Columbia project . Clarence Bassler sold 63 acres of his farm in 1963 , with George Bassler selling 140 the next year , retaining land for the Harper 's Choice Village Center .
Home sites were sold by Howard Research and Development ( Rouse ) to larger homebuilders . Levitt & Sons , known for building Levittown , New York , bought land for over 600 units but halted construction in 1970 at 151 homes due to code violations . In August 1971 , Harper 's Choice Village Center opened with housing above shops . In 1978 , the village suffered from a string of arson attacks , including 26 in a two-day period from a local resident . By the 1990s , the village center shops were in decline with little investment from the Rouse Company . In 2004 , MS-13 gang activity was reported in the neighborhood .
In 2007 , a study determined that the Middle Patuxent Environmental Area of the Patuxent River was `` fair to poor biological conditions and only partial support of habitat conditions '' from runoff related to development in the Hobbit 's Glen area . The Middle Patuxent Environmental Foundation was formed to study the issue in 2015 with a $ 38,000 Watershed Assistance Grant Program .
Services
The Harper 's Choice Village Center has a grocery store , banks , restaurants , and other retail establishments . The community center , Kahler Hall , was named in 1971 for the William C. Kahler family , who sold a portion of their farm in November 1962 followed later by the remaining 280 acres . The original name for the village center was `` Joseph Square '' , named for John Joseph , chairperson of the first Harper 's Choice Village Board . In 1974 , Peg Zabawa opened the landmark Mrs. Z 's restaurant in an abandoned Wawa Inc. facility . The restaurant closed after burning in 1979 .
The Florence Bain Senior Center in the Swansfield neighborhood , opened in 1983 and was renovated in 2005 . It is named for Florence Bain , whose son Henry worked on Rouse 's original work group . She started the local AARP chapter and was the first chairperson of Howard County 's Commission on Aging . Winter Growth/Ruth Keeton House , offering an assisted living program , is located next to the Senior Center . It is named for the former council member , Ruth U. Keeton .
Athletic facilities
The Athletic Club , one of Columbia 's three athletic facilities , is located in Swansfield . An 18-hole par 72 golf course is located in Hobbit 's Glen , which also includes tennis courts and a pool . Originally named `` Jericho '' , the Harper family requested Rouse not to use the name of their family farm . The Columbia SportsPark , an 18-hole miniature golf course , batting cages , and skate park is located in the Harper 's Choice village center .
An extensive walking/biking trail connects the neighborhoods .

Millepora complanata , commonly known as blade fire coral , is a species of fire coral in the family Milleporidae . It is found in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea where it is a common species . The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of `` least concern '' .
Description
Fire corals are colonial coral-like organisms that secrete calcareous skeletons . Colonies of Millepora complanata have an encrusting base and thin upright plates or blades growing to a height of about . The plates of Millepora complanata grow perpendicular to the current direction , with some colonies not growing larger than the encrusted base if the current is too strong . The surface of the blades is smooth and the outer margins irregular , with many stumpy protrusions . This fire coral is pale brown or cream coloured , with white tips to the blades . The feeding and defensive polyps are hair-like and project through fine pores on the surface of the blades . Contact with this fire coral by bare skin can cause a severe stinging sensation .
Distribution and habitat
Millepora complanata has a widespread distribution in the Caribbean Sea and is a relatively common species on reefs in shallow water at depths down to about . It often grows in areas with vigorous water movement and turbid waters , and is tolerant of siltation .
Biology
Some of the polyps of Millepora complanata are dactylozooids with hair-like processes and stinging cells that detect the presence of zooplankton and help entrap it . The nematocyst in the dactylozooid is discharged and injects venom into the prey , all within three milliseconds . Other polyps are gastrozooids and their chief function is the ingestion of food for the colony . Copepods form the main part of the diet . The soft tissues of M. complanata contain zooxanthellae , symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates . These provide much of the organic carbon needed by the fire coral . The M. complanata can feed during both day and night , but tend to feed mostly at night .
The reproduction of fire corals is complex and involves an alternation of asexual and sexual generations . The encrusting parts of the coral expand by the growth of stolons , and the edges of blades expand by sympodial growth . Sexual reproduction involves a sessile polyploid stage and the budding off of planktonic medusae . Broken off fragments of coral blades can successfully reattach to the substrate and M. complanata is one of the first coral species to recolonise damaged reefs .
Millepora complanata is susceptible to coral bleaching , a process by which stressed corals expel their zooxanthellae and turn white . In a mass bleaching event in the Caribbean in 1998 caused by thermal stress , both M. complanata and the closely related Millepora alcicornis were affected but M. alcicornis more severely so . Many colonies were killed but some , especially colonies of M. complanata , recovered and regained their colour over the course of a few months .

KC Accidental were a Canadian post-rock band from Toronto , Ontario , Canada . The band released two albums of mostly instrumental music . It later evolved into Broken Social Scene .
History
KC Accidental was formed in 1998 , and started out as a two-person recording project consisting of Kevin Drew and Charles Spearin . The `` KC '' in the band 's name was taken from the initials of their first names . The pair began recording in a home studio ; their debut album Captured Anthems for an Empty Bathtub was sold by Drew and Spearin exclusively through one shop in 1998 and quickly sold out .
The group released a second album in 2000 entitled Anthems for the Could 've Bin Pills on Noise Factory Records . It included contributions from Jason Collett , Evan Cranley , Emily Haines , Jason McKenzie , Jessica Moss , James Payment , Bill Priddle , James Shaw and Justin Small . Many of these musicians went on to work with Drew and Spearin in Broken Social Scene , who released their debut album , Feel Good Lost on Noise Factory in 2001 .
As a reference to the earlier group , Broken Social Scene included a song titled `` KC Accidental '' on its Juno Award-winning album You Forgot It in People .
The two albums by KC Accidental , long time out of print and out of reach , were reissued by Arts & Crafts on 2CD/2LP format and digitally in 2010 .
On June 21 , 2013 , KC Accidental performed a new 15-minute song entitled `` Summer Withdrawal '' live at Jason Collett 's Courtyard Revue in Toronto . It was the first time the band had performed in 13 years . A year later on June 20 , 2014 , KC Accidental reconvened for a full live show at the North by Northeast festival .

August Richter ( August 9 , 1831 – June 7 , 1907 ) was an American real estate agent from Milwaukee , Wisconsin who served a single one-year term as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly .
Background
Richter was born in Gunzenhausen , Kingdom of Bavaria on August 9 , 1831 ; he was educated at the höhere bürgerschule level . He left Bavaria in 1852 , came to Wisconsin in 1856 , settled in Milwaukee and for some years ran a meat market . He shifted his business to that of real estate agent , in the latter years of his career specializing in timberlands in Michigan and northern Wisconsin , particularly Oneida County , Wisconsin .
He married Marie Sauber ; their son August Jr. , born August 1 , 1861 , would become a prominent real estate dealer ; and would serve on the Milwaukee Common Council and the Milwaukee Board of School Directors .
Public office
In 1866 , he was elected to the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors ; but an 1867 ruling of the Wisconsin Supreme Court nullified the results of that election , and he was one of four members removed from the Board . A new election was held in the fall , and he was elected once more to represent the Second Ward of the City of Milwaukee . In 1869 he was elected chair of the County Board .
In 1870 he was elected to the Assembly 's 2nd Milwaukee County district ( the Second Ward of the City ) as a Democrat , with 597 votes to 517 for Independent John Orth ( the Democratic incumbent George Abert was not a candidate ) .
In 1871 , Abert was the Democratic nominee . Richter ran anyway as an `` Independent Democrat '' , but garnered only 227 votes to Abert 's 569 . Richter would attempt once more in 1873 to regain his seat in the Assembly , running against Joseph Hamilton as an Independent when Hamilton , like most Democrats , was a member of the short-lived People 's Reform Party , also known as the Liberal Reform Party . He polled only 161 votes to Hamilton 's 1,277 . After this defeat , he retreated from competition for public office .
Later years
Richter became an active member of Milwaukee 's Old Settlers Club . He lived in his later years with his son August Jr. , and died in that home on June 7 , 1907 .

Sawtry Village Academy ( formerly Sawtry Community College ) is a mixed secondary school and sixth form located in the village of Sawtry , Cambridgeshire a short distance from Peterborough .
Sawtry Community College converted to academy status in April 2015 and was renamed Sawtry Village Academy . The school is now part of the Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust ( CMAT ) .
Management
The current principal is Sarah Wilson , who is assisted by Deputy Principal Simon Parsons and five assistant principals . Wilson was appointed following the resignation of the previous principal , James Stewart . Stewart left the school in summer 2014 after a critical Ofsted report , and was subsequently arrested over allegations of fraud . In October 2017 , Stewart was convicted of four counts of fraud and one of misconduct in a public office . Stewart used £85,000 of school funds to pay off personal debts , £6,000 of school funds to cover household bills , and aided and abetted vice-principal Alan Stevens to commit fraud . During the trial , the court heard that Stewart would routinely lock himself in his office—which he refurbished at the expense of the school which cost thousands of pounds—where he had `` a private phone line installed to place bets with bookmaker William Hill , and [ would ] watch horse racing on TV . '' His office also contained sex toys , condoms , lubricants and alcohol . Stewart was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment by Mr Justice Stuart Bridge at Huntingdon Law Courts . In February 2019 , Simon Parsons was appointed Head teacher of Sawtry Village Academy after the previous principal , Sarah Wilson , was appointed as CMAT Executive Principal .
Tutoring System
The school made a decision to change to a Vertical Tutoring System in 2009 , this system was originally split into 6 houses but for September 2015 these were reduced to 4 main school houses and 1 sixth form house , to reflect the falling intake of the school . The school implemented the CMAT set of Academy Pledges which students are expected to complete during the course of their time at the academy , at Bronze , Silver and Gold levels . Pledges are an awards system which offers students a range of character building opportunities that enhance their learning and development .

In 2017–18 season , he averaged 11.1 points , 4.6 assists and 2.8 rebounds over 31 domestic league games . Also , in 21 games of the regional ABA League Second Division , he averaged 15.7 points , 5.1 assists , and 3.1 rebounds per game .
In August 2019 , Đoković signed back a two-year contract for FMP . In July 2020 , he signed one year deal with the Croatian team Split . In September 2021 , Đoković signed with Borac Čačak .
National team career
Đoković was a member of Serbia national U18 team that won silver at the 2014 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship .
Đoković represented the Serbian men 's university basketball team at the 2017 Universiade held in Taiwan . In the tournament , Serbia was defeated by the United States in the semifinal game and eventually lost in the bronze-medal game to Latvia with 81–74 . The Basketball Federation of Serbia stated that a total of 24 talented young players refused to play for the Universiade Team Serbia , the highest in history . However , despite many refusals to represent Serbia , the weakened roster made big success by getting the fourth place in the tournament . Đoković was invited in the last minutes to form the latest spot and eventually was one of the team leaders .
In November 2017 , Đoković was invited by the senior national team head coach Aleksandar Đorđević to represent Serbia in the 2019 World Cup qualifications . He made debut for the senior national team on 25 November 2017 , in a game against Austria .

Prelux are commercial chicken crossbreeds of the Slovenian origin , that are being sold under the eponymous trademark by the Biotechnical Faculty of University of Ljubljana . The name is an abbreviation for the Slovenian phrase prevojski luxuriranci , with a word luxuriranci referring to luxuriance ( heterosis ) or outbreeding enhancement of hybrid offspring , and adjective prevojski referring to the Slovenian settlement Prevoje , where selective breeding was once performed . This name was given to quality layer hens , that are being obtained by crossbreeding three Slovenian traditional breeds of layer hens ; Slovenian Barred , Slovenian Brown and Slovenian Silver Hen . The most known and best-selling layer hens of the trademark Prelux are Prelux-Č , Prelux-G and Prelux-R. A part of the selection is also a meat type chicken ( broiler ) , Prelux-BRO .
Breeding
Commercial chickens of the trademark Prelux are being selected , grown and then sold further to mostly Slovenian customers on the PRC for Poultry Breeding of Department of Animal Science , Biotechnical Faculty of Ljubljana . Prelux chickens are two-breed hybrids , obtained from a parent flock of three Slovenian traditional breeds ; Slovenian Barred , Slovenian Brown and Slovenian Silver . Those three breeds are being crossbred in various combinations , depending on a parent 's breed and sex . The meat type Prelux , which is a hybrid of multiple different breeds , is a result of crossbreeding Slovenian heavier breeds in a special sequence . Prelux chickens are usually not meant for further reproduction , since such hybrids do not pass plumage colouration to their offspring , which are consequently covered with feathers of various shades .
Importance
Nowadays poultry breeders more often use commercial crossbred chickens instead of purebred and original chicken breeds . These animals are either crossbreeds of different purebred breeds either line crossbreeds – a result of pairing different chicken lines ( homogeneous groups inside breeds ) . Commercial chickens are popular because of their usability ; often they have a higher production yield , and it is relatively easy to breed them in different modes of intensive farming ( including free-run , free-range and enriched ( battery ) cages , as well as other alternative modes ) . Feature of Slovenian Prelux layer hens are also autosex chicks , that enable any breeder to determine animal 's biological sex at the age of just one day . Autosex chicks have sex-dependant plumage colouration or different feathering speed .
Types
The selection of Prelux chicken types includes the most widespread layer hens Prelux-Č , Prelux-G , Prelux-R and slightly less common Prelux-M. A part of the Prelux selection is also a chicken of heavy or meat type , broiler Prelux-BRO .
Prelux-Č
Prelux-Č ( prelux črna and črni prelux in Slovenian , Prelux Black and Black Prelux in English ) is a type of commercial layer crossbreed . It is a hybrid between a hen of the Slovenian Barred Hen and a rooster of the Slovenian Brown Hen . Animals of the Black Pelux have shiny black plumage with shades of brown on their neck . When hatched , female chicks are totally black , while male chicks have a white stripe on their head . Morphological and production features of Prelux-Č are similar to those of Prelux-G. Hens measured in 18th week reached a body mass of 1.8 kg , and after one year of laying the value increased to 2.4 kg . In average , the Black Prelux , grown in battery cage , lays 314 eggs per year , with a single egg weighing 64 g .
Prelux-G
Prelux-G ( prelux grahasta and grahasti prelux in Slovenian , Prelux Barred and Barred Prelux in English ) is a type of commercial layer crossbreed . This hybrid is a result of pairing the same traditional breeds as in Prelux-Č , the only difference is a swapped role of parent breeds ; a hen is of the Slovenian Brown and a rooster is of the Slovenian Barred . Feather colouration of this type resembles Slovenian Barred Hen , as Barred Prelux are covered with plumage of barred , black and white pattern . A sex of chicks is determined with a speed of feathering ; male chicks have slower feathering speed than females of the same type . The Prelux-G is a heavier type of chicken ; 18 weeks old hens weighed 1.8 kg , and after one year of laying the value reached 2.5 kg . Prelux-G is not only used as a good layer hen but also a meat chicken . Especially popular is meat of castrated roosters – capons . Hens of the Prelux-G in average lay 308 eggs per year , with each egg reaching 60 g .
Prelux-R
Prelux-R ( prelux rjava and rjavi prelux in Slovenian , Prelux Brown and Brown Prelux in English ) is a type of commercial layer crossbreed . Such hybrids are a result of pairing hens of the Slovenian Silver and roosters of the Slovenian Brown . This brown coloured layer hen 's appearance resembles foreign brown breeds and hybrids . The type 's feature are autosex offspring , with male chicks being white and female chicks being yellowish brown . It is a relatively light hen ; 18 weeks old animals weigh in average 1.7 kg , and after one year of laying hens weigh 2.2 kg . The typical Prelux-R will lay 294 eggs per year ; with eggs being somewhat heavier than in other hybrids layers , 65 g .
Prelux-BRO
Chickens of the type Prelux-BRO ( also Prelux-bro ) are heavier ( meat type ) hens , that are used for raising broilers . Animals of this type are derived from the meat breed Slovene Late-feathered Hen , that serves as a grandparent father breed for producing mothers of hybrids Prelux-BRO . A procedure of crossbreeding includes pairing a rooster of the Slovene Late-feathered Hen and a hen of the Slovene Early-feathered Hen . Female offspring of these parents is being bred with roosters of the Slovenian Fathering Hen , resulting in broilers of the Prelux-BRO type . Sexing is based on the speed of feathering ; with males having slower feathering speed than females . Usually such broilers are raised extensively ; either free or closed , occasionally within ecological way of farming . Since hens of the Prelux-bro are slow growing animals , they are less appropriate for breeding in big , industrial plants .

The Juliana Republic ( Portuguese : República Juliana ) or Catarinense Republic ( República Catarinense ) , officially the Free and Independent Catharinense Republic ( República Catharinense Livre e Independente ) , was a revolutionary state that existed between 29 July and 15 November 1839 , in the province of Santa Catarina of the Empire of Brazil . The Republic was proclaimed in an extension of the Ragamuffin War started in the neighboring province of Rio Grande do Sul , where the Riograndense Republic had already been created .
Forces of the revolutionary Riograndense Republic , led by General David Canabarro and Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi , with help from the local population , conquered the harbor city of Laguna on 22 July 1839 , in a battle known as the `` Capture of Laguna '' ( Tomada de Laguna ) . The Catarinense Republic was then proclaimed on 29 July , at the city 's municipal chamber . Canabarro assumed temporarily the office of president until an electoral college was assembled and elections were held on 7 August . For president and vice president were elected , respectively , Joaquim Xavier Neves , a Lieutenant-colonel of the National Guard of São José , and his uncle , the priest Vicente Ferreira dos Santos Cordeiro , who assumed the presidential office due to a blockade by the Imperial Army that prevented Joaquim Xavier Neves from reaching Laguna .
The rebels could not conquer the provincial capital of Nossa Senhora do Desterro ( present-day Florianópolis ) , because their naval forces were found and destroyed by the Imperial Brazilian Navy at Massiambu River ( on the continent , south of Santa Catarina Island ) while the rebels were preparing to attack Nossa Senhora do Desterro . Chiefly because of this , the Juliana Republic lasted for only four months . In November , imperial forces took the Julian capital of Laguna .

Thai Chana ( , ; ) is an online registration system and closed database for public establishments to record their visitors as a government 's plan to combat COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand . The database is available only to the Ministry of Public Health 's Department of Disease Control in order to track , trace and restrict the visitors who may later be infected .
Development
Thai Chana was developed by Krungthai Bank and Digital Government Development Agency and was launched for public on 17 May 2020 , following an order to reopen department stores after 2-month lockdown . All enterprises are obliged to have their visitors `` check-in '' to the Thai Chana system upon arrival and `` check-out '' upon departure . As of February 2020 , the system is available on its website and its Android mobile application . On its first day of operation , the system was deployed by more than 44,000 stores and was checked-in by more than 2 million users .
According to the official statement , goal of the system is to `` determine the crowdedness of the given business location , so that the business owner can manage the visitors ' admission '' and to `` trace the visitors [ in case got infected ] and track down those with close contact to them based on their check-ins '' . However , many found that these goals have never been implemented throughout the pandemic .
Criticisms
The system has been criticised for collecting certain aspects of users ' private information that are deemed irreverent to the track-and-trace scheme and unnecessarily violating citizens ' online privacy .
Privacy
Poramet Minsiri , founder of told BBC Thai that Thai Chana has made him realise that `` [ Thai ] citizens ' rights are so light '' . He further criticised the unnecessary collection of users ' real-time location , amongst others , as a violation of online privacy . Human rights academics Sarueni Achawananthakun criticised its lack of transparency on data collection . She further questioned the extent of involvement of Krungthai Bank given its for-profit status .
Spam messages
Not long after Thai Chana launched , many iPhone and iOS users in Thailand received spam messages via iMessage advertising online casino scams . Many netizens accused the government 's Thai Chana for possible leakage of many telephone numbers to third parties . However , Ministry of Digital Economy and Society declined all claims .

Infrared vision is the capability of biological or artificial systems to detect infrared radiation . The terms thermal vision and thermal imaging , are also commonly used in this context since infrared emissions from a body are directly related to their temperature : hotter objects emit more energy in the infrared spectrum than colder ones .
The human body , as well as many moving or static objects of military or civil interest , are normally warmer than the surrounding environment . Since hotter objects emit more infrared energy than colder ones , it is relatively easy to identify them with an infrared detector , day or night . Hence , the term night vision is also used ( sometimes misused ) in the place of `` infrared vision '' , since one of the original purposes in developing this kind of systems was to locate enemy targets at night . However , night vision concerns the ability to see in the dark although not necessarily in the infrared spectrum . In fact , night vision equipment can be manufactured using one of two technologies : light intensifiers or infrared vision . The former technology uses a photocathode to convert light ( in the visible or near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum ) to electrons , amplify the signal and transform it back to photons . Infrared vision on the other hand , uses an infrared detector working at mid or long wavelengths ( invisible to the human eye ) to capture the heat emitted by an object .
The infrared spectrum
The entire electromagnetic spectrum highlighting the infrared part located between the visible and the radio waves , is depicted in the figure . The IR spectrum can be subdivided into 5 regions , although this definition is somewhat arbitrary and it differs from one author to another . The subdivision presented here is based on a combination of the atmospheric transmittance windows , i.e . the wavelengths regions in which infrared radiation is better transmitted through the atmosphere , the detector materials used to build the infrared sensors and the main applications . In this way , the Near Infrared ( NIR ) band is mostly used in fiber optic telecommunication systems since silica ( SiO2 ) provides a low attenuation losses medium for the infrared , whilst the Short Wave Infrared ( SWIR ) band allows working on long-distance telecommunications ( remote sensing ) using a combination of detector materials . The Medium Wavelength Infrared ( MWIR ) and the Long Wavelength Infrared ( LWIR ) bands find applications in Infrared Thermography for military or civil applications , e.g . target signature identification , surveillance , NonDestructive Evaluation , etc . The Very Long Wavelength Infrared ( VLWIR ) band is used in spectroscopy and astronomy .
The MWIR band is preferred when inspecting high temperature objects and the LWIR band when working with near room temperature objects . Other important criteria for band selection are : the operating distance , indoor-outdoor operation , temperature and emissivity of the bodies of interest . For instance , long wavelengths ( LWIR ) are preferred for outdoor operation since they are less affected by radiation from the Sun . LWIR cameras are typically uncooled systems using Focal Plane Array microbolometers commonly used in industrial IR applications , although cooled LWIR cameras using Mercury Cadmium Tellurium ( MCT ) detectors exists as well . On the contrary , the majority of the MWIR cameras require cooling , using either liquid nitrogen or a Stirling cycle cooler . Cooling to approximately −196 °C ( 77 K ) offers excellent thermal resolution , but might restrict the span of applications to controlled environments .
Applications
Infrared vision is used extensively by the military for night vision , navigation , surveillance and targeting . For years , it developed slowly due to the high cost of the equipment and the low quality of available images . Since the development of the first commercial infrared cameras in the second half of the 1960s , however , the availability of new generations of infrared cameras coupled with growing computer power is providing exciting new civilian ( and military ) applications , to name only a few : buildings and infrastructure , works of art , aerospace components and processes , maintenance , defect detection and characterization , law enforcement , surveillance and public services , medical and veterinary thermal imaging . The electronic technique that uses infrared vision to `` see '' thermal energy , to monitor temperatures and thermal patterns is called infrared thermography .
On February 14 , 2013 researchers developed a neural implant that gives rats the ability to sense infrared light which for the first time provides living creatures with new abilities , instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities .

Kinematic diffraction is the approach to study diffraction phenomena by neglecting multiple scattering . For linear wave equations , it thus consists in summing the contribution of the partial waves emanating from the different scatterers , where only the incident field drives the scattering . As a consequence , the far-field amplitude essentially corresponds to the Fourier transform of the scattering length density . It is typically understood as the Born approximation applied to a regular arrangement of scatterers , as appropriate for X-ray crystallography . The corresponding full ( non-perturbative ) theory is called the dynamical theory of diffraction .

The British literary figure and designer William Morris ( 1834-1896 ) , a founder of the British Arts and Crafts Movement , was especially known for his wallpaper designs . These were created for the firm he founded with his partners in 1861 , Morris , Marshall , Faulkner and Company , and later for Morris and Company . He created fifty different block-printed wallpapers , all with intricate , stylised patterns based on nature , particularly upon the native flowers and plants of Britain . His wallpapers and textile designs had a major effect on British interior designs , and then upon the subsequent Art Nouveau movement in Europe and the United States .
The 1860s - experiments and early designs
His partners in the company were members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , a group of painters who rejected the art and design of the Victorian era , and sought to revive earlier themes and techniques of art and craftsmanship . The first wallpaper pattern he designed for his company was the Trellis wallpaper in 1864 . It was inspired by the roses he grew on the trellis at his residence , the Red House . However , two years passed between the time he designed the paper and the time he was able to print it to his satisfaction . His primary objective was to make the wallpaper by hand , with transparent oil colours on zinc plates . However , when he could not make this work to his satisfaction , he gave the task to an established wallpaper firm , Jeffrey and company , which printed it with wood blocks and distemper colours . Since Morris was a perfectionist , this also was a long process . He was dissatisfied by the early versions , and at one point threw away the entire set of printing blocks . The final versions were printed in different colours . For the bedroom of his own residence Kelmscott House , which he decorated in 1879 , he used the trellis design with a blue background .
In the following years , he made two more floral designs , Daisies ( 1864 ) , and Fruit and Pomegranate ( 1866 ) . All three were created in a variety of different colours . The multitude of colours used and the careful work involved made these wallpapers particularly expensive .
since he was running a business , he had to adapt to the wishes of the market . At the end of the 1860s , in order to bring in more orders , he created an entirely different group of four papers based on a new design , called the Indian . Since they had only two colours , they were less expensive . In 1868 , though he disliked the Victorian idea of using several different designs of wallpaper in the same room , intended especially for the ceilings of rooms .
The early 1870s - mastery of technique
In the 1870s , through practice and continual refinement , he achieved a mastery of the technique and a more sophisticated and subtle style , with a finer balance between color , variety , and structure . He wrote later in his 1881 lecture , Some hints on pattern designing , of the necessity `` to mask the construction of our pattern enough to prevent people from counting the repeats of our pattern , while we manage to lull their curiosity to trace it out . '' The purpose of a good pattern , he wrote , `` was a look of satisfying mystery , which is essential in all patterned goods , and which must be done by the designer . '' He added that `` colour above all should be modest , '' since the wallpaper was part of the household , meant to be lived with and seen only in passing , not meant to attract attention to itself .
During this period he created some of this most famous designs , creating an illusion of three dimension , with lavish flowers interwoven with a complex and lush background . His designs in this period included 'Larkspur ' ( 1872 ) , 'Jasmine ' ( 1872 ) , 'Willow ' ( 1874 ) , 'Marigold ' ( 1875 ) , 'Wreath ' and 'Chrysanthemum ' ( both 1876 ) . The Morris wallpapers were expensive to produce . A typical Morris wallpaper in the 1870s required as much as four weeks to manufacture , using thirty different printing blocks and fifteen separate colours .
The wallpapers of Morris were regarded as strange and excessive for most wealthy Victorians , who preferred the more geometric and traditional French styles . The early clients of Morris ' wallpapers were mostly his avant-garde artist friends . His early designs were purchased by his close friend painter Edward Burne-Jones , and Punch cartoonist Edward Linley Sambourne . He also had as few avant-garde aristocratic clients , including the Earl and Countess of Carlisle , who used the 'Bird and Anemone ' and two sunflower designs in their home at Castle Howard in Yorkshire .
Late 1870s to the 1890s - Royal attention and final wallpapers
The period between 1876 and 1882 was the most productive for Morris ; he created sixteen different wallpaper designs . In his wallpapers of this period , he reverted to more naturalistic themes , somewhat less three-dimensional than his earlier work , but with an exceptional harmony and rhythm , as in his designs Poppy ( 1885 ) and Acorn .
In the 1880s , his work finally received royal attention : In 1880 he was asked to redecorate rooms St. James 's Palace in London . He created a particularly complex design , named 'St . James 's ' , which used sixty-eight separate printing blocks to make a section of two wallpaper widths , with a height 127 centimeters . In 1887 Queen Victoria again commissioned Morris & Company , this time to another special design for wallpaper at Balmoral Castle , based on the 'VRI ' initials of the Queen .
During this time , however , Morris was devoting more and more of his time to literary and political work . He also became increasingly involved in other media , especially textile and tapestry weaving . He relocated the workshops of his company to Merton Abbey in the 1880s to focus on these . He also began to create wallpapers with a single color , such as Acorn and Sunflower , which were much simpler and much less expensive to produce . Among his final wallpapers was the Red Poppy design .
Technique
Between 1864 and 1867 , for his early wallpapers such as the Trellis , Fruit and Pacquerette , he experimented with printing them with blocks of zinc but decided that this was too complex and took too long . He turned to a commercial company , Barrett of Bethnal Green , which made the first blocks for him in the traditional way from pearwood . For the printing , he turned to the firm of M.M . Jeffrey & Company of Islington , which eventually produced all of his papers .
The technique used by Morris for making wallpaper was described in some detail in Arts and Crafts Essays by Members of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society published in 1893 . The chapter on wallpaper was written by Walter Crane . He describes how the wallpapers of Morris were made using pieces of paper thirty-feet long and twenty-one inches wide . ( French wallpaper was eighteen inches wide ) . The design therefore could not exceed twenty-one inches square , unless a double block was used . This was the greatest width for which the craftsman could comfortably handle and print the paper with a block .
The block itself was made of wood twenty-one inches wide . The design was first outlined on the block , and carved in wood , cutting away everything except for the part of the design to be printed in one colour . Details and fine lines were reproduced with flat brass wires that were driven edgewise into the block . The pigments , made with natural ingredients , were mixed with sizing or a binder , and then put into shallow trays , called wells . The long papers were passed over on wooden rods overhead , with the section of paper to be printed placed flat on a table in front of the craftsman .
One block was used for each colour . The typical Morris design used as many as twenty different colours , but some were more complex . The Saint James design ( 1881 ) required sixty-eight different blocks . The printer painted a pad with the first colour , then pressed the block down onto the pad to put the paint onto its surfaces . Then he moved the block to the paper and used a hand press to print the color onto the paper . The location of the block was marked precisely with pins , so all the colours would align . This process was repeated time after time for the length of the first paper . When the colour on the first sheet was dry , he took another block and printed the next colour over the first and so on , colour after colour , until the design was complete .
Producing a single set of a wallpaper design with this process could often take as long as four weeks .
The Morris Style
In the 1850s , during the Victorian era prior to Morris , most English wallpaper was inspired by the geometric and historical designs of Augustus Welby Pugin , who had created the neo-Gothic interiors of Westminster Palace , and Owen Jones , notable for his abstract geometric patterns . Wallpaper design was also strongly influenced by imitations of the colorful and highly ornate French wallpaper of the Napoleon III style .
Morris 's friend Walter Crane wrote , `` ... Mr. William Morris has shown what beauty and character in pattern , and good and delicate choice of tint can do for us , giving in short a new impulse to design , a great amount of ingenuity and enterprise has been spent on wallpapers in England , and in the better minds a very distinct advance has been made upon the patterns of inconceivable hideousness , often of French origin , of the period of the Second Empire - a period which perhaps represents the most degraded level of taste in decoration generally . ''
Morris wrote that his object was to find the balance between color and variety on the one hand and structure . He declared in an 1881 essay , Some Hints on Pattern Designing of the need to `` mask the construction of our pattern enough to prevent people from counting the repeats of our pattern , while we manage to lull their curiosity to trace it out . '' The goal , he wrote , was `` to attain a satisfying mystery , which is essential in all patterned goods , and which must be done by the designer . '' He also declared that `` colours of all things should be modest , designed to be seen only in passing , and not drawing attention to themselves . ''
Morris sought to depict nature , particularly the plants and flowers of England , without excessive naturalism . He placed his flowers and plants in series which were carefully created to be rhythmic and balanced , giving a sense of order and harmony . He did not want his wallpapers to be the center of attention in a room . In the 1870s and 1880s his designs became denser , richer and more complex , but they preserved the sense of and harmony and equilibrium which he sought .
Associated artists
In later years the Morris style influenced and was adapted by the other designers who worked for Morris and Company . The most prominent were John Henry Dearle , who collaborated closely with Morris on many of his projects , and issued them under the name of Morris . He replaced Morris as chief designer of the company after the death of Morris . The sisters and designers Kate Faulkner and Lucy Faulkner Orrinsmith also collaborated with Morris , and adapted elements of his philosophy and style in their own work .

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and lacks any natural satellites . An undiscovered moon orbiting the planet was hypothesized to exist in the early 1970s , but it turned out to be misinterpreted data from the star 31 Crateris . Observation of a moon of Mercury from Earth would be difficult because Mercury is relatively close to the Sun . For example , Mercury was not observed in the infrared spectrum until 1995 . NASA 's MESSENGER spacecraft , which orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015 , did not detect any moon . Mercury 's small Hill sphere limits the potential for a natural satellite to exist .
Mariner 10 mission
A moon of Mercury was for a short time thought to exist . On March 27 , 1974 , two days before Mariner 10 made its flyby of Mercury , instruments began registering large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the vicinity of Mercury that , according to one astronomer , `` had no right to be there '' . By the next day , the radiation had disappeared ; it reappeared three days later , appearing to originate from an object that was , seemingly , detached from Mercury . Some astronomers speculated that they had detected a star , but others argued that the object must be a moon , citing not only the two different directions from which the radiation had emanated but also the belief that such high-energy radiation could not penetrate very far through the interstellar medium . Arguments in favor of a moon were strengthened when the object 's speed was calculated to be , which matched the expected speed of a moon .
31 Crateris
A `` moon '' was detected moving away from Mercury in 1974 , and was eventually identified as a background star , 31 Crateris . 31 Crateris is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 2.9 days , and this may have been the source of the ultraviolet radiation detected in 1974 . The 'moon of Mercury ' misidentification in 1974 sparked an important discovery in astronomy : ultraviolet radiation is not as completely absorbed by the interstellar medium as was formerly thought .
MESSENGER mission
In an April Fools ' Day joke in 2012 , NASA announced
that the MESSENGER spacecraft supposedly discovered a moon in orbit around Mercury ,
which they named jokingly Caduceus , in reference to the caduceus , the staff carried by the Roman god Mercury . The MESSENGER mission used the spacecraft to search for moons of Mercury in 2011 and 2013 , and confirmed that Mercury had none .

WVVR ( 100.3 FM , `` The Beaver '' ) is a radio station licensed to serve Hopkinsville , Kentucky . The station is owned by the Five-Star Media Group subsidiary of Saga Communications through licensee Saga Communications of Tuckessee , LLC . It airs a country music format .
History
WVVR-FM went on the air in 1960 as WFOF-FM with several call sign changes through the years including WKSD-FM , WKOA-FM , WYKH-FM , WZZF-FM and WBVR-FM . The station was purchased in 1977 by a group of Hopkinsville , Kentucky investors , with Hal King serving as the manager . WKOA became WYKH – meaning `` Your Kentucky Home '' & ndash , which switched to a solid gold format in 1986 after John N. Hall III bought the station . The next year the station became WQKS `` Kiss FM '' to reflect a new urban contemporary format .
Over time the station programmed beautiful music , stereo rock and contemporary hit radio . The station , known as `` K-100 '' , became `` Z-100 '' when the call letters changed to WZZF-FM in 1986 .
The station was purchased by WRUS , INC. , of Russellville , Kentucky ( a division of Forever Broadcasting at the time ) . WZZF had been oldies but changed call letters to WVVR-FM when it joined with WMJM to pick up the former WBVR-FM country music format . WBVR-FM in Bowling Green-Russellville , KY was considered to be the `` Original Beaver '' radio station . The Bowling Green station had far less power and was separate until its purchase later on after the `` Beaver Branding '' on WVVR . The original station `` Hook Phrase '' was , `` The Beaver 1-oh-1 FM ! '' . That changed after the tower and frequency were sold to Clear Channel in Nashville , Tennessee . That is when the station adopted the equally powerful 100.3 FM frequency on the analog radio dial . Afterward , the station was to be known as , `` The Beaver 100.3 ! '' Some `` hooks '' and `` catchphrases '' used by the station are/were , `` Today 's Best & MOST Country '' , `` The Big Money-Beaver Country FM '' , and others . In the late 1990s , the station moved out of its studios in Russellville , Kentucky and moved into new studios located in downtown Hopkinsville , Kentucky . That all changed after the sell off from Forever Broadcasting when the station was then moved to a brand-new location in Clarksville , Tennessee along with the other main Clarksville stations including WCVQ .
The station has been assigned these call letters by the Federal Communications Commission since July 1 , 1994 .

Bodianus dictynna , is a species of wrasse native to tropical and warm temperate waters of the Western Pacific , from the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago east to Tonga , as far north as Japan and as far south as Australia . It is most frequently recorded in association with living coral reefs and the juvenile fish usually occur near black coral and gorgonians , although they sometimes are found in caves near the ceiling . It feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans . The juveniles regularly behave as cleaner fish , removing parasites from other fish . The specific name dictynna is an alternative name for Diana , the Roman goddess of hunting , and refers to the close relationship between this species and Bodianus diana of the Indian Ocean , and a proposed common name of Pacific Diana 's pigfish also reflects this relationship .

The amethyst sunbird , also called the black sunbird ( Chalcomitra amethystina ) , is a species of passerine bird in the family Nectariniidae . It is native to the Afrotropics , mostly south of the equator . They are commonly found in well-watered habitats , and undertake seasonal movements to visit flowering woodlands . The demise of some woodlands have impacted their numbers locally , but their range has also expanded along with the spread of wooded gardens .
Habits
Though mostly found singly or in pairs , larger numbers may concentrate at favourite flowering trees , where they act aggressively towards other sunbird species . The complex song is a loud , sustained twittering . Food includes emergent termites , spiders and nectar . In courtship a male will hop about a branch near a female , drop one wing , then the other , and finally both wings . The wings will then be fluttered and displayed . A responsive female may lower her head , and assume a rigid posture .
Nesting
Breeding pairs of amethyst sunbird are widely spaced , and the female builds the nest . Favoured trees include exotic eucalypts and pines , and are often close to buildings or human activity . Nests are attached to a drooping branch , below the canopy , or hidden by foliage . Nests are built from fine grass stems , which are bound together with cobwebs . The nest is often decorated with lichens , or other debris . Two speckled eggs are laid , but successive clutches may be raised from the same nest in a single season . Nests are parasitized by green-backed honeybird and Klaas 's cuckoo .
Habitat and movements
Amethyst sunbirds are widespread residents of woodland , mesic savanna , forest edge and suburban gardens . They occur only sparsely in dry savanna or low dry regions , where they keep to riparian woods or concentrations of nectar-bearing plants , and are decidedly scarce in the Limpopo valley and mopane regions . A distinct summer influx is notable in the Zambezi valley and Great Zimbabwe woodlands , and they are strictly summer visitors ( September/October to April ) to the Kalahari sand ( or Gusu ) woodlands , where they appear in high densities when the Baikiaea trees are in flower . On seaward-facing slopes , they are very common residents up to 1,800 metres , with high reporting rates in afromontane forest and valley bushveld .
Adaptations
The average hematocrit level for birds is between 30 and 45 % ; however , the Amethyst Sunbird has an average hematocrit level of 50 % . Amethyst sunbirds can be found along an altitudinal gradient in South Africa from the Drakensberg mountain range to the coast of KwaZulu-Natal . During warmer months , the sunbird 's hematocrit levels will increase with higher altitudes ( where there is also a dramatic drop in temperature ) and with lower oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere . Higher hematocrit levels may be attributed to its small body size and can help with oxygen carrying capacity and the metabolic cost of flying .
Subpopulations of Amethyst Sunbirds show variation in their resting metabolic rates , basal metabolic rate , and thermal neutral zones based on the subpopulation 's acclimation to different altitudes . Those more acclimated to high altitudes would have lower metabolic rates and a larger thermal neutral zone . Therefore , the Amethyst Sunbird can change its physiology in response to altitude and temperature to achieve a metabolic rate and temperature regulation best suited for its environment .
Status
On the Mashonaland plateau , race kirkii has declined in favour of scarlet-chested sunbird , after fragmentation of its native miombo woodlands . In South Africa , the range of the nominate race has increased along with the spread of wooded gardens .
Range
It occurs in Angola , Botswana , Burundi , Republic of the Congo , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Eswatini , Ethiopia , Gabon , Kenya , Malawi , Mozambique , Namibia , Somalia , South Africa , South Sudan , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia and Zimbabwe .
Races
Between three and eleven races have been proposed , including :
C. a. amethystina
Range : South Africa , southern Botswana , Swaziland
Description : Fairly distinct : bill heavy , females dark from throat to belly , males have tail coverts metallic purple
C. a. kirkii Shelley , 1876

SAP Ariba is an American software and information technology services company located in Palo Alto , California . It was acquired by German software maker SAP SE for $ 4.3 billion in 2012 .
Company beginnings
Ariba ( now SAP Ariba ) was founded in 1996 by Bobby Lent , Boris Putanec , Paul Touw , Rob Desantis , Ed Kinsey , Paul Hegarty , and Keith Krach on the idea of using the Internet to enable companies to facilitate and improve the procurement process , which was paper-based , labor-intensive , and inefficient for large corporations . The name Ariba is a neologism , chosen by a branding company since it was easy to pronounce and spell . The pre-launch name was Procuresoft .
Ariba went public in 1999 under Krach 's leadership as CEO , and was one of the first business-to-business Internet companies to do an IPO . The company 's stock more than tripled from the offering price on opening day , making the three-year-old company worth $ 4 billion . In 2000 , the stock value continued to climb , and Ariba 's market capitalization was as high as $ 40 billion . With the bursting of the dot-com bubble , Ariba 's stock price fell dramatically in July 2001 to its IPO level , where it remained for the rest of its life as an independent company .
Past acquisitions and competitors
On December 17 , 1999 , Ariba announced it would acquire Atlanta-based Tradex Technologies in a stock swap valued then at $ 1.86 billion . Tradex was the leader in the nascent Digital Marketplace Software field . The stock market liked the acquisition and the price of Ariba 's shares rose from $ 57 at the time of the announcement to $ 173 at closing on March 9 , 2000 , which also marked the peak of the Internet Bubble . The 33.2 million shares that Ariba issued to buy Tradex were then worth $ 5.6 billion to Tradex shareholders .
In January 2001 Ariba announced that it would acquire Agile Software in a $ 2.55 billion stock swaps . By April , with Ariba facing a disappointing second quarter and cutting a third of its workforce , the deal had fallen apart .
In early 2004 , Ariba acquired FreeMarkets which gave the company a software package in the upstream ( sourcing ) of the sourcing process . In late 2007 , Ariba bought the company Procuri for $ 93 million , which enhanced the company 's client base and on-demand abilities .
In December 2008 , Ariba announced that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas had issued an injunction against Emptoris , which prohibits the company from infringing on two of Ariba 's patents related to overtime and bid ceilings in reverse auctions . On 16 December 2008 , the court ordered Emptoris to pay an enhanced damages award of $ 1.4 million for willful infringement in connection with Emptoris ' infringement of the two reverse auction-patents held by Ariba . This was in addition to the 29 October 2008 jury award of $ 5 million in damages to Ariba , bringing the total fine to approximately $ 6.4 million , a significant penalty for Emptoris which earned approximately $ 50 million in revenue for 2008 . In an Emptoris press release , that company noted that it had released a new software `` patch '' that eliminates any infringement . The U.S. District Court , in February 2009 , issued an order noting that the `` patch '' is colorably different , effectively concluding the case .
In November , 2010 , Ariba announced that it would acquire Quadrem , a privately held provider of one of the world 's largest supply networks and on-demand supply management solutions . The acquisition closed in January 2011 .
In October , 2011 Ariba announced the acquisition of b-process , a privately held French company and European leader in electronic invoicing service provider , for approximately €35 million in cash .
In April , 2013 , Ariba partnered with Medassets to `` extend the latter 's supply chain management and outsourced procurement functionalities '' .
AribaWeb
On February 19 , 2009 , Ariba announced AribaWeb , an open source framework for Rich Web Applications . It is designed to generate a user interface automatically from base Java or Groovy classes and includes Object-Relational Mapping features . It also encapsulates AJAX functionality and has a broad selection of UI widgets .
Ariba Product Suite
SAP Ariba now only sells the cloud version of product in the market and calls it SAP Ariba On Demand Suite of Applications . Customers using the On Premise versions will eventually have to migrate to the cloud version .
Acquisition by SAP
On May 22 , 2012 , the German business software maker SAP SE announced it planned to acquire Ariba for an estimated $ 4.3 billion . SAP said it would pay $ 45 a share . JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank AG advised SAP SE on the sale , while Morgan Stanley provided financial counsel to Ariba . Ariba 's shareholders approved the acquisition on August 29 , 2012 , and it was completed on October 1 , 2012 , for $ 4.4 billion .
Customer Base
As of March 2022 SAP Ariba indicates that it currently supports 5.3 Million companies ( between buyers and suppliers ) on the `` SAP B2B Network '' transacting $ 3.75 trillion annually .
Partnerships
In January of 2022 SAP Ariba announced that it would be building a partnership with CLM specialist Icertis as well as taking minority stake within the company for an undisclosed amount . The two companies have committed to building a joint roadmap .

Townsend Harris High School at Queens College ( THHS ) is a public magnet high school for the humanities in the borough of Queens in New York City . Students and alumni often refer to themselves as `` Harrisites . '' Townsend Harris consistently ranks as among the top 100 high schools in the United States . In 2019 , 2020 , and 2021 , U.S. News & World Report ranked THHS # 1 in New York State ; THHS ranked # 12 nationally in 2021 . The school was named in honor of Townsend Harris the 19th-century American merchant , politician , and diplomat who served as the first American Consul to Japan .
History
Townsend Harris High School was founded in 1984 by alumni of Townsend Harris Hall Prep School , who wanted to reopen their school that was closed in the 1940s . This process in started in 1980 .
The first principal was Malcolm Largmann , a former high school English teacher with a strong belief in a classically styled education who also handpicked the school 's original faculty . Largmann served as principal of Townsend Harris from 1984 until his retirement in 2001 . The new school began life in a small building on Parsons Boulevard , originally intended as a temporary home until a permanent facility could be realized . In early 1995 , the school moved into a new building located on the campus of Queens College .
Brian Condon became principal after a heated debate concerning Interim Principal Rosemarie Jahoda .
Admissions
Well over 15,400 students compete for approximately 270 seats in the freshman class each year based on their middle school grades , standardized test scores and even attendance records . Admission is available to all New York City residents in 8th grade . A minimum grade point average of 91 is required of all applicants to be considered for admission . Minimum standardized reading and math scores at the 90th percentile are also required ( 4.3 on both English and Math ) .
Some seats are available for 9th graders wishing to start Townsend as sophomores , though as the number depends on the number of students who decide to leave the school during freshman year the number varies significantly from year to year ; in 2006 , only 5 were available . In 2019 , just 10 seats were available to 5,000 students who applied .
Initially , the admissions process included an interview and a writing component , but this was eliminated by 1988 . Upon matriculation , students take a writing and math exam . Students must fulfill prerequisite grade standards to earn admission in addition to the examination .
Academics
In addition to the standard three-year Regents English program , all students take a `` fifth year '' of English as freshmen in the form of a `` Writing Process '' composition course . In addition to the standard modern language requirement which may be fulfilled with classes in Spanish , French , or Japanese , students must meet a two-year classical language requirement which can be fulfilled by classes in Latin or classical Greek . There is also a rigorous physical education requirement , especially in freshman gym , and a senior project required of students . A variety of electives and AP classes are also offered to students . As of 2004 , AP World History became a mandatory subject and replaced the Regents-level course . Every subject requires students to execute at least one major project a year , with history classes requiring one per semester and English several per semester . These projects are referred to as `` collaterals . ''
In the 2008–2009 school year , Townsend Harris is offering the following Advanced Placement ( AP ) classes : World History , United States History , United States Government , Environmental Science , Psychology , Calculus AB/BC , Computer Science A , Japanese Language and Culture , Latin : Vergil , Statistics , French Language , Art History , Computer Science Principles , AP Macroeconomics , AP Microeconomics , and Spanish Language , Spanish Literature .
The most notable feature of the school 's curriculum is the senior `` Bridge Year '' program . Students in good standing may take up to 12 credits at Queens College at no cost to themselves . This includes an elective course taught by Queens College faculty and a required humanities seminar co-taught by Harris teachers and Queens College faculty . The curriculum and format is fairly similar to the Great Books seminars required of liberal arts freshmen at colleges around the world , with heavy emphasis on critical reading and writing .
Recently , a number of other New York City public high schools have been established that have similar `` bridge year '' programs . These include the High School of American Studies at Lehman College , Queens High School for the Sciences at York College , and Bard High School Early College .
Student body
In sharp contrast with the original school which was open to male students only , the new school has been dominated by female students from its inception , today comprising approximately 70 % of the student population .
As of 2019 , the school 's minority population is largely Asian , with the New York City Department of Education 's `` Asian and other '' category making up 44 % of the student body total , comprising the largest segment of the school 's population . White students comprise 37 % of the population , Hispanic students 12 % and black students 7 % .
48 % of students at Townsend Harris are from an economically disadvantaged background .
The school maintains a 100 % graduation rate .
Miscellaneous
The attendance rate is the highest in NYC . Scores on standardized examinations are also high when compared to other public high schools ; in the year 2005–2006 , Harrisites had average scores of 628 and 632 on the SAT verbal and math sections , respectively , compared to 551 and 565 for what the city deems `` similar schools '' and 444 and 467 for students citywide . In 2000 Eileen F. Lebow published a history of the original school , The Bright Boys : A History of Townsend Harris High School ( ) .
Accomplishments
The Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence Foundation named Harris a 21st Century School of Distinction in June 2004 . In December of that year , the school was named a Lighthouse School by the same organization .
In 2005 and 2006 , the school had the highest percentage of students passing Regents exams of any New York City Department of Education high school .
2006-2007 The Highest Percentage Passing AP World History Scores in the US for a Large School

The Battle of Sandema was a battle in Africa that was fought between Babatu and the people of Sandema . The battle is said to have taken place at a place called Akumcham , where the Builsa united and defeated the leader of the Zabarma warriors .
History
According to historians , Babatu was said to have hailed from Indunga , a town in Niger . He recruited people from Grunshie Mossi , Hausa and Fulani as fighters who took part in slave raids in the Northern Territories . It was said he conquered an area that stretched from Ouagadougou in the north to what is now the Upper East region and certain parts of Northern region in Ghana .
It is said Babatu brought the people of Zabarma state to its peak of power and prestige in the late 1880s .
Background
It was said certain events took place before the confrontation between the two sides . Babatu attacked the Builsa for about three months . He captured many warriors of the village of Wiaga as prisoners . Some of the warriors rushed to Sandema and he pursued them . Babatu was defeated in a battle that took place in a hill between Sandema and Fiisa called Azagsuk . The warriors from Navrongo , Fumbisi , and Kunkwa united as one Builsa . The Zabarma were defeated with the help of white men .
It is claimed the battle took place between 1890 and March 1897 . Other sources claim it took place between the market and where the current Old Primary School is in 1896 .
Legacy
After the Zabarma were defeated , their weapons were collected as relics of war and kept in Fiisa which has a shrine in Sandema . Slaves under Babatu were freed by the Builsa .
The Feok Festival is celebrated every year in the third week of December to mark their victory and encounter with the slave raiders and also the War dance after it became a public event in 1972 . The festival means abundance of food .

The Histochemical Society ( HCS ) is an academic society that was founded on March 24 , 1950 at a meeting organized by Ralph D. Lillie of the National Institutes of Health . The idea for the Society arose during the 1949 Biological Stain Commission meeting at which a symposia encompassing anatomy , cytology , pathology and biochemistry was proposed by Lillie , Charles Leblond and Edward Dempsey . Lillie became the first editor of HCS 's journal , Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry .
The Society is an interdisciplinary body of cell biologists , pathologists , anatomists , biochemists , and neuroscientists . HCS 's mission is the development and use of visual techniques that provide biochemical and molecular information about the structure and function of cells , tissues and organs and for the dissemination of this knowledge through education and outreach . The Society fulfills its mission through publishing its Journal , the Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry , and through the management of annual meetings and short courses .
The Histochemical Society 's offices are in Bethesda , Maryland . The Society is a member society of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology ( FASEB ) and the International Federation of Societies for Histochemistry and Cytochemistry .

Ido 's Football Club , usually known as IFC , is a Dutch association football club from Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht . Its grounds are at Sportpark Schildman .
History
First years
Ido 's Football Club was established on 20 October 1927 , 2 years before its Saturday football rival ASWH , and initially played football only on Sundays . The establishment was a merger of street soccerclubs , HIVV , OVV and SDW . Its members were for the most part left-oriented blue collar workers . IFC 's first ground was Den Dommes in Oostendam , later covered by a bridge and road over the Noord River .
2010s
Since 2014 and occasionally before IFC also has a team for Saturday soccer . In 2016–2017 this team plays in the Derde Klasse of district South-I . IFC further features women teams , youth teams , and senior teams . It engaged in women soccer already in the 1970s .
IFC 's prime squad are male Sunday `` amateurs '' playing in the season 2016–2017 in Hoofdklasse B . Coach was Jack van den Berg , who was behind the promotion of the first squads of IFC and neighboring ASWH in the same season .
In the 2017–2018 season , the first squads of Sunday and Saturday football are coached by Virgil Breetveld , who arrived in Ambacht after training SteDoCo . Breetveld got sacked in March 2018 . Gerard van der Mei replaced him as head coach of the Saturday football team , Robert Verbeek replaced him as head coach of the Sunday football team .
In 2019 , the first male squad only just survived the relegation playoff from the Hoofdklasse . The first women squad won a section championship and promoted from the Derde Klasse to the Tweede Klasse . In the summer of 2019 , Jack van Berg is back as coach of IFC .
2020s
In 2021 , IFC dropped its Sunday first squad that played in the Hoofdklasse . The contract of coach Jack van den Berg was ended after IFC could no longer afford him . Some other Sunday squads continued . The Saturday first squad , now the main first squad , won a Vierde Klasse section championship in 2022 and promoted to the Derde Klasse .

A wind-up toy is an automaton toy powered by a clockwork motor .
Background
Automata built for the sake of art , amusement , and simulation have been described since antiquity , in cases such as Heron of Alexandria designing clockwork birds during the Hellenistic Period . Leonardo da Vinci is frequently credited with constructing a mechanical lion , which he presented to King Francois I in Lyon in 1515 . Although no record of the device 's original designs remain , a recreation of this piece is housed at the Château du Clos Lucé .
Some misinformation exists with regards to Regiomontanus 's contribution , and his supposed construction of a flight-capable mechanical eagle and fly , which are frequently credited as the first wind-up toys . This story of an eagle which flew from Nuremberg to greet Friedrich III , alongside that of a fly which could circulate the room before returning to its inventor 's hand , was spread by Petrus Ramus after a visit to Nuremberg in 1571 , and is apparently false . Furthermore , various internet sites instead credit these inventions to a Karel Grod , but little evidence suggests he exists .
René Descartes may have attempted to build some automata . According to legend , a life-sized wind-up human girl was discovered in his luggage aboard a ship in which he was traveling to Sweden , and was thrown overboard by order of the ship 's Captain .
History
After the larger , elaborate wind-up machine art declined in interest , wind-up toys were created cheaply in large numbers by the 1800s . Wind-up machines became known as wind-up toys , and were designed in different forms to move around . European toy makers created and mass-produced the first windup tin toys during the late 1880s . Over the next 60 to 70 years , more manufacturers created more intricate designs . The trend stopped with the introduction of the small and inexpensive Alkaline battery in the 1960s , which allowed motors to run without a wind up mechanism . Over the next 20 years , wind up toys lost popularity .
Plastic Wind-ups started in 1977 when the Japanese company Tomy made a walking Robot ( Rascal Robot ) . Tomy 's ability to build small precise plastic gears and parts allowed them to reduce the size of the gearbox ( housing the spring drive ) .

The first R class were a class of 62 destroyers built between 1916 and 1917 for the Royal Navy . They were an improvement , specifically in the area of fuel economy , of the earlier destroyers . The most important difference was that the Admiralty R class had two shafts and geared turbines , compared with the three shafts and direct turbines of the Admiralty M class , but in appearance the R class could be distinguished from its predecessors by having the after 4-inch gun mounted in a bandstand . The Admiralty ordered the first two of this class of ships in May 1915 . Another seventeen were ordered in July 1915 , a further eight in December 1915 , and a final twenty-three in March 1916 ( of which eleven were to a slightly modified design ) .
As well as these fifty ships to the standard 'Admiralty ' design , twelve more R class were designed and built by the two specialist builders Yarrow Shipbuilders and John I. Thornycroft & Company to their own separate designs . Three were ordered from Thornycroft and four from Yarrow in July 1915 , and two from Thornycroft and three from Yarrow in December 1915 .
They were the last three-funnelled destroyers ordered by the Royal Navy ( although commissioned in 1973 had three funnels , these were not all on the centreline ) . All of these ships saw extensive service in World War I . Some saw service as minelayers . Eight R-class ships were sunk during the war and all but two of the surviving ships were scrapped in the 1920s and 1930s . One Admiralty R-class vessel , , survived to see service in World War II as a convoy escort , making her the oldest destroyer to see wartime service with the Royal Navy . A second , was transferred to the Royal Siamese Navy as Phra Ruang in September 1920 and survives to this day as a hulk .

Peleid ( foaled 1970 ) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for winning the classic St Leger Stakes in 1973 . After showing little promise in his early career he ran well in several important handicap races in 1973 before stepping up in class to record a 28/1 upset victory in the St Leger on 15 September . He was later sold and exported to stand as a breeding stallion in Hungary .
Background
Peleid was a bay horse bred by his owner Colonel William E. Behrens . He was from the fourth crop of foals sired by Derring-Do , a horse whose wins included the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1965 and whose other offspring included the 2000 Guineas winners High Top and Roland Gardens . Peleid 's dam , Winning Bid , was a successful broodmare who also produced the Eclipse Stakes winner Coup de Feu . The colt was trained by Bill Elsey at his Highfield stables in Malton , North Yorkshire .
Racing career
1972 : two-year-old season
Peleid was not campaigned in the highest class , and won only once , when taking a maiden race at York Racecourse in July .
1973 : three-year-old season
As a three-year-old Peleid was mainly campaigned in handicap races and made steady progress . After winning over one mile at Liverpool on Grand National day in March he won the valuable Zetland Gold Cup over ten furlongs at Redcar Racecourse in May . In June he was sent to Royal Ascot where he finished second to Zab in the King George V Stakes . In July he won the John Smith 's Magnet Cup at York and was then sent to France where he finished second in the Prix de la Ville de Trouville . In August he returned to York for the Ebor Handicap over one and three quarter miles . Carrying a weight of 114 pounds he finished fourth to Bonne Noel .
In September Peleid was one of thirteen three-year-olds to contest the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse . Ridden by the 47-year-old veteran Frankie Durr , he was not regarded as a serious contender , and started at odds of 28/1 . It was believed that Peleid had raced too prominently in the early stages of the Ebor , and on this occasion Durr restrained the colt in the early stages before making his challenge in the straight . He took the lead inside the last quarter mile and accelerated clear of the field to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from Buoy and Duke of Ragusa . He was the first winner of the race trained in the North of England since the filly Cantelo , trained by Elsey 's father Charles Elsey won in 1959 .
1974 : four-year-old season
Peleid remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win a race in Britain : he did finish second in the John Porter Stakes and third in the Jockey Club Stakes . In the autumn he was sold and exported to Hungary . He won the Great Breeders ' Prize in his new country before being retired to stud .
Assessment
In their book A Century of Champions , John Randall and Tony Morris rated Peleid a `` poor '' St Leger winner .

Lucy Johnston ( born 1969 ) is a British journalist , currently health editor of the Sunday Express , and previously a staff reporter and investigative journalist for The Observer .
Johnston was a member of the original editorial team of The Big Issue in 1992 . She has become known for her investigative articles on London 's drug culture , deaths in police custody , animal research , and the pharmaceutical industry , and for her campaigns to improve healthcare provision to the elderly and mentally ill .
Education and career
Johnston was educated at Culford School in Bury St Edmunds . She moved to London in 1992 to work as a volunteer for The Big Issue , becoming a reporter with the newspaper 's original editorial team , before working her way up to news editor , then assistant editor . She was known from then until 1996 for several investigative pieces , including on deaths in police custody and street drugs in London .
Tessa Swithinbank writes that Johnston was headhunted by The Observer in 1996 as a result of her ability to work with the kinds of sources few journalists were able to access . After several years with The Observer as a staff reporter , she joined the Sunday Express investigations team in 2001 , later becoming health editor . She has conducted undercover investigations for the newspaper , including one in 2001 where she took a job as a care assistant in Lynde House , a nursing home owned by Westminster Health Care , which was headed by Chai Patel . Her story was highly critical of the treatment the elderly residents were receiving ; Patel , at the time a government adviser on care of the elderly , later sold the company and resigned from his government post . She has also campaigned in the Express to highlight the treatment of people with mental-health problems , and has written articles opposing the requirement that pensioners pay for medical treatment while in nursing homes .
Reception
Johnston won a commendation in 1998 from the Natali Prize for Journalism , awarded by the International Federation of Journalists , for `` Barred from animals ' kingdom , '' an article in The Observer on the conflict over land rights in northern Tanzania between the Maasai people and the establishment of the Mkomazi National Park , a conservation area for animals .
In 2001 she and a colleague , Jonathan Calvert , won a Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States for a Daily Express article , `` Terrible despair of animals cut up in name of research , '' on xenotransplantation experiments conducted by Imutran and Huntingdon Life Sciences . Johnston was shortlisted that year for a `` Journalist of the Year '' award by Mind , the mental-health charity , and in 2012 the Sunday Express won Mind 's `` Making a difference award '' for its `` Crusade for Better Mental Health '' campaign , with the work of Johnston and a colleague , Ted Jeory , highlighted in the citation .
An article by Johnston in the Sunday Express that was critical of the cervical cancer vaccine , Cervarix , was the subject of a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission in 2009 . The newspaper published a correction and apology .

Following is a table of the United States presidential elections in Delaware , ordered by year . Since its admission to statehood in 1787 , Delaware has participated in every U.S. presidential election .
Winners of the state are in bold . The shading refers to the state winner , and not the national winner .
Elections from 1864 to present
Election of 1860
The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country . The result of the election , with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery , spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War .
Elections from 1828 to 1856
Election of 1824
The election of 1824 was a complex realigning election following the collapse of the prevailing Democratic-Republican Party , resulting in four different candidates each claiming to carry the banner of the party , and competing for influence in different parts of the country . The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote . It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes ( Andrew Jackson ) did not become President , a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters , who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain .
Elections from 1788-89 to 1820
In the election of 1820 , incumbent President James Monroe ran effectively unopposed , winning all 4 of Delaware 's electoral votes , and all electoral votes nationwide except one vote in New Hampshire . To the extent that a popular vote was held , it was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President .
In elections from 1792 to 1816 , Delaware did not conduct a popular vote . Each Elector was appointed by the state legislature .

Kenneth Robert Giles ( born September 20 , 1990 ) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent . He previously played for the Philadelphia Phillies , Houston Astros , Toronto Blue Jays , and Seattle Mariners .
Exposed to baseball at an early age , Giles played the game while attending Rio Grande High School in Albuquerque , New Mexico . Although he was drafted out of high school by the Florida Marlins , Giles instead enrolled at Yavapai College , where he played college baseball until the Phillies drafted him in the seventh round ( 241st overall ) of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft .
Giles quickly progressed through the Phillies ' Minor League Baseball ( MiLB ) system , overcoming two oblique injuries to participate in major league spring training before the 2014 season . Although he began that season in MiLB , Giles soon received a promotion to the major leagues , making his debut on June 12 . One of the team 's few bright spots that season , Giles finished fourth in National League Rookie of the Year voting .
Giles opened the 2015 season as the team 's primary setup man , but when the Phillies traded their closer ( Jonathan Papelbon ) , Giles assumed that role . Renowned for his fastball that can reach upwards of , Giles is a power pitcher who pairs his fastball with a slider to compile high strike-out rates .
Early life
Giles was born on September 20 , 1990 in Albuquerque , New Mexico . From an early age , he was exposed to baseball . His father , Glenn , who had never played baseball himself , apparently saw potential in Ken when he was in pre-school to be a baseball player , and encouraged him to pursue the sport at that young age . Giles attended Rio Grande High School in Albuquerque , New Mexico , where he played baseball , although he was mainly an outfielder , and used his arm strength to throw out runners rather than pitch . He also played football and basketball in college , but focused predominantly on baseball .
Giles was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 44th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft , but did not sign and instead attended Yavapai College , which Giles praised as a great place to focus on baseball without having to go to a large university . At Yavapai , the alma mater of Curt Schilling , Giles began pitching regularly , and realized his talent on the mound . At Yavapai , he posted a 1.18 earned run average ( ERA ) with 67 strikeouts in 38 innings pitched ( 15.9 strikeouts per nine innings pitched ( K/9 ) ) .
Professional career
Minor leagues
Giles was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the seventh round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft , and he signed with the club despite initially committing to transfer to play college baseball for the University of Arizona . He made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Phillies that year , and made three appearances with the team , pitching to a 5.79 ERA , and averaging 5.8 walks per 9 innings .
He opened the 2012 season with the Low-A Lakewood BlueClaws , and after finding success there – he recorded five saves and a 3.61 ERA , working mostly as a reliever ( although occasionally as a starter ) – he earned a promotion to the Class A-Advanced Clearwater Threshers , with whom he worked solely out of the bullpen , and posted a 3.07 ERA and .183 batting average against ( BAA ) .
In 2013 , he returned to Clearwater . During the season , he strained each oblique , limiting him to 24 appearances in which he was 2-2 with a 6.31 ERA , and perhaps hurting his control on the mound , as his walk rate ballooned to 6.7 every nine innings , in comparison to 5.5 the preceding year . After the season , he pitched in the Arizona Fall League , at which point MLBPipeline.com commentator Bernie Pleskoff said `` his ( Giles ' ) command and control are a little behind his velocity '' , but that he was a `` terrific , closer-type arm '' who reminded him of Jonathan Papelbon , whom Giles was a candidate to – and ultimately did – replace as the Phillies ' closer . Other scouts questioned his aptitude as a major league pitcher due to his `` penchant for wildness . '' Aside from one outing in which he surrendered six runs without recording a single out , Giles ' ERA in the Arizona Fall League was 0.00 ( with that outing , it was 5.23 ) , as he gave up 8 walks in 10.1 innings . He finished the season facing an uncertain developmental future , as his velocity was universally acknowledged , but his durability and control universally questioned .
As observers expected , Giles began the 2014 season with the Reading Phillies after spending some time with the major league club during spring training . Through his first seven appearances , he allowed only two hits , and routinely reached over with his fastball . His primary focus was developing a secondary pitch , namely a slider , and working on locating his fastball within the strike zone . With the worst bullpen in the major leagues , the Phillies faced mounting pressure to accelerate Giles ' ascent through the minor leagues , but both manager Ryne Sandberg and general manager Rubén Amaro , Jr. preached patience , asserting that he needed more time to develop . On May 9 , Giles was promoted to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs to further hone his skills , and receive the chance to face better hitters , closer to what he would eventually face in the major leagues . In 11 appearances at Triple-A , he posted a 2.63 ERA , but struck out just nine in comparison to eight walks issued . In regards to striking out fewer batters , Giles said , `` They ( Triple-A hitters ) were more experienced , but I was n't trying to do too much . I was n't trying to strike everyone out kind of thing . I just tried to make good pitches and get outs . Get out of innings as quick as possible . The fewer pitches I had , the better . ''
Philadelphia Phillies
On June 7 , 2014 , Giles was promoted to the major leagues after the Phillies placed Mike Adams on the disabled list ( DL ) . Four days after the promotion , he made his major league debut in a game against the San Diego Padres , and relinquished a home run to his first batter , but then worked through the inning to preserve a lead for the Phillies , who won the game . His first winning decision came on August 10 against the New York Mets . On September 1 , Giles was part of a combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves ; Cole Hamels , Giles , Jake Diekman , and Papelbon did not allow a hit in the game 's nine innings . Later that month , Giles picked up his first save as a major league pitcher in a game against the Oakland Athletics on September 20 . Giles ranked among the best relievers in the major leagues in many key statistical categories relating to strikeouts , ERA , and walks plus hits per innings pitched ( WHIP ) . He also represented a bright spot for the Phillies – and a point of pride for the fan base – during a rebuilding phase for the team . Adam Dembowitz of Crashburn Alley , an ESPN affiliated blog , wrote , `` He 's pretty awesome . He 's cheap and young and he 's a Phillie . Ken Giles is one of the reasons we should all feel good about this offseason and the current rebuilding period . '' Giles finished fourth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting . He finished the season with a 3–1 record , a 1.18 ERA , and one save in 44 games .
Coming off a `` meteoric rise through the Phillies ' organization last season en route to becoming one of the top young relievers in baseball '' , Giles opened the 2015 Philadelphia Phillies season firmly implanted as the team 's setup man , with his goal of being the team 's closer something he did not take for granted , noting he had to `` earn that position . '' Early in the season , he was not as dominant as he had been during his rookie season , but still was among the best relievers in the major leagues . Scouts observed that Giles had an inclination to use his slider more often to compensate for command of his fastball that needed improvement . When the Phillies traded Jonathan Papelbon to the Washington Nationals on July 28 , Giles became the team 's regular closer ; in his first outing as such , he recorded a save against the Toronto Blue Jays .
Houston Astros
On December 12 , 2015 , the Phillies traded Giles and Jonathan Arauz to the Houston Astros in exchange for Mark Appel , Vince Velasquez , Brett Oberholtzer , Tom Eshelman , and Harold Arauz .
In 2016 , Giles made 69 appearances with a 2–5 record , a 4.11 ERA , and 15 saves .
In 2017 , he made 63 appearances with a 1–3 record , a 2.30 ERA , and 34 saves . The Astros finished the year 101–61 , and eventually won the 2017 World Series for their first championship . However , Giles was ineffective in the postseason ; by the end of the World Series , the Astros had stopped using him .
On February 2 , 2018 , Giles won his arbitration case versus the Astros , for a $ 4.6 million salary . The Astros had proposed $ 4.2 million . Giles struggled throughout the beginning of the 2018 season , allowing 17 earned runs on 36 hits in innings for a 4.99 ERA . The Astros demoted him to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League on July 11 , where in 5.1 innings he gave up 9 hits and had an 8.44 ERA .
Toronto Blue Jays
On July 30 , 2018 , the Astros traded Giles , Héctor Pérez , and David Paulino to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roberto Osuna . Giles appeared in 21 games for the Blue Jays in 2018 , pitching to a 4.12 ERA with 14 saves and 22 strikeouts over 19 innings .
Giles successfully converted 34 consecutive save opportunities in a streak that began on September 12 , 2017 , when he was still a member of the Astros , and ended on April 11 , 2019 in a game against the Boston Red Sox . On May 10 , Giles earned his 100th career save when he closed out a 4–3 win against the Chicago White Sox . Giles entered the All-Star break with a 1.45 ERA , 13 saves , and 53 strikeouts over 31 innings . His ERA was the seventh best among qualified relievers prior to the break , and his 1.50 fielding independent pitching ( FIP ) was the best among qualified American League relievers , and the second best among all qualified major league relievers . On July 20 , Giles set a Blue Jays franchise record by recording his 26th consecutive relief appearance with at least one strikeout . Giles finished the 2019 season with a 1.87 ERA and 83 strikeouts in 53 innings .
With the 2020 Toronto Blue Jays , Giles appeared in 4 games , compiling a 0-0 record with 9.82 ERA and 4 hits , 4 walks , and 6 strikeouts in 3.2 innings pitched . On September 30 , 2020 , Giles underwent Tommy John surgery .
Seattle Mariners
On February 19 , 2021 , Giles signed with the Seattle Mariners on a two-year , $ 7M major league contract . On March 31 , 2021 , Giles was placed on the 60-day injured list . He was designated for assignment on August 12 , 2022 . On August 14 , Giles elected free agency .
San Francisco Giants
On August 22 , 2022 , Giles signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants . He was released on August 30 .
Pitching style
A power pitcher , Giles ' fastball has hit as high as , and he relies on it in tandem with a slider in which he spent much of his developmental phase building confidence . His fastball typically registers around , in contrast to a slider that registers around . Very occasionally , he mixes in a change up and sinker . He has always had an aptitude for striking out hitters , which potentially obviated the need for him to record as many groundouts as other pitchers needed to be successful . A slight decline in fastball velocity , at the beginning of the 2015 season , helped him develop more command , something he called a `` blessing in disguise . ''
Personal life
Giles married Estela Piñon , a former softball pitcher at the University of Arizona , in 2015 . They have two sons and reside in Peoria , Arizona .

The Pearson 30 is an American sailboat that was designed by William Shaw as a cruiser and first built in 1971 .
The design was replaced in the company product line by the Pearson 303 , which was also a Shaw design .
Production
The design was built by Pearson Yachts in the United States , from 1971 until 1981 , with 1,185 boats completed by 1 January 1980 , but it is now out of production . The design was one of Pearson 's most commercially successful boats .
Design
The Pearson 30 is a recreational keelboat , built predominantly of fiberglass , with a balsa-cored deck and wood trim . The hull was made from a hand lay up in a one-piece mold . It has a masthead sloop rig , a raked stem , a plumb transom , an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel . Wheel steering was a factory option . It displaces and carries of lead ballast .
The boat has a draft of with the standard keel .
Early production versions had a Palmer inboard engine , while later ones came with a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine and finally an Atomic two-cylinder diesel engines , for docking and maneuvering . The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .
The design has sleeping accommodation for six people , with a double `` V '' -berth in the bow cabin , a straight settee berth and a dinette table that converts to a double berth in the main cabin and an aft quarter berth on the port side . The galley is located on the starboard side just forward of the companionway ladder . The galley is `` L '' -shaped and is equipped with a two-burner stove , an ice box and a double sink . The head is located just aft of the bow cabin .

Operational history
The boat 's designer , William Shaw owned a Pearson 30 as his own personal boat for many years .
Even though it was not designed as a racer , the boat has had success on the racing circuit , including International Offshore Rule , PHRF , MORC and also one-design .
In a 2000 used boat review Darrell Nicholson wrote in Practical Sailor , `` the Pearson 30 is an active sailor 's boat . We find it responsive , and a pleasure to sail . It is also tender , and very sensitive to the proper sail combination . All owners responding consider the boat to be somewhat 'tippy . ' The P30 does , in fact , put the rail under quite easily . '' He concluded , `` the Pearson 30 was an industry success story . The boat is fast and responsive . Finish quality is above average . The interior is comfortable and reasonably roomy within the limitations inherent in a 30-footer . Many of the minor design problems can be corrected by the imaginative and handy owner who enjoys tinkering . ''

Perry Eugene Thurston Jr. ( born January 30 , 1961 ) is an American lawyer and politician who served as a member of the Florida Senate from 2016 to 2022 . He represented the 33rd district , which includes Lauderhill , Lauderdale Lakes , North Lauderdale , Margate , Oakland Park , and surrounding areas in Broward County . He previously served four terms in the Florida House of Representatives , representing the Fort Lauderdale area from 2006 to 2014 , and was the House minority leader in his final term . Thurston was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Attorney General of Florida in 2014 .
Early life and education
Thurston was born in Pompano Beach and attended Morehouse College in Atlanta , Georgia , where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in finance in 1982 . After graduation , he returned to Florida , where he worked in banking until he decided to attend the University of Miami School of Law , where he graduated in 1987 .
Career
After graduating from law school , Thurston worked for the Broward County Public Defender 's Office for four years , and then began working in private practice as a defense attorney .
Florida House of Representatives
When State Representative M. Mandy Dawson did not seek re-election in 1998 , making a successful run for the Florida Senate instead , Thurston ran to succeed her in the 93rd District . In the Democratic primary , he faced Chris Smith , Hazel K. Armbrister , and Fred Segal . Smith placed first in the primary , but he did not win a majority , so he and Thurston , the second-place finisher , advanced to a runoff election , which Smith easily won .
In 2006 , Smith could not seek re-election , and Thurston ran to succeed him in the 93rd District . Against Alain Valias-Jean , Randy Smith , Sallie Tillman-Watson , and McKinley Williams II , Thurston won the Democratic primary with 43 % of the vote . In the general election , he crushed his opponent , independent candidate Nick Sakhnovsky , with 82 % of the vote . Thurston was re-elected in 2008 and 2010 without opposition .
When Florida House of Representatives districts were redrawn in 2012 , Thurston was redistricted into the 94th District , which included most of the territory that he had previously represented in the 93rd District . He won the Democratic nomination without an opponent , and was opposed by Republican nominee Scott Herman in the general election . The South Florida Sun-Sentinel endorsed Thurston for re-election , praising him as `` an advocate for those issues important to his district and his party ... education , economic development , and criminal justice issues . '' In the end , Thurston won in a landslide with 84 % of the vote to secure his final term in the House .
During the 2012-2014 term , Thurston served as Minority Leader of the Florida House of Representatives . In that capacity , he played a critical role in the controversy over the proposed Medicaid expansion as provided for by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , joining to support Governor Rick Scott 's proposal to take `` more than $ 50 billion from the federal government over the next decade , '' which would allow `` an estimated 1.1 million low-income Floridians to purchase private insurance . '' Owing to the refusal by Republicans to consider the proposal , Thurston engaged in a series of legislative maneuvers to slow down the session , `` relying on a parliamentary tactic that requires a full reading of all House bills ready for floor votes , '' which caused Will Weatherford , the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives to use an automated bill reader named `` Mary '' to speed-read through the bills . When the legislative session drew to a close without a decision on the Medicaid expansion , Democrats , including Thurston , joined forces to urge Governor Scott to call a special session to resolve the issue . However , despite the battle over health care , he did not engage in a protracted fight over the budget , declaring , `` There will be some [ Democrats ] who will be voting for the budget , and they 'll have legitimate reasons to vote for it , which I think are legitimate reasons . ''
2014 Attorney General campaign
In late 2012 , Thurston confirmed that he was considering running against Republican Attorney General of Florida Pam Bondi in 2014 , and at the annual convention of the Florida Democratic Party in October 2013 , he announced that he was running , declaring , `` I will be a candidate for attorney general in November 2014 . I look at the attorney general 's position as the people 's attorney , and I think that we need , Florida can do better . I think we need an attorney general who 's going to focus on health care needs of Florida citizens , not necessarily some national agenda . '' Thurston , however , is also a candidate for the Florida Senate in 2016 , when State Senator Chris Smith is term-limited . When asked about how his Senate candidacy impacts his Attorney General campaign , he said , `` I will not be running for the Senate once I win this election in 2014 , '' but , when asked about whether he would run for the Senate if he loses , noted , `` I have not made a decision about that , but I fully expect to win in 2014 . ''
He faced George Sheldon , who had most recently served as the Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families in the United States Department of Health and Human Services , in the Democratic primary . Thurston campaigned on his support for protecting consumers , expanding individual rights , and increasing government oversight , specifically criticizing Bondi for her opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , the restoration of felons ' civil rights , medical marijuana , and marriage equality . He argued , `` There would have been a time when she would have defended the fact that I could n't get married to [ some women ] because we 're not of the same race . '' Despite the fact that neither Thurston nor Sheldon raised very much money in the primary , Thurston emphasized his support for voting rights and his opposition to suing President Barack Obama in radio advertisements that he aired targeting African-American voters . Ultimately , Sheldon defeated Thurston handily in the primary , winning 61 % of the vote to Thurston 's 39 % .
Florida Senate
In 2016 , Thurston ran for the Florida Senate seat vacated by Chris Smith , who was term-limited . He was elected without primary or general election opposition . Thurston was scheduled to succeed Gary Farmer as minority leader of the Florida Senate in the 2022–2024 legislative session . With Thurston announcing a run for Congress in the special election for Alcee Hastings 's seat , Democrats chose Lauren Book to lead Senate Democrats in Tallahassee . Due to Florida 's resign to run laws , Thurston will be forced to resign from the Florida Senate in order to run for Congress . On July 27 , 2021 , Thurston announced his resignation from the Florida Senate , effective January 10 , 2022 .
2022 congressional special election
After incumbent Representative Alcee Hastings died of pancreatic cancer , Thurston announced that he would run to succeed him in a special election .

The 1988 Atlanta Journal 500 was a NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing event that took place on November 20 , 1988 , at Atlanta International Raceway ( located in the Atlanta suburb of Hampton , Georgia ) .
Background
Atlanta International Raceway ( now Atlanta Motor Speedway ) is one of ten current intermediate track to hold NASCAR races ; the others are Charlotte Motor Speedway , Chicagoland Speedway , Darlington Raceway , Homestead Miami Speedway , Kansas Speedway , Kentucky Speedway , Las Vegas Motor Speedway , New Hampshire Motor Speedway , and Texas Motor Speedway . However , at the time , only Charlotte and Darlington were built .
The layout at Atlanta International Speedway at the time was a four-turn traditional oval track that is long . The track 's turns are banked at twenty-four degrees , while the front stretch , the location of the finish line , and the backstretch are banked at five .
Race report
One of the drivers who failed to qualify for this race was Bobby Coyle ; who attempted to qualify in his # 50 Pontiac machine .
Bill Elliott would earn his only NASCAR Winston Cup championship here despite not finishing in the top ten . However , Elliott consistently placed in the other races of the 1988 season with six wins , 15 finishes in the top five , and 10 finishes in the top ten .
The race took three hours and fifty-two minutes ; resulting in a 4¼ second win by Rusty Wallace over Davey Allison . There was an unusually high attrition rate during this race ; with 13 engine failures and only 20 of the 42 starters running at the finish . It would be contributed to the fact that the speedway was repaved since the previous race in the spring . Rusty Wallace was mad that Bill Elliott was running conservative since he only had to finish 18th to clinch the title . Rusty did everything that he could do , including leading the most laps . Elliott could 've been more conservative than he was , over half the field blew motors or wrecked .
Mike Alexander would finish third in this event ; his best NASCAR Winston Cup Series performance . Neil Bonnett finished 13th in his final outing in the Rahmoc # 75 Valvoline Pontiac .
Seventy-two thousand fans would see an average speed of while Wallace qualified for the pole position with a speed of - the equivalent of 30.525 seconds . Tommy Ellis would finish last after encountering a transmission problem on lap 2 out of 328 . Nine cautions slowed the race for 55 laps . Cale Yarborough 's last event went out with a respectable 10th as he would return as an owner of the Phillips # 66 .
NASCAR champion Benny Parsons and Brad Noffsinger would also compete in their final Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race here . Parsons would finish in 34th place while Noffsinger would finish in 26th place . This was the last race for Piedmont Airlines as a NASCAR Cup series sponsor , ending the company 's partnership with the sport that began in 1981 and picked up momentum during a two-year stay at Richard Childress 's team before joining Billy Hagen 's team in 1984 for an extended run that began with Terry Laborite taking their car to a championship . The Piedmont brand was in the process of being phased out at the time as USAir had bought the company was rebranding the regional airline as part of its USAir Express operations . Sterling Marlin brought the white-and-blue # 44 Oldsmobile home with a top-15 run in its last race .

Robert Adams ( 1540–1595 ) was a 16th-century English architect , engraver and surveyor of buildings to Queen Elizabeth . He was a son of Clement Adams .
None of Robert Adams 's architectural works are known to have survived , but some of his plans and engravings are still extant , such as a large 1588 plans of Middleburgh and , from the same year , a small parchment roll , drawn with pen , entitled `` Thamesis Descriptio '' , which shows line drawn across the River Thames and the various ranges of guns at different points from Tilbury Fort to London .

Gimmestad Church ( ) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Gloppen Municipality in Vestland county , Norway . It is located in the village of Sørstranda , right along the shore of the Gloppefjorden . It is one of the four churches for the Gloppen parish which is part of the Nordfjord prosti ( deanery ) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin . The white , wooden church was built in a long church style in 1910 by the architect Niels Stockfleth Darre Eckhoff . The church seats about 315 people .
History
For centuries , the people of this part of Gloppen attended the Gimmestad Church . By 1880 , the old church was deemed to be in poor condition and too small for the parish , seating only about 80 people . After years of discussions , the Church Ministry was in favor of demolition and replacement , but many of the local residents fought for preserving the old church as a museum . The local people prevailed in January 1909 when plans for building a new church were approved . Plans were made for a new church nearby and the old church was to be preserved as a historic site . Niels Stockfleth Darre Eckhoff was hired to draw plans for the new church which would be located on a site about west of the old church site . Anders Karlsen from Nordfjordeid was the lead builder for the church . The new building was a wooden long church in a Swiss chalet style . The church has two short extensions on either side of the nave which make the church look more cruciform , but they are just for decoration and the interior is a long church design . There is a church porch with a tower on the west end and the chancel and sacristy are on the east end of the nave . The church was consecrated on 16 December 1910 by Bishop Johan Willoch Erichsen .

Gurdwara Makhdoom Pur Pahoran ( Punjabi : ) is a gurdwara situated at Makhdoom Pur Pahoran , a town between Tulamba and Kabirwala .
History
A narrative tells that Guru Nanak set out from Pakpattan and reached a place near Tulamba where Sajjan Thug had set up a trap in the form of a caravan inn . He used to rob the travellers and made an attempt to trap Guru Nanak but failed . Guru Nanak created this Shabd here ; Bronze is bright and shiny , but when it is rubbed , its blackness appears . Washing it , its impurity is not removed , even if it is washed a hundred times . Hearing this Shabd , Sajjan became a friend of Guru . Sajjan 's inn was converted into a Gurdwara to commemorate this event .
Bhai Jodh Singh , disciple and Army General ( Battle of Gurusar ) of Sat Guru Har Gobind Ji was a resident of this village ; this Gurdwara was built by one of his descendants in Samvat 1970 . Following the partition in 1947 , a new Gurdwara was set up in Panipat Haryana by his descendants ( Bhayana Clan ) .
Status
The boundary of the gurdwara runs around in area of two ghumaon with Gurasthan at its centre : There used to be a big pool ( made of marble ) west of it which has now been filled with soil and levelled ; if this soil is dug out , the original pool can be restored . Rooms for the stay of Sangat have been built along the boundary wall . There are green trees , flowery creepers , rose , jasmine and other plants whose flowers blossom all around . At present , Govt Higher Secondary School is housed in this building and Gurasthan is made the headmaster 's office . The inner design of the dome is still the same as it was centuries ago and so are the tiles of the floor , yet other walls and buildings are regularly white washed .

Rochelle Heights is a historic residential neighborhood in the city of New Rochelle , in Westchester County , New York . The area is bordered by the City Park area on the east , Interstate 95 on the south , and Rochelle Park on the west . The Rochelle Heights and Rochelle Park neighborhoods together create the Rochelle Park-Rochelle Heights Historic District .
History
Rochelle Heights was laid out in a number of phases beginning in 1905 by New York architects Mann , MacNellie and Lindeberg . Its landscape design is more efficient than Rochelle Park , reflecting its later period of development . The architecture of Rochelle Heights does not have the same uniformity as Rochelle Park but rather , reflects the diversity of scale and style found in suburban architecture in the early twentieth century , including Queen Anne , shingle , arts and crafts , tudor revival , beax-arts and colonial revival . These two neighborhoods , combined into one historic district in 1986 , reflect the history of suburban design since 1885 when the phenomenon first took hold in the United States .
The plan for Rochelle Heights is organized around a promontory in the northeastern part of the subdivision that was set aside for large houses with the status of water views . As the plan descended from this highpoint , a hierarchy of lots and architecture is shown in a secondary group encircling the hill . The properties at the outer limits of the development are more closely arranged in a tight pattern with detached houses intended for a middle-class clientele . The latter properties provided a buffer against the more random development outside the district and protected the neighborhood 's exclusive environment within .

For the vehicle design where the vehicle 's skin is used as a load-bearing element , see Monocoque .
Unit construction is the design of larger motorcycles where the engine and gearbox components share a single casing . This sometimes includes the design of automobile engines and was often loosely applied to motorcycles with rather different internal layouts such as the flat twin BMW models .
Prior to unit construction , the engine and gearbox had their own separate casings and were connected by a primary chain drive running in an oil bath chaincase . The new system used a similar chain drive and both had 3 separate oil reservoirs for engine , gearbox and primary drive .
Triumph and BSA were already using cast alloy chaincases and started converting to unit construction in the 1950s . A driving factor behind the BSA/Triumph change was that Lucas had declared an intention to abandon production of motorcycle dynamos and magnetos , and instead produce only alternators . By contrast , Velocette , Matchless/AJS and Norton motorcycles continued to be pre-unit construction ( the former machines with pressed-steel primary cases ) until the end of production in the 1960s and 1970s respectively . In reality , the casings were not really `` unitary '' , as the crankcase section was vertically divided in the middle and no oil was shared between the three portions . Only in the 1960s did Japanese motorcycles introduce the now- familiar horizontally-split clam-shell which has become almost universal .
Modern horizontally-split four-stroke engines invariably use single oil reservoir ( whether wet- or dry-sump ; but while this simplifies matters , it is arguable that the previous system of having different types of oil for engine and gearbox is preferable . The BMC Mini was an early example of a car with the `` gearbox-in-the-sump '' ; but this practice of using a single oil reservoir , which has become the norm for motorbikes , is generally undesirable for cars and trucks . Two stroke `` total-loss '' bikes always have separate oil for the gearbox , as engine oil is burned along with the fuel .
Advantages and disadvantages
The advantages of unit construction are :
the combined unit contributes to the stiffness of the entire motorcycle .
unit construction may even enable the engine unit to become a frame stressed member .
the primary chaincase can be lighter and more compact .
the primary chaincase can be shorter , so that wheelbase may also be shorter
engine and transmission are now much more accurately aligned to each other in the frame , improving primary drive life .
the engine is cleaner and fashionably modern in appearance ( compared to earlier designs ) .
A significant disadvantage is that there is no longer any tension adjustment possible of the chain drive between engine and transmission , and tensioning ( which is almost certainly still required ) must be over a rubber-faced steel slipper . However , this is quieter and the tensioner does not wear greatly . This change to unit construction meant that it was no longer possible to choose a gearbox from a different manufacturer ( e.g . a close-ratio unit for racing ) and to send a worn gearbox units to be rebuilt .
History
Early history
Alfred Angas Scott , founder of The Scott Motorcycle Company , designed a motorcycle with unit construction for the engine and gearbox . Production of the motorcycle began in 1908 .
In 1911 , Singer offered motorcycles with unit-construction 299 cc and 535 cc engines .
In 1914 , ABC founder Granville Bradshaw designed a unit-construction horizontally opposed ( 'flat ' ) twin for Sopwith Aircraft , who , at the time , also made motorcycles .
In 1919 , Harley-Davidson introduced the Model W Sport Twin with a unit construction flat-twin .
In 1920 Carlo Guzzi constructed the G.P . 500 prototype with unit-construction . This was followed in 1921by the first Moto Guzzi production model , the `` Normale '' , also a 500cc unit-construction motorcycle .
In 1921 , an expanding Bianchi ( Italy ) showed its first unit-construction side-valve 600 cc V-twin .
In 1923 , Rover introduced a 250 cc unit-construction model , followed by a 350 cc in 1924 , but production ended in 1925 .
In 1923 , the advanced three-speed Triumph single-cylinder 346 cc sv unit-construction Model LS appeared , but did not sell well , and ended production in 1927 .
In 1923 , BMW released its own unit construction shaft drive flat twin of 498 cc . BMW has never built a motorcycle with a separate gearbox .
From 1924 , FN single-cylinder engines changed from semi unit construction ( as seen in the last semi-unit single , the 1922 FN 285TT , in its last year of sale in 1924 , ) to unit construction engines ( as seen in the new-for-1924 M.60 ) .
In 1928 , BSA made their first and only two-stroke , a 175 cc unit construction bike , for only one season , otherwise four-stroke twins became unit construction in 1962 .
The 1930 Triumph 175 cc Model ' X ' two-stroke , two-speed is their first `` all-unit construction '' two-stroke single-cylinder engine .
From 1932 , New Imperial was known for pioneering innovations in unit construction on motorcycles . They made the Unit Minor 150 and Unit Super 250 in this manner and by 1938 all of their machines were unit construction .
In 1938 , Francis-Barnett offered a 125 cc unit-construction Snipe .
In 1946 , the Series B Vincent employed unit construction and used the engine-gearbox as a stressed member of the frame .
The 1947 Sunbeam S7 , an advanced overhead-cam , longitudinal twin , unit construction motorcycle , designed by Erling Poppe , used shaft drive .
In 1957 the Royal Enfield Clipper was replaced by the unit-construction Crusader .
In 1957 the first unit construction twin cylinder motorcycle made by Triumph , the 350 cc ( 21 ci ) 'Twenty One ' 3TA , designed by Edward Turner and Wickes , was introduced for the 21st Anniversary of Triumph Engineering Co. Ltd . Unfortunately it also had the first `` bathtub '' rear enclosure , which proved a sales failure .
The 1958 Ariel Leader used unit construction .
Triumph
Triumph Motorcycles produced its first single-cylinder unit construction model with the 149 cc Terrier launched in 1952 . It was quickly followed by the more popular 196 cc Tiger Cub in 1953 . They made the first twin-cylinder unit construction model in 1957 with the release of the 350 cc Twenty One 3TA ( so named because it was approximately twenty-one cubic inches capacity ) . The 500 cc Triumph 5TA followed , and the 650 cc models were made unit construction in 1963 . The 1963—1969 unit construction 650 cc Triumph Bonneville has become sought- after models , partly as the 1970-onward oil-in-frame chassis was considered inferior .
BSA
Unit singles
The BSA Bantam range of two-stroke engines introduced the unit construction concept to BSA since its introduction in 1949 . BSA produced their first four-stroke unit construction singles in 1959 when they introduced the C15 to replace the venerable c12 single . The unit construction ( in contrast to the separate engine and gearbox of the C10/C11 and c12 ) gave the family of motorcycles started by this model its familiar name .
The C15 was intended as a utility `` get to work '' model , and served this purpose faithfully for many thousands of users . It was a simple and reasonably robust design .
Along with the C15 came the B40 , the 350 cc version . This was no faster than the C15 , but had a little more lugging power . A version of the B40 was also produced ( in considerable quantities ) for various branches of the military . These motorcycles ( known as the `` Ex-WD B40 '' ) were more rugged than the vanilla version ( in particular , the timing-side main bearing was over- rather than under-engineered and an oil filter was fitted ) , slightly de-tuned and given a version of the competition frame . For these reasons , these bikes can make very good buying , and are often used as the basis for competition machines .
Several minor changes were made to the C15 in 7 years ( with some variations on the theme - the `` warmer '' SS80 and SS90 , plus competition versions ) .
In 1967 the model underwent some revisions and a name change to B25 . The model then continued with little variation until BSA collapsed in the early 1970s .
The BSA unit single was an affordable introduction to motorcycling for many young men in the 1960s and 1970s . The simple design meant that inexperienced and under-equipped home mechanics could keep them running under most circumstances . The effects of such inexperienced maintenance led to a slightly undeserved reputation for unreliability - a well maintained and regularly serviced unit single will chug along for a very long time with no problems .
The warmer versions ( such as the much-loved Starfire ) were generally less robust , but their light weight , enjoyable handling and peppy engines meant that many people considered the hours of necessary maintenance a worthwhile trade-off .
Many BSA unit singles were built , meaning there are few 1960s motorcycles with such a large supply of readily available spares . The tunability and ready supply of these motors , combined with their compact and light ( ish ) construction has also made them a popular choice for modern `` Classic '' competition .
The BSA design was based on the Triumph Tiger Cub , first produced in 1952 . The continuation of the model until 1973 speaks well for the popularity and utility of this design , but also reflects badly on the forward-thinking and investment of the BSA management . By 1967 unit singles were looking slow and rattly and the `` charm '' of the traditional British oil-leak was wearing thin . The new breed of Japanese motorcycles arriving on the scene were fast and exotic in comparison , and the buying public can certainly not be blamed for their eventual shunning of the entire British motorcycle industry .

The 2020 Kansas Democratic presidential primary occurred until Saturday , May 2 , 2020 ; this was the sole contest scheduled on that date in the Democratic Party presidential primaries for the 2020 presidential election .
The Kansas primary was a closed party-run primary , undertaken completely by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States . The state awarded 45 delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention , of which 39 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary . Voters cast ranked choice voting ballots , with a voter 's ballot counting for a backup ranked choice if their first choice was in last place and below the 15 percent threshold for winning delegates . Joe Biden won the primary , taking 76.9 % of the vote after the distribution of preferences and excluding inactive votes compared to Bernie Sanders ' 23.2 % .
Procedure
Kansas was the sole state in the Democratic primaries with in-person voting set for May 2 . Because of the coronavirus pandemic , however , in person voting was cancelled and only mail-in voting was utilized . For the first time since 1992 , Kansas Democrats did not use a caucus to apportion delegates . Instead , the Kansas Democratic Party used a party-run primary with ranked-choice voting . Mail-in voting was planned between March 30 and April 24 , with ballots planned to be mailed to every registed Democrat in the state by April 4 . Due to the pandemic every registered Democrat received mail-in ballots already on March 30 , the first day to vote in the election . The postmark deadline to return completed mail-in ballots was extended to voting day , May 2 . Election results were released the next day , May 3 . Kansans would have been able to utilize same-day voter registration for in-person voting .
In the closed party-run primary , voters ranked their top five candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination . Among candidates who did not receive a minimum 15 % of all first-choice votes , the candidate with the fewest first-choices was eliminated . Voters who chose this candidate as their top choice had their votes given to their next choice . If after redistribution there were still candidates with fewer than 15 % of the vote , the process repeated , round by round , until all candidates remaining had reached at least 15 % of the vote . Candidates earned their proportional share of delegates , based on the percentage that each candidate received in the final round of the total tally .
The 39 pledged delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary . Of these , between five and eight were allocated to each of the state 's four congressional districts and another four were allocated to party leaders and elected officials ( PLEO delegates ) , in addition to nine at-large pledged delegates . Originally planned with 33 delegates , the final number included a 20 % bonus of 6 additional delegates awarded by the Democratic National Committee due to the May date , which belonged to Stage III on the primary timetable .
Senate district conventions would have met on Saturday , May 9 , to nominate delegates for subsequent congressional district conventions on Saturday , May 16 , where the district-level national convention delegates should have been designated . The state convention was planned to be held on Saturday , June 6 , to vote on the nine at-large and four PLEO delegates to send to the Democratic National Convention . The 39 pledged delegates Kansas sent to the national convention were joined by six unpledged PLEO delegates ( four members of the Democratic National Committee ; a sole U.S. representative in Sharice Davids ; and the governor , Laura Kelly ) .
Candidates
The following individuals appeared on the ballot in Kansas :
Joe Biden
Tulsi Gabbard ( withdrawn )
Bernie Sanders ( withdrawn )
Elizabeth Warren ( withdrawn )
There was also an uncommited option .

The 1488th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment ( ; Military Unit Number 03216 ) is a surface-to-air missile regiment of the Russian Aerospace Forces .
It was formed in 1960 and soon became the 83rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade ( ) of the Soviet Air Defense Forces . The brigade provided air defense for the Leningrad area with S-75 Dvina and S-125 missiles . After reequipping with S-300PS missiles , the brigade was reorganized as the 1488th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment in 1994 .
History
The brigade was originally formed as the 83rd Air Defense Brigade of Special Designation , a unit of System-100 , the Leningrad air defense missile system , in accordance with a General Staff directive dated 15 January 1958 . It was the first brigade of the system to be formed and was based at Zelenogorsk-4 . The brigade received its equipment between May and July of that year and became operational in its air defense sector in August 1959 . It received its battle flag on 22 April 1959 . In August 1960 , it was redesignated the 83rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade . It included eight battalions of S-75 Dvina missiles , and was reinforced by six S-125 battalions transferred from the 169th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment in 1964 , which had relocated from Vaskelovo to Kornevo and Uglovo to reequip with the S-200V .
In 1967 , the brigade was directly subordinated to the 6th Independent Air Defense Army when the air defense missile system was abolished as an independent headquarters . By a directive of 5 October of that year , the brigade inherited the Order of the Red Banner awarded to the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion of the 189th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment on 19 June 1943 . The 189th provided air defense for Leningrad during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II , and cadres from it were used to form the brigade in the late 1950s .
One of the S-75 battalions of the brigade was stationed at Lisy Nos in the Zhdanovsky District of Leningrad during the 1960s . In 1986 , the brigade became part of the 54th Air Defense Corps . By the late 1980s , the 83rd included twelve missile battalions of S-75s and S-125s . In 1987 , it began rearming with the new S-300PS in two groups of battalions . After the replacement of the S-75s and S-125s had been completed , the brigade was reorganized as the 1488th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment in the summer of 1994 .
In 2009 , the 54th Corps was converted into the 2nd Air Defense Brigade as part of the reform of the Russian Air Forces , and became part of the 1st Air and Air Defense Forces Command . The regiment became part of the 2nd Aerospace Defense Brigade in 2013 and the 2nd Red Banner Air Defense Division in 2014 when the brigade was reorganized . In 2015 the division became part of the 6th Air and Air Defense Forces Army when the latter was reformed . By 2016 the 1488th had been reequipped with new S-400 missiles .

Extreme is an American television adventure drama that premiered on ABC on January 29 , 1995 following Super Bowl XXIX . Starring James Brolin , Extreme was centered on a search and rescue team which operated in the Rocky Mountains .
Although thirteen episodes were ordered and the network had enough faith in the series to give it the coveted post-Super Bowl timeslot , Extreme could not find an audience and ABC cancelled the series after seven episodes aired . The final episode aired on April 6 , 1995 , and the remaining six episodes were never aired in the United States .
The failure of Extreme forced a reconsideration of post-Super Bowl programming strategy by the major networks . NBC chose to commission a special episode of Friends to air immediately following Super Bowl XXX the next year and the experiment was such a success that the other networks have for the most part chosen to air one of their established series after covering the Super Bowl , with particular attention paid to season premieres of popular reality competitions like Survivor and The Voice .
The practice of premiering new series following the Super Bowl has not been fully discontinued ; Fox debuted Family Guy in 1999 , American Dad ! in 2005 , and 24 : Legacy in 2016 while CBS launched Undercover Boss in 2010 and its reboot of The Equalizer in 2021 .
Plot
A search and rescue team operates a Bell 204B `` Super Huey '' helicopter in the Rocky Mountains of Utah . The show features the trials and tribulations of the rescue team and the daring rescues undertaken in `` Steep Mountain . ''
The series was filmed on location in Park City , Utah .

Ryan Ponsonby Burl ( born 15 April 1994 ) is a Zimbabwean cricketer who plays for the national side . He made his international debut for Zimbabwe in February 2017 .
Early life
He quit his university education in Southampton and also sacrificed his county cricket commitments as he decided to play first-class cricket in Zimbabwe .
Domestic and T20 career
In February 2017 , Burl was named in an academy squad by Zimbabwe Cricket to tour England later that year . He made his Twenty20 debut for Mis Ainak Knights in the 2017 Shpageeza Cricket League on 12 September 2017 .
Burl was the leading run-scorer in the 2017–18 Logan Cup for Rising Stars , with 401 runs in five matches . In November 2019 , he was selected to play for the Chattogram Challengers in the 2019–20 Bangladesh Premier League .
In December 2020 , Burl was selected to play for the Rhinos in the 2020–21 Logan Cup .
International career
Burl was part of Zimbabwe 's squad for the 2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup . He made his One Day International ODI debut for Zimbabwe against Afghanistan at the Harare Sports Club on 16 February 2017 .
In December 2017 , Burl was named in Zimbabwe 's Test squad for their one-off Test against South Africa . He made his Test debut for Zimbabwe against South Africa in the Boxing Day Test on 26 December 2017 .
Burl made his Twenty20 International ( T20I ) debut for Zimbabwe against Afghanistan on 5 February 2018 . In September 2019 , during the first match of the 2019–20 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series against Bangladesh , Burl scored the second most runs by a Zimbabwe batsman off one over in a T20I match , with 30 against Shakib Al Hasan .
In May 2021 , he pointed out the harsh realities and daily struggles of an average Zimbabwean cricketer by posting a tweet in his official Twitter handle about his torn shoes and how he apples glue to his shoes to play cricket and also urged sponsorship for himself as well as fellow Zimbabwean players . His tweet put him in spotlight and under some scrutiny after it exposed the flaws of Zimbabwe Cricket as it implied to outsiders that Zimbabwe Cricket does n't care about their players . Nike , Inc. made a prompt response by agreeing to sponsor Ryan Burl 's shoes .
In July 2022 , he was named in Zimbabwe 's squad for the 2022 ICC Men 's T20 World Cup Global Qualifier B tournament which was held in Zimbabwe .
During the 15th over of Zimbabwe 's innings against Bangladesh during the third and final match of the T20I series on 2 August 2022 , which was also a decider with series already at 1-1 , Burl smashed Nasum Ahmed 's over for a record 34 runs including five sixes and a four to propel Zimbabwe to a total of 156/8 which they would later go on to defend successfully . Burl 's 34 runs in an over is also the joint second most by any batsman in a single over of a T20I equalling with Tim Seifert and Ross Taylor 's 34 runs rampage on Shivam Dube . He also added a crucial 79 run partnership in quick time with Luke Jongwe for the seventh wicket at a big run rate of 15.29 per over which lifted Zimbabwe from a precarious position of 67/6 to a respectable total of 156/8 . Burl was awarded the player of the match for his 28 ball 54 which powered Zimbabwe to a 10 run victory and sealed the series for the hosts 2-1 . It was also the first time Zimbabwe secured a home bilateral T20I series win against a full member nation .
During the third and final ODI against Australia at Townsville on 3 September 2022 , Burl picked up his maiden ODI five-wicket haul and he also registered his career best bowling performance in ODIs by taking 5/10 within a space of just 18 deliveries inside three overs which sparked a batting collapse by Australia as he cleaned up the Aussie tail by picking up the last five wickets of the Australian innings . His bowling performance restricted Australia to just 141 runs and helped Zimbabwe to register a famous historic win over Australia as it turned out to be Zimbabwe 's first ever ODI win as well as their first ever win in any format against Australia on Australian soil . For his record breaking performances with the ball , he was awarded the player of the match . His figures of 5/10 are also the best bowling figures by a Zimbabwean bowler on Australian soil against Australia and also the second best bowling spell by a visiting legspinner on Australian soil behind Yuzvendra Chahal 's spell of 6/42 in 2019 . He also became the first Zimbabwean bowler to take a fifer against Australia in ODIs , surpassing the previous record held by Duncan Fletcher during the 1983 Cricket World Cup and he also registered the second best bowling figures for Zimbabwe in ODI history just behind Graeme Cremer 's haul of 6/46 which came against Kenya in 2009 . His haul of 5 for 10 is also the cheapest five wicket hauls taken by a bowler against Australia in ODIs surpassing the previous record held by Ravi Shastri .

French 's is an American brand of prepared mustard , condiments , fried onions , and other food items that was created by Robert Timothy French . French 's `` Cream Salad Brand '' mustard debuted to the world at the 1904 St. Louis World 's Fair . By 1921 , French 's Mustard had adopted its trademark pennant and begun advertising to the general public . French 's is now owned by McCormick & Company .
History
Brothers Robert and George French bought a flour mill in 1883 in Fairport , New York . It burned down in 1884 and they relocated the flour mill to Rochester , New York . They named their mill the R.T. French Company . Robert French died in 1893 and brother George became company president . George ( who developed the creamy yellow mustard ) and another brother , Francis , introduced French 's mustard in 1904 .
In 1926 , French 's was sold to J . & J. Colman of the United Kingdom , a company that produced home care products such as Lysol , Reckitt 's Blue and Brasso , and its own mustard brand , as well as other products such as the Frank 's RedHot condiment line .
In 1928 , the Atlantis Sales Corporation was formed as a subsidiary of R. T. French to handle sales and distribution of French 's , Reckitt , and Colman products . Atlantis remained a separate entity through the nineteen-fifties .
In 1960 , French 's purchased L. C. Forman and Sons Pickle Company of Pittsford , New York . Forman produced a variety of pickle products , including a well-known piccalilli relish .
In 1965 , French 's introduced a new line of `` Cattlemen 's '' barbecue sauce . The line was inaugurated with the trip of a horse-drawn `` chuck wagon '' from Buffalo , New York , across upstate New York to New York City and then to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in June , 1965 .
In 1970 , the company purchased Widmer Wine Cellars of Naples , New York . The winery was sold in 1983 .
In 1985 , the company sold its instant potato operations in Shelley , Idaho , to Pillsbury .
In 1986 , Reckitt & Colman acquired Durkee Famous Foods ; in 1987 and consolidated headquarters in New Jersey . Durkee 's French onions became French 's crispy fried onions .
In 1999 , Reckitt & Colman merged with Benckiser NV to form Reckitt Benckiser .
In 2017 , McCormick & Company acquired French 's from Reckitt Benckiser .
For many years , the fictitious `` Carol French '' was the face of the company . Her name appeared on numerous recipes and cookbooks , the oldest of which may be Dining Delights from 1948 .
Locations
Until 1987 , French 's headquarters was located in Rochester , New York . The headquarters is now located in Chester , New Jersey . During its heyday , French 's was a sponsor of the local weather forecast , featuring its address prominently in television advertising . They also were a prominent sponsor of the Rochester Red Wings baseball club , often in conjunction with a local brand of hot dogs , Tobin 's First Prize . The former headquarters location at 1 Mustard Street is now home to a variety of professional offices and public agencies .
French 's also had facilities in Shelley , Idaho , for potato products . A plant in Souderton , Pennsylvania , was constructed in 1957 and closed in the 1990s . A plant in Fresno , California , closed in 1994 . Manufacturing operations were consolidated in Springfield , Missouri .
Products
Historically R. T. French may have manufactured a complete line of spices and extracts , condiments , pickle products , sauces and gravy mixes , instant potato products , and pet care products , in particular canary and parakeet seeds .
As of 2016 , in certain markets French 's markets mustards , Worcestershire sauce , a line of mayonnaise-based products , ketchup , barbecue sauce , potato sticks , and fried jalapeños , as well as a line of French 's fried onions .

BxPC-3 ( BxPC3 ) is a human pancreatic cancer cell line used in the study of pancreatic adenocarcinomas and treatments thereof .
BxPC-3 cells were derived from a 61-year-old female in 1986 , and were confirmed to be tumorigenic in athymic nude mice , with moderate differentiation . The cells produce mucin , and exhibit an epithelial morphology . BxPC-3 cells lack a KRAS mutation , though it is commonly found in pancreatic cancers . BcPC-3 cells , along with JoPaca-1 cells , have high expression of cancer stem cell markers .
BxPC-3 has been used in tumorigenicity studies , pancreatic cancer therapy research , and other biomedical applications . The cells have been additionally studied for their phenotypic and genotypic properties as they can be applied to pancreatic cancer drug development ; in particular , BxPC-3 cells have high expression of the angiogenic factors IL-8 , VEGF , and PGE2 , which can serve as potential drug targets .

In thermodynamics , an adiabatic wall between two thermodynamic systems does not allow heat or chemical substances to pass across it , in other words there is no heat transfer nor mass transfer .
In theoretical investigations , it is sometimes assumed that one of the two systems is the surroundings of the other . Then it is assumed that the work transferred is reversible within the surroundings , but in thermodynamics it is not assumed that the work transferred is reversible within the system . The assumption of reversibility in the surroundings has the consequence that the quantity of work transferred is well defined by macroscopic variables in the surroundings . Accordingly , the surroundings are sometimes said to have a reversible work reservoir .
Along with the idea of an adiabatic wall is that of an adiabatic enclosure . It is easily possible that a system has some boundary walls that are adiabatic and others that are not . When some are not adiabatic , then the system is not adiabatically enclosed , though adiabatic transfer of energy as work can occur across the adiabatic walls .
The adiabatic enclosure is important because , according to one widely cited author , Herbert Callen , `` An essential prerequisite for the measurability of energy is the existence of walls that do not permit the transfer of energy in the form of heat . '' In thermodynamics , it is customary to assume a priori the physical existence of adiabatic enclosures , though it is not customary to label this assumption separately as an axiom or numbered law .
Construction of the concept of an adiabatic enclosure
Definitions of transfer of heat
In theoretical thermodynamics , respected authors vary in their approaches to the definition of quantity of heat transferred . There are two main streams of thinking . One is from a primarily empirical viewpoint ( which will here be referred to as the thermodynamic stream ) , to define heat transfer as occurring only by specified macroscopic mechanisms ; loosely speaking , this approach is historically older . The other ( which will here be referred to as the mechanical stream ) is from a primarily theoretical viewpoint , to define it as a residual quantity after transfers of energy as macroscopic work , between two bodies or closed systems , have been determined for a process , so as to conform with the principle of conservation of energy or the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems ; this approach grew in the twentieth century , though was partly manifest in the nineteenth .
Thermodynamic stream of thinking
In the thermodynamic stream of thinking , the specified mechanisms of heat transfer are conduction and radiation . These mechanisms presuppose recognition of temperature ; empirical temperature is enough for this purpose , though absolute temperature can also serve . In this stream of thinking , quantity of heat is defined primarily through calorimetry .
Though its definition of them differs from that of the mechanical stream of thinking , the empirical stream of thinking nevertheless presupposes the existence of adiabatic enclosures . It defines them through the concepts of heat and temperature . These two concepts are coordinately coherent in the sense that they arise jointly in the description of experiments of transfer of energy as heat .
Mechanical stream of thinking
In the mechanical stream of thinking about a process of transfer of energy between two bodies or closed systems , heat transferred is defined as a residual amount of energy transferred after the energy transferred as work has been determined , assuming for the calculation the law of conservation of energy , without reference to the concept of temperature . There are five main elements of the underlying theory .
The existence of states of thermodynamic equilibrium , determinable by precisely one ( called the non-deformation variable ) more variable of state than the number of independent work ( deformation ) variables .
That a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium of a body have a well defined internal energy , that is postulated by the first law of thermodynamics .
The universality of the law of conservation of energy .
The recognition of work as a form of energy transfer .
The universal irreversibility of natural processes .
The existence of adiabatic enclosures .
The existence of walls permeable only to heat .
Axiomatic presentations of this stream of thinking vary slightly , but they intend to avoid the notions of heat and of temperature in their axioms . It is essential to this stream of thinking that heat is not presupposed as being measurable by calorimetry . It is essential to this stream of thinking that , for the specification of the thermodynamic state of a body or closed system , in addition to the variables of state called deformation variables , there be precisely one extra real-number-valued variable of state , called the non-deformation variable , though it should not be axiomatically recognized as an empirical temperature , even though it satisfies the criteria for one .
Accounts of the adiabatic wall
The authors Buchdahl , Callen , and Haase make no mention of the passage of radiation , thermal or coherent , across their adiabatic walls . Carathéodory explicitly discusses problems with respect to thermal radiation , which is incoherent , and he was probably unaware of the practical possibility of laser light , which is coherent . Carathéodory in 1909 says that he leaves such questions unanswered .
For the thermodynamic stream of thinking , the notion of empirical temperature is coordinately presupposed in the notion of heat transfer for the definition of an adiabatic wall .
For the mechanical stream of thinking , the exact way in which the adiabatic wall is defined is important .
In the presentation of Carathéodory , it is essential that the definition of the adiabatic wall should in no way depend upon the notions of heat or temperature . This is achieved by careful wording and reference to transfer of energy only as work . Buchdahl is careful in the same way . Nevertheless , Carathéodory explicitly postulates the existence of walls that are permeable only to heat , that is to say impermeable to work and to matter , but still permeable to energy in some unspecified way . One might be forgiven for inferring from this that heat is energy in transfer across walls permeable only to heat , and that such exist as undefined postulated primitives .
In the widely cited presentation of Callen , the notion of an adiabatic wall is introduced as a limit of a wall that is poorly conductive of heat . Although Callen does not here explicitly mention temperature , he considers the case of an experiment with melting ice , done on a summer 's day , when , the reader may speculate , the temperature of the surrounds would be higher . Nevertheless , when it comes to a hard core definition , Callen does not use this introductory account . He eventually defines an adiabatic enclosure as does Carathéodory , that it passes energy only as work , and does not pass matter . Accordingly , he defines heat , therefore , as energy that is transferred across the boundary of a closed system other than by work .
As suggested for example by Carathéodory and used for example by Callen , the favoured instance of an adiabatic wall is that of a Dewar flask . A Dewar flask has rigid walls . Nevertheless , Carathéodory requires that his adiabatic walls shall be imagined to be flexible , and that the pressures on these flexible walls be adjusted and controlled externally so that the walls are not deformed , unless a process is undertaken in which work is transferred across the walls . The work considered by Carathéodory is pressure-volume work . Another text considers asbestos and fiberglass as good examples of materials that constitute a practicable adiabatic wall .
The mechanical stream of thinking thus regards the adiabatic enclosure 's property of not allowing the transfer of heat across itself as a deduction from the Carathéodory axioms of thermodynamics .

Biography
Background
Joshua Nelson is Black and Jewish and he goes by the nickname “ the prince of kosher gospel , ” and he has called himself `` the KKK 's worst nightmare . '' His grandparents emigrated to the US from Senegal , and he became fascinated with music when he was 8 , while living in Brooklyn . His fascination lasted after he graduated from Newark 's Performing Arts High School . Nelson was the high school 's official soloist for the 4 years he studied there . He went on to do a 2-year college and kibbutz program in Israel studying at the Hebrew Union College as well as at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
While attending Hebrew University , he started blending Hebrew texts with gospel melodies and arranging Jewish hymns in gospel style , resulting in solo CDs like `` Hebrew Soul '' ( 2004 ) and `` Mi Chamocha '' ( 2005 ) .
Both of Mr. Nelson 's parents are Jewish , and his family attended temple at a black synagogue in Brooklyn , then switched to Sharey Tefilo-Israel , in South Orange , New Jersey , a reform synagogue with a liberal reputation .
Jewish Gospel singing
Nelson is both a Jewish Gospel singer in the tradition of Mahalia Jackson , and a full-time Hebrew teacher in the Hebrew school at Sharey Tefilo-Israel , a Reform synagogue in South Orange , NJ , when he is not on the road . He also serves as director of music at Hopewell Baptist Church in Newark , NJ , which is housed in the building of a former synagogue ( the former B'nai Jeshurun ) .
Nelson has performed with musical legends including Wynton Marsalis and Aretha Franklin and Stephanie Mills and Billy Preston , as well as gospel singers Albertina Walker , the Barrett Sisters , Hezekiah Walker , Kirk Franklin , Dottie Peoples , Dorothy Norwood , Vanessa Bell Armstrong , Timothy Wright , Carlton Pearson , and Bobby Jones & New Life . Nelson also performs frequently with the Jewish Klezmer band The Klezmatics , and performed with the late jazz greats Cab Calloway and Dizzy Gillespie .
Nelson sang before Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson in 2001 , and performed for an audience in Jerusalem that included then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon .
Film
A film was made about Nelson entitled Keep on Walking : Joshua Nelson : The Jewish Gospel Singer ( 2000 ) . It was voted Best Documentary in the Northampton Film Festival , and won the Best Film Award ( the Paul Robeson Award ) at the Newark Black Film Festival .
The film aired on PBS and affiliate networks nationally in 2003 and 2004 . Internationally it aired on the national networks of Sweden , Denmark , France , Germany , the Netherlands , Japan , Israel , and Italy in 2003 and 2004 .
TV
Nelson 's TV credits include “ A+ for Kids ” on WWOR-TV ; “ SingSation , ” a Gospel program taped in Chicago and broadcast nationally on CBS-TV ( 1995–97 , 2005 ) ; and Black Entertainment Television 's The Bobby Jones Gospel Hour ( 1995–2003 ) . Nelson also appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show , which aired October 2004 and December 2004 . Alongside Jamie Foxx , Mr. Nelson was named by Oprah as “ The Next Big Thing . ”

Long Hunter State Park is a state park in Davidson County and Rutherford County , Tennessee , located in the southeastern United States . The park is mostly situated along the eastern shores of Percy Priest Lake , an artificial lake created by an impoundment of the Stones River .
Long Hunter State Park comprises three lake sections — Baker 's Grove in the north , Couchville at the center , and Bryant Grove to the south . All three sections are connected by narrow strips of land . The park also manages Sellars Farm , a state archaeological area near Lebanon to the east .
Geographical setting
The West Fork of Stones River flows northward from its source in the hills around Rock Springs , passes through Murfreesboro and Stones River National Battlefield , and merges with the East Fork of Stones River near Smyrna . The East Fork flows westward from its source atop Short Mountain , at the edge of the Highland Rim , and passes north of Murfreesboro . The confluence of these two rivers forms Stones River proper , and marks the southern extreme of J. Percy Priest Lake .
Stones River 's J. Percy Priest Lake impoundment stretches for approximately between the confluence of the West Fork and East Fork to the south and the J. Percy Priest Dam near Donelson to the north . Downstream from the dam , Stones River winds its way through a series of bends toward its mouth along the Cumberland River , just east of Nashville . Long Hunter State Park is officially located in Hermitage , a suburb of Nashville .
Tennessee State Route 171 follows Mount Juliet Road south from Interstate 40 to the park 's boundary . The two roads then split , with TN-171 continuing west along Hobson Pike to the park 's Couchville section , and Mount Juliet Road ( now South Mount Juliet Road ) continuing south to the park 's Bryant Grove section . Granny Wright Road , which intersects TN-171 just north of its split with Mount Juliet Road , accesses the Volunteer Trailhead and the park 's Bakers Grove section .
History
Native Americans were hunting in the Stones River Basin as early as 12,000 years ago , as evidenced by flint tools found on the grounds of Long Hunter State Park . The Nashville Basin is full of evidence of Paleo-Indian habitation , including Clovis points and a mastodon kill site in Williamson County , several miles west of Stones River on the other side of Nashville . A fortified Mississippian-era village was located near Lebanon at Sellars Farm , the site of which is now maintained by Long Hunter State Park . The Sellars Farm site was occupied between A.D. 1000–1300 , and included a series of `` platform '' mounds and a central plaza .
Among the first Euro-Americans to explore the Nashville Basin were small groups of hunters known as long hunters . Long hunters had arrived in the region by the 1760s , typically following the Cumberland River valley from Virginia . The term `` long hunter '' referred to the relatively lengthy period of time ( usually 6–18 months ) a typical long hunt lasted . Most long hunters initially sought animal furs for sale back in Virginia , although later long hunters were employed as surveyors . Stones River , upon which Long Hunter State Park is situated , is named for Uriah Stone , a long hunter who allegedly had all of his furs stolen by a French companion while hunting along the river in 1767 . Geographical and topographical information gathered by long hunters would later be invaluable to the Nashville area 's first settlers .
After the Cherokee ceded the Stones River area to the United States in 1805 , settlers began to arrive in large numbers . Among the first to settle at what is now Long Hunter State Park were Sherrod Bryant and his son , Henderson , who were living in the valley by 1820 . The Bryants , who were the namesake for Bryant Grove , were one of the wealthiest African American families in the state by the time of Sherrod 's death in 1854 . Other early settlers included the Couch family , who operated a store and river crossing just north of Bryant Grove .
In 1963 , largely due to the demand for flood control along the volatile Stones River , the United States Army Corps of Engineers began construction on Stewart 's Ferry Dam near Donelson . The dam — which was renamed for Congressman James Percy Priest ( 1900–1956 ) — was completed in 1968 . The impoundment of the river forced water to back up through underground channels , leading to the formation of Couchville Lake , the small lake situated near the center of the park . In 1972 , the Corps of Engineers leased of land on the east shore of the reservoir to the state of Tennessee for the formation of a state park . Long Hunter State Park officially opened in 1978 .
The Sellars Mound site , which had been excavated by Peabody Museum curator Frederic Putnam in the late 1870s , was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and purchased by the state of Tennessee in 1974 . In the late 1990s , the Friends of Sellars Farm State Archaeological Area was formed by volunteers who began promoting the site and offering tours . The site became a satellite of Long Hunter State Park in 2004 .
The park today
Long Hunter State Park consists of approximately managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation . The park includes two boat launch ramps on J. Percy Priest Lake , several miles of hiking trails , several group campsites and one backcountry campsite , a meeting facility , and a visitor center . Non-motorized boats are allowed on Couchville Lake .
The Volunteer Trail follows the lakeshore , connecting the Couchville and Bakers Grove sections . Two back country campsites are located at the end of the trail . A flat , paved trail circles Couchville Lake ( which is not connected by surface water to Percy Priest Lake ) , and includes a bridge spanning the eastern end of the lake . The Jones Mill Trail , in the Bryant Grove section , leads to the top of Bald Knob , a clear hilltop that overlooks J. Percy Priest Lake .

Majlis al Jinn , also Majlis al-Jinn ( , ) is the second-largest known cave chamber in the world , as measured by the surface area of the floor . It ranks lower when measured by volume . The cave is located in a remote area of the Selma Plateau at 1,380 metres above sea level in the Sultanate of Oman , 100 km south-east from Muscat .
Description
The Selma Plateau is a shallow syncline on the north-eastern limb of the Jabal Bani Jabir anticline . The cave was formed in fossiliferous carbonate rocks of the Middle Eocene Hadhramaut Group , Dammam Formation . It is one of five vertical cave entrances on the Selma Plateau , but the only one with no lower exit .
Majlis al Jinn is a single chamber measuring about 310 metres by 225 metres , with a domed ceiling 120 metres high and three entrances in the roof . The totally free-standing roof is only about 40 metres thick over most of the cave . The deepest part of the cave is 178 metres below the top of the highest entrance . The volume of the chamber is approximately 4,000,000 cubic metres , and the floor area is 58,000 square metres .
When it was surveyed in 1985 , Majlis al Jinn was the second largest known cave chamber in the world by volume . However , more than 15 chambers larger than Majlis al Jinn have been surveyed since that time .
There are no visible lower exits or passages leading from the chamber–these passages most likely have been blocked by debris on the cave floor . Water entering the cave collects along the lowest part of the floor , then slowly infiltrates into the fine-grained , mud-cracked sediment or evaporates . The entrances receive surface runoff from only a small drainage area , so water never reaches most parts of the cave . While surface temperatures can exceed 40 °C , air temperatures in the chamber are a constant 17–18 °C .
Access to the cavern is only through a free descent of one of three vertical entrances in the ceiling , formed by water seeping through the weakened marly limestone in the zones of fracturing . The two largest entrances are called Asterisk ( Khoshilat Beya Al Hiyool ) and First Drop ( Khoshilat Maqandeli ) , the smallest is Cheryl 's Drop ( Khoshilat Minqod ) . Entrance depths : Cheryl 's Drop - 158.2 meters . Asterisk - 139.6 meters . First Drop - 118.0 meters .
Below the two larger entrances are high piles of rocks ( `` breakdown . '' ) The remains of goats , birds , and snakes have been found on the floor of the chamber . The entrance openings in the ceiling provide ambient light in the chamber most of the day . There are only a few stalactites and draperies on the ceiling and walls , but moderate and fragile speleothems are common on the floor . Growth only occurs during times of seepage and drips following heavy rains .
Access
Until fairly recently there had not been a way to reach the cave by car , so cavers had to hike in carrying their equipment or rent donkeys from a village a few hours walk from the cave entrance . The original explorers , Don and Cheryl , often flew into the area by helicopter . Now the cave can be reached on a rough track , which requires four-wheel drive .
Cavers entering Majlis al Jinn require about 200m of specialized rope and equipment to descend and ascend safely . For several years tourism companies had been providing caving trips into Majlis al Jinn , providing equipment and training .
Majlis al Jinn had grown in popularity as a BASE jumping site , particularly for special promotions . Felix Baumgartner is known to have BASE jumped in the cave . However the uncontrolled use of the cave for BASE jumping and the degradation of the area surrounding the cave seem to be the main reason behind the cave being placed off limits by the Oman government in 2008 .
In 2008 , the Ministry of Tourism issued a plan to develop Majlis al Jinn as a show cave , after their first show cave attracted 75,000 visitors in the first year of operation ( 2007-8 ) .
In 2014 , rock climbers Stefan Glowacz and Chris Sharma abseiled into the cave and climbed out via a very steeply overhanging route up the inside of the dome , which they claimed as the world 's largest unclimbed roof .
History
The entrances were discovered in June 1983 by Americans W. Don Davison , Jr. ( nickname : D2 ) and his wife , Cheryl S. Jones . Don , a hydrogeologist , who was employed by the government of Oman 's Public Authority for Water Resources ( PAWR ) , which later became the Ministry of Water Resources . The cave was located and mapped as part of the PAWR 's Karst Research Program .
Exploration of Majlis Al Jinn began on 23 June 1983 , when Don rappelled down the 118m First Drop . Cheryl 's Drop was first negotiated on 1 March 1984 , by Cheryl Jones . The 158m drop is the deepest free rappel into any known cave in Oman or the Arabian Peninsula . Finally , Don descended the Asterisk on 22 April 1985 .
Don and Cheryl surveyed and photographed the cave in April and May , 1985 . The map and cross-sections they created , as well as photos , were originally published in the special PAWR report and have been reproduced many times since .
Omanis living in the area of the Selma Plateau told Don and Cheryl that they did not have names for any of the holes on the plateau that served as entrances to the caves . Thus , Cheryl gave the cave its name , referring to the Omani belief that jinn live in caves . Years later locals said they call the cave `` Khoshilat Maqandeli '' from the refuge for goats near one of the entrances . Nowadays locals refer to this cave as Khoshilat Maqandeli , while internationally it is known as Majlis al Jinn .
Don authored the first published account of the cave 's discovery as a special report Majlis Al Jinn Cave , Sultanate of Oman , issued by the PAWR in October , 1985 . A second article by Don , Meeting Room of the Spirits , was featured in the September–October , 1990 , issue of Aramco World magazine . Majlis al Jinn was included in a story in the April , 2003 , issue of National Geographic Magazine .

A leadership election was held by the Likud party on 26 December 2019 . Incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu defeated Gideon Sa'ar by a large majority .
Background
After the April 2019 Israeli legislative election , Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition by the deadline of 29 May . Instead of letting Benny Gantz attempt to form a coalition of his own , the majority of the Knesset dissolved itself , and a snap election was held on 17 September 2019 .
The second election was inconclusive , prompting warnings of a third election . The threat was deemed unacceptable by the opposition and the general public , and Netanyahu called on Gantz to form a national unity government , even offering to cede the position of Prime Minister some time in the future . Gantz rejected this offer , noting that Netanyahu 's proposed unity government would include all of Netanyahu 's right-wing allies , but none of Gantz 's centre-left allies . Yair Lapid , then a member of Gantz 's Blue and White alliance , also refused to sit with Likud as long as Netanyahu was its leader , due to the criminal cases against Netanyahu .
In October 2019 , amid coalition talks , Netanyahu indicated that he was considering holding snap primaries for party leadership . Gideon Sa'ar said in a tweet , `` I 'm ready . '' After Netanyahu decided against holding a leadership election , Sa'ar said that he would run in the next election and would support Netanyahu until then .
On 21 November 2019 , Netanyahu was officially indicted for breach of trust , accepting bribes , and fraud . As a result of the indictment , some in Likud began to support Sa'ar in his bid for the chairmanship of the party . On 24 November 2019 , Sa'ar asked the Likud Central Committee to schedule a party leadership race within two weeks .
Polling
Results
Sa'ar won 7 of the 116 polling places , with Netanyahu winning the rest . Nearly all of Sa'ar 's victories were in majority Druze towns and cities , indicating that Druze voters were still upset over Netanyahu 's support of the 2018 Nation State Bill .

Kabul , capital of Afghanistan , fell in November 2001 to the Northern Alliance forces during the War in Afghanistan . Northern Alliance forces began their attack on the city on 13 November and made swift progress against Taliban forces that were heavily weakened by American and British air strikes . The advance moved ahead of plans , and the next day the Northern Alliance forces ( supported by ODA 555 ) entered Kabul and met no resistance inside the city . Taliban forces retreated to Kandahar in the south .
Coupled with the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif five days earlier , the capture of Kabul was a significant blow to Taliban control of Afghanistan . As a result of all the losses , surviving members of the Taliban and al-Qaeda retreated toward Kandahar , the spiritual birthplace and home of the Taliban movement , and Tora Bora .
Background
By late 2001 , the Taliban had seized control of approximately 90 % of the country during the 1996-2001 Afghan Civil War , and with the death of Northern Alliance general Ahmad Shah Massoud there were concerns the entire country would fall under their control . Their fighters consisted of between 25,000 and 30,000 fighters , and were supported by other groups including between 2000 and 3000 Arab fighters in Osama Bin Laden 's 055 Brigade .
On 10 September , the Bush Administration agreed to plan to oust the Taliban should they refuse to hand over Osama Bin Laden . Following the September 11 Attacks , on 14 September , the United States demanded that the Taliban surrender all known al-Qaeda associates , provide intelligence on bin Laden and his affiliates , and expel all terrorists from Afghanistan .
On 7 October , after the Taliban failed to hand over bin Laden , the United States began their bombing campaign , and over the next month Northern Alliance forces , supported by US Special Forces and airstrikes , advanced across the country , capturing several key cities .
On 12 November , a brief battle took place on Shamali Plain between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance north of Kabul . For two years during the Afghan Civil War the frontline had been stalemated here , but with the Taliban demoralized by the fall of the northern cities , under constant attack by American air support , and fearing encirclement , they fell back to Kabul following just three hours of fighting , opening the road to the city . Following the battle , the Taliban forces in Kabul evacuated the city , emptying the national treasury but in their haste leaving behind weapons and other possessions .
Fall of Kabul
Discussions had been held between the Northern Alliance and various foreign governments , including the United States , Britain , and Pakistan , about the possible seizure of Kabul , with the American Secretary of State Colin Powell expressing that the foreign governments would prefer the alliance invest the city and not seize it , in order to improve the ability to form a broad and successful post-war government . The response to this pressure varied ; some spokesmen agreed to this , while others suggested that they would push on to Kabul and on 12 November , as alliance forces neared the city , the British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his expectation that alliance commanders would honour their commitment and not seize the city .
Initially the alliance held back from the city , with security guards being seen holding back armour and truckloads of infantry , but this pause was short-lived , and the alliance proved unable or unwilling to prevent their forces from entering the city .
Aftermath
With the fall of the city , there were some incidents of vengeance against the Taliban ; the BBC 's John Simpson reported hearing chants of `` kill the Taliban '' from the inhabitants of Kabul as he entered the city , with many Taliban fighters , particularly foreign fighters from the Arab Peninsula and Pakistan , being lynched and left in ditches while others were beaten with rifles and fists after their capture .
The liberation from the Taliban also resulted in the practice of behaviours formerly prohibited ; the `` great Afghan passion '' of kite flying , which the Taliban had tried to stamp out , was taken up again , music was played , and young men lined up at street barbers to cut off the beard the Taliban had forced them to wear – though most would choose to keep it .
The fall of the city to the alliance did bring concerns about the long-lasting stability in the country . The alliance primarily consisted of minority ethnic groups within Afghanistan ; Uzbeks , Tajiks , and Hazaras , while the Taliban was dominated by the majority ethnic group , the Pashtuns , and it was feared that the seizure of the city would make it more difficult to form a broad and inclusive coalition that would bring stability to the nation , particularly if the Taliban position in the south did not collapse and they continued to fight on as a guerrilla force .

It is native to the Indo-Pacific Ocean from the eastern part of Africa to the Persian Gulf .
Taxonomy
Pterois russelii was first formally described in 1831 by the English naturalist Edward Turner Bennett with the type locality given as Coromandel Coast in India . Molecular studies , and some morphological data too , have indicated that this species and the luna lionfish ( P. lunulata ) are the same species , P. russelii . The specific name honours the Scottish surgeon and herpetologist Patrick Russell , who had illustrated and described , without naming , this species in 1803 . Bennett , misspelt Russell 's name by leaving out the final l , as Cuvier and Valenciennes did on a consistent basis .
Description
Pterois russelii has 13 spines and between 10 and 12 soft rays in its dorsal fin and 3 spines and 7 or 8 soft rays in its anal fin . It has a whitish body striped vertically with reddish brown . This species has no rows of small dark spots on the soft dorsal , anal and caudal fins which are a feature of related species , and it has comparatively short dorsal-fin spines . The maximum published standard length of Russell 's lionfish is .
Distribution and habitat
Pterois russelii has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution from the coast of eastern Africa as far south as South Africa . It then occurs from Oman east to Japan and Australia . It has been recorded in the Red Sea but this was only confirmed in 2016 . In Australian waters Russell 's lionfish is found from the Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia around the northern tropical coasts to the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland . It occurs at depths of , where it is found in areas of muddy substrate in shletered shallow estuaries , bays and coastal waters down to deeper waters in quiet offshore reefs .

Matvei Alekseevich Usenko ( ; , – May 12 1943 ) was a major general of the Red Army during the Second World War .
Biography
In 1918 he joined the Red Army , and during the Civil War served with enough distinction to be awarded both the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of the Red Star . During the interwar years he commanded the 63rd Cavalry Regiment for more than two years in 1933-35 , then was transferred to serve two years as the assistant commanding officer of the prestigious Special Cavalry Division named for I.V . Stalin . He went on to the position of acting commander of that division for the following year . In 1938 he spent three months as Inspector of Cavalry for the Far Eastern Separate Red Banner Army , during which time he was promoted to the rank of Kombrig . He went on to take command of the 31st Cavalry Division for over a year . From December , 1939 , until the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War he attended the Military Academy of the General Staff . On June 4 , 1940 , he was promoted to the rank of major general .
At the outbreak of war , Usenko was given command of the 1st Airborne Corps ( a division-sized unit ) in Southwestern Front . He bravely and skilfully led this unit through July and August , participating in the defense of Kiev . He escaped from the Kiev encirclement with a portion of his troops , and , after a brief assignment as deputy commanding officer of 26th Army in December he was assigned to command of the 2nd Cavalry Corps in Southern Front .
On April 9 , 1942 , Southern Front headquarters sent a telegram to the Soviet High Command stating that , in accordance with the Ukrainian SSR criminal code , Usenko had been sentenced to 'deprivation of his freedom ' for 10 years for commission of a military crime . However , given the shortage of experienced senior officers , Usenko 's sentence was delayed until after the war . After examining the legal process , the USSR People 's Commissariat for Defence annulled the sentence , but reduced Usenko to the rank of colonel . It further recommended that Southwestern Front , at its own discretion , appoint Usenko to command of a rifle division .
On May 16 Usenko was reduced in rank , and on June 22 he was appointed to command of the 226th Rifle Division . During the following two months he led the division through the trials of the German summer offensive , once again with considerable skill . The remnants of the 226th ( later the 95th Guards Rifle Division ) went back to be reformed on August 14 , and Usenko was sidelined until he was given command of the 343rd Rifle Division on December 23 .
Usenko led this division through the later stages of Operation Koltso , the reduction of the encircled German 6th Army at Stalingrad , as part of 66th Army . During the course of the operation the much-depleted division was officially credited with capturing 6,647 enemy officers and men , and seizing 67 artillery pieces , 297 machine guns , 30 tanks , 521 other vehicles , and 5,253 rifles .
Following the German defeat , Usenko regained his rank of major general on May 2 , 1943 , and on May 4 his division became the 97th Guards Rifle Division . General Usenko continued in command of the 97th Guards for just a few days ; on May 12 he died near Voronezh after being blown up by a mine while his vehicle was crossing a road .

The Godly Man 's Picture is a work of systematic theology by Thomas Watson , a 17th century English Puritan preacher . The full title is The Godly Man 's Picture Drawn with a Scripture Pencil , or , Some Characteristic Marks of a Man who is Going to Heaven . The book is a work of English Puritan spirituality .
Purpose
The book 's purpose , according to Watson , is to describe a godly person , `` in his full lineaments ... that all into whose hands this book may providentially come , may be so enamoured with piety as to embrace it heartily . ''
Structure
The book follows a strict outline format and progressive logic , with many points made through the asking of a question , a series of in-depth answers , and several applications to be drawn from the answers . The book 's heavy emphasis on application is typical of Puritan writing .
The book is systematically partitioned into twelve sections and thirty subsections , with the majority of the book ( 169 pages ) contained within the twenty-four subsections of section 4 : Showing the Characteristics of a Godly Man .
The sections and subsections are as follows :

8 . An Exhortation to Persevere in Godliness
9 . Motives to Persevere in Godliness
10 . Counsel for the Godly
11 . Comfort to the Godly
12 . Showing the Mystic Union between Christ and the Saints
Themes
Religion as Relationship
The Puritan understanding of godliness as fundamentally relational rather than propositional runs throughout the book . Instead of being a godly Christian by what one believes about Jesus Christ in an epistemological sense , Watson describes the godly as relating to Jesus as a bridegroom to a bride . Using strongly romantic language from the Song of Solomon and other parts of the Bible , Watson speaks of `` a conjugal union between Christ and believers '' ( 239 ) . He further states that `` the joy that flows from the mystic union is unspeakable and full of glory '' ( 241 ) .
Radical Selflessness
A radically selfless notion of Christianity emerges in the book , wherein the believer ought to love and serve God not because of benefits from God , but because the inherent worth of God . This idea ties in with the idea of religion as relationship . As Watson puts it , `` God is to be loved more than his mercies '' ( 132 ) .
Quotes
Watson 's writing is known for its quotability due to its succession of compact but meaning-filled statements reiterating and refining key points . Some of the key quotes are as follows :
`` A natural man… may have the eye of reason open , but he does not discern the things of God in a spiritual manner… he is no more able to judge sacred things than a blind man is able to judge colors '' ( 20 ) .
`` The ship of ordinances will not carry us to heaven… unless the wind of God 's Spirit blows '' ( 76 ) .

Germanic names in Italy started to proliferate after the fall of the Roman Empire due to the Barbarian Invasions of 4th-6th centuries .
Early studies of the Germanic names in Italy were carried out by German scholars ( e.g. , Bruckner ( 1895 ) , and Gamillsсheg 1934 - 1936 ) .
History
The adoption of Germanic names in Italy was less prominent than in Gaul , another part of the Roman Empire conquered by the Barbarian kingdoms , and was associated with the Ostrogothic and Lombards settlement in Italy . Over time , there was a growing mismatch between the ethnicity and the naming , similar to the Gaul . While initially Gothic names belonged to the Goths , by the 10th century the choice was influenced by the fashion independently of the ethnicity . Often the names were hybrids : German suffixes were added to Roman roots ( e.g. , Forteramnus =Forte + -ramn + -us ) and vice versa ( Hrodemia , from Hroðr ) . Eventually Germanic names have become predominant , but did not displace the Latin-language ones completely . Christianity has played a considerable role in preservation of the classical Greco-Latin names , related to religious ideas and saints . Even the names of pagan gods were preserved via the name of saints ( e.g. , Mercurius , Victoria ) Eventually , in the process of the adoption by non-Germans , Germanic names mutated and became the new names of their own .

was a Japanese businessman who built the Tokyu Group into one of the leading corporate groups in Japan .
Education and civil service career
Gotō was born as Keita Kobayashi in the village of Aoki in Nagano Prefecture . After graduating from high school in the nearby city of Matsumoto , he returned to his native village as a grade school teacher . In 1902 he entered what is now the University of Tsukuba , and in 1907 entered the law department of Tokyo Imperial University . After graduating , he entered the Agriculture Ministry at the relatively late age of 29 , and three years later transferred to the Ministry of Transport , where he was involved in supervising the national railway system .
In 1912 , while still working in the Agriculture Ministry , he married the daughter of an engineer and subsequently assumed her family name , Gotō .
Business career
In 1920 , Gotō was offered the post of Director of the Musashi Railway , a struggling company in need of capital to finance its expansion . He accepted and by 1924 had acquired a controlling interest in the company , using the profits from other railway ventures in the Tokyo area . This was the first of many acquisitions in which Gotō bought weak companies and transformed them into profitable members of a growing railway and real estate group .
It was also around this time that he persuaded the Tokyo Institute of Technology to relocate along his railway from its former campus , which had been damaged in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake . Over the next 10 years , this was followed by relocation assistance to several other schools and universities , including the Nippon Medical School and the high school of Tokyo Gakugei University . Together with numerous new residential developments along the railways , this strategy brought steady passengers and increased the value of the company 's real estate holdings .
By the time of his death in 1959 , his strategy of aggressive acquisitions had built the Tokyu Group into one of Japan 's largest corporate empires , with businesses ranging from railways and department stores to hospitals , schools , and leisure and entertainment companies .
Gotoh Educational Corporation
The Gotoh Educational Corporation which Gotō established and served as the first Director-General continues his philanthropic legacy managing eight private educational schools including Tokyo City University . The Tokyo City University and affiliated schools currently serve the educational needs of over 12,000 students .
Art collection
In his later years , Gotō was a noted collector of Japanese and Asian art . His collection included several National Treasures , including calligraphy , ceramics , and one of the four surviving 13th-century Tale of Genji illustrated handscrolls . The collection is now preserved in the Gotoh Museum in Tokyo .

After this fact was made public , Rosenberg discontinued most of these publishers , but retained the Eternity label as a brand of Malibu Comics .
Malibu began modestly with creator-owned black-and-white titles , but made a name for itself publishing a combination of new series and licensed properties such as the classic characters Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes , and popular television , film , and video game tie-ins . Malibu 's first title was Ex-Mutants . Malibu later created a shared universe called Shattered Earth with these characters , after a legal battle with the creators .
Publishers acquisitions and Genesis
Malibu 's 1987 financing arrangement with Rosenberg also led to it effectively acquiring the Canadian publisher Aircel Comics as an imprint . In 1989 , Malibu acquired the publisher Adventure Publications . From that point forward , the Malibu brand was used for superhero titles , while Eternity was used for the magazine line and also for anime-inspired titles like Robotech , Adventure was used for Malibu 's licensed titles , such as Planet of the Apes and Alien Nation , and Aircel was used for Barry Blair 's comics and Malibu 's adult line . The company also acquired the character Shuriken , from his creator Reggie Byers , in 1988 ( a character that was self-published before in Victory Productions from 1985–1988 ) . The character was published in three mini-series and two one-shots by Malibu ( later the character was introduced in the Ultraverse imprint ) .
In 1992 , heroes from Centaur Publications ( a Golden Age publisher whose properties fell into the public domain ) were revived in the form of the Protectors ( Airman , Amazing-Man , Aura , Arc , Arrow , Ferret , Man of War and Mighty Man , among others ) . Several of these characters had short-lived spin-off titles of their own . The Centaur heroes and other characters from Adventure ( Miss Fury and Rocket Ranger ) , and Eternity ( Dinosaurs For Hire , Ex-Mutants ) plus Dead Clown and Widowmaker were put together in one Universe to form the Genesis line . However , the line had a short life period .
The Bravura imprint was then launched for the creator-owned and licensed titles . The company also served as publisher of record for the first comics from Image Comics in 1992 , giving the upstart creator-run publisher access to the distribution channels . This move led to Malibu obtaining almost 10 % of the American comics market share , temporarily moving ahead of industry giant DC Comics . However , by the beginning of 1993 , Image 's financial situation was secure enough to publish its titles independently , and it left Malibu .
Malibu Interactive and Ultraverse
In late 1992 , seeking to capitalize on the growing video game market , Malibu merged with video game developer Acme Interactive to form Malibu Interactive .
The Ultraverse line was launched in June 1993 during the `` boom '' of the early 1990s , roughly concurrent with the debut of publishers such as Image and Valiant , and new superhero lines from DC and Dark Horse ( Milestone and Comics ' Greatest World , respectively ) . The line was in part intended to fill the gap left by Image 's independence . They boasted improved production values over traditional comics ( especially digital coloring and higher-quality paper ) , and a roster of respected and/or talented new writers and artists . Emphasizing the tight continuity between the various series in the Ultraverse line , Malibu made extensive use of crossovers , in which a story that began in one series would be continued in the next-shipping issue of another series . Various promotions for special editions or limited-print stories followed . The Ultraverse line came to dominate Malibu 's catalog .
Malibu launched additionally the Rock-It Comix imprint for rock band comics in early 1994 . Malibu worked with Gold Mountain Entertainment management firm in dealing with the musicians , while International Strategic Marketing was distributing the line to comic book shops , music outlets and newsstands .
Acquisition by Marvel Comics
As sales declined industry-wide in the mid-1990s , Malibu canceled lower-selling series . But their biggest problem was their game division , started in an attempt to break into the video game market , which cost them more than $ 200,000 a month . Nonetheless , the company 's assets were still seen as attractive enough to garner interest from DC Comics in the spring of 1994 . In addition , Rosenberg and Malibu signed with the William Morris Agency . The company was purchased by Marvel Comics on November 3 , 1994 . In the middle of the next year , Malibu standard-bearers Mason and Ulm left the company .
Because Malibu had sufficient market share that an acquisition from DC would make the latter surpass Marvel 's market share , Marvel decided to purchase Malibu themselves to prevent this from happening . To slow down rumors that Ultraverse titles would be cancelled as soon as the deal closed , Malibu claimed that Marvel wanted them because of their digital coloring system .
Marvel eventually canceled the entire Ultraverse line , but ( during the Black September event ) re-launched a handful of the more popular titles as well as a number of crossovers with Marvel characters . The `` volume 2 '' series each started with `` # ∞ ( infinity ) '' issues and were canceled a short time later . Very little Malibu content was published after 1996 .
Within the Marvel Comics multiverse , the Genesis Universe is designated as Earth-1136 and the Ultraverse as Earth-93060 .
Potential Ultraverse revival
In June 2005 , when asked by Newsarama whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse , Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada replied that :
In May 2012 , Steve Englehart suggested in a podcast interview that the reason Marvel will not presently publish the Ultraverse characters is because five percent of the profits from those books would have to go to the Malibu creators that are still alive . Marvel Editor Tom Brevoort later denied that the five percent was what was holding Marvel back , but was unable to give a real explanation due to a non-disclosure agreement .
It has been speculated that Scott Mitchell Rosenberg 's ongoing producer deal for all Malibu properties ( and his alleged personal troubles ) is another possible factor .

Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve situated in Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia , Canada . A diverse range of ecosystems exist within the biosphere reserve boundaries , including temperate coastal rainforest , ocean and rocky coastal shores .
Nine of the large forested valleys remain untouched by logging or other industrial development . The area 's temperate rainforest , lakes , rivers and alpine peaks provide habitats for a vast array of species , a significant number of which are endangered or rare . Given that development is increasingly resulting in the fragmentation of forest and alpine ecosystems and loss of biodiversity in coastal rainforests , this biosphere reserve provides a refuge and centre for the natural dispersion and re-establishment of species .
Ecological characteristics
The primary habitat of the Clayoquot Biosphere is temperate rainforest ( Coastal Western Hemlock ) , covering 85 % of the terrestrial component and extending to altitudes of about 900 m. The habitat is dominated by large trees including the Western Hemlock , Western Red Cedar , Amabilis Fir , Western Yellow Cedar , Sitka Spruce , Pine , Douglas Fir , Yew and Red Alder . There are approximately 300 vertebrate species , including the American black bear ( Ursus americanus ) , cougar ( Puma concolor couguar ) , American mink ( Neovison vison ) and grey wolf ( Canis lupus ) .
The second common habitat covering 12 % of the Clayoquot Sound above 900 m is temperate rainforest ( Mountain Hemlock ) . Dominant trees include the Mountain Hemlock , Western Yellow Cedar and Amabilis Fir . Fewer species are found at such a high altitude , but include some those of those found at lower altitudes .
The marine component of the Clayoquot supports mud flats , beaches and estuaries . The reserve contains the largest cover of eelgrass on the west coast of Vancouver Island . Cetaceans such as humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) , gray whales ( Eschrichtius robustus ) , orcas ( Orcinus orca ) , and a variety of other whale , dolphin and porpoise species are common . Steller 's ( Eumetopias jubatus ) and California sea lions ( Zalophus californianus ) are also found in the reserve . Commercial aquaculture of native salmon species and introduced Atlantic salmon , oysters and scallops constitute significant economic activities .
Socio-economic characteristics
The permanent population amounts to about 5,000 people . At least one-third are Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations ( of Aboriginal ancestry ) , whose traditional territories encompass the entire biosphere reserve . Since 2000 , the local economy has shifted from being based on industrial forestry and fisheries towards a more ecologically sensitive approach informed by Nuu-chah-nulth cultural principles . The First Nations and provincial government are working together to develop small-scale alternatives built around a conservation economy . Aquaculture is well established .
Because of the nature of the resources , tourism and related services have been encouraged . They are developing rapidly along the coast , both in and between two towns accessible from the only road into the biosphere reserve . Seasonal visitors amount to about 1 million annually .
Protected areas
Protected areas located within the biosphere reserve include :
Clayoquot Arm Provincial Park
Clayoquot Plateau Provincial Park
Cleland Island Ecological Reserve
Dawley Passage Provincial Park
Epper Passage Provincial Park
Flores Island Marine Provincial Park
Gibson Marine Provincial Park
Hesquiat Lake Provincial Park
Hesquiat Peninsula Provincial Park

Christian Andreas Käsebier ( 1710 – after 1757 ) was a legendary German thief and robber during the 18th century who became an intelligence operative for King Frederick the Great following a sentence of life imprisonment .
Early life
Käsebier was born in 1710 in Halle , Saxony-Anhalt , the son of Johann von Christophe Käsebier and Margaretha Kuhn . Christian and his siblings were raised in the French Reformed religion . He came from a long line of successful tailors , in which his father educated him to continue in the family profession . His brother , Johann George , would become the personal tailor for Count Casimir , before emigrating to Pennsylvania , however , Christian rebelled and entered a life of crime .
Crime boss
It is said that Christian Andreas became an infamous crime boss , staging numerous robberies and heists . He was caught on many occasions , but never executed , eventually being released every time . He was not a violent criminal , rather he used his charm and intelligence to accomplish most of his work . He was considered cunning and extremely deceptive .
Life imprisonment
Käsebier was staying in Brandenburg an der Havel under an assumed named when he was finally arrested in 1748 and sentenced to life in prison at Stettin by the King .
Recruitment as intelligence operative
In 1757 , King Frederick the Great was engaged in the Seven Years ' War and was conducting the Siege of Prague . He was in need of intelligence operatives who could penetrate behind enemy lines . The King personally recruited Käsebier with the promise of a pardon in return for his intelligence services . Käsebier successfully smuggled himself into the besieged city three times , but on the fourth mission became hesitant over the fear of being known now . The King threatened to send him back to prison , so Käsebier agreed to the fourth mission . He vanished soon thereafter , never to be heard from again , although it is claimed he was executed by the Austrians .
Popular culture
It is claimed that Friedrich Schiller 's play The Robbers , from 1781 , is loosely based on Christian Andreas and his father , Johann .
In 1972 , the events surrounding the siege at Prague were adapted for the film Die gestohlene Schlacht ( The stolen battle ) with Manfred Krug cast in the lead role as Christian Andreas .
Käsebier is compared numerous times to the romanticized criminals of Europe , including having been cited in 2001 along with Diego Corrientes Mateos , Robin Hood , Dick Turpin , and Louis Mandrin as one of Europe 's most fabled criminals .
In Benjamin Carter Hett 's 2008 book Crossing Hitler , Christian Andreas Käsebier was cited as having stayed in the notorious Spandau Prison at one point and considered legendary .
In Kevin Casebier 's 2021 book , King of Thieves , Christian Andreas Käsebier is described as the `` Prussian Robin Hood '' , a master of disguise and cunning leader of a band of highwaymen .

Joseph Banks ( 6 September 1665 – 27 September 1727 ) , of Revesby Abbey , Lincolnshire , was an English lawyer , financial speculator and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1715 to 1727 .
Banks was the second son of Robert Banks of Beck Hall , Giggleswick , Yorkshire and his wife Margaret Frankland , daughter of John Frankland of Rathmell , Yorkshire . He was articled to a solicitor . He married , Mary Hancock , the daughter of Rev . Rowland Hancock , a dissenting minister of Shircliffe Hall , near Sheffield , in 1689 . At some time , he moved to live as a country attorney at Scofton , Nottinghamshire , where he was stewarded of the manors for Lady Mary Howard of Worksop . He was also agent for the Dukes of Leeds , Norfolk and Newcastle . He made a fortune and bought up estates in Nottinghamshire , and Lincolnshire where in 1711 he bought Revesby Abbey from Henry Howard , 11th Earl of Suffolk .
At the 1715 general election Banks stood for Parliament at Great Grimsby where his opponent , being in debt , had promised to repay his creditors after he won . Banks pointed out that if his opponent won , he could claim privilege and default , and so offered to pay the notes of credit himself . He was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby . He voted consistently with the government and his only speech was to oppose a scheme to improve navigation facilities at the rival port of Sunderland . In 1719 , he bought some estates which were forfeited after the Jacobite rebellion ( and which he sold back to the family later a profit ) , and in 1720 made a profit from South Sea Company stock before the bubble burst but avoided a penalty because , unlike his fellow MP Robert Chaplin , he had paid for them himself . At the 1722 general election he was defeated heavily at Grimsby but was returned on the Treasury interest as MP for Totnes . He did not stand at the 1727 general election . In his later days took an interest in reclamation operations at Deeping Fen in Lincolnshire .
Banks died shortly after leaving parliament on 27 September 1727 . He had two children . His son Joseph Banks inherited his profitable estates and became an MP . His daughter married Sir Francis Whichcote , 3rd Baronet .

Robin Baker ( born 13 March 1944 ) is a British novelist , popular science writer , lecturer and broadcaster . A best-selling author in the field of sexual biology his books have been translated into 27 different languages . These include the international bestseller Sperm Wars which was based on his own lab 's original research on human sexuality . His work and ideas on the evolution of human behaviour have been featured in many radio and television programmes around the world .
Education and early life
Born in Wiltshire , England in 1944 , Robin Baker grew up in the small village of Manningford Bruce in the Vale of Pewsey . Educated at Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School , where thirty years earlier the author William Golding had also been educated , he gained his Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from the University of Bristol in 1965 , followed by a PhD in 1969 supervised by H. E. Hinton . His thesis investigated the evolution of the migratory habit in butterflies and applied principles of behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology to the insect migration . This work was subsequently published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society .
Career and research
Baker moved to the University of Newcastle in 1970 and from there to the University of Manchester in 1974 where he was first a lecturer , and in 1981 a Reader in Zoology in the School of Biological Sciences . In 1996 he left academic life to concentrate on his career in writing and broadcasting .
Although his early work was on evolutionary aspects of insect migration and territoriality , his interests broadened . With G.A . Parker and V.G.F . Smith in 1972 , he proposed a theory for the evolution of anisogamy and two sexes
and in 1979 , with G.A . Parker he proposed the Unprofitable Prey Theory of the evolution of bird coloration . In 1978 in his book The Evolutionary Ecology of Animal Migration he wrote for the first time on the theme that permeated his work for the rest of his academic life : the application of the principles of evolutionary biology to the behaviour of humans . This led in the 1980s to controversial work on the role of magnetoreception in the navigation of humans , and in the 1990s ( with Mark Bellis ) to a study of sperm competition in humans and rats , including proposal of the kamikaze sperm hypothesis . Baker and Bellis ' research into the evolutionary biology of infidelity , masturbation , sperm polymorphism , and sperm number in humans , as well as into the design and function of the human penis and cervix led to a number of scientific papers and an academic book : Human Sperm Competition : copulation , masturbation and infidelity .
Noticing that sperm in a mixed sample tends to clump together—making it less mobile—and to have a high mortality rate , reproductive biologist Robin Baker , formerly of the University of Manchester , proposed about a decade ago that some mammals , including humans , manufacture `` killer '' sperm whose only function is to attack foreign spermatozoa , destroying themselves in the process .
To test this idea , reproductive biologist Harry Moore and evolutionary ecologist Tim Birkhead of the University of Sheffield mixed sperm samples from 15 men in various combinations and checked for how the cells moved , clumped together , or developed abnormal shapes . `` These are very simple experiments , but we tried to mimic what goes on in the reproductive tract , '' Moore says . The team found no excess casualties from any particular donor or other evidence of warring sperm , they report in 7 December Proceedings of the Royal Society . `` The kamikaze sperm hypothesis is probably not a mechanism in human sperm competition , '' says Birkhead .
The findings are `` the nail in the coffin for the kamikaze hypothesis , '' says Michael Bedford , a reproductive biologist at Cornell University 's Weill Medical Center in New York City . He says he had never given the idea much credence .
Publications
As well as being the author of around one hundred scientific papers and six academic books , Robin Baker is the author of four popular science books : Sperm Wars ; Baby Wars ; Sex in the Future ; and Fragile Science . He has also written three novels : Primal ; Caballito ; and The Hitchhiker 's Child which under the guise of being sexual whodunits continue the theme of the evolution of human sexual behaviour . His first novel , Primal , was likened to both the TV series Lost and William Golding 's Lord of the Flies . It describes a group of university students and staff stranded on a remote desert island occupied by feral chimpanzees . Bit by bit the people find themselves stripped of all the trappings of civilization until like the apes around them they have only their instincts to guide them .
In Sperm Wars , Baker asserted the human cuckolding rate to be at 10 % and that women frequently cheat to secure better genes for their offspring . This figure was later debunked , because studies which rely on a data set consisting of men who have requested paternity tests are strongly sample biased toward those who have a reason to have suspicions . Men who have low paternity confidence and have chosen to challenge their paternity through laboratory testing are much less likely than men with high paternity confidence to be the fathers of their putative children . A survey of 67 studies reporting nonpaternity suggests that for men with high paternity confidence rates of nonpaternity are ( excluding studies of unknown methodology ) typically 1.9 % , substantially less than the typical rates of 10 % or higher cited by many researchers . `` Media and popular scientific literature often claim that many alleged fathers are being cuckolded into raising children that biologically are not their own , '' said Maarten Larmuseau of KU Leuven in Belgium . `` Surprisingly , the estimated rates within human populations are quite low -- around 1 or 2 percent . '' `` But reliable data on contemporary populations that have become available over the last decade , mainly as supplementary results of medical studies , do n't support the notion that one in 10 people do n't know who their `` real '' fathers are . The findings suggest that any potential advantage of cheating in order to have children that are perhaps better endowed is offset for the majority of women by the potential costs , the researchers say . Those costs likely include spousal aggression , divorce , or reduced paternal investment by the social partner or his relatives . The observed low cuckoldry rates in contemporary and past human populations challenge clearly the well-known idea that women routinely 'shop around ' for good genes by engaging in extra-pair copulations to obtain genetic benefits for their children , '' Larmuseau said .
Women are loyal to men who are good providers . `` With DNA tests now widely available , so-called paternity fraud has become a staple of talk shows and TV crime series . Aggrieved men accuse tearful wives who profess their fidelity , only to have their extramarital affairs brought to light ... The rule of thumb seems to be that males of higher socioeconomic status , and from more conventionally bourgeois societies , have greater warranted paternity confidence . Lower paternity confidence among those who are the principals for sensational media should n't be surprising then . ''
Five days a week , you can tune into `` Paternity Court '' , a television show featuring couples embroiled in disputes over fatherhood . It 's entertainment with a very old theme : Uncertainty over paternity goes back a long way in literature . Even Shakespeare and Chaucer cracked wise about cuckolds , who were often depicted wearing horns . But in a number of recent studies , researchers have found that our obsession with cuckolded fathers is seriously overblown . A number of recent genetic studies challenge the notion that mistaken paternity is commonplace . `` It 's absolutely ridiculous '' , said Maarten Larmuseau , a geneticist at the University of Leuven in Belgium who has led much of this new research .

Wingfield is a small village and civil parish in the county of Wiltshire , England , about south of Bradford-on-Avon and west of Trowbridge .
The parish is bordered to the east by the Trowbridge urban area and to the west by the county of Somerset , where the River Frome forms most of the boundary . The secondary road from Bradford-on-Avon to Rode ( Somerset ) crosses the A366 from Trowbridge to Farleigh Hungerford near the centre of the parish , and most of the dwellings are near this junction .
History
Wingfield is mentioned in a charter of 954 . Domesday Book in 1086 recorded a settlement named Winefel in Bradford a hundred with 12 households and a mill , on land held by Geoffrey , bishop of Coutances . From at least the early 13th century until the Dissolution , Wingfield manor was linked to Keynsham Abbey . Thereafter the manor was granted to Thomas Bayley , whose heirs held it until 1647 ; the Wiltshire Victoria County History has an account of later owners .
The name `` Winkfield '' or `` Winkfield with Rowley '' was used in the 19th century . The Imperial Gazetteer in the 1870s has `` Wingfield , or Winkfield , a parish , with Rowley tything '' . In 1934 the civil parish gained 532 acres on the abolition of Bradford Without parish , and a further 62 acres were transferred from Trowbridge .
Wittenham and Rowley
A manor called Wittenham in the west of the present parish is mentioned in 1001 , and in Domesday Book Withenham is also held by Geoffrey . Rowley was either an alternative name or a separate manor nearby . A church dedicated to St Nicholas was last mentioned in 1535 . By 1428 the population was low , and Walter , Lord Hungerford of Farleigh Castle obtained permission to unite the ecclesiastical parish with that of Farleigh Hungerford . Today the location of Wittenham village is unknown ; since 1777 the land has been part of the Iford estate .
Notable buildings
Stowford Manor , a late 15th-century farmhouse with a three-gable front , is also Grade II * listed . Church Farmhouse , just north of the church , has 16th-century origins and was occupied continuously by the Baily family from the 17th century , according to the 1962 listed building record . The farmyard has a 17th-century cowshed . Midway Manor , a house in the north of the parish towards Bradford on Avon , was in the late 18th century the home of Henry Shrapnel , inventor of the Shrapnel shell .
Parish church
The Church of England parish church of St Mary , on the eastern edge of the village , is mostly in dressed limestone ; it has a 15th-century tower with a stair-turret , a nave rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries and a chancel rebuilt in 1861 . The church was designated as Grade II * listed in 1962 .
Parish registers from 1654 are held in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre , Chippenham . Today the church is part of the benefice of Bradford on Avon Holy Trinity , Westwood and Wingfield .
Amenities
A National School was built in the village in 1852 and educated children of all ages until 1926 . It became a Church of England school , and since 2009 has been a satellite of The Mead Community Primary School at Hilperton .
The village has a pub , the Poplars Inn .
Local government
Wingfield is part of the Winsley and Westwood ward of Wiltshire Council , a unitary authority . This is represented by John Kidney ( Conservative ) who has held the position since May 2017 . Wingfield has a parish council with five members .
Notable people
Edward William Grinfield ( 1785–1864 , biblical scholar ) and Thomas De Quincey ( 1785–1859 , writer ) were educated at a private school at Wingfield , run by the rector .

An Act for the Release of certain Persons held to Service or Labor in the District of Columbia , 37th Cong. , Sess . 2 , ch . 54 , , known colloquially as the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act or simply Compensated Emancipation Act , was a law that ended slavery in the District of Columbia , while providing slave owners who remained loyal to the United States in the then-ongoing Civil War to petition for compensation . Although not written by him , the act was signed by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln on April 16 , 1862 . April 16 is now celebrated in the city as Emancipation Day .
History
Proposals to eliminate slavery in the District of Columbia date back at least to the gag rules of the later 1830s . In 1848 , New York Representative Daniel Gott gave a passionate speech to the House of Representatives against the proposed emancipation of slaves in the District of Columbia . Gott described the actions of abolitionists of the Northern states as `` impertinent interference with the slaves '' and `` impertinently intruding themselves into the domestic and delicate concerns of the South , understanding neither the malady to be corrected nor the remedy to be applied . '' In 1849 , when he was a representative , Lincoln introduced a plan to eliminate slavery in Washington , D.C. by compensated emancipation . The bill failed . The sale and purchase of slaves in Washington D.C. was outlawed by the Compromise of 1850 . However , the ownership of slaves in the capitol was not affected and Washington D. C. 's slave owners could still buy and sell slaves in the neighboring states of Virginia and Maryland .
Emancipation in the District of Columbia became possible in 1861 after the departure of the senators and representatives from the seceding states who had blocked the ending of slavery in the district , not wanting emancipation to be legislated anywhere . In December 1861 , a bill was introduced in Congress for the abolition of slavery in Washington , D.C . Written by Thomas Marshall Key , and sponsored by Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts , the bill passed the Senate on April 3 by a vote of 29 in favor and 14 against . It passed the House of Representatives on April 11 . Lincoln had wanted the bill to include a provision to make emancipation effective only after a favorable vote from the citizens of the District of Columbia . He also wanted the bill to delay implementation until a certain amount of time after the bill was signed . Neither provision was included in the bill . Lincoln signed the bill on April 16 , 1862 , amid ongoing Congressional debate over an emancipation plan for the border states . Following the bill 's passage , Lincoln proposed several changes to the act , which were approved by Congress . The commissioners appointed to implement the bill later made a report to Congress listing the names of slaveholders who applied for compensation , the names of people emancipated , and the amounts paid .
The passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act came nearly nine months before the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation . The act immediately emancipated slaves in Washington , D.C. and set aside $ 1 million to compensate slaveholders loyal to the U.S. government . An additional $ 100,000 allocated by the law was used to pay each newly freed slave $ 100 if he or she chose to leave the United States and colonize in places such as Haiti or Liberia .
Outcome
The emancipation plan relied on a three-person Emancipation Commission to distribute the allotted funding . In order to receive compensation , former slaveholders were required to provide written evidence of their ownership , as well as state their loyalty to the Union . Most of the petitioners were white , but some blacks also filed for compensation , having once bought their family members away from other owners . In the end , almost all of the $ 1 million appropriated in the act had been spent . As a result of the act 's passage , 3,185 slaves were freed . However , fugitive slave laws still applied to slaves who had fled from Maryland to Washington , D.C. until their 1864 repeal .
Although the compensated emancipation model was never expanded beyond the district , the act , along with the prohibition of slavery in the federal territories a few months later , signified the forthcoming demise of slavery in the United States . The act was the only compensated emancipation plan enacted in the United States .
In Washington , D.C. , April 16 has been celebrated as Emancipation Day since 1866 . An annual parade was held to commemorate the signing of the act until 1901 , when a lack of financial and organizational support forced the tradition to stop ; it restarted in 2002 . In 2000 , the Council of the District of Columbia made April 16 a private holiday—or one on which city employees are not given a free day off—and on July 9 , 2004 , council member Vincent Orange proposed making the day a public holiday . Emancipation Day was first celebrated as an official city holiday in Washington , D.C. in 2005 .
`` When Congress passed the DC Emancipation Act in April 1862 , giving compensation to 'loyal ' owners , Coakley [ Gabriel Coakley , a leader of the black Catholic community in Washington ] successfully petitioned for his wife and children , since he had purchased their freedom in earlier years . He was one of only a handful of black Washingtonians to make a claim like this . The federal government paid him $ 1489.20 for eight slaves that he 'owned ' ( he had claimed their value at $ 3,300 ) . ''
Supplemental legislation
Following Lincoln 's concerns over the version of the bill that he signed , the U.S. Senate approved a supplement to the original Compensated Emancipation Act . The amendment passed on July 12 , 1862 , allowing former slaves to petition for compensation if their masters had not done so . Under the supplemental act , claims made by blacks and whites were weighted equally , whereas previously , the testimonies of blacks—enslaved or free—were discarded if challenged by a white person .

The Knights of the Cross with the Red Star is the only male order founded in Bohemia , with its centre in Prague and a history dating back to the 13th century . Originally it was a lay hospital fraternity , which was founded in 1233 by Agnes of Bohemia at the convent of the Poor Clares and the Church of St. Haštal , following the example of St. Hedwig . The Brotherhood was guided by the Rule of Saint Augustine and the ideas of St. Francis of Assisi , and its main mission was the care of the sick . In the same year , Agnes ' mother , Queen Constance of Hungary , bought the church of St. Peter in Poříčí , including several villages , from the Order of the Teutonic Knights and gave it to the Brotherhood .
In 1237 , the Pope elevated the Brotherhood to a knightly order and its members exercised spiritual administration over the parishes entrusted to them as canons of the Order . The Order 's emblem , which is a cross accompanied by a five-pointed star , was granted by the Pope at the request of St Agnes in the 1350s . In 1252 Agnes founded a new hospital with the Church of the Holy Spirit ( later St. Francis ) on the Old Town side of the Judith Bridge ( `` ad pedem pontis pragensis '' ) . The Order gradually founded other hospitals and churches in Bohemia , Moravia and Silesia . It also had an important branch in Wrocław , where St. Hedwig came from .
On 29 November 1378 , the day of Charles IV 's death , a fire broke out in the Order hospital of St. Francis , destroying the church and the convent with all its valuables , documents and privileges . During the Hussite Wars , the Knights of the Cross Order had to retreat to Catholic western Bohemia . It lost most of its property , which at that time included not only hospitals but also a number of parishes . After the Hussite Wars , the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star actively participated in the recatholization of the country , and during the Jagiellonian period it flourished again and managed to regain some of its property . From 1460 to 1490 , Nikolaus Puchner became its twentieth Grand Master and commissioned a new main altar with a statue of the Virgin Mary ( Assumpta ) and scenes dedicated to the history , mission and spirituality of the Order .
Description of the work
Puchner 's Ark is a large winged altar with a central statue of the Virgin Mary , two fixed and two painted wings on both sides . It was the main altar of the convent of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star . The statue of the Madonna standing on a crescent ( Assumpta type ) was probably accompanied by two angels bearing a crown in the original architecture of the altar . The style of carving suggests that the work came from a Nuremberg workshop . The statue is permanently housed in the Church of St. Francis of Assisi in Prague 's Old Town .
The paintings on the wings of the altar are influenced by Dutch naturalism ( Dieric Bouts ) , evident in the careful drawing of small details , the portrait-like characterization of faces , and the realism of the time , which brings the depicted action into the viewer 's present and interprets it as an actual story . The characteristic features of the painting style are space depicted in the form of scenery flats , with an implausible perspective with multiple focal points , some naturalistic elements of vegetation and architecture , non-dramatic scenes , and cool colours rendered in large continuous areas . The light comes from a single source and the depth of the space is suggested , for example , by the cast shadow of a candle . The background is replaced by a gilded engraved ornament . The shapes are harder , with an emphasis on drawing , the sculptural volumes of the bodies and draperies are modelled with painting techniques . Underdrawing is visible in places . The inner sides of the retable are gilded and decorated with tin relief ornament imitating brocade , the outer sides are decorated with silver foil with a simpler geometric pattern .
The two tall panel paintings framing the statue of the Virgin Mary in the altar cabinet show , on the left , the figures of St Barbara with the kneeling donor Nicolas Puchner turning to the Virgin Mary , on the right St Catherine with her usual attributes ( wheel , sword , figure of the humiliated Emperor Maxentius ) . The inscription at the bottom of the painting gives the year of the altar 's consecration as the bicentenary of the death of St Agnes in 1482 .
On the upper part of the left movable wing of the altar , St Agnes is depicted as a princess handing a model of the church to the first Grand Master of the Order , Albert of Sternberg . On the opposite side , St. Hedwig of Silesia is depicted wearing a ducal cap , nursing a sick man in bed . Hedwig was the wife of Prince Henry of Silesia and founded the hospital in Wrocław . Agnes was betrothed at the age of 3 to their son Konrad and the Knights Order had a branch monastery there . This painting has often been misunderstood as a depiction of St Agnes . In principle , there can be no doubt that this is St. Hedwig of Silesia - see the ducal cap and the fact that St. Agnes as a Poor Clare was not allowed to leave the cloister and treat the sick . At the bottom left is the Death of the Virgin Mary with the Last Prayer , on the right the Crucifixion scene .
On the upper part of the rear side of the wings were pairs of saints . The surviving left wing shows the patron saint of the country , St. Ludmila , together with St. Ursula , who was popular in the hospital fraternity as a protector against the plague ; the missing right part may have depicted St. Wenceslas . At the bottom of the rear side of the wing is St. Augustine teaching the Knights of the Cross , among whom is again the figure of Nikolaus Puchner . On the other wing is a scene of the stigmatization of St. Francis . The saint has a direct connection with St. Agnes as the founder of the Convent of Saint Agnes in Prague , and the apparition of the Holy Cross , carried by a seraph , refers to the Order of the Knights of the Cross . The composition comes from a graphic design by Monogrammist E.S . The individual parts of the retable were complemented in the lower part by inscriptions , which have only partially survived .
Some of the panel paintings that are part of the altar ( St. Agnes with Grand Master Albert of Sternberg , Crucifixion , St. Augustine teaching the Knights of the Cross ) are located in the convent of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star , the others are on permanent display in the National Gallery in Prague .

Santa Maria della Fava , also originally known as Santa Maria della Consolazione , is an ancient Roman Catholic church in the sestiere of Castello in Venice , Italy .
The suffix of della Fava ( of the bean ) attributed to the church , bridge and piazza has a number of attributed derivations . One explanation is that this area in Venice was used for the commerce of beans or the home of pastry shops for bean cake . A more colorful legend , perhaps for consumption of tourists , is that a man smuggling salt and beans was apprehended at the site , but when he kneeled before a local icon of the Madonna painted on a wall of Ca ' Dolce , the salt from his bag disappeared , and thus he escaped imprisonment . The church then was built to house the miraculous icon . Finally , the church may have been endowed by the Fava family from Ferrara .
The original church at the site was completed by 1500 . While by 1662 , it was under the jurisdiction of the Procuratoria of St Mark , it later was under the order of Saint Phillip Neri . The reconstructed , but unfinished , church we see today was designed by Antonio Gaspari in 1711 , while the apse and presbytery ( 1750 ) were completed by Giorgio Massari . The interior of the church has a famous altarpiece of Saint Anne , Young Mary , and Saint Gioacchino , ( 1732 ) by Tiepolo . It also houses a Virgin with St Phillip Neri by Piazzetta . A series of statues of Saints and Evangelists were carved by Giuseppe Bernardi . Flanking the altar , which was designed by Massari are two angels by Giovanni Maria Morlaiter .

The was a class of submarine in the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) , which served during the Second World War . The Type-A submarines were built to take a role of the command ships for submarine squadrons . For this reason they had equipment for a headquarters , better radio facilities and a floatplane .
Class variants
The Type-A submarines were divided into four classes :
. The 5094th vessel class boats were not built and remained only a design .
Type-A ( I-9 class )
Project number S35Ja . Their design was based on the Junsen III ( I-7 class ) . Three boats were built in 1938-42 under the Maru 3 Programme ( Boat # 35 - 36 ) and Maru 4 Programme ( Boat # 138 ) .
Boats in class
Type-A Mod.1 ( I-12 class )
Project number S35B . Five boats were planned under the Maru Tsui Programme ( Boat # 620 - 621 ) and the Kai-Maru 5 Programme ( Boat # 5091 - 5093 ) . They were equipped with less powerful diesel engines which shortened the time needed to build them . Only one boat , , was completed to the original design . The I-13 and the later boats were converted to a new submarine class ( I-13 class ) , because the number of I-400 class boats was reduced .
Boats in class
Type-A Mod.2 ( I-13 class )
Project number S35C . Four boats were planned under the Maru Tsui Programme ( Boat # 621 ) and the Kai-Maru 5 Programme ( Boat # 5091 - 5093 ) . However , four boats were converted to new submarine class ( I-13 class ) , because a number of submarines of the I-400 class were cancelled . They had a large hangar and were equipped with bulges to be able to operate 2 × special Aichi M6A1 Seiran attack bombers . The headquarters institutions were removed .
Boats in class
V21 Type
Project number S48 . Three boats were planned under the Kai-Maru 5 Programmes . However , all boats were cancelled in late 1943 , because the IJN turned its attention to the construction of in 1945 .

In contemporary Thai politics , salim ( , ) is a Thai slang referring to people who are sceptics of democracy and supports the military 's involvement in politics . Politicist Surachart Bamrungsuk saw salims as representatives of right wing middle class . The term initially referred to the `` multicoloured shirts '' as a reference to the colourful Thai dessert sarim and was considered by some as a pejorative . It later included other people outside the `` multicoloured shirts '' as well . The term has been used on mainstream media by 2011 . In late February 2020 , the term gained popularity following the Thai Constitutional Court 's order to disband the pro-democracy Future Forward Party . Students , seeing the order as a political abuse , began to use hashtags including the term salim as their online activism against the ruling .
Origin
Thailand in 2005-2010 saw two main political sides either supporting or opposing then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra . The two identified themselves by their shirt colours , nominally ; the yellow shirts ( anti-Thaksin ) and the red shirts ( pro-Thaksin ) . In 2010 , a new political group Network of Citizen Volunteers Protecting the Land was formed and identified as the `` multicoloured shirts '' to distinguish it from the aforementioned two . Some netizens later called the group salim after Thai dessert sarim which is known for its colourfulness . The term is believed to be first used on Thai web-board Pantip.com .
Definition
The term has always been a topic of various definitions and studies socially , politically , philosophically , and economically .
In 2010 , Thatsana Thirawatphirom described that some of the shared traits in definitions of salim include ultra-royalism , ethical , being educated but only believe in what was thought in the curricula , highly cynical but gullible when it comes to people who are seemingly knowledgable , being a strong follower of politics news and see Thaksin Shinawatra as a long-time threat to Thai politics , being bourgeois and trand-settlers , and highly hypocritical .
In 2011 , Faris Yothasamuth describe the uniqueness of salims as being the Thaksin-haters , monarchists , pro-military , democracy skeptics , lacked of reasoning , and deludingly higher than others .
Since the 2020 Thai protests , the term has turned derogatory . It has since been used to refer to those who are ultraconservative , ultra-royalist , and pro-Prayut cabinet .
Usages
Prior to 2020 protests , the term was sparsely used by some writers , journalists , and academics including Nidhi Eoseewong and Kham Phaka .
In late February 2020 , the term gained popularity following the Thai Constitutional Court 's order to disband the pro-democracy New Future Party . Students , seeing the order as a political abuse , began to use hashtags including the term salim as their online activism against the ruling . Some of them include `` # BUกูไม่เอาสลิ่ม '' ( Bangkok University [ BU ] do n't want salims ) , `` # ราชภัฏอยากงัดกับสลิ่ม '' ( Rajabhat universities want to fight with salims ) , `` # KUไม่ใช่ขนมหวานราดกะทิ '' ( Kasetsart University [ KU ] is not salim ) . In 29 February , a channel SalimVEVO released the parody song named du salim ( ดูสลิ่ม , ) with the lyrics beginning with `` [ salims are those who ] love the specially tailored laws '' on YouTube .

Derker is an area of Oldham , in Greater Manchester , England . It lies in north-central Oldham , close to the boundary with Royton .
History
Historically a part of Lancashire , Derker was recorded as a place of residence in 1604 with the name Dirtcar . During the Industrial Revolution , Derker sprouted 5 mills ; 4 of which were cotton , which brought with it terraced housing to house the workers of these mills . A number of these early houses had fallen into a state of disrepair prompting the Housing Market Renewal Initiative . These houses were compulsorily purchased , and demolished , and , as of 2019 , have yet to be replaced .
Granville Mill met a sour end when it was destroyed by fire in 1999 . All of the mills have now been demolished either as a part of the housing market renewal scheme or converted into industrial units .
In the 2000s , Derker had terraced houses `` unsuited to modern needs '' according to the Housing Market Renewal Initiative . This was opposed and legally challenged by local residents . who have lobbied Parliament to protest at the demolitions . The then local MP Phil Woolas opposed the demolitions .
In 2008 the challenge was rejected , and plans to begin regeneration took place . However , with the switch to the Conservative government in 2010 , the funding for the Housing Market Renewal Initiative ceased . But as of 2012 private funding was sought by Oldham Council and plans to start building houses in Derker were announced in 2012 , with the contract being awarded to Keepmoat housing .
Geography
Derker is next to the Greenacres , Higginshaw and Mumps areas of Oldham . It is approximately 1 mile away from Oldham town centre , and 4 miles away from the picturesque villages of Saddleworth .
Transport
Stagecoach Manchester 411 service operates an hourly daytime service from Derker to Oldham Bus Station , as well the evening service to First Manchester 's 81 service between Manchester and Oldham , which extends to Derker ( 8pm onwards ) . As well as this , the Metrolink station , Derker Metrolink Station , which opened in December 2012 . The station was a former railway station , part of the Oldham Loop Line that was decommissioned in 2009 to make way for the new Metrolink system .

Sefapanosaurus was an early , herbivorous sauropodomorph dinosaur occurring in the southern regions of Gondwana some 200 million years ago in the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic . The sauropodomorphs were the dominant terrestrial herbivores throughout much of the Mesozoic Era , from their origins in the mid-Triassic ( approximately 230 Ma ) until their decline and fall at the end of the Cretaceous ( approximately 66 Ma ) . A distinctive feature of this dinosaur is the cross-shaped astragalus or talus bone in its ankle . The generic name is derived from the Sesotho word sefapano , meaning ‘ cross ' and the Greek word saurus , meaning 'lizard ' . The specific name refers to Zastron , the type locality , where the specimen was discovered .
History of study
This new genus was described in the 23 June 2015 issue of 'Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society ' in an essay titled ' A new basal sauropodiform from South Africa and the phylogenetic relationships of basal sauropodomorphs ' . A portion of the left foot and four partial skeletons , including several pieces of spine and limbs , were excavated from the Elliot Formation in the late 1930s in the Zastron district in South Africa , some from the Lesotho border . Until a few years ago these formed part of the large fossil collection curated by the Evolutionary Studies Institute ( ESI ) at Wits University .
When finally studied , the remains were thought to be those of the dinosaur Aardonyx . Further study determined that the remains represented a new dinosaur genus which was intermediate between early bipedal sauropodomorphs and the later giant quadruped sauropods , adding to the list of transitional sauropodomorphs from Argentina and South Africa , and further clarifying their diversification .

The Grumman American AA-1 series is a family of light , two-seat aircraft . The family includes the original American Aviation AA-1 Yankee and AA-1A Trainer , the Grumman American AA-1B Trainer and TR-2 , plus the Gulfstream American AA-1C Lynx and T-Cat .
Development history
The Yankee was originally designed in 1962 by Jim Bede as the BD-1 and was intended to be sold as a kit-built aircraft . Bede decided to certify the design under the then-new FAR Part 23 rules and offer it as a completed aircraft . No BD-1 kits were ever sold .
The prototype first flew on July 11 , 1963 , and featured folding wings for trailering and ease of storage . Bede formed a company , Bede Aviation Corporation , based in Cleveland , Ohio , to produce the aircraft , but the BD-1 never entered production as a certified aircraft . At that time the FAA was hesitant to certify a light aircraft with folding wings . The certification process was complex and expensive and disagreements arose between Bede and the other shareholders . As a result , Bede was ousted by his business partners and the company renamed American Aviation .
AA-1 Yankee Clipper
American 's engineers reworked the wing to a non-folding design , easing FAR Part 23 certification . Other changes included adding extended wing tips to improve rate-of-climb , an anti-servo tab on the elevator along with a centering spring system to increase longitudinal stability and stall strips to improve handling during a stall . The company designated the redesigned aircraft the AA-1 Yankee Clipper .
The AA-1 was certified under FAR Part 23 on August 29 , 1967 , with the first production AA-1 flying on May 30 , 1968 . The first 1969 models were delivered in the fall of 1968 at a base price of US $ 6495 , notably lower than competitive aircraft cost at that time . American Aviation built 459 examples of the AA-1 Yankee Clipper between 1969 and 1971 at their factory in Cleveland , Ohio .
AA-1A Trainer
In 1971 , American Aviation modified the NACA 64-415 airfoil used on the AA-1 's wing , creating the AA-1A Trainer . The recontoured leading edge produced softer stall characteristics and permitted lower approach speeds . While this did tame the AA-1 's sharp stall , it also reduced the cruise speed compared to the original AA-1 by 10 mph . First flight was on March 25 , 1970 , and 470 AA-1As were built in 1971–72 .
AA-1B Trainer and TR-2
Grumman bought American Aviation in 1971 , renaming it Grumman American Aviation , and beginning in late 1972 sold the 1973 model year design as the Grumman American AA-1B Trainer for school use . The variant designed for the personal-use market was called the TR-2 and it featured a standard radio and trim package . The AA-1B was produced until 1976 . 680 AA-1Bs were produced .
All the AA-1s , AA-1As and AA-1Bs were powered by the Lycoming O-235-C2C low-compression engine designed for 80/87 avgas , which produced 108 hp .
AA-1C Lynx and T-Cat
The Grumman light aircraft line was then acquired by Gulfstream Aerospace in 1977 who formed it into their light aircraft division , Gulfstream American , in Savannah , Georgia . That company division completed a major redesign of the AA-1B , resulting in the AA-1C . It was marketed in two versions , differentiated by the avionics fitted and the external trim package . The Lynx was targeted at private owners while the T-Cat was the flying school trainer . These names were chosen to position the aircraft in the Gulfstream American line which , at that time featured the Cheetah , Tiger and the Cougar .
The AA-1C received a new larger horizontal tail and other significant improvements , including a 115 hp Lycoming O-235-L2C high-compression engine designed for 100LL fuel , which brought the cruise speed back up to that of the original 108 hp Yankee . 211 AA-1Cs were produced in 1977 and 1978 .
The last AA-1C was produced by Gulfstream American in 1978 . Overall , 1820 AA-1 family aircraft were built between 1969 and 1978 .
The type certificate for the AA-1 family of aircraft is currently held by True Flight Holdings LLC who bought the assets of Tiger Aircraft on August 2 , 2007 .
Features
All models of the AA-1 accommodate two people in side-by-side seating under a sliding canopy and are noted for their exceptionally light handling . The Yankee and its four-seater siblings , the AA-5 series , feature a unique bonded aluminum honeycomb fuselage and bonded wings that eliminate the need for rivets without sacrificing strength . The wide-track main landing gear struts are laminated fiberglass for shock absorption , marketed as the `` Face Saver '' design by American Aviation .
The Yankee was originally designed to minimize the number of airframe parts used , with the aim of simplifying production and saving money . As a result of this philosophy , many parts were interchangeable . Due to the use of a non-tapered tubular spar , which doubled as the fuel tank , and the lack of wing washout , the wings could be exchanged left and right . The fin and horizontal stabilizers were interchangeable , as were the rudder and the elevators . The ailerons and flaps were similarly the same part . While it did succeed in making production easier , this design philosophy produced many aerodynamic compromises in the design . For instance , because the flaps were the same part as the ailerons they were too small to be effective as flaps . The lack of wing washout , necessitated by the wing interchangeability requirement , meant that stall strips had to be installed to produce acceptable stall characteristics for certification . Over time this philosophy of compromising the aerodynamics in favour of a minimized parts count was abandoned . For example , the redesign of the AA-1B into the AA-1C by Gulfstream involved wider-span elevators and horizontal stabilizers that produced better longitudinal stability , but were no longer interchangeable with the rudder and fin .
Powered by the same 108 hp Lycoming O-235 engine as the Cessna 152 , the original Yankee cruises twenty percent faster thanks to the cleaner wing and better aerodynamics .
Safety record
The original American Aviation AA-1 Yankee developed a poor reputation for safety in its first years of production ( 1969–71 ) . The aircraft was designed purely to fill the role of a personal transportation and touring aircraft and not a trainer , but many of the early production models were purchased by flying schools . The appeal of the AA-1 to schools was obvious – compared to the competition , the AA-1 was faster , cost less to purchase and maintain and , most importantly , had more student-appeal with its sliding canopy and fighter-like looks .
Many of the early school accidents were related to spin-training . Once the AA-1 entered a fully developed spin and exceeded three turns , it was usually not recoverable . The AA-1 had been spin-tested as part of its certification , but in 1973 the FAA issued Airworthiness Directive 73-13-07 ordering the aircraft placarded against spins .
The remaining accidents were generally attributed to the AA-1 's short endurance ( 3.3 hours ) , inability to use short grass strips and high approach speeds ( 85–90 mph ) . These were all different from the other school aircraft in use in that era and took some adaptation by instructors and students alike .
Today most of the AA-1s , AA-1As , Bs and Cs are in private hands . If the pilot is properly trained on the aircraft and stays within its limitations , data show that it is as safe as any other light aircraft .
Modifications
Some AA-1s have had their original engines replaced with larger 150 or 160 hp engines that further increase performance . Other popular modifications include the addition of a dorsal strake on earlier model AA-1s to improve yaw stability or the addition of a transparent red rudder cap to fair the flashing beacon for reduced drag . Some AA-1s have been converted to taildragger configuration .

Tom Oliver ( born 12 June 1938 ) is a British-born Australian retired actor who started his career in theatre in his native country , before emigrating to Australia .
Oliver , a staple of the small screen since the early 1960s , is best known for his TV soap opera roles , most especially Neighbours as Lou Carpenter , a role he played for 25 years . The character was known for his constant sparring with Harold Bishop , and his trademark dirty laugh , which he previously utilised in an earlier role on Number 96 . Oliver has stated that it was inspired by the comic actor Sid James .
He appeared in the early Crawford Productions police procedurals , before having the soap opera roles in Bellbird , as Tom Grey and in Number 96 as Jack Sellers .
Short term soap roles included Prisoner , Sons and Daughters and A Country Practice .
Biography
Early life
Oliver was born in Chandler 's Ford , Hampshire , England and started appearing in amateur theatricals as an adolescent in Britain before pursuing a career as a jockey . However , he failed to gain an apprenticeship owing to his size .
British Navy
He joined the Merchant Navy at 16 and travelled the world , eventually settling in Sydney in 1956 . Whilst in the British Forces , he worked on the Pacific Nuclear Testing Base , Christmas Island and so is a member of the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association .
Career
Early career
While in Australia , Oliver found work as a stockman , spending three years in this job , working his way around the country . He subsequently returned to the UK before beginning an overland trek across Asia to return to Australia . However , the journey was halted by illness and Oliver returned to Britain where he contacted Albert Finney who was then planning to produce the film Ned Kelly in Australia in 1963 . Finney gave him a letter of introduction to an agency in Sydney and Oliver emigrated in 1963 , later becoming an Australian citizen . He frequently visits Fareham , Hampshire to see his old friends .
Oliver became a busy theatre and television actor in Australia . He had many guest starring roles on Australian drama series , appearing frequently in the top-rated Crawford Productions police dramas Homicide , Division 4 , Matlock Police , and in Crawford 's adventure series Hunter ( 1967 ) .
Oliver was then cast in serial Bellbird , playing the role of Tom Grey from 1969 to 1971 , and appeared in the 1971 film Nickel Queen , directed by John McCallum . After this he returned to television guest roles for Crawfords , and other companies . He also appeared in several British TV series at the beginning of the 70 's , such as Paul Temple , Thirty Minute Theatre , and also played two roles in the Gerry Anderson series UFO – a doctor in the episode entitled `` Confetti Check A-OK '' as well as a SHADO technician in the episode entitled `` The Sound of Silence '' .
Oliver also served a stint as a presenter on Play School in 1967 .
Number 96
In 1972 he joined the cast of fledgling soap opera Number 96 playing the role of Janie Somers ' new beau Jack Sellars . Back-slapping rough diamond Jack , nicknamed `` Jolly Jack Sellars '' was intended as a guest character to appear for a run of just three weeks , but the makers of the show were impressed with his performance and the character was made into an ongoing lead regular in the serial .
Oliver became one of the Number 96s most popular cast members . During his run in the show he married fellow Number 96 actress Lynn Rainbow , who played Sonia Vansard and opened a wine bar in Kensington , Sydney cunningly named Jack 's Cellar . In late 1973 , along with much of the show 's regular cast including Rainbow , he reprised his television role in a feature film spinoff of the serial , also called Number 96 . Oliver stayed in the role in the series for more than two years , finally electing to leave in mid-1974 . He quickly returned to guest starring roles on television and film roles of varying sizes . He briefly returned to Number 96 in the role of Jack Sellars in September 1975 . He has been married to his current wife Jan Oliver since 1985 . Whilst acting on Neighbours , he owned a Maltese Shitzu called Lou . He is a keen gardener and mountain fisher .
Television and miniseries and stage
Oliver 's film roles included ABBA : The Movie ( 1977 ) . His primary role in the film is as ABBA 's gruff bodyguard ; however , he additionally appears in the film as a barman and as a chatty moustached taxi driver shown mainly from behind . Through the late 1970s and the 1980s , Oliver appeared in guest and regular roles in many Australian drama series and serials , including Prisoner , Holiday Island , Cop Shop and Sons and Daughters . He also appeared in the acclaimed miniseries The Dismissal portraying Reg Withers . Oliver has been nominated for the Australian Film and Television Awards for Best Supporting Actor three times . Oliver also acted on the stage , appearing in such plays as The Knack , Cactus Flower , How the Other Half Loves and The Club .
Neighbours
Today Oliver is best known for his long-running role of Lou Carpenter in Neighbours . He first appeared for a handful of episodes as lovable rogue used-car salesman Lou , Madge Bishop 's former flame , in 1988 . In early 1992 the character was reintroduced to the series and was a key character until 2016 . Oliver was written out of the show in 1996 but producers relented after numerous petitions from fans and he was quickly reintroduced . By 2009 , he was the show 's longest serving character , both in continuous and overall duration . From the 2009 season , Oliver reduced his role on Neighbours to a part-time regular member of the cast . Oliver appeared in a documentary special celebrating the show 's 30th anniversary titled Neighbours 30th : The Stars Reunite , which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015 . In 2015 , it was announced that Oliver had cut back further on his role as Lou and would only appear from time to time as a guest . In October 2016 it was announced that Oliver had quit the role after 24 years and his last appearance aired in December 2016 .
Lou did not feature in the series finale , but there was still a reference to his character in the form of a lawyers ' office called `` T Oliver '' . Executive producer Jason Herbison later revealed that he had personally called Oliver to inquire about returning for the final episode , but Oliver turned it down as he was `` at a different point in his life now '' .

Kay Dickersin is an academic who trained first in cell biology and subsequently epidemiology . She went on to a career studying factors that influence research integrity , in particular publication bias and outcome reporting bias . She is retired ( as of December 31 , 2018 ) Professor Emerita in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where she was Director of the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence Synthesis there . She was also Director of the US Cochrane Center and the US Satellite of the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group within the Cochrane Collaboration . Dickersin received multiple awards for her research .
Education
Dickersin 's formal academic and research training spans the basic , clinical , and public health sciences . Dickersin began an undergraduate degree at Bennington College in Bennington , Vermont , planning to major in art . After two years , she transferred undergraduate institutions to University of California , Berkeley . She received both a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Zoology ( cell biology ) , from the UC Berkeley , in 1974 and 1975 , respectively . She was awarded a PhD in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1989 . While an undergraduate , she received a Howard Hughes Fellowship in Medical Research in 1971 , and during her PhD research she received an NIH traineeship .
Career
Dickersin spent two months in Dorothy and Claude A. Villee 's research laboratory at Harvard University to complete a `` field work term ” at Bennington College . Her new interest in science led her to leave Bennington after 2 years , and to work in Allan Tobin 's lab in developmental biology at Harvard College . Subsequently , she transferred undergraduate institutions to University of California , Berkeley . At Berkeley , where she did undergraduate and master 's degree research , she worked in Daniel Mazia 's lab . Her master 's thesis was “ Increased Permeability of Sea Urchin Eggs to Adenine After Fertilization , Parthenogenetic Activation , and Exposure to Ammonia ” . After her master 's degree , Dickersin taught biology at two community colleges in California ( West Valley College and Fullerton College ) and subsequently worked in Roger Sloboda 's lab at Dartmouth College doing developmental biology research .
While at Fullerton College , and through her biology students , Dickersin learned about the field of epidemiology , which she liked because it merges science with societal concerns and involves experimental research ( clinical trials ) . In addition , in the late 1970s Dickersin believed the opportunities for women in laboratory research were limited . These two factors led her to switch research areas to public health , a field that she believed is more friendly to women . Dickersin matriculated at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1979 , focusing on clinical trials , and Curtis L. Meinert became her advisor . Her graduate education was interrupted when the family moved to Boston for 4 years in 1981 so that her husband could attend medical school . During this interlude she worked with two influential mentors , Thomas C. Chalmers and Sir Iain Chalmers , and became interested in research synthesis and related biases . When she returned to Baltimore to complete her PhD , she worked on clinical trials as well as research directly linked to publication bias . Her PhD dissertation , “ Publication and the Meta-analysis of Clinical Trials , ” was the first in her Department to use the model where a group of related published research papers is bound together with linking text , rather than the traditional model of a stand-alone document with chapters .
After completing her PhD in 1989 , Dickersin moved to the University of Maryland , School of Medicine , in Baltimore , first to the Department of Ophthalmology and later to the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine . In 1998 , she moved to Brown University School of Medicine where she launched the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence-Based Healthcare . In 2005 , she accepted a position directing the Center for Clinical Trials at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore , renamed in 2014 to the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence Synthesis .
Dickersin 's research career spanned several areas related to clinical trials and systematic reviews of trials . She has led clinical trials , for example she was a principal investigator of two federally funded multicenter randomized trials , the data center for the Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial ( IONDT ) and the Surgical Treatments Outcomes Project for Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding ( STOP-DUB ) . Dickersin became interested in systematic reviews in the mid-1980s , especially the problem of identifying all relevant research on a topic . While her early research focused on establishing the existence of publication bias and the difficulty of retrieving the clinical trial literature , her later research has explored how selective outcome reporting may distort knowledge from clinical trials . She has also contributed to implementation of “ fixes ” related to these problems , aimed at increasing research integrity . For example , she has contributed to the establishment of clinical trial registries , promoting public accessibility to trial findings , and establishment of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993
Over the course of her career , Dickersin served on a variety of federal advisory committees , for example , she was appointed by President Clinton to the National Cancer Advisory Board ( 1994-2000 ) . Internationally , she was instrumental in starting the World Health Organization 's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) and served as Co-Chair of the Scientific Advisory Group from 2005-2008 when it was disbanded . She has also served on numerous Institute of Medicine and National Research Council committees , which include for example : The Vaccine Safety Committee ( 1992-3 ) ; Committee to Advise the Department of Defense on its FY 1993 Breast Cancer Program ( 1993 ) ; Committee to Study the Reimbursement of Routine Patient Care Costs for Medicare Patients Enrolled in Clinical Trials ( 1998-9 ) ; Committee to Assess the System for Protecting Human Research Subjects ( Advisory Consultant ) ( 2001-2 ) ; Committee on the Review of Evidence on High Clinical Value Services ( 2005-7 ) ; Committee on Comparative Effectiveness Research Prioritization ( 2009 ) ; Committee for the Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials ( 2009–10 ) ; Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Clinical Effectiveness Research ( 2009–11 ) .
Cochrane collaboration
Dickersin was a founding member of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993 , and was on the Steering Committee from 1993 to 1996 . She served on the Information Management Steering Group from 2003 to 2005 . She directed the US Cochrane Center , which has evolved from one of four original centers ( she headed the Baltimore Cochrane Center , the first US-based center , opening in 1994 ) . She also directed the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group , US Satellite , since its inception in 2002 and until June 30 , 2018 .
The US Cochrane Center coordinated the development of Cochrane 's Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) from 1994 to 2005 , which was then turned over to The Cochrane Library publisher for further development and maintenance . Dickersin 's papers related to the Cochrane Collaboration are at the National Library of Medicine .
In 2018 , the US Cochrane Center at Johns Hopkins closed and Kay Dickersin stepped down from her position as its director .
Consumer engagement in research
In 1986 , one year after resuming her PhD work , Dickersin was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer . This led to her starting a breast cancer support group , Arm-in-Arm , with Marsha Oakley , and engagement in national and international consumer advocacy work , as a founding mother of the National Breast Cancer Coalition in 1991 . Her papers related to the start of the NBCC are at the Schlesinger Library in Cambridge , Massachusetts . As the only scientist on the Board of Directors of the NBCC , Dickersin initiated a series of “ teach-ins ” for the Board designed to expose Board members to the underlying concepts in biology and epidemiology that they would need to be active contributors to the research agenda . Teaching faculty included Francis Collins and others . This project expanded in 1995 to Project LEAD , a flagship science education program offered by NBCC to consumer advocates and still active in 2014 . Her longstanding support for consumer and patient engagement in the research process is also evident from her involvement in the Department of Defense ( DoD ) Breast Cancer Programme .
In 2003 , Dickersin initiated a coalition of consumer and health advocacy groups ( later named Consumers United for Evidence-based Healthcare or CUE . The idea behind CUE was to bring together consumer groups , who traditionally have not worked together , to form a professional organization for learning and networking . In addition to serving these functions , CUE helps scientist groups to identify consumers for meaningful engagement in research and on advisory and guideline panels . As of 2019 , CUE is directed by Dr. Janice Bowie at Johns Hopkins .

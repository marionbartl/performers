The Cruise of the Snark ( 1911 ) is a non-fictional , illustrated book by Jack London chronicling his sailing adventure in 1907 across the south Pacific in his ketch the Snark . Accompanying London on this voyage was his wife Charmian London and a small crew . London taught himself celestial navigation and the basics of sailing and of boats during the course of this adventure and describes these details to the reader . He visits exotic locations including the Solomon Islands and Hawaii , and his first-person accounts and photographs provide insight into these remote places at the beginning of the 20th century .
About the Snark
In 1906 , Jack London began to build a 45-foot yacht on which he planned a round-the-world voyage , to last seven years .
The Snark was named after Lewis Carroll 's 1876 poem The Hunting of the Snark . She had two masts and was 45 feet long at the waterline and 55 feet on deck , and London claimed to have spent thirty thousand dollars on her construction . She was primarily sail power ; however , she also had an auxiliary 70-horsepower engine . She carried one lifeboat .
After many delays , Jack and Charmian London and a small crew sailed out of San Francisco Bay on April 23 , 1907 , bound for the South Pacific .
One of London 's crew members was young Martin Johnson from Kansas . Following the cruise of the Snark , Martin became an adventurer and world traveler , making some of the earliest motion pictures of unexplored or less-explored areas and peoples of the earth .
The anchor , banister ropes , and oars from Snark were incorporated into the Los Feliz estate of conductor John A . Van Pelt built in the 1930s . The anchor from Snark was made into a chandelier and the oars were used as balcony beams .
Locations visited by the Snark
San FranciscoThe Snark first set sail out of San Francisco on April 23 , 1907 following construction and several months of delay .
HawaiiWhile in Hawaii , London learned the `` Royal Sport '' of surfing , visited the Leper colony on Molokai and traveled by horseback on Maui up and across Haleakala and to Hana .
Marquesas Islands including the island of Taiohee
Tahiti including the town of Papeete , and the islands of Raiatea ,
Bora Bora
Fiji
Samoa
Solomon Islands , Malaita , Langa Langa Lagoon , Laulasi Island
Australia
The Londons ended their voyage at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands and travelled to Sydney on the steamer SS Makambo . Jack spent five weeks in a hospital recovering from infections and illness . A skeleton crew brought the Snark from the Solomons to Australia where she was sold for a fraction of the build-costs . The Londons departed Australia on the SS Tymeric , bound for Ecuador April 8 , 1909 .
Media coverage
London 's voyage garnered some media attention from the point when he first set out into the Pacific . Concern was raised that the Snark might be lost when London failed to arrive in the Marquesas Islands on schedule .
Related works
Jack London 's The Lepers of Molokai first appeared as articles in the Woman 's Home Companion ( 1908 ) and the Contemporary Review ( 1909 ) . Additional essays from the voyage also appeared in The Pacific Monthly and Harper 's Weekly prior to publication of the Cruise of the Snark .
Charmian Kittredge London subsequently wrote three books detailing their adventures aboard the Snark and their extended visits in Hawaii :
The Log of the Snark ( 1915 )
Our Hawaii ( 1917 )
Our Hawaii : Islands and Islanders ( 1917 )
These works provide daily details on the activities of the crew . A comparison with Jack London 's book reveals how he highlighted episodes of most interest to his readers , such as surfing . Charmian London 's books reveal much more description of the cultures they encountered , along with criticism of the effects of colonization . Tucker notes how Charmian distinguishes her accounts from prior women travelog writers in being the sole woman with an all-male crew . This leads to her close reading of gender and hierarchies throughout the voyage .

Critical comments
Ellen Emry Hetzel , of the Seattle Times wrote , concerning O'Connell 's novel , `` Among other achievements , Seattle climber and author Nicholas O'Connell helps us understand the mountaineer mentality ... O'Connell finds his larger theme in what can happen when trust is broken . Even those of us who do n't climb mountains can step into his fictional character 's crampons . ''
`` Author Nicholas O'Connell brings readers along for every painful and heart-stopping step of the way up Denali , '' said Hikari Loftus of Deseret News . `` O'Connell 's knowledge of climbing makes the story believable and relatable to climbers and hikers . The story he writes makes this tale of survival and risks hard to put down . ''
Amherst Magazine book reviewer , DeWitt Henry , said `` this is a fully imagined , thought-provoking and moving debut . ''
In Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers , Ralph K. Allen reviewed O'Connell 's On Sacred Ground , saying `` Nicholas O'Connell 's tightly written history of the Pacific Northwest 's literature is an excellent compass for students , teachers , and the general public to use as a reference , story , or jumping-off point for further research into the spatial character of the Northwest . ''
John Marshall , a critic from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , said `` ( O'Connell ) may be the most successful yet in analyzing the region 's literature ... As `` On Sacred Ground '' illuminates , Northwest literature has come full circle and returned to its native American roots , recalling stories and legends that were rife with reverence for the natural world and all its inhabitants .
David Stevenson of the American Alpine Club , said `` Many of these climbers are writers themselves , well over half with books to their credit ( Messner and Bonington being virtual publishing industries unto themselves ) . But even these familiar faces benefit from O'Connell 's careful questioning and editing . ''
Bob Speik , of Traditional Mountaineering said , `` Beyond Risk is the best book I have found on traditional climbing ethics . It is one of the best reads of the adventure books on traditional mountaineering and climbing that I have enjoyed . ''

The Elmwood District is a neighborhood of the City of Berkeley , California . It is primarily residential , with a small commercial area . The district does not have set lines of demarcation , but is focused around College and Ashby Avenues . The most extreme definitions of the district 's boundaries do not extend past Telegraph Avenue to the west , Dwight Way to the north , or the Oakland city limit to the south . Elmwood was a streetcar suburb that was developed in the 1900s housing boom following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , and was the first Berkeley subdivision to be assigned single-family residential zoning .
It has a small commercial corridor on College Avenue , centered on the intersection of Ashby and College Avenues , that spans College Avenue about one to two blocks in each direction . The commercial corridor consists of small shops and restaurants that cater to local residents . There is also a small movie theater and a bank near the intersection . There are also a handful of businesses near the intersection of College Avenue and Derby Street .
Elmwood was developed as a de facto segregated neighborhood , reinforced by Federal Housing Administration–guaranteed mortgages , which were not issued to African Americans . Homes purchased with FHA-guaranteed mortgages were closely scrutinized to ensure segregation was maintained . In one noted 1958 incident , a white San Francisco schoolteacher , Gerald Cohn , purchased a house with an FHA-guaranteed mortgage in Elmwood . By the closing date , Cohn was not ready to inhabit the property ; while continuing to pay the mortgage , Cohn rented the house to a fellow teacher , Alfred Simmons , who was African American . The Berkeley Police Department asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate Simmons moving in to an all-white neighborhood . Cohn was not prosecuted , but the FHA blacklisted Cohn and prevented him from ever obtaining another government-backed mortgage . Such policies ensured the ongoing segregation of the Elmwood district . As of the 2010 census , census tracts 4237 and 4238 , which encompass the Elmwood district , have the highest percentage white residents of any Alameda County census tract , hovering at 63 % and 77 % respectively .
The housing stock in Elmwood is similar to surrounding areas of Berkeley and consists mostly of detached houses and small apartment buildings . The houses are generally moderate to large Brown Shingle , Arts and Crafts and Colonial Revival homes , sometimes one or two stories , that are usually landscaped with gardens and generally well-kept . The apartment buildings tend to be newer , usually built between the 1950s and 1970s , and become more numerous towards the adjacent Southside neighborhood .
Alta Bates Hospital is located in Elmwood near Ashby and Telegraph Avenues . Maybeck High School , Willard Middle School , the Julia Morgan Center for the Arts , the Claremont Branch of the Berkeley Public Library , and Willard Park are also located within a few blocks of the center of the neighborhood .

Alfred Edwin Brain Jr. ( born London , 24 October 1885 ; died Los Angeles , 29 March 1966 ) was an English player of the French horn . He came from a family which included many famous horn players , including his nephew , Dennis Brain .
His father , Alfred Edwin Brain Sr. was a well-known horn player . Alfred started to learn the trumpet when he was six , but when he was twelve he changed to the French horn and learned from his father . He studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Adolf Borsdorf and also learned the piano from G.D.Cunningham who was to teach his nephew the organ forty years later . His first professional job was with the Scottish Orchestra . He then played in the Queen 's Hall Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra .
When World War I broke out he joined the Scots Guards . Later , in 1917 , he did a lot of dangerous work in France where the fighting was taking place . After the war he was awarded the British War Medal and Victory Medal for his bravery .
When he returned after the war he worked with several of the London orchestras , including Covent Garden where he played for Sir Thomas Beecham . His brother Aubrey , also an excellent horn player , returned from the war after him . By this time Alfred had got all the best horn jobs in London , so it was difficult for Aubrey to find jobs .
In 1923 he emigrated to the United States . He played in the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and later for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra . In his later years he recorded a lot in movie studios , including for 20th century Fox .

The village of Ochsenberg is part of the municipality of Königsbronn in the district of Heidenheim in Baden-Württemberg , Germany .
Geography
Ochsenberg is situated in the eastern part of the Swabian Jura , on the western edge of the Härtsfeld plateau at an altitude of 617 m above sea level ( town hall ) .
History
General
The first documentary evidence dates back to 1538 . Years before the abbot Melchior Ruff , who was active in the Königsbronn Abbey , had already settled woodworkers , charcoal burners and day labourers on a clearing in today 's hamlet . The village name originates from the `` oxen ( Ochsen ) pasture for the abbey , up on the mountain ( Berg ) . '' 1572 Ochsenberg was annexed to Königsbronn .
In the tax audit protocol of 1733 is written : `` All the buildings in this hamlet are the very least in the whole monastery office , none of them is built of bricks and all of which are covered with straw '' .
Around 1800 , the houses were still not made of bricks and were only covered with straw , and the water was only sparsely available from ponds or vats . In 1817 a major fire destroyed ten houses completely . 1849 Ochsenberg became an independent municipality . With the commissioning of the Härtsfeld water pipe on 11 November 1891 Ochsenberg receives a permanent drinking water supply from the wells in Itzelberg .
In 1910 the construction of today 's town hall took place , which also serves as a schoolhouse and fire brigade depot . The supply of electrical power is ensured by UJAG ( Ueberlandwerk Jagstkreis ) from 1917 onwards . The forester Wilhelm Braun from Oberkochen was shot by poachers in the Falchen forest on 1 August 1926 , a memorial stone commemorates the event .
Until 1963 the churchgoers had to walk to Königsbronn , as the Kirchenweg ( church path ) still bears witness to today . On 23 June of the same year , after 2 years of construction , the Johanneskirche ( church of St. John ) was consecrated by pastor Traugott Scheytt , the church windows were designed by Hans Bäurle . On 1 February 1972 Ochsenberg is incorporated into Königsbronn . With the age-related felling of the 175-year-old linden tree on 9 May 1974 , the redesign of the Lindenplatz ( linden square ) began . In 1976 the village receives the collective connection to the sewage treatment plant in Itzelberg . The Staatliche Maschinenhof ( state machinery yard ) , which was relocated from Königsbronn , was inaugurated on 20 May 1977 . The newly built gym and multipurpose hall is ceremonially opened on 31 March 1979 . In 1988 they celebrated 450 years of Ochsenberg .
School , Protestant recreational home
Initially the school lessons were held in private rooms . From 1910 school lessons were held in the newly built town hall and schoolhouse . In 1964 a new building was erected and the old classroom in the town hall was converted into a kindergarten . For 12 years one teacher taught the 1st to 4th primary class in one room at the same time . Since 1976 the children travel by bus to the school in Königsbronn .
In 1981 the school building , which had been unused until then , was rebuilt and extended into a Protestant recreational home with 53 beds .
Due to the low occupancy rate , the complex was rented to the district of Heidenheim from the end of 2015 until autumn 2018 and refugees were accommodated there . Since autumn 2018 the municipality of Königsbronn has rented the building and uses it as subsequent accommodation .
Youth hostel
Planned as a motel at the beginning of the 1960s , the building was abandoned as a shell at the end of the 1960s . In the mid-1970s , the building was extended and converted into a youth hostel with 110 beds , which opened in 1977 . On 31 October 2005 the hostel closed , in February 2014 it was demolished .
Ammunition depot , solar park
For a planned ammunition depot of the Bundeswehr ( Armed forces of Germany ) , a forest area east of the village was cleared in 1963 . The construction of the 19-hectare site took place in 1964-65 :
Administrative district with guard/service building and technical area
11 concrete storage halls
29 larger and 8 smaller ECM ( earth-covered magazine ) Stradley ammunition storage facilities ( bunkers )
2 small ammunition warehouses 25 m2 and 50 m2
In December 1998 the ammunition depot closed , in 2010 the bunkers were demolished .
From February 2014 , a solar park with 40,000 modules was built on the unused site , which will supply up to 3,000 households with electricity . The commissioning takes place in May .
Demographics
In 1538 there were 6 houses in the hamlet . At the beginning of the Thirty Years ' War in 1618 , 40 families lived in 24 houses , by 1648 it had been reduced to 10 houses with 8 families . By 1708 the village grew to 25 houses .
From the description of the district authority Heidenheim of 1844 : `` Hamlet with 51 thatched houses . Of the craftsmen , Ochsenberg has two potters , some weavers , and several bricklayers and carpenters who work journeymen in Königsbronn and Itzelberg . The economic conditions of the inhabitants , a very active , honest , but rather rough and coarse people , have improved noticeably by the lively haulage business , in which the transport of salt , peat , wood , iron , etc . is taken in piecework by local farmers . ''
World War I claims 11 dead and 6 missing soldiers , World War II 17 dead and 12 missing soldiers .
With the arrival and settlement of displaced persons after World War II , the number of inhabitants had increased noticeably .
1 Incorporation 1 February 1972
2 Population census 25 May 1987
Religion
Until the end of World War II , Ochsenberg was Protestant . After that the number of Roman Catholic inhabitants increased considerably due to the displaced persons .
Associations
Choral society Liederlust Ochsenberg
At the end of 1920 the village teacher Wilhelm Heggenberger founded a girls ' choir . The conversion to a mixed choir took place on 14 January 1924 and choir is given the name Liederlust Ochsenberg . In 1931 there were 63 singers .
After World War II , the resumption of singing lessons began in October 1947 and in January 1948 the choir is newly founded . In 1994 the first performance of the children 's choir took place . In the 75th anniversary year 1999 104 members were counted , 49 of them active singers .
Shooting club SSV Ochsenberg
Already in autumn 1928 11 men met with the idea to found the KK-Schützenverein 'Edelweiß ' Ochsenberg . This takes place in 1929 and the practical shooting started in spring in the clay pit in the Falchen . In 1939 the club had 30 active members and 5 young shooters .
After World War II , shooting clubs were initially banned by the Allies . On 15 October 1954 , an extraordinary meeting was held at the tavern Zur Linde to reestablish the club , and the name is changed to Sportschützenverein 'Edelweiß ' Ochsenberg . At first a shooting room was provided in the Hirsch tavern , later there was also shooting in the private house of Heinz Elser . From 15 March 1957 on the shooting took place in the leased , municipality-owned barrack .
In 1979 the club had 115 members : 94 active shooters , 2 honorary members and 19 passive members . With the 60th anniversary in 1989 the new club flag is inaugurated , in 2004 they celebrated its 75th anniversary .
Clubhouse
From 29 July 1961 on the construction of the new clubhouse was started . After 6,000 hours of voluntary work , it is ceremonially opened on 26 October 1963 . In 1972 the extension of the kitchen was built . 1988 a further extension took place ( sanitary facilities , heating & evaluation room ) . In 1999 the clubhouse gets its present appearance by the extension of the new shooting hall .
Nickname
Steftsstecke is the historical nickname of the residents of Ochsenberg . A Steftsstecke is a strong and long stick ( Stecken ) equipped with an iron tip ( Steft ) at the lower end . People used this stick in many ways . It was useful for walking or climbing steep paths not only in winter , it also helped to push a sled . Often it was used to poke into or examine objects lying on the ground .
The advantage of the Steftstecke was proven by this historical narrative : Around 1820 , Ochsenberger boys made their way to Ebnat for the church anniversary ( religious festival ) . The bachelors from Ebnat were not happy about this , wanted to keep uninvited competition away from the dance floor and ran towards the Ochsenberg boys . The two groups already met at the boundary of the mark in the forest . After an exchange of words , a scuffle followed , which developed into a bloody quarrel . The Steftstecke they took with them proved to be a great advantage and the boys from Ochsenberg emerged as winners .

From Nördlingen in Bavaria they crossed the Württemberg state border with their cattle , had to pay customs and moved on to the markets . By far the largest tree was colloquially called the `` Judenbusch '' . The storms of the last decades affected the tree more and more . On the morning of 18 May 2020 , the last remaining branch broke off due to its own weight . Its age was nearly 300 years , the remaining stump has a circumference of 6.35 m .

Hannathon , and of the 1350-1335 BC Amarna letters , Hinnatuna , or Hinnatuni/Hinnatunu , is the Biblical city/city-state of Hannathon , ( meaning : `` the Gift of Grace '' ) ; in the Amarna letters correspondence as Hinnatuna , it is a site in southern Canaan , site uncertain . Ancient settlement of Tel Hanaton in Lower Galilee has been suggested as a candidate .
Amarna letters mentioning Hinnatuna
Hinnatuna is referenced in 2 Amarna letters , EA 8 , and EA 245 ( 'EA ' stands for 'El Amarna ' ) .
Amarna letter EA 8 is a letter to Pharaoh by Burna-Buriash of Karaduniyaš- ( i.e . Babylon ) . The letter , entitled : `` Merchants murdered , vengeance demanded '' , states near the letter beginning : `` ... Now , my merchants who were on their way with Ahu-tabu , were detained in Canaan for business matters . After Ahu-tabu went on to my brother- ( the pharaoh ) , –in Hinnatuna of Canaan , Šum-Adda , the son of Balumme , and Šutatna , the son of Šaratum of Akka- ( modern Acre ) , having sent their men , killed my merchants and took away [ th ] eir money . ''
Burna-Buriash continues , and states that he demands retribution , as well as he makes a warning to the pharaoh , that his own merchants/envoys are in danger .
Letter EA 245 , title : `` Assignment of guilt ''
Letter EA 245 , to pharaoh , letter no . 4 of 7 by Biridiya , concerns the rebel , and mayor of Shechem- ( Amarna Šakmu ) , Labayu , and his cohort and protector : Surata of Akka- ( modern Acre , Israel ) .
EA 245 is the second tablet of a 2–Tablet letter- ( Part 1 lost ) .
Letter Part 2 of 2 :
( 1-7 ) '' Moreover , I urged my brothers , `` If the god of the king , our lord , brings it about that we overcome Lab'ayu , then we must bring him alive : ha-ia-ma to the king , our lord . ''
( 8-12 ) My mare , however , having been put out of action : tu-ra ( having been shot ) , I took my place behind him : ah-ru-un-ú and rode with Yašdata .
( 13-20 ) But before my arrival they had struck him down : ma-ah-sú-ú , - ( mahāsū ) . Yašdata being truly your servant , he it was that entered with me into batt [ le ] .
( 21-47 ) ( bottom/tablet and reverse ) May ... [ ... ] the life of the king , my [ lord ] , that he may br [ ing peace to ever ] yone in [ the lands of ] the king , [ my ] lord . It had been Surata that took Lab'ayu from Magidda and said to me , `` I will send him to the king by boat : a-na-yi . '' Surata took him , but he sent him from Hinnatunu to his home , for it was Surata that had accepted from him : ba-di-ú his ransom .
( ? 41-47 ) Moreover , what have I done to the king , my lord , that he has treated me with contempt : ia8-qí-ìl-li-ni and honored : ia8-ka-bi-id my less important brothers ?
( ? 41-47 ) It was Surata that let Lab'ayu go , and it was Surata that let Ba ' l-mehir go , ( both ) to their homes . And may the king , my lord , know . '' -EA 245 , lines 1-47 ( complete , ( minor 1-sentence lacuna ) ) ( Letter Part 2 of 2 ; Letter Part 1–lost )

A tiger kidnapping or tiger robbery involves two separate crimes . The first crime usually involves an abduction of any person or thing someone highly values . Instead of demanding money , the captors demand that a second crime be committed on their behalf . The second crime could be anything from robbery , murder , to planting a bomb . A person or item held hostage is kept by the captors until their demands are met . The goal of the captors is to have their risky/dirty work performed by another person . The victims of a crime like this are less likely to report to authorities since they just committed a crime themselves .
Origins
The practice began as a twist on a tactic used by the Irish Republican Army , which kidnapped people in order to coerce others into placing car bombs .
The first recorded crime that can be described as a tiger kidnapping occurred in 1972 , but the term was coined in the 1980s and gained more widespread use in the following decade . Since tiger kidnapping is technically two crimes committed in tandem , statistics regarding their occurrence are difficult to compile . Tiger kidnappings have occurred in several jurisdictions , but are more common in the United Kingdom , Ireland , and Belgium . Examples include the Northern Bank robbery and Bank of Ireland robbery . According to International Herald Tribune , tiger kidnappings `` have become common in Ireland , a close-knit society where criminals can closely track their targets '' and `` they have typically involved thefts below €1 million . '' After the 2009 Bank of Ireland robbery , Charlie Flanagan , a member of the Irish Parliament , remarked that “ tiger kidnappings are taking place in Ireland ... at a rate of almost one per week . ”
Countermeasures
Businesses can take several steps to guard against these such as mandating that two or more people must work in tandem in order to open sensitive areas such as bank vaults and cash boxes .
In popular culture
The movies Cash on Demand , Nick of Time , Bandits , Firewall , Intermission and Waist Deep dramatize tiger kidnappings .
The video game Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney − Justice for All features a tiger kidnapping as a plot point in its final case .
A tiger kidnapping is also carried out in Season 4 of Love/Hate .
The series Happy Valley features a kidnapping that is falsely described as a tiger kidnapping by Sergeant Cawood .

The Dodge Journey is a mid-size crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ' Dodge brand for model years 2009 to 2020 over a single generation , with a facelift for the 2011 model year . The Journey was styled by Ryan Nagode , and was marketed globally in both left and right hand drive , including as the Fiat Freemont .
Internally identified as the JC49 , the Journey shares FCA 's global D-segment platform with the Dodge Avenger and a nearly identical wheelbase to the outgoing short wheelbase ( SWB ) Dodge Caravan .
Having debuted at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show , the Journey subsequently appeared at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show . All models were manufactured in Mexico at FCA 's Toluca Assembly facility , with just over 1.1 million manufactured before production ended in 2020 .

As a mid-size CUV , the Journey was available in five and seven passenger configurations and was noted for its overall packaging and seating flexibility — which included a front passenger seat with under-cushion storage and fold-flat capability ; second-row for-aft sliding , reclining , fold-flat seating with an H-point 1.6 inches ( 40 mm ) higher than the front row ( aka theater seating ) ; latching under-floor storage with removable bins ; available twin booster seats and single-hand-operable third row access ; available twin fold-flat third-row seats and an aft under-floor storage compartment .

The Keyless Enter-'n'-Go System , with keyless access and push-button start , became standard on all Journey models .
For the 2012 model year , the Journey became Dodge 's smallest SUV after FCA stopped manufacturing the Nitro . SE and SXT trims return for 2012 , replacing Express and Mainstreet trims , respectively . An American Value Package ( AVP ) model is also added for the United States market that is priced below the SE . For the 2013 model year , Dodge released a `` Blacktop '' trim option , with 19-inch gloss black aluminium wheels and center caps , a gloss black grille , gloss black bezel headlamps , gloss black lower front fascia accent and gloss black exterior mirrors . In 2014 , the Journey Crossroad was introduced with chrome accents along the lower part of the body and in the interior , smoked head and taillights , a black grille , rocker panels , rails for a roof rack , and a skid plate simile at the rear . Chrysler added the revised Dodge logo with two slanted rectangles for the 2013 Model Year . For the 2016 model-year , the Journey 's AVP and Limited trims were discontinued and the Crossroad Plus trim was added and also for the 2017 model-year ; the R/T trim is replaced by the GT trim .

About the title , the director says `` The title , Action Hero Biju , stems from my interest in narrating a common man 's story . Biju is an extremely common and secular name in Kerala and I felt it has cuteness about it . My film tells the story of a common man who becomes a brave cop , and I felt the title is a perfect fit '' . He also explained `` The film is a light take on policing , it is not the hardcore police kind of story – it is a mix of humour and action . It is about a police sub-inspector 's heroism . We see the world through his eyes – we experience his views , experiences and emotions '' . The title was announced in September 2014 .

Nivin Pauly was selected to play the title character of the film sub-inspector Biju . Anu Emmanuel who made her debut as a child artist in Swapna Sanchari ( 2011 ) was placed to play the female lead , who was suggested by her father and producer Thankachan Emmanuel .

The Conquest of Ran Wei by Former Yan or Wei-Yan war was a conflict in North China in 352 CE between the Former Yan , composed of mixed Xianbei-Han forces , and the Ran Wei . It ended in Yan victory , bringing about the downfall of the Ran Wei regime and the rise of brief Xianbei rule in North China .
Background
In 350 CE , Ran Min restored native Han rule to North China and issued a cull order , starting the Wei-Jie war . As a result , thousands of Wu Hu ( : zh : 胡人 ) were killed , and their uprisings suppressed with the exception of the Xianbei tribe in Northeast China . In 352 CE , the Murong Xianbei attacked Ran Wei with generals and soldiers from both Xianbei and Han backgrounds .
Course of the war
Although initially successful , the Ran Wei army was ambushed by the Former Yan forces , who used Xianbei heavy cavalry to charge into Wei infantry lines . Ran Min himself was captured after single handedly killing more than a hundred enemy soldiers .
When asked why he had usurped Later Zhao , Ran Min replied : `` If beastly barbarians like you can be emperor , why not me , a heroic descendant of the Huaxia ! ''
Murong Jun was furious that Ran insulted him as a barbarian and ordered Ran to be executed .
Aftermath
With the fall of Ran Wei , Xianbei forces controlled much of North China , until the rise of the Liu Song dynasty almost a century later .

Player 's Guide to the Dragonlance Campaign is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game , published in 1993 .
Contents
Player 's Guide to the Dragonlance Campaign illustrates key concepts in the Dragonlance setting with original fiction , essays , graphics , and sidebars , and does not include game mechanics , character stats , and role-playing game jargon . The Player 's Guide to the Dragonlance Campaign includes a large selection of maps and portraits . Focusing on the continent of Ansalon , where most Dragonlance campaigns take place , the first half of the book comprises a guided tour of major locations , using first-person narratives . The tale of a seafaring Kagonesti elf , for example , sets up an overview of the empire of Ergoth . An encounter with a pirate ship leads into a look at the dwarven land of Kayolin . Each entry features concise but informative sections on culture , climate , and trade . The book also introduces a gallery of personalities , among them the undead Lord Soth and Sivart of the Kagonesti . The second half of the book contains less fiction but more history , which emphasizes gully dwarves , tinker gnomes , and other Ansalon races .
Publication history
Player 's Guide to the Dragonlance Campaign is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game supplement published as a 128-page softcover book by TSR , Inc . The source material was by David `` Zeb '' Cook , Michael Dobson , Jeff Grubb , Tracy Hickman , Harold Johnson , Douglas Niles , and Margaret Weis , with compilation , editing , and original material by Jonatha Ariadne Caspian . Illustrations are by Denis Beauvais , Jeff Butler , Clyde Caldwell , Larry Elmore , Stephen Fabian , Keith Parkinson , Robin Raab , and Valerie Valusek .
Reception
Rick Swan reviewed the Player 's Guide to the Dragonlance Campaign for Dragon magazine # 210 ( October 1994 ) . Having also reviewed the Player 's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign in the same column , he declares : `` For the hapless souls intimidated by the sprawl of Dragonlance ( and the equally imposing Forgotten Realms setting ) TSR comes to the rescue with these two Player 's Guides . While the content is familiar—old hat , in fact , to veteran AD & D game players—the format is brand-new . Gone are [ ... ] everything that makes novices feel like they 've wandered into a foreign country . Instead of using rules , the books illustrate key concepts with original fiction , as whimsical as fairy tales and a treat to read . '' Swan called the Player 's Guide to the Dragonlance Campaign `` the better of the two '' , explaining that it `` boasts crisp writing and a generous selection of maps and portraits '' . He also felt that `` Lucid explanations make this a good resource as well as a good read . Take , for instance , the Knights of Solamnia , an order of chivalrous warriors who fell out of favor prior to the War of the Lance . The responsibilities and membership requirements of the knights have been discussed in umpteen previous supplements [ ... ] But for the novice , the game lingo in the earlier books made life difficult ; it 's hard to get a handle on the ethos of a Knight of the Rose when you 're still struggling with proficiency bonuses . The Player 's Guide , however , provides clutter-free summaries . A novice who does n't know a proficiency bonus from a ping-pong ball will come away with a clear understanding of the Rose Knights ' commitment to justice and how it relates to the legacy of Huma Dragonbane . '' Swan did have a few complaints : `` By downplaying the conflict between good and evil that forms the backbone of the Dragonlance mythos , the book fails to capture the epic scope of the early novels . [ ... ] Familiar characters , such as Flint Fireforge and Sturm Brightblade , receive only single-paragraph biographies . For those interested in using Ansalon as a campaign setting , it would 've been nice to suggest which supplements they need . Swan concluded his review by saying : `` Make no mistake . These books are intended as introductions , providing broad overviews for beginners . Serious players who want serious answers can skip the Player 's Guides and go right to the Tales of the Lance boxed set ( for the Dragonlance setting ) and the revised in 1993 edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting set . But if you 're not ready for the big time , or if you 're more curious than committed , try the Player 's Guides first . ''

Project : F.E.T.U.S . is an album by rapper One Be Lo that was first released in 2002 . Over half the album was recorded before the release of the Binary Star album Masters of the Universe in 2000 . The original goal of the album was to press only 1000 copies for fans that wanted to hear anything from One Be Lo that was available but after those copies were sold in less than 2 weeks they decided to press more . The LA Underground picked up the album and re-released it in 2003 , releasing it under the name `` OneBeLo aka OneManArmy '' ( originally labeled as just OneBeLo ) . The whole album was intentionally not mixed or mastered and is basically a compilation of rejected songs for the album L.I.F.E .
The acronym F.E.T.U.S . stands for `` For Everyone That UnderStands '' .

Hue and Cry is a 1947 British film directed by Charles Crichton and starring Alastair Sim , Harry Fowler and Joan Dowling .
It is generally considered to be the first of the Ealing comedies , although it is better characterised as a thriller for children . Shot almost entirely on location , it is now a notable historic document due to its vivid portrait of a London still showing the damage of the Second World War . London forms the backdrop of a crime-gangster plot which revolves around a working class children 's street culture and children 's secret clubs .
Plot
Following church choir practice in 1946 east London , Joe Kirby ( Harry Fowler ) reads aloud to his gang ( The Blood and Thunder Boys ) from the Trump boys ' comic , but finds a page missing . He then buys a copy so he can follow the adventures of fictional detective Selwyn Pike . While reading one part of the latest story , Joe finds the comic adventure being repeated exactly in real life when he comes across two men carrying a crate ( Joe thinks it contains corpses ) into Mr Jago 's fur shop . Even the truck number plate—GZ 4216—matches the comic .
Joe gets a friend to distract Jago so he can search the crates . Jago catches Joe and calls the police but he does not press charges . A policeman , Inspector Ford , tells Joe to stop letting his imagination run wild . Ford sends Joe to meet a Covent Garden grocer , Nightingale ( Jack Warner ) , for a job . Nightingale likes Joe 's stories .
Later , in a hideout in a bombed-out building , Joe 's friends tease him about the incident , until another boy says he saw a truck with GZ 4216 plate that morning . Joe says he thinks criminals are planning jobs via the Trump . To find out more they visit the comic 's writer , Felix Wilkinson ( Alastair Sim ) .
Joe and Alec find Wilkinson 's house , find out the comic 's editions are being manipulated and tell Wilkinson . He sees the criminals are using the codes from the comic to communicate their plans but , fearful of the gang , Wilkinson refuses to aid the boys .
Joe tells the police but nobody listens so he visits the offices of the Trump . Here Joe meets Norman and together they work out the code from the next issue - 'Tattoo Jack 's ' plan to rob an Oxford Street department store . At the store , Joe 's gang think they have overpowered the thieves but it is really the police , who have been tipped off anonymously . The kids scarper down a manhole .
Norman then tells the kids about Rhona Davis ( Valerie White ) who also works at the Trump . After following her home , the boys tie her up . Joe then telephones Nightingale , who then rescues Miss Davis . One of Joe 's gang gets in the villain 's car unnoticed and hears that stolen goods are being moved to Ballard 's Wharf but without seeing that it is Nightingale .
Joe then gets Wilkinson to create a Trump story that sends all the criminals to Ballard 's Wharf . Next day , Joe tells Nightingale the whole plan , but then realises he is the mastermind as his car number plate matches . Nightingale and Miss Davis review the latest Trump story and are amused at Joe 's attempt to capture them , that is until Nightingale realises Joe has caught him out by sending the crooks to Nightingale 's own warehouse .
Joe goes to the warehouse and finds the stolen furs but is disturbed by Nightingale . However , when the other crooks arrive , Nightingale does n't know the password as he never finished the latest comic story . He 's knocked unconscious by the crooks . Heading for Ballard 's Wharf , the crooks are outnumbered by hundreds of boys who capture them . Nightingale tries to flee in a van , but Joe leaps aboard and causes it to crash . Nightingale runs into a bombed building and , after a fight with Joe , Nightingale falls through one of the many holes in the floor . Joe jumps onto Nightingale , sprawled out below , winding him completely just as the police arrive . The final scene returns to the same church choir session as at the film 's beginning , but with many of the boys now sporting black eyes and bandages , war-wounds from their recent adventures .

City Raga is the eighteenth album by Popol Vuh . It was originally released in 1995 on Milan Records .
In this album , Popol Vuh plays a style of music which is similar to bands like Enigma , Deep Forest or Banco de Gaia , mixing electronic music and dance rhythms with ethnic chants and the sampled voice of singer Maya Rose rather than the krautrock , psychedelic rock and ambient music of their previous releases . Because of this , City Raga remains generally a controversial release among Popol Vuh 's fanbase .

The Caproni Trento F.5 was a small Italian two-seat trainer designed by Stelio Frati and built by Aeroplani Caproni Trento . The F.5 was not ordered into production and only a prototype was built .
Design and development
By the 1950s the Caproni company had collapsed and could not survive the postwar economic problems . One of the few group members to continue working was Aeroplane Caproni Trento , based at Gardola in Trento . Originally involved with aircraft maintenance and support , the company decided to design and build a small jet trainer in 1951 . The F.5 aircraft was designed by Stelio Frati based on his earlier glider work . It was a low-wing all-wood monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear . The engine was a small Turbomeca Palas turbojet located in the fuselage . It had two inlet ducts , one either side of the fuselage and the exhaust was below the rear fuselage . It had an enclosed cabin with tandem seating for an instructor and student and was fitted with a jettisonable canopy .
The F.5 made its maiden flight on 20 May 1952 . It was the first jet aircraft developed in postwar Italy . Although evaluated by the Italian Air Force it gained little interest and was not ordered into production .
Operators
Italian Air Force one aircraft for evaluation test
Aircraft on display
The prototype , registered I-FACT , and only F.5 is on display at the Museo dell'Aeronautica Gianni Caproni in Trento .

Tamapin is a toxin from the Indian Red Scorpion ( Hottentotta tamulus ) , which is a selective and potent blocker of SK2 channels .
Etymology
Tamapin is named after the scorpion from which it was isolated .
Sources
Tamapin has been isolated from hottentotta tamulus , the Indian red scorpion .
Chemical structure and methods of isolation
Tamapin belongs to short-chain scorpion toxin subfamily 5 , together with PO5 and Scyllatoxin . Its sequence similarity to other toxins that can compete with the binding site of apamin is much lower . It is 31 amino acids long and its weight is 3458 Daltons . Its amino acid sequence is AFCNLRRCELSCRSLGLLGKCIGEECKCVPY , with disulfide bonds between Cys3-Cys21 , Cys8-Cys26 , and Cys12-Cys28 ( chemical formula C146H234N42O42S6 ) .
Tamapin has been isolated via detection of the apamin-competing fraction of the venom from the scorpion via a Sephadex G-50 size exclusion chromatography , followed by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) .
An isoform of tamapin , tamapin-2 , has been found , in which the tyrosine is replaced by a histadine . Tamapin-2 can also compete very effectively with apamin for binding to synaptosomes .
Target and mode of action
The target of tamapin is the small conductance calcium-dependent potassium ( SK ) channel . This scorpion toxin blocks SK2 channels with selectivity for SK2 versus SK1 channels in a largely reversible manner . Despite completely different sequences , Apamin ( a bee venom toxin ) and tamapin share at least in part , the same binding sites on rat brain synaptosomes . Cloned SK2 are most sensitive for Apamin in binding assays and physiological recordings . However , tamapin displaces Apamin in binding assays and is therefore a stronger toxin with respect to Apamin . SK 1 and SK 3 are only affected with a high concentration of tapamin and therefore this toxin inhibits SK2 with the highest affinity , SK3 intermediate and the lowest affinity for SK1 channels . A less closely related member of the SK channels is the intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel SK4 , also known as IK1 , which is not sensitive to Apamin and is also not affected by Tapamin . The same applies to voltage dependent potassium channels ; the block of SK2-mediated currents is not voltage dependent . This specific channel block evokes a reduction in the small conductance calcium-dependent potassium channels current .
Toxicity
Previous studies showed that the effect of tamapin is largely reversible and depends on time and concentration . The Indian red scorpion ( Hottentotta tamulus ) causes a large number of deaths annually especially among young children . Its venom contains highly specific potassium channel blockers such as iberiotoxin , which is a highly specific blocker of the high conductance calcium activated potassium channel , and tamulustoxin .

The Saint Joseph Church and Shrine is a historic district located at 8742 U.S. Route 12 in the Irish Hills region in rural Cambridge Township in Lenawee County , Michigan . The district was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on April 19 , 1990 , and added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 4 , 2007 .
History
The church traces its origins to its founding as a missionary church in 1854 by the area 's earliest Irish settlers . Irish Catholics had trickled into the area beginning in the 1830s , and they met in private homes for occasional mass . By 1852 , a large enough number were in the area that a church was needed , and Humphrey and Ann Agan and Martin Kelly deeded the site on which this church stands to the Bishop of Detroit . Work on the church itself commenced in 1854 , and continued on and off until 1862 . Originally , the church was a very simple fieldstone church with no exterior adornments .
The church 's tower , sacristy , and stained glass windows were added in 1911 . A new roof , transept , and sanctuary were added in 1928 . In 1932 , the shrine was completed under the supervision of Hispanic architects Leo Ouelette , Dionicio Rodriguez , and Ralph Corona . The first resident priest of the church arrived until 1954. and the church continues to function as a Catholic church .
Description
The district consists of a church edifice and a shrine . The district also consists of a cemetery with graves dating back to the 1850s . The church is a fieldstone cruciform-plan structure with a hip roof . A square-plan , hip-roof bell tower at the front contains an entry vestibule . Both the church and tower are topped with a red ceramic tile roof . A 1954 addition in located in one corner of the church .

Strozzapreti ( ; `` priest choker '' or `` priest strangler '' in Italian ) are an elongated form of cavatelli , or hand-rolled pasta typical of the Emilia-Romagna , Tuscany , Marche and Umbria regions of Italy as well as in the state of San Marino . The name is also used for a baked cheese and vegetable dumpling , prepared in some regions of Italy and on the French island of Corsica .
Origin of name
There are several legends to explain the name , primarily based on the anticlerical sentiment of the region .
One is that gluttonous priests were so enthralled by the savory pasta that they ate too quickly and choked themselves . Another explanation involves the `` azdora '' ( `` housewife '' in the Romagna dialect ) , who `` chokes '' the dough strips to make the strozzapreti . The azdora would express rage ( perhaps triggered by the misery and difficulties of her life ) and curse the local clergy , resulting in pasta that could choke a priest . A third states that wives would customarily make the pasta for churchmen as partial payment for land rents ( In Romagna , the Catholic Church had extensive land properties rented to farmers ) , and their husbands would be angered enough by the venal priests eating their wives ' food to wish the priests would choke as they stuffed their mouths with it . The name surely reflects the diffuse anticlericalism of the people of Romagna and Tuscany .
Another possible explanation is that following Sunday mass , it was common for the priest to visit homes of the villagers and enjoy dinner with them . The more pleasant experiences for the priest would entice them to come back to that particular home more frequently . As a means for the family to let the priest know that he might be overextending his welcome , they would serve this pasta which had later earned the name `` Strozzapreti . '' Another origin story is that the pasta resembles a clerical collar , commonly referred to as a `` Priest Choker '' .
Description
The name strozzapreti can refer either to a fresh pasta type or to a gnocchi type .
Pasta types
In the cuisine of Romagna strozzapreti are short twisted cords obtained by hand from water and flour pasta . In the countryside between Faenza and Lugo , strozzapreti col nodo are widespread , obtained by knotting each piece of pasta after twisting it on itself .
In the cuisine of Imola and Ravenna between the end of the 1800s and the middle of the 1900s , strozzapreti were called `` suffocated priests '' , a terminology that has since disappeared , and were slightly larger .
In Emilia the dough is made from flour , water , Parmesan cheese , and egg whites , all beaten together .
In Umbrian cuisine with the term strozzapreti or strangozzi is meant long pasta with a square section made of water and flour .
In the Latium cuisine the strozzapreti are spaghettoni pulled by hand . In the area of Viterbo , the stratto is a handmade pasta , typical of the town of Blera , seasoned with tartufi .
In the city of L'Aquila in Abruzzo the strangolapreti are big cords of pasta of Triticum durum long about 20 cm .
Pici is a somewhat similar form of pasta from Tuscany in which hand-rolled , solid fat tubes of dough are cut but left untwisted ; the taut , rope-like appearance provides yet another popular explanation for the association with strangling .
The dough ( see some regional variations below ) is rolled out in thick flat sheets . It is then cut into strips . The strips are lightly rolled or twisted between the palms . The large pasta is separated into 10 cm pieces by pinching . Unlike spaghetti or macaroni , this pasta is not uniform in size or shape .
Gnocchi types
In the Trentino cuisine and in the Milanese cuisine the strangolapreti are gnocchi made of stale bread , spinach , eggs and grana cheese from Trentino , served with melted butter and sage . In Milanese and Larian cuisine , soft cheese is also added .
In the Neapolitan cuisine with the term strangulapriévete are designated simple gnocchi , made at home with water and flour .
In the Salentine cuisine with the term strangulaprevati are meant the potato dumplings .
In the Calabrian cuisine the strangugliapreviti are dumplings made of flour and eggs ; in the nicastrese tradition they are the dish of Martedi ' Grasso .
In the Corsican cuisine the name `` sturzapréti '' refers also to large gnocchi made of cheese and vegetables , and then baked . Seasoned spinach or chard is rolled into balls together with brocciu cheese , and then baked in the oven . These balls are large enough to choke a person if eaten whole .

The Military Provost Guard Service ( MPGS ) is responsible for maintaining physical security at British Armed Forces locations throughout Great Britain . It is one of three constituent units of the Adjutant General 's Corps Provost Branch ( the other two parts being the Royal Military Police and the Military Provost Staff ) . The Provost branch is the responsibility of the Provost Marshal who is a Brigadier from the Royal Military Police . The MPGS also works alongside the unarmed Ministry of Defence Guard Service ( MGS ) . In Northern Ireland , armed security at Ministry of Defence establishments is provided by the uniformed civilian Northern Ireland Security Guard Service in a similar manner to that of the MPGS in Great Britain .
History and operational role
The MPGS was formed in the wake of structural changes of the Armed Forces and the increased threat of terrorism in 1997 .
The MPGS 's duties include :
Controlling entry and exit access to a site
Managing control room operations and ensuring all visitors are dealt with efficiently
Patrolling site perimeters and taking necessary action to preserve perimeter security
Security incident management , such as suspicious packages , bomb threats , protests , etc .
Military Working Dog services at some sites .
To join the MPGS , applicants must have served for at least three years in any arm or service , including the Royal Naval Reserve , Royal Marines Reserve , Territorial Army , and Royal Auxiliary Air Force . They must have completed that service within six years of application to the MPGS , unless they have relevant service in the Police or HM Prison Service since leaving the armed forces .
To join , they have to re-enlist into the Regular British Army on a Military Local Service Engagement ( MLSE ) . The MLSE is a form of engagement which is ideally suited to use by the MPGS . The MLSE is renewable on a three-yearly basis providing the soldier continues to meet the requirements and standards of the service , as well as there being a continued need for MPGS soldiers at that particular unit .
There are 26 police constabularies that currently have a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) with the Military Provost Guard Service in respect of the legal authority for carrying firearms on UK roads .
Uniform and equipment
MPGS soldiers are issued the same uniform and equipment as other arms and services in the British Army , albeit at a reduced scale due to their barracks-based role . Everyday working dress is the standard Personal Clothing System Combat Uniform ( PCS CU ) in Multi-Terrain Pattern ( MTP ) , beret with cap badge , belt ( or stable belt ) and combat boots . The shirt and jacket will have the MPGS tactical recognition flash ( see top ) on the right sleeve . If soldiers are carrying out security duties on roads or vehicle checks , they may also wear a high-visibility yellow jacket , normally with `` SECURITY '' or `` MILITARY GUARD '' printed on the front and back . The main firearm used by the MPGS is the SA80 L85A2 assault rifle ; Glock 9 mm semi-automatic pistols may also be used . All MPGS soldiers must pass a weapon handling test biannually to use firearms .
Vehicles
The MPGS utilises Toyota 4x4 pickup vehicles in white or silver with `` SERVICE SECURITY PATROL '' or `` ARMY SECURITY PATROL '' on the bonnet , left side , right side and at the rear on top of a yellow fluorescent stripe . Some vehicles have an amber strobe beacon on the roof for increased visibility . In late 2013 the Ministry of Defence purchased Ford Ranger pickups for use within the MPGS and other MOD departments .

Mr. Nigel Fezziwig is a character from the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol created by Charles Dickens to provide contrast with Ebenezer Scrooge 's attitudes towards business ethics . Scrooge apprenticed under Fezziwig . Despite this , the older Scrooge seems to be the very antithesis of Mr. Fezziwig in appearance , actions , and characterization . Mr. Fezziwig is portrayed as a jovial , foppish man with a large Welsh Wig .
In Stave 2 of A Christmas Carol , the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge to revisit his youthful days in Fezziwig 's world located at the cusp of the Industrial Revolution . Dickens used Fezziwig to represent a set of communal values and a way of life which was quickly being swept away in the economic turmoil of the early nineteenth century .
Character
Scrooge , who is a very mean person and does not care about anything but himself and money , diverged greatly from the people under he apprenticed and once admired . Fezziwig , as an early adopter of capitalism , moderates profit maximization with kindness , generosity , and affection for his employees . In the early 19th century , such small owner-controlled traders were being swept up .
Extended characterizations
Film characterizations
In the screenplay for the 1951 film Scrooge by Noel Langley , Fezziwig is advised to bend with the times and sell out , but Fezziwig resists this call to progress :
Jorkin : `` Mr. Fezziwig , we 're good friends besides good men of business . We 're men of vision and progress . Why do n't you sell out while the going 's good ? You 'll never get a better offer . It 's the age of the machine , and the factory , and the vested interests . We small traders are ancient history , Mr . Fezziwig . ''
Fezziwig : `` It 's not just for money alone that one spends a lifetime building up a business… . It 's to preserve a way of life that one knew and loved . No , I ca n't see my way to selling out to the new vested interests , Mr. Jorkin . I 'll have to be loyal to the old ways and die out with them if needs must . ''
In the end , Jorkin hires away Scrooge and buys out Fezziwig 's business , moving it from private to shareholder ownership . As agent of shareholder interests , Jorkin and his managers Scrooge and Jacob Marley are constrained from diverging from the goals of profitability , making it more difficult to be a Fezziwig even if they were inclined to . Fezziwig 's successor Jorkin demonstrates the weakness of self-interest when he announces to the board of directors that the company is insolvent after years of embezzling . Scrooge and Marley demonstrate their cunning self-interest by using the crisis to attain controlling interest in the company . In Langley 's and director Brian Desmond Hurst 's Scrooge , these new managers replacing the Fezziwigs are predatory towards shareholders and employees alike , the product of a process and a mindset that Dickens felt was at odds with humanity itself .
Many film adaptions , such as The Muppet Christmas Carol , show Fezziwig 's Christmas party as the setting for where Scrooge first met Belle , the beautiful young woman whom he fell in love with and became engaged to . However , Belle eventually breaks off their engagement after Scrooge 's obsession with money eclipses his love for her . Fezziwig is mentioned as having three daughters ; although their names are not revealed , it is possible that Belle is one of his daughters .
In A Christmas Carol starring Kelsey Grammer , Fezziwig—following a downturn in his business—approaches Scrooge and Marley for a business loan . Scrooge , starting to turn into his greedy self , refuses the request , stating that he ( Scrooge ) and Marley would be throwing good money after bad .
Popular culture
Fezziwig appears in the 1983 animated featurette , Mickey 's Christmas Carol , where he is portrayed in a non-speaking role by Mr. Toad .
In the 1992 film The Muppet Christmas Carol , he is played by Fozzie Bear and called `` Fozziwig '' .
The Boston Brewing Company produces Old Fezziwig Ale , a winter seasonal beer named after the character .

The Tuskegee Railroad was a 5 and 1/2 mile long railroad that connected Tuskegee , Alabama to the Montgomery and West Point Railroad at the nearby village of Chehaw . First constructed in 1860 by the Tuskegee Rail Road Company , it was subsequently destroyed in the American Civil War and then sold to E. T. Varner & Company , which rebuilt it and reincorporated it as the Tuskegee Railroad Company in 1872 . Again incorporated in 1902 as the Tuskegee Railroad , one of the railroad 's primary purposes in the early 20th century was to connect the Tuskegee Institute to other railroad lines .
History
1860 Founding
On February 20 , 1860 , the State of Alabama granted a charter to incorporate the Tuskegee Railroad . The Railroad owners were David Clopton , William Foster , Cullen A . Battle , Robert F. Ligon , J.W . Echols , S. B. Baine , G.W . Campbell , A . B. Fanin , John C. H. Reid , W. G. Swanson and A. D. Edwards . In 1860 , 500 enslaved Africans worked building the railroad under lease agreements with plantation owners who collected pay for the slave 's labor .
Civil War - Rail Destroyed
U.S. General Sherman sent U.S. General Lovell Rousseau on a raid of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad where he destroyed rail to the Chehaw Station of the Tuskegee Railroad , cutting of connections to the Tuskegee Railroad from all points . The Tuskegee Railroad was melted down by Confederates for armaments for the American Civil War .
1872 Reconstruction
William G. Swanson and others bought the defunct railroad in 1869 and signed an agreement with E. T. Varner & Company , which rebuilt the railroad by 1872 . It was run by E. T. Varner & Company as the Tuskegee Railroad until 1902 when it was incorporated under the same name and owned by E. T. Varner , L. V. Alexander and Campbell & Wright . Rates were 10 cents per mile in 1882 .
1943 Tuskegee Airman
Benjamin O. Davis Jr. of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen remembered the 99 Squadron of bombers riding on the Tuskegee Railroad in 1943 . He mentions segregation in his autobiography , unfair treatment of black people and the 19 pullman drawing room where the railroad put black politicians so they would not see worse effects of segregation .
Sale of Railroad in 1963
When Interstate 85 was built through Alabama and Alabama State Route 81 was widened connecting the Tuskegee Institute to the Interstate in 1963 , the need for the railroad was gone and the railroad received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to no longer operate . Trains were salvaged and warehouses were built where the depot was demolished after some of the property was sold .
1978 Literature
Ralph Ellison wrote The Little Man at Chehaw Station : The American Artist and His Audience about a jazz musician playing a street performance in the Great Depression . The setting used was the Chehaw Station of the Tuskegee Railroad .

The train made three round trips , one at night . It took about 1 hour and thirty minutes to go one way .
Rolling stock
In 1876 the railway had one 10-ton-locomotive , 1 passenger car and 3 freight cars of all classes .
Between 1888 through 1916 the Tuskegee Railroad Company had two locomotives , one to two passenger cars and a baggage and mail car . The only surviving locomotive , 101 , a 2-6-2 , was donated to the Illinois Railway Museum where it would serve as the museum 's mainline locomotive until 1989 .

Wampum is a traditional shell bead of the Eastern Woodlands tribes of Native Americans . It includes white shell beads hand-fashioned from the North Atlantic channeled whelk shell and white and purple beads made from the quahog or Western North Atlantic hard-shelled clam .
In New York , wampum beads have been discovered dating before 1510 . Before European contact , strings of wampum were used for storytelling , ceremonial gifts , and recording important treaties and historical events , such as the Two Row Wampum Treaty and the Hiawatha Belt . Wampum was also used by the northeastern Indigenous tribes as a means of exchange , strung together in lengths for convenience . The first colonists understood it as a currency and adopted it as such in trading with them . Eventually , the colonists applied their technologies to more efficiently produce wampum , which caused inflation and ultimately its obsolescence as currency .
Linguistic origin
The term wampum is a shortening of wampumpeag , which is derived from the Massachusett or Narragansett word meaning `` white strings of shell beads '' . The Proto-Algonquian reconstructed form is thought to be ( wa·p-a·py-aki ) , `` white strings '' .
The term wampum ( or wampumpeag ) initially referred only to the white beads which are made of the inner spiral or columella of the channeled whelk shell Busycotypus canaliculatus or Busycotypus carica . Sewant or suckauhock beads are the black or purple shell beads made from the quahog or poquahock clamshell Mercenaria mercenaria . Sewant or zeewant was the term used for this currency by the New Netherland colonists . Common terms for the dark and white beads are wampi ( white and yellowish ) and saki ( dark ) . The Lenape name for Long Island is Sewanacky , reflecting its connection to the dark wampum .
Description and manufacture
Wampum beads are typically tubular in shape , often a quarter of an inch long and an eighth of an inch wide . One 17th-century Seneca wampum belt featured beads almost 2.5 inches ( 65 mm ) long . Women artisans traditionally made wampum beads by rounding small pieces of whelk shells , then piercing them with a hole before stringing them . Wooden pump drills with quartz drill bits and steatite weights were used to drill the shells . The unfinished beads would be strung together and rolled on a grinding stone with water and sand until they were smooth . The beads would be strung or woven on deer hide thongs , sinew , milkweed bast , or basswood fibers .
The process to make wampum was labor-intensive with stone tools . Only the coastal tribes had sufficient access to the basic shells to make wampum . These factors increased its scarcity and consequent value among the European traders . The introduction of European metal tools revolutionized the production of wampum , and by the mid-seventeenth century , production numbered in the tens of millions of beads . Dutch colonists discovered the importance of wampum as a means of exchange between tribes , and they began mass-producing it in workshops . John Campbell established such a factory in Pascack , New Jersey , which manufactured wampum into the early 20th century . Eventually the primary source of wampum was that manufactured by colonists , a market glutted by the Dutch .
Uses
Record-keeping and memory aids
As William James Sidis wrote in his 1935 history :
The weaving of wampum belts is a sort of writing by means of belts of colored beads , in which the various designs of beads denoted different ideas according to a definitely accepted system , which could be read by anyone acquainted with wampum language , irrespective of what the spoken language is . Records and treaties are kept in this manner , and individuals could write letters to one another in this way .
Wampum belts were used as a memory aid in oral tradition , and were sometimes used as badges of office or as ceremonial devices in Indigenous cultures , such as the Iroquois . For example , the 1820 New Monthly Magazine reports on a speech given by chief Tecumseh in which he vehemently gesticulated to a belt as he pointed out treaties made 20 years earlier and battles fought since then .
Social purposes
Wampum strings may be presented as a formal affirmation of cooperation or friendship between groups , or as an invitation to a meeting .
The Iroquois used wampum as a person 's credentials or a certificate of authority . It was also used for official purposes and religious ceremonies , and as a way to bind peace between tribes . Among the Iroquois , every chief and every clan mother has a certain string of wampum that serves as their certificate of office . When they pass on or are removed from their station , the string will then pass on to the new leader . Runners carrying messages during colonial times would present the wampum showing that they had the authority to carry the message .
As a method of recording and an aid in narrating , Iroquois warriors with exceptional skills were provided training in interpreting the wampum belts . As the Keepers of the Central Fire , the Onondaga Nation was also trusted with the task of keeping all wampum records . Wampum is still used in the ceremony of raising up a new chief and in the Iroquois Thanksgiving ceremonies .
Wampum was central to the giving of names , in which the names and titles of deceased persons were passed on to others . Deceased individuals of high office are quickly replaced , and a wampum inscribed with the name of the deceased is laid on the shoulders of the successor , who may shake it off and reject the transfer of name . The reception of a name may also transfer personal history and previous obligations of the deceased ( e.g. , the successor of a person killed in war may be obligated to avenge the death of the name 's previous holder , or care for the deceased person 's family as their own ) .
... the Iroquoians ( Five Nations and Huron alike ) shared a very particular constitution : they saw their societies not as a collection of living individuals but as a collection of eternal names , which over the course of times passed from one individual holder to another .
Just as the wampum enabled the continuation of names and the histories of persons , the wampum was central to establishing and renewing peace between clans and families . When a man representing his respective social unit met another , he would offer one wampum inscribed with mnemonic symbols representing the purpose of the meeting or message . The wampum , thus , facilitated the most essential practices in holding the Iroquois society together .
Currency
When Europeans came to the Americas , they adopted wampum as money to trade with the native peoples of New England and New York . Wampum was legal tender in New England from 1637 to 1661 . It continued as currency in New York until 1673 at the rate of eight white or four black wampum equalling one stuiver , meaning that the white had the same value as the copper duit coin . The colonial government in New Jersey issued a proclamation setting the rate at six white or three black to one penny ; this proclamation also applied in Delaware . The black shells were rarer than the white shells and so were worth more , which led people to dye the white and dilute the value of black shells .
In the writings of Robert Beverley Jr. of Virginia Colony about tribes in Virginia in 1705 , he described peak as referring to the white shell bead , valued at 9 pence a yard , and wampom peak as denoting the more expensive dark purple shell bead , at the rate of 1 shilling and 6 pence ( 18 pence ) per yard . He added that these polished shells with drilled holes were made from the cunk ( conch ) , while another currency of lesser value called was fashioned from the cockleshell .
Wampum briefly became legal tender in North Carolina in 1710 , but its use as common currency died out in New York by the early 18th century .
Recent developments
The National Museum of the American Indian repatriated eleven wampum belts to Haudenosaunee chiefs at the Onondaga Longhouse Six Nations Reserve in New York . These belts dated to the late 18th century and are sacred to the Longhouse religion . They had been away from their tribes for over a century .
The Seneca Nation commissioned replicas of five historic wampum belts completed in 2008 . The belts were made by Lydia Chavez ( Unkechaug/Blood ) and made with beads manufactured on the Unkechaug Indian Nation Territory on Long Island , New York .
In 2017 , a wampum belt purchased by Frank Speck in 1913 was returned to Kanesatake , where it is used in cultural and political events .
The Shinnecock Indian Nation has sought to preserve a traditional wampum manufacturing site called Ayeuonganit Wampum Ayimꝏup ( Here , Wampum Was Made ) . A portion of the original site , Lot 24 in today 's Parrish Pond subdivision in Southampton , Long Island , has been reserved for parkland .
The Unkechaug Nation on Long Island , New York , has built a wampum factory which manufactures traditional as well as contemporary beads for use by Native artists such as Ken Maracle , Elizabeth Perry , and Lydia Chavez in their designs of traditional belts and contemporary jewelry . The factory has been in existence since 1998 and has been instrumental in the resurrection of the use of wampum in contemporary native life .
Traditional wampum makers in modern times include Julius Cook ( Sakaronkiokeweh ) ( 1927–1999 ) and Ken Maracle ( Haohyoh ) , a faith keeper of the Lower Cayuga Longhouse .
Artists continue to weave belts of a historical nature , as well as designing new belts or jewelry based on their own concepts .

KFPH-CD ( channel 35 ) is a low-power , Class A television station in Phoenix , Arizona , United States , airing programming from the Spanish-language UniMás network . It is a translator of Flagstaff-licensed KFPH-DT ( channel 13 ) which is owned and operated by TelevisaUnivision ; it is also sister to Univision outlet KTVW-DT ( channel 33 ) . KFPH-CD 's transmitter is located on South Mountain ; its parent station shares studios with KTVW-DT on 30th Street in southern Phoenix .
Originally established as a translator for the American Christian Television System ( ACTS ) on channel 39 , the station moved to channel 35 when a full-power television station was established on channel 39 in 2000 . It has been owned by Univision since 2002 and has served primarily as a translator of KFPH-DT . KFPH-CD was converted in April 2018 to be one of the first regular ATSC 3.0 television stations in the United States as part of the Phoenix Model Market initiative and since has been regularly used for testing ; its programming is available in ATSC 1.0 format on subchannels of other Phoenix television stations .
History
North Phoenix Baptist Church received a construction permit for low-power television station K39BI in December 1986 ; the station was on the air less than six months later and began broadcasting programs on June 7 , 1987 . Alongside programming from ACTS—owned by the Southern Baptist Convention—K39BI produced some of its own programming , including the Baptist church 's services . In the 1990s , ACTS was replaced with FamilyNet .
Underneath K39BI was a full-power allocation for channel 39 , the second non-commercial reserved channel in Phoenix . In 1996 , the Daystar Television Network , by way of Community Television , Inc. , filed for the channel . Two years later , Daystar bought K39BI from the church ; Daystar programming replaced FamilyNet , though North Phoenix Baptist Church services were still broadcast . The call letters were changed to KDTP-LP on December 16 , 1998 .
The impending launch of KDTP as a full-power station displaced the low-power station to channel 35 . Daystar also sold the low-power station to Equity Broadcasting Corporation , which owned KDUO channel 13 in Flagstaff , and changed KDTP-LP 's call letters to KOND-LP . The stations aired programming from America 's Collectibles Network before being sold for $ 19.1 million to Univision in late 2001 alongside KBGF in Douglas . KDUO and KOND-LP became KFPH and KFPH-CA on January 4 , 2002 , in advance of the launch of Telefutura ten days later .
ATSC 3.0
In December 2017 , the Phoenix Model Market partnership , comprising Pearl TV and the television station groups that owned most of Phoenix 's commercial stations at the time , including Univision Communications , was formed in order to provide guidance and testing for how the ATSC 3.0 standard could be deployed without reducing ATSC 1.0 service to existing viewers , using the `` lighthouse '' concept , in which one station becomes an ATSC 3.0 multiplex and its subchannels are distributed on the signals of other stations serving the same area . In service of this goal , KFPH-CD was selected to become the first lighthouse station and the first authorized ATSC 3.0 station , going live on April 6 , 2018 ; KFPH-CD 's subchannels were placed with three other Phoenix stations for ATSC 1.0 continuity . Soon after launching , Arizona PBS joined the Model Market consortium , becoming the first public broadcaster to use ATSC 3.0 .
Subchannels
The KFPH-CD ATSC 3.0 multiplex carries an assortment of Phoenix television stations . On July 8 , 2021 , the two remaining major network affiliates on KFPH-CD were relocated to the higher-power KASW multiplex on RF channel 27 , and the channel capacity on KFPH-CD was used to add KTVK and KTAZ to the lineup .
KFPH-CD offers three ATSC 1.0 subchannels , stacked across the multiplexes of three Phoenix TV stations .

There she comes face to face with her kidnapper Lars Dahl , a former music student on the mainland and conspirator , but her weeks of exposure have so altered Killashandra 's appearance that Lars does not recognize her ; she gains his confidence and learns he is part of a rebel conspiracy , and why . Killashandra confirms that Optherian leadership effectively prevent unhappy citizens from leaving the planet , in violation of Federation law , and that they use the Crystal organs to transmit highly illegal subliminal hallucinations , brainwashing the population at the seasonal Music Festivals in order to keep them compliant . The conspirators , who are less influenced by subliminals , made a plan to destroy the organ , then kidnap the Crystal Singer sent to repair it to create an interplanetary incident that would demand a full Federation investigation .
By this time Killashandra and Lars have fallen in love , presenting an emotional crisis for Killashandra as she can not survive on Optheria and Lars can not follow her to Ballybran . Killashandra reveals herself and volunteers to further the conspirators ' plans by having Lars return her to the mainland and present himself as her rescuer . She will locate and sabotage the organ 's hidden subliminal projector under the guise of repairing the organ , then report the human rights violations to the Federation . The plan succeeds and the subliminals are disabled , but Lars is now under suspicion of the government . To protect him from reprisal , Killashandra and a fellow Singer smuggle him off the planet under the guise of arresting him for Killashandra 's kidnapping .
At an automated trial , Killashandra speaks in Lars ' defense , but when stress monitors misread her concern for him as fear , the computerized judge believes he has threatened her and finds him guilty . Killashandra returns to Ballybran despondent , certain she will never see Lars again . Meanwhile , the Federation has collected enough evidence to justify taking over Optheria and arresting its leadership , and Lars receives a retrial when it is learned that he and Killashandra were married by island custom . He applies to the Heptite Guild to become a Singer . His transition succeeds and the lovers reunite .
Reception
Dave Langford reviewed Killashandra for White Dwarf # 77 , and stated that `` the plot is candyfloss nonsense throughout , but it has a certain charm . Turn off that brain . Relax and enjoy . ''

Avalon Airport is an international airport located in Avalon in the City of Greater Geelong in Victoria , Australia . While located outside the Melbourne metropolitan area , it is the second busiest of the four airports serving the state capital in passenger traffic . It is located north-east of the Geelong CBD and south-west of the Melbourne CBD . The airport is operated by Avalon Airport Australia Pty Ltd , a subsidiary of Linfox .
Avalon is currently served by passenger airline Jetstar , which began domestic flights in 2004 . The airport is also the site of the biennial Australian International Airshow .
Unlike Melbourne Airport , Avalon Airport is not governed by the Commonwealth 's Airports Act 1996 . The airport has a single runway in addition to a helipad .
History
The airport is located on land of the original indigenous owners , the Wathaurong people , and a scatter stone area is preserved on the Avalon Airport site , out of respect for the original owners . The land has undergone many changes over the past century .
In the beginning , the airport was a sheep and cattle farm and homestead , founded by James Austin , an immigrant from Glastonbury , Somerset , England . James established his farm and named the homestead `` Avalon '' after the isle of Avalon at Glastonbury , the mythical island in the Arthurian legend . In 1952 the Commonwealth Government bought at Avalon for just 110 pounds , as the land was deemed to be of poor quality farmland due to the abundance of volcanic rock littering the surface .
The airport was opened in 1953 , to cater for the production of military aircraft . Previously , the Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermans Bend , Melbourne had used a runway beside the factory . However , newer jet aircraft required a longer runway for safe operations , and the Fisherman 's Bend runway was being encroached upon by development .
A runway was built by Country Roads Board , with the first plane landing on 3 April 1953 – a four-engined Avro Lincoln heavy bomber flown from Fishermans Bend . The English Electric Canberra light bomber was under construction at same time at the new airport . In 1959 , Qantas established a training base at the site .
In 1961 , Government Aircraft Factories combined with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation , and built and serviced 110 Mirage fighters at the site , and in 1970 Jindivik Target Aircraft transferred to Avalon Airport from Fishermens Bend , adding production of 170 Nomad and 75 Hornet military jets , in addition to servicing of other jets .
In 1985 the Government Aircraft Factories changed its name to Aerospace Technologies of Australia ( ASTA ) . Aircraft produced during this time included the GAF Jindivik remotely piloted aircraft , and Nomad civil aircraft . Under the ASTA banner , engines for the Dassault Mirage III jet fighters were produced , as well as assembly of the F/A-18 multirole combat aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) .
In October 1988 , the ASTA Aircraft Services division took the first Boeing 747 to Avalon for servicing and maintenance . By December 1993 , fifty 747 aircraft had been through the Avalon facility , and 820 people were employed at the site . October 1995 saw a Cathay Pacific Lockheed L-1011 flown to Avalon for scrapping by ASTA Aircraft Services , in what was a one-off event .
Training of pilots from Japan 's All Nippon Airways commenced at the airport on 8 September 1993 .
On 27 June 1995 Aerospace Technologies of Australia was privatised by the Commonwealth Government , selling the aircraft divisions to Rockwell Australia Limited , and the airport operations to Avalon Airport Geelong Pty Ltd . The ASTA airliner overhauling facility was closed in 1997 .
The first scheduled passenger flights out of the airport were operated by Hazelton Airlines , who commenced flights between Avalon Airport and Sydney in February 1995 . 36-seat Saab 340 aircraft were used for the service . The service was discontinued after a short time due to a lack of passengers .
Post-privatisation
In 1997 , the federal Government of Australia , through the Department of Defence , granted Linfox a 50-year plus a 49-year option lease of the airport . Between 1997 and 2001 Linfox developed proposals to develop the land which formed the basis of the Avalon Airport Master Plan draft , 2013 . In 1992 , the airport began hosting the Australian International Airshow .
On 1 June 2004 , Jetstar started commercial flights from the airport , in addition to their operations at Melbourne Airport .
In April 2010 , Tigerair Australia announced it would base two aircraft and commence operations from Avalon later that year . By June 2011 however , Tigerair Australia announced it would be withdrawing several flights from Avalon , to be operated instead from Melbourne Airport . The remaining Tigerair Australia services were withdrawn after a series of incidents that led to airline 's operations being suspended by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the following month .
In October 2012 , the Federal Government announced that the airport 's lease would be amended , allowing for the construction of a new terminal and the implementation of international flights . Avalon is the second airport in Victoria to be designated as a port of entry for freight operations .
International flights
It was announced on 4 February 2018 that AirAsia X would move their Melbourne Airport operations to Avalon Airport by the end of the year . AirAsia X Airbus A330s would service the twice daily direct flights to Kuala Lumpur . Announcing it on 10 July 2018 the airline commenced its operations from Avalon Airport on 5 December 2018 .
A media release on 22 October 2019 from the Victorian Premier 's Office stated that VietJet Air was expected to begin flights from Avalon to Vietnam in the second half of 2020 .
On 11 December 2019 , it was announced on Citilink 's Instagram social media account that flights to Denpasar ( Bali ) , Indonesia would be added to Avalon Airport 's list of international flights . On 10 January 2020 , it was stated that the daily flight would commence on 24 January 2020 .
On 18 July 2022 , Air Asia announced they would be restarting flights to Australia and New Zealand but will be ending their Avalon operations and begin operating out of Melbourne Airport for the first time since 2018 .
Future
Airport Master Plan 2015
The Avalon Airport Master Plan was prepared by Avalon Airport Pty Ltd in September 2015 and was endorsed by the Department of Defence . The document provides for a significant expansion of the airport 's operations , as well as the establishment of non-aviation related developments .
Proposed rail connection
On 3 May 2011 , the Victorian Minister for Public Transport committed $ 3 million for the planning of a rail link to Avalon Airport . In January 2013 , three route options were presented . The railway line would start by running along the existing Geelong-Melbourne heavy rail corridor , and then divert towards Avalon Airport , south of Little River , at one of three locations . The eastern option would see the line break away closer to Melbourne , near Cherry Swamp Road and Little River . The central option would place the diversion 2.5 kilometres southwest , near Peak School Road at Lara . The western route option would divert from the existing line closer to Geelong , at Plains Road , Lara . Each of the three routes would run over the Princes Freeway , north east of the Beach Road interchange at Little River , running under the flight path to a new station inside the terminal . The government would need to acquire private farmland to complete the link and is considering a number of different options , including a light rail service , automated driverless trains used at several international airports .
On 4 August 2013 , the state government indicated that it may alter its election promise to build the $ 250 million train line to Avalon Airport , and instead create a cheaper light rail link from Melbourne 's south-west . Department documents show the government is now considering other options to meet interim demand , such as light rail , buses , or `` driverless transport options which are used at many airports around the world '' .
Facilities
Since the introduction of Jetstar in 2004 , the Avalon Airport terminal facilities have expanded from the original size of to nearly . Over $ 100 million has been invested in the airport thus far to complete the following :
An apron expansion to accommodate a further four aircraft as well as enable the opportunity to accommodate an aircraft the size of a Boeing 747 .
A total of seven A320 sized aircraft can now be parked simultaneously in front of the airport terminal .
Installation of a flight information display system
Fuel farm expansion to triple storage capacity from 500,000 to 1,500,000 litres of A1 jet fuel plus installation of new fuel pipelines
Construction of a new bus , taxi and hire car road and various rerouted roads to manage incoming passenger traffic and other road infrastructure upgrades
Fuel farm electrical maintenance and demolition of unused buildings
Significant infrastructure upgrades as part of the Australian International Airshow
Passenger terminal
The current terminal facility is approximately in area and houses four gates capable of servicing aircraft up to and including the size of the Airbus A321 . In its present configuration , the terminal can accommodate around six domestic departures per hour . The airport has a total of eight aircraft parking bays ; there are six on the Northern Apron and two on the Eastern Apron . On the Northern Apron , the airport can accommodate five Code C Aircraft ( Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 aircraft ) and one Boeing 747 .
Avalon Airport can accommodate two Boeing 747s or two Boeing 787s on the Eastern Apron . The Eastern Apron is also a remote parking bay which doubles as a freight bay . The airport is capable of fitting one Airbus A380 at a time on the Eastern Apron ; this means it can also accommodate the freighter version of the Boeing 747-8 , which is slightly smaller .
Currently the airport terminal is not equipped with aerobridges , and does not feature any guest lounges .
Freight facilities
The most notable freight operations include the Australian Grand Prix , Supercars and Superbikes , plus some specialist charters including livestock race horses , fresh produce , military hardware , touring rock bands . The airport can facilitate loads on all aircraft types from the Airbus 380 series down , with equipment available to load via the main deck , lower deck , nose or tail end of the Aircraft , with a maximum lift of 16 tonnes . It has three dedicated freighter parking positions : Two on its Eastern and one on the Northern Freighter Aprons .
Aircraft heavy maintenance
Avalon Airport has six hangars in total : of hangar space , including three Boeing 747 hangars . Three of these are customised B747 hangars that were used by Qantas . The Qantas Engineering maintenance facility commenced operations on 13 May 1998 .
It was also responsible for the Qantas Group 's aircraft commercial project work , including cabin reconfigurations and refurbishment .
The Avalon Maintenance Facility was the first in Australia to develop and carry out a program for converting B737-300 passenger aircraft to freighters for Australian Air Express operations and was responsible for the modification of the new Premium Economy product for Qantas ' B747-400 fleet .
In 2012 , Qantas announced that it would phase out operations at Avalon Airport , making the hangars available for other businesses .
Airlines and destinations
Other uses
The video clip of Human Nature 's 2000 song He Does n't Love You was filmed at the airport .
In July 2013 , it was proposed by Geelong City Council that a theme park be built at Avalon , and they have held discussions with Village Roadshow and other companies concerning the proposal . African Safari World was a previous proposal at nearby Werribee Zoo that did not get approved .
The biennial Australian International Airshow operates from Avalon Airport . The project is owned by Aviation Development Australia Limited . The event attracts a total attendance of over 195,000 across the six days , including exhibitors from the international aerospace industry and government , military , scientific and trade delegates .
Ground transportation
Car
Avalon Airport is linked to Geelong and Melbourne by the adjacent Princes Freeway . The airport has 1,500 airport car spaces , a taxi rank and a ride-share pick-up/drop-off bay .
Coach
In 2017 , Skybus launched services from the Melbourne CBD and Geelong to Avalon Airport .
Accidents and incidents
On 6 August 1976 , a prototype N24 Nomad crashed shortly after takeoff at Avalon while a flight test of modifications to the tail of the aircraft . Two of the three crew members were killed in the accident , notably including pilot Stuart Pearce , father of actor Guy Pearce .
A serious incident involving a Tiger Airways Australia Airbus A320 flight from Sydney occurred on 30 June 2011 when the crew performed a missed approach at Avalon outside of published procedures , resulting in the aircraft overflying the Geelong suburb of Leopold at a dangerously low altitude , without guidance from Air Traffic Control . The incident made national headlines and triggered a five-week grounding of the airline over a busy school holiday period while a safety audit was conducted by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority .

Vega , also known as Claw ( for international tournaments ) , is a fictional character from the Street Fighter fighting game series by Capcom . Vega is a mask-wearing , claw-wielding fighter from Spain who uses a personal fighting style combining Japanese ninjutsu and Spanish bullfighting , earning him the nickname of `` Spanish Ninja '' .
Vega first appears in the original Street Fighter II in 1991 as the second of four boss opponents the player faces at the end of the single-player mode , a group known as the Four Devas , Grand Masters , or the Four Heavenly Kings . From Street Fighter II : Champion Edition ( the second version of the game ) onwards , Vega and the other three boss characters became playable . He reappears as a playable character in Street Fighter Alpha 3 , Street Fighter EX2 and EX3 , the Capcom vs. SNK series , SNK vs. Capcom : SVC Chaos , Street Fighter IV , Super Street Fighter IV , Street Fighter X Tekken , Ultra Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V .
Conception and creation
Vega was designed by Akira Yasuda with the premise of the original Street Fighter 's Geki character in mind , and was initially conceived as a brief sketch of a masked man in a ripped shirt with long , frizzy hair . As development progressed the design evolved into a large , unarmed man , retaining the mask and dressed as a matador . The design was changed again , revolving around the concept of a foreign soldier with a cross on his vest and armed with a broadsword , while still retaining the mask . This design was eventually replaced in turn with another concept , a masked ninja in a bodysuit armed with a long metal claw on his right hand . Ultimately the character 's finalized appearance was a culmination of all of these , incorporating various aspects of each into the finished design .
When the original Street Fighter II was being localized for the English language market , Capcom 's North American marketing staff felt that the name of the game 's final boss , Vega , did not sound threatening enough to North American audiences , and was hence better suited for the bullfighter , as Vega is by itself a Spanish surname . Plus , afraid of a lawsuit from American boxer Mike Tyson ( whose name and appearance was very similar to the game 's first boss ) , they felt inclined to change the name of this character as well . For international tournaments he is named Claw . As a result , Claw 's name was changed from Balrog to Vega for English-language appearances , while original Vega ( Dictator ) became M.Bison and original M.Bison ( the boxer ) became Balrog .
Design
Vega is one of the few Street Fighter characters to constantly carry a weapon , a tekkō kagi , and the only character to do so in Street Fighter II . This claw is useful for slashing attacks , yet curved in the end to prevent him from lethally stabbing his opponents . This claw gives him a very long range compared to most characters . It is the same type of weapon worn by Geki in the original Street Fighter , though longer .
Obsessively narcissistic and vain , Vega considers himself the epitome of beauty and perfection . As such , he wears his expressionless mask not to conceal his identity , but to protect his face from scarring or bruising during battle ; in fact , Vega removes it after winning fights , as well as in certain character-select images .
Vega wears murrey and yellow ceremonial trousers , a red sash , loafers , and white leggings of a matador , suggesting his involvement with bullfighting . This decorative garb also offers matadors ease of movement , and is ideal for Vega 's acrobatic maneuvers .
Depending on the games ' color palettes , Vega has brown or blonde hair . In the various games in the Street Fighter II series , Vega 's game sprite and character select profile shot depict him with brown hair , while his ending in Street Fighter II ' : Champion Edition and Super Street Fighter II depict him with blonde hair . In Street Fighter EX2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3 , Vega is depicted with blonde hair in all iterations . His tattoos consist of a purple snake on his chest and two purple bands which circle his arm . In Capcom vs. SNK 2 , in a victory pose , Vega will hold his arm out towards the opponent , with the tattoo coming to life and hissing at it . In the mobile puzzle game Street Fighter : Puzzle Spirits , he appears as a super-deformed character .
Appearances
In video games
Vega 's backstory reveals that he was born to a noble family in Spain . As he matured , Vega studied bullfighting , a Spanish cultural tradition . He later traveled to Japan to learn ninjutsu , a style that he believed would mesh well with his natural grace and agility . Returning home , Vega combined bullfighting with ninjutsu and entered an underground cage fighting circuit , where he quickly became one of the best .
For undisclosed reasons , his family 's status dwindled , causing his mother to remarry for financial security . Vega 's new stepfather , incensed that his wife only valued him for his money , murdered her right in front of Vega , who killed him in return . The incident warped his mind and caused him to develop a dual personality : suave nobleman by day , sadistic masked murderer by night . Brandishing a three-pronged , razor sharp claw gauntlet , Vega embarked on many murderous rampages , taking great pleasure in mutilating his victims , especially those he perceived as `` ugly '' . The murder of his mother caused him to view `` beauty '' as a trait of heroism and strength , whereas `` ugliness '' represented cowardice and evil . Eventually , Vega 's insatiable bloodlust and brutal fighting skills caught the attention of criminal leader M. Bison , who accepted the young nobleman into Shadaloo as his personal assassin and one of his three Grand Master bodyguards . Vega accepted Bison 's offer purely to improve his own aesthetic senses . His official tag partner in the crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken is Balrog , although they are shown to loathe each other due to their clashing personalities .
Gameplay
Vega is one of the fastest characters in the Street Fighter series , and also one of the most fragile . His strength is in long-range attacks , with the reach advantage provided by his claw , his speed and jumps . During fights , Vega is capable of losing his claw . This reduces his attack range significantly , and prevents him from performing certain moves . Since Super Street Fighter II Turbo , Vega can pick up the claw again if lost . Other games allow Vega to lose his mask , lowering his health but increasing his attack power as a result . In Street Fighter EX2 , Street Fighter EX3 , and Street Fighter IV Vega can take his claw and mask off manually . Vega becomes able to switch freely between clawed and bare-handed in his most recent rendition , Street Fighter V .
In other media
In the 1994 live-action film version of Street Fighter , Vega was played by American actor Jay Tavare in his film debut . He is depicted as a member of the Shadaloo Tong working for Sagat . Along with his trademark mask and claw , he has very few lines during the whole film and utters them while his face is obscured or when he is off-camera . He forms a rivalry with Ryu , and in the film 's final battle , he is defeated by Ryu and abandoned by Sagat to presumably die when Bison 's base explodes . He also appears in the arcade game based on the film titled Street Fighter : The Movie , as well as in the home video game also based on the film . In the arcade version of the game , Vega has the ability to take his mask off and throw it to his opponent . In the home version , this ability was removed and Vega fights unmasked .
In the 2009 live-action film Street Fighter : The Legend of Chun-Li , Vega is played by rapper Taboo of the group The Black Eyed Peas as an assassin for Bison 's Shadaloo corporation . This version of Vega retains his claw and mask , but the mask is made of metal and he appears dressed in black from head to toe . The film changed the reason Vega wears the mask , from protecting his face to concealing his identity .
In the 1994 anime film Street Fighter II : The Animated Movie , Vega was voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa in Japanese and Richard Cansino in the English dub . In the film , he works for Shadowlaw under Bison , and is sent to New York to kill Chun-Li . He almost succeeds through a vicious and bloody duel that takes its toll on both fighters , but after baiting Vega into a rage by attacking his face , Chun-Li eventually defeats him by Hundred-Burst-Kicking him through her apartment wall into the streets far below where he presumably dies .
In the 1995 anime Street Fighter II V , Vega appears as a young amorous bullfighter who tries to seduce Chun-Li . Envious over Ryu and Ken 's friendship with Chun-Li , Vega invites the three to a party in his castle , which is actually a trap to lure Ryu and Ken to a caged death match with him . Since Ryu does not attend the party , he subsequently fights only Ken , and is finally defeated after a brutal match . He is given the surname of Fabio La Cerda in the series . Kaneto Shiozawa provided his voice for the Japanese version , while Vic Mignogna provided his voice for the English dub from ADV Films and Richard Cansino provided his voice for the Animaze English dub . In the Spanish dub , his full name is listed as Fabio Antonio de la Vega .
Vega appears in two episodes of the 1995 American Street Fighter animated series , `` Eye of the Beholder '' and `` Face of Fury , '' where he is a former henchman of Bison promised eternal youth who develops a rivalry against Blanka . He was voiced by Mark Hildreth in the series .
Vega makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in 1999 anime miniseries Street Fighter Alpha : The Animation , where he ends up pulverizing , though not outright killing , his opponent Dan Hibiki during an underground fight . Vega reappears in the Shadaloo helicopter near the end of Street Fighter IV : The Ties That Bind .
Reception
In 1992 , he was ranked 16th on Japanese magazine Gamest 's list of the best video game characters introduced in 1991 . Vega was voted fifth in Capcom 's own poll of 85 characters for the 15th anniversary of Street Fighter , making him the most popular male character . IGN ranked Vega at number ten in their `` Top 25 Street Fighter Characters '' article , stating `` he deserves all the credit in the world for originality . There 's never been a Street Fighter character quite like him since . '' GameDaily ranked him at number twelve on their `` Top 20 Street Fighter Characters of All Time '' article , noting the strength of his aerial attacks , and also put Vega on their `` Tattooed Video Game Characters '' list . Vega is placed at 28th in a worldwide Street Fighter character poll held between 2017 and 2018 .
He ranked 46th in GamePros `` 47 Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time '' article . News.com.au named Vega one of the sexiest characters in video games , placing him tenth in their `` Top 10 '' article and stating `` part ninja , part bullfighter , Vega 's fighting style is definitely one of the most unusual we 've seen . '' NowGamer listed a fight between Vega and Yoshimitsu under their `` Street Fighter X Tekken Character Wishlist '' and commented `` Any bout between these two would be a mind-boggling display of fast attacks across the screen. '' . GamesRadar noted that while his attire and obsession with beauty was a departure from traditional depictions of ninjas , the features made him `` one of the more iconic scrappers in the Street Fighter games '' . They additionally listed him as one of the most outrageous camp villains , stating that a `` camp bad guy list '' without Vega was like a `` cheese sandwich without the cheese or bread , '' while describing him as `` more narcissistic than two clones of Narcissus having sex in a room full of mirrors . '' In 2013 , GamesRadar included him in a list of `` The 30 Best Capcom Characters of the Last 30 Years . ''

Jean Painlevé ( 20 November 1902 – 2 July 1989 ) was a photographer and filmmaker who specialized in underwater fauna . He was the son of mathematician and twice prime minister of France Paul Painlevé .
Upbringing
A few days after Painlevé was born , his mother , Marguerite Petit de Villeneuve , died from complications arising from an infection contracted during childbirth . Painlevé , an only son , was raised by his father 's sister Marie , a widow .
In the Lycée Louis Le Grand , he was a poor and inattentive student who preferred to skip classes and go to the Jardin d'Acclimatation where he was assisting the guard in taking care of the animals . Painlevé later wrote : `` In high school , my classmates hated me . They hated people in the margins , such as Vigo , son of the anarchist Almereyda , or Pierre Merle , son of , director of [ satirical weekly ] Merle Blanc ( `` White Blackbird '' ) . Me , I was the son of a Boche ( `` Kraut ) '' , that Painlevé who had fought for Sarrail , solitary and unique republican general , and who had relieved [ general ] Nivelle of his duties to replace him with Pétain '' . He finished high school well apart `` from these poor , unhappy ones who were like tradesmen in their trade '' . Among the few friends he made in his adolescence were future film critic Georges Altman , and writer and precious stones specialist Armand Moss ( Moschowitz ) , who later appeared as an extra in Mathusalem .
Studies
Painlevé had to abandon his studies aimed at entering the École Polytechnique because he understood practically nothing of Mathematics . ( He would subsequently state he wished that mathematics was approached `` like a language and not like a mystery '' ) . Instead , he turned to medicine . However , two years into his studies , he abandoned the class of Professor Delbet , on account of the professor 's treatment of a hydroencephalic patient which Painlevé found cruel , never to come back . He next turned to biology and entered the Laboratoire d'Anatomie et d'Histologie Comparée at the Sorbonne .
Personal life
In the course of his studies in biology , Painlevé started frequenting the Station biologique de Roscoff . There , he met Viviane , Geneviève ( `` Ginette '' ) , and Maryvonne Hamon , the three daughters of Augustin and Henriette Hamon , translators of the works of George Bernard Shaw in France and anarchist militants . Ginette would become Painlevé 's work partner and life companion .
The Hamons ' residence in Port Blanc , Penvenan , named `` Ty an Diaoul '' , ( which some locals had dubbed `` Maison du Diable '' , `` House of the Devil '' ) eventually became a second home for Painlevé .
Political influences and militancy
Painlevé , along with Georges Altman and others , in 1918 , created in his school an affiliate union to the `` Socialist Revolutionary Students '' , an anarchist organisation established in the previous century . Painlevé himself was in the streets , distributing pamphlets calling on passers-by to join up . After two years , in 1920 , he left the group to join the union of `` Communist Students '' .
His acquaintance with the Hamons familiarised Painlevé with the active practice of anarchism and teaching it by example . Augustin Hamon and his wife wanted their children to be raised in the altruist culture and under anarchist principles , so they had no objections to their young daughter living with Jean Painlevé as an unmarried couple ( `` living in sin '' ) , something socially unacceptable in Catholic France , and , even more so , in deeply Catholic Penvenan , where the Hamons resided .
The Hamon family and their lifestyle influenced Jean Painlevé not only in his politics but in his outlook on life in general . Painlevé joined the Hamon daughters , all of whom would go on to become scientists , in their quest to acquire knowledge on everything . At the same time , Augustin Hamon encouraged not just young , inquisitive scientists , but also young artists with radical and controversial ideas , to come visit in his home , in Brittany . Painlevé would make numerous acquaintances among the visitors , such as Calder , Pierre Prévert , Jacques-Alain Boiffard , and Eli Lotar .
Contact with Surrealism
Prévert and Boiffard were part of the Surrealist wave and brought Jean Painlevé in contact with the artists active in the movement . Painlevé started collaborating with the monthly revue Surrealisme , directed by Yvan Goll . In 1924 , the revue published an article by Painlevé titled `` '' . In the article , which could be considered a declaration of principles , Painlevé preached the `` recording of reality '' , which , added to the imagination of the screenwriter and cinema 's techniques of slow motion , accelerated speed and the blur , can create `` a surrealist esthetic '' . Most of Painlevé 's subsequent designs on cinema are gathered in this article , where he affirmed `` the superiority of reality '' , the `` extraordinary inventiveness of Nature '' , over `` the artifice '' of traditional cinematographical scenes .
Painlevé , like Guillaume Apollinaire in 1909 , claimed that `` the cinema is a creator of a surreal life '' .
One year later , in 1925 , after a communication with l'Académie des Sciences , he submitted a pseudo-scientific , nonsensical and entirely Surrealist text , which he titled `` Neo-zoological Drama '' .
Painlevé can not be considered part of the Surrealist movement and did not actually consider himself a surrealist . He did , however , share the surrealists ' interest in psycho-sexual stimulation and the ultimate weirdness of procreation .
Cinema
Painlevé first came to the cinema as an actor , alongside Michel Simon , and also as assistant director in the René Sti unfinished film L'inconnue des six jours ( The Unknown Woman of Six Days ) , 1926 . Soon , he was shooting his own films , starting with L'œuf d'épinoche : de la fécondation à l'éclosion , 1927 .
Painlevé sometimes scored the music and background sounds for his films , such as in Les Oursins , where the collage of noise is a homage to Edgar Varèse .
In order to shoot scenes underwater , Painlevé encased his camera in a custom designed waterproof box , fitted with a glass plate which allowed the camera 's lens to reach through . Understandably , he spent a lot of time submerged in water . In his 1935 essay , titled `` Feet In The Water '' , Painlevé discussed wading , its instinctive , sensual pleasure and thwarted desire : `` Wading around in water up to your ankles or navel , day and night , in all kinds of weather , even in areas where one is sure to find nothing , digging about everywhere for algae or octopus , getting hypnotised by a sinister pond where everything seems to promise marvels although nothing lives there . This is the ecstasy of any addict . ''
Overall Jean Painlevé directed more than two hundred science and nature films .
He also marketed a collection of brass and bakelite jewelry in the form of seahorses .
Science is Fiction : 23 Films by Jean Painlevé , a DVD collection of his films , was released in 2009 by the Criterion Collection .
Legacy
Advocating the credo `` science is fiction , '' Painlevé managed to scandalize both the scientific and the cinematographic world with a cinema designed to entertain as well as edify . He portrayed seahorses , vampire bats , skeleton shrimps , and fanworms as endowed with human traits – the erotic , the comical , and the savage . Painlevé single-handedly established a unique kind of cinema , the `` scientific-poetic cinema '' .

Raymond Wintz ( Joseph Raimond Wintz ) ( 1884–1956 ) was a Paris-born painter and engraver whose most famous paintings were of marine and coastal views in Brittany . He is best known for his painting The Blue Door , which is still widely available as a poster and print .
Life
Raymond Wintz was born on 25 March 1884 . He was the son of the painter Guillaume Wintz ( 1823-1899 ) and the husband of the painter Renée Carpentier-Wintz ( 1913-2003 ) .
Raymond Wintz was trained at the School of Decorative Arts and the National College of Fine Arts in Paris . He was a pupil of Jules Adler at the Ecole Francais and started exhibiting at the Salon des Artistes Francais in 1910 .
Among the awards and distinctions he held were :
1911 – Membership of the Salon
1922 – Silver Medal , Salon
1924 – Officer of the Academy ; Gold Medal and Corot Prize , Salon
President of the Salon
President of the Society of French Landscape Artists
Knight of the Order of the Legion of Honour
President of the Jury of the Salon
Raymond Wintz died in 1956 and is buried in Montparnasse Cemetery , Paris .
Works
The best known of Raymond Wintz 's paintings is The Blue Door , which is still sold as a poster and print . It is believed to have been painted in 1924 and the French title , which appears on some older prints , is Un coin du port a Doelan . It contains many of his typical themes and motifs : a partially seen room with an open door to a balcony overlooking a harbour or coastal scene . A vase or plant-pot containing geraniums or hydrangeas often features . A similarly themed painting , The Open Door , was sold in the US as a `` Paint it Yourself Art Program '' in the 1950s . The information accompanying this states that Wintz painted the scene following a trip to Brittany in 1924 and that it is based on the actual view from a friend 's villa . Brittany was the location for The Blue Door and for most of his landscapes which carry the name of the location and include Camaret and Morning Light at Dalan ( Finisterre ) .
A weekly French newspaper , L'Illustration , featured one of his watercolours , Matinee sur la Baie du Morbihan . In addition , several of his prints were reproduced in the Homelovers Art Review . These include La Vue Tranquille , Blue Harbour ( Port Haliguen ) Brittany , and Luminosite Marine . Postcards were produced featuring some of his paintings , including Breton Fishing Village and Hydrangeas published by the Medici Society .
The style in which Raymond Wintz painted can be broadly termed ‘ realism ' , although a slight leaning towards impressionism has been noted . He may have been attracted to the Brittany locations because of the quality of the light , in the same way as a school of painting grew up around Newlyn in Cornwall . He has been called ‘ the painter of light ' and his works were described as 'nostalgic ' even in the 1950s . To a modern-day audience his paintings may evoke childhood memories of holidays on the coast . The continuing popularity of The Blue Door may be because it typifies the kind of view that people want from their front window .
Paintings attributed to 'Richard Wintz ' and ' R . Wints ' also appear to be by Raymond Wintz , displaying many of his characteristic motifs and stylistic features . The confusion has possibly arisen because his signature is ' R.Wintz ' and ' R . Wints ' appears to be a misreading of this . Paintings are most commonly signed in the bottom right hand corner .
His works were exhibited in museums and galleries including the Tattegrain Museum and Petit-Palais in Paris and the Museums of Reims , Laon , Montreal Museum of Fine Arts , Montevideo , and Glasgow , but it is not clear how many remain on show . His paintings are occasionally sold at auction in France and other locations , with most originating from and entering private collections .
In terms of auction records , an oil painting called La Maison Rose ( 48 x 55 cm ) was sold at auction by Bonhams for £2,800 in December 2007 . The highest recorded price may be 13,200 euros obtained for Port a l'ile d'Yeu , a large ( 165 x 195 cm ) oil painting sold by Chayette-Cheval in France in December 2004 .

John Edmund Reade ( 1800–1870 ) was an English poet and novelist .
Life
Reade was born in 1800 at Broadwell , near Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire , the son of Thomas Reade of Barton Manor , Berkshire , and his wife Catherine , daughter of Sir John Hill . His grandfather , Sir John Reade , was fourth baronet , being the great-grandson of Compton Reade of Shipton Court , Oxfordshire .
Reade was educated at a school at Doulting , near Shepton Mallet . His first work , a collection of poems entitled The Broken Heart , was published in 1825 . He was to devote the rest of his life to literature , although he was severely criticised for lack of originality : Edward Irving Carlyle , in the first edition of the Dictionary of National Biography , says he `` developed a remarkable capacity for plagiarism '' , adding that `` Byron served for his chief model , but his poems and plays are full of sentiments and phrases taken undisguisedly from the best-known writings of Scott , Wordsworth , Ben Jonson , Croly , and others . '' His `` Cain , the Wanderer '' ( 1830 ) , however , earned him an introduction to Coleridge and was praised by Goethe . In 1838 , after a long stay in the southern Europe , he published his longest poem , Italy , which , according to Carlyle , `` bears a close resemblance to Childe Harold , reproducing even the dying gladiator '' .
His other publications included Sibyl Leaves : Poems ( 1827 ) ; The Revolt of the Angels , an epic drama ( 1830 ) ; Catiline , a tragedy ( 1839 ) ; Prose from the South ( 1846 ) ; and the novels The Light of other Days ( 1858 ) , Wait and Hope ( 1859 ) and Saturday Sterne ( 1862 ) . Several collected editions of his poems were published , the most complete being that of 1865 , in three volumes .
Reade lived in Bath and the west of England for most of his life , but also spent considerable periods in central and southern Europe . He died on 17 September 1870 .
A portrait of Reade by Thomas Brigstocke was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1850 .

The Coalition won the 2013 federal election with 90 of 150 lower house seats on a current 17-seat , 3.65-point two-party swing , defeating the 6-year Labor government . Labor holds 55 seats while crossbenchers hold the remaining five . The Division of Fairfax was the last seat to be declared .
Classification of seats as marginal , fairly safe or safe is applied by the independent Australian Electoral Commission using the following definition : `` Where a winning party receives less than 56 % of the vote , the seat is classified as 'marginal ' , 56–60 % is classified as 'fairly safe ' and more than 60 % is considered 'safe ' . ''
Pendulum
The Mackerras pendulum was devised by the Australian psephologist Malcolm Mackerras as a way of predicting the outcome of an election contested between two major parties in a Westminster style lower house legislature such as the Australian House of Representatives , which is composed of single-member electorates and which uses a preferential voting system such as a Condorcet method or IRV .
The pendulum works by lining up all of the seats held in Parliament for the government , the opposition and the cross benches according to the percentage-point margin they are held by on a two party preferred basis . This is also known as the swing required for the seat to change hands . Given a uniform swing to the opposition or government parties , the number of seats that change hands can be predicted .

Northwich Woodlands ( formerly Northwich Community Woodlands ) is an area of 373 hectares of publicly accessible countryside near Northwich in Cheshire , England . It comprises nine separate woods , country parks , lakes and parks , many of which are connected to each other via footpaths and other rights of way . Much of the land was formerly industrial and used for mining salt and manufacturing chemicals . The extraction of salt caused subsidence leading to the formation of pools known as flashes . The land became derelict during the 20th century as the salt industry contracted . Much of the area has now been reclaimed for the purposes of conservation and recreation and forms part of the Mersey Forest initiative .
Description
Northwich Woodlands is made up of nine different sites : Marbury Country Park ; Anderton Nature Park ; Dairy House Meadows ; Forge Woods ; Hopyards Woods ; Marshall 's Woods ; Ashton 's Flash ; Furey Woods and Carey Park .
Marbury Country Park
In the north of the area beside Budworth Mere is Marbury Country Park . It was formerly a country estate owned by the Smith-Barry family but it became derelict and Marbury Hall was demolished in 1968 . The site was reclaimed in 1975 and is now run as a country park by Cheshire West and Chester Council . An arboretum , ice-house and avenues of lime trees remain from former times . An area of ancient woodland known as Big Wood is important for wildlife with a variety of woodland birds including lesser spotted woodpecker .
Anderton Nature Park
Anderton Nature Park stretches along the north side of the River Weaver and Witton Brook from Anderton Boat Lift in the west to Haydn 's Pool ( formerly Marbury No . 1 Sludge Bed ) in the east . A number of paths lead through grassland and recently planted woodland . Wildlife includes uncommon flowers such as pennyroyal . Haydn 's Pool is important for waterbirds including regular green sandpiper .
Neumann 's and Ashton 's Flashes
These flashes lie at the south-east of the site . From the 1940s they were used by ICI to store lime waste but by the 1970s they had become disused . Paths and bird hides have now been constructed around them .
A number of plants associated with alkaline soils grow on the site including fragrant orchid , marsh helleborine , ploughman 's spikenard , and yellow-wort . It is a stronghold for the dingy skipper butterfly . A variety of ducks , waders , and other waterbirds occur and numerous rarities have been recorded such as broad-billed sandpiper , stilt sandpiper , Caspian tern , and whiskered tern .
Witton Lime Beds SSSI
Immediately to the west of Neumann 's and Ashton 's Flashes , in a loop of Witton Brook , lies Witton Lime Beds , a Site of Special Scientific Interest .
Carey Park
Carey Park is the closest park to the town . It was opened in 2003 and named after Councillor Ron Carey who was instrumental in regenerating the site , the park is located on the site of the former Witton landfill . A conversion project took seven years . Carey Park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest with rare grasses and butterflies alongside other wildlife . Northwich Parkrun takes place in the park .

L-Homocitrulline is an amino acid and a metabolite of ornithine in mammalian ( including human ) metabolism . The amino acid can be detected in larger amounts in the urine of individuals with urea cycle disorders . At present , it is thought that the depletion of the ornithine supply causes the accumulation of carbamyl-phosphate in the urea cycle which may be responsible for the enhanced synthesis of homocitrulline and homoarginine . Both amino acids can be detected in urine . Amino acid analysis allows for the quantitative analysis of these amino acid metabolites in biological fluids such as urine or blood .
Description
Homocitrulline is one methylene group longer than citrulline , but similar in structure . The metabolite is generated from a lysine residue after lysine reacts with cyanate . Cyanate is present in the human body in equilibrium with urea . Under physiological conditions the urea concentration may be too low to allow extensive carbamylation . However , the conversion process leading to the formation of homocitrulline from lysine in proteins is known to occur in vivo . During renal failure conditions , the urea concentration increases and carbamylation of many proteins can occur , which can be detected . It is believed that most carbamylation takes place during inflammation when the enzyme myeloperoxidase is released from neutrophils . This enzyme converts thiocyanate to cyanate . Increased levels of cyanate can now carbamylate lysine residues .
Myeloperoxidase released from neutrophils converts thiocyanate to cyanate which carbamylates lysine residues to form homocitrulline . Thiocyanate ( SCN− ) is a naturally occurring pseudohalide found in dietary sources . Myeloperoxidase can use SCN− as a cosubstrate together with hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) to form cyanate . In patients with kidney dysfunction urea is elevated . Urea is in equilibrium with cyanate and isocyanate . Carbamylation of nucleophilic amino groups , for example lysine residues , can modify protein structures and ultimately cause metabolic dysfunctions .
In diseases
Homocitrulline has been suggested as a confounding antigen for rheumatoid arthritis antibodies targeting citrullinated proteins/peptides . Antibodies binding to homocitrulline-containing sequences have been found in rheumatoid arthritis patients ' sera More recently , it has been shown that homocitrulline-containing proteins are present in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) joints . In rodents they may affect T-cell triggering and possibly autoantibody formation , and possibly also in humans .
In another metabolic disorder , in the hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria ( HHH ) syndrome , first described in 1969 , ornithine levels maybe elevated five to ten times in comparison to normal levels . In addition , in this syndrome , levels of alanine , orotic acid and homocitrulline may be elevated as well . In people with hyperammonemia orotic acid and homocitrulline appear to be chronically elevated after a high protein diet , but may be normal when fasting .
The metabolic disorder , lysinuric protein intolerance is caused by the body 's inability to digest and use certain protein building blocks or amino acids . These are lysine , arginine , and ornithine . These amino acids are found in many protein-rich foods . Since in this disorder the human body can not effectively break down these amino acids people typically experience nausea and vomiting after ingesting protein rich foods . Associated features of this protein intolerance may include an enlarged liver and spleen , short stature , muscle weakness , impaired immune function , and progressively brittle bones that are prone to fracture and a lung disorder called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may also develop . In addition , the accumulation of amino acids in the kidneys can cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . In ESRD the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively .

Vice Admiral Alfred Erik Bertil Berthelsson ( 11 April 1902 – 11 February 1977 ) was a senior naval officer in the Swedish Navy . Berthelsson served as Captain of the Coastal Fleet ( 1951–1953 ) , as Chief of the Naval Staff ( 1953–1957 ) , as Chief of the Coastal Fleet ( 1957–1961 ) and as commanding officer of the Naval Command South ( 1961–1966 ) .
Early life
Berthelsson was born on 11 April 1902 in Njurunda Parish , Västernorrland County , Sweden , the son of Alfred Berthelsson , a merchant , and his wife Anna Backman . He passed studentexamen in Örebro in 1920 , after which in 1921 he enlisted as a telegraphist in the Swedish Navy , where he reached the rank of Corporal . After two years of service , mostly on the torpedo cruiser HSwMS Claes Horn , Berthelsson was accepted in the summer of 1923 as a naval cadet and underwent regular training at the Royal Swedish Naval Academy .
Career
Berthelsson was commissioned as a naval officer in 1926 with the rank of acting sub-lieutenant . After service as an acting sub-lieutenant on the coastal defence ship with Göran Wahlström as executive officer and long voyage with the cruiser to South America , Berthelsson began his training as an air scout . During the 1930s , he came during a number of different tours of duty to deal with the air operational issues in the navy , during which he served for a year 1933-34 in the Air Staff . During the same period , he underwent training as a torpedo officer with tours of duty on the destroyers and . These tours were a good preparation for Berthelsson 's passing of the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College 's General Course in the winter of 1932-33 , which was followed by a Staff Course in the winter of 1934-35 . This laid the foundation for decades of work in staff service - on board and ashore - as well as in various investigations . In 1936-37 he served on the coastal defence ship Sverige as an adjutant in the Winter Squadron ( Vintereskadern ) and in 1937 on the cruiser as an adjutant of the School Department . This was followed by service in the Naval Staff , among other things as a press officer until the spring of 1939 . The contact with the press that he thereby received , he maintained throughout his subsequent service , which benefited him during work in various investigations .
In the spring of 1939 , Berthelsson took over as flag lieutenant ( flaggadjutant ) in the Coastal Fleet with Rear Admiral Gösta Ehrensvärd as commander and Captain Helge Strömbäck as flag captain . During the mobilization in the autumn of 1939 and the subsequent years of emergency preparedness , Berthelsson performed one of his superiors ' highly esteemed work . It was above all the development of the ships ' tactics and the torpedo 's effort , both with ships and aircraft , that he had to devote his strength to , but at the same time he had to convey to daily press and radio events and developments to keep in touch with the public . Among other things , he also participated in the publication of various defense magazines and books , which were published by various main authors . After three years in this position , Berthelsson got a long-awaited position as ship captain on the destroyer during the summer of 1942 , followed by a similar command on the destroyer in 1943 . He was largely allowed to conduct escort service in the Baltic Sea for shipping protection against German sea and air forces and Russian submarines , in which he was involved in several incidents . However , in the autumn of 1942 , Berthelsson had already taken up the position of teacher in tactics at the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College and in 1943 was appointed lieutenant commander . During his three years as a tactics teacher , the reorganization of ship tactics began , which was conditioned by new weapons and on-board radars , which came to strongly influence the ships ' way of behaving both at sea and in the bases . His pioneering work also came to fruition in the 1943 naval inquiry into naval warfare , where he served as secretary with Rear Admiral Gunnar Bjurner as leader . The type of ship , the armored destroyer , which was launched at the time , can be said to have served as a model for the Halland-class destroyers who began to be planned and built in the late 1940s and the Östergötland-class destroyers during the 1950s . His diligent efforts to keep the navy with destroyers at sufficient numbers were a marked feature of his business . Berthelsson 's good handling of investigative issues led him to be appointed as an expert in the 1945 Defense Committee as an assistant to the then Rear Admiral Stig H : son Ericson , who was the navy 's representative . The inquiry 's work led to the Defence Act of 1948 .
Berthelsson 's longing for a tour of sea duty was satisfied in the autumn of 1947 , when he took over as destroyer division commander with base aboard . This annual command was followed by a year as captain of the cruiser . It was important to design the complex tactics of this newly built ship , which was conditioned by the many weapon systems on board . Tre Kronor was therefore allowed to act fairly independently under the command of the captain , during which Berthelsson was free to develop his thoughts on tactics and personnel care . Berthelsson 's theoretical and practical knowledge of naval tactics was then used by placing him in the autumn of 1949 as head of the Weapons Control Office ( Stridsledningskontoret ) of the Royal Swedish Naval Material Administration , where he served for two years , during which time he was appointed Captain in 1951 . It was a time when Swedish naval ships was fully equipped with radar , both for reconnaissance , combat command and navigation as well as for weapons deployment in many different forms . Berthelsson 's great interest in modern development led him to play a leading role in the introduction of the Decca Navigator System for hyperbole navigation in the southern Baltic Sea . The facilities were later transferred to the Swedish Maritime Administration . In the autumn of 1951 , Berthelsson was appointed flag captain of the Coastal Fleet , whose commander was Rear Admiral Stig H : son Ericson . This marked the beginning of what was called the `` cruiser era '' in the Swedish Navy , which came to be about a decade old . During this time , the `` squadron tactic '' was created , which involved a concentrated attack with at least two squadrons , composed of cruisers , destroyers and torpedo boats .
In the spring of 1953 , Berthelsson took over as Chief of the Naval Staff . The emphasis in his work was shifted from the tactical and operational to the organizational and defense policy . Sweden 's cooling defense will and the declining appropriations made it necessary to reduce the ship 's armaments , while maintaining the high level of preparedness , leaving the ships to be `` mothballed '' . At the organizational reductions , Berthelsson preferred to reduce the land organization in order to keep the crews on board , which led to some contradictions . The increasing number of investigations with which the navy was charged during Berthelsson 's time as chief meant that his agility , acquired through dealings with publicists and politicians , came in handy . He had the ability , even when there were major differences from the beginning , to negotiate a compromise that was acceptable to all , which , thanks to his determination and willpower , did not become completely unfavorable to the navy . In 1954 he was promoted to rear admiral . In the spring of 1957 , he achieved the goal he had set himself since his youth , namely to take over as Chief of the Coastal Fleet . There he had to continue the same line of development , which he helped to draw up during his time as Captain of the Fleet . He was eager to not only lead the exercises from the flagship but also to embark on the smaller ships in difficult conditions at sea to get to know the conditions of the crews . At the same time , he worked for information about the navy during the ships ' visits to ports and he never forgot the requirement for contact with the public . However , in 1958 - due to drastically cut defense spending - the destroyers Lappland and Värmland had to be canceled to get funds available for the acquisition of the ship types that would be part of the new light fleet , which would succeed the cruiser era . Berthelsson took so much offense to this that he suffered both mentally and physically and his health was forever weakened .
In the autumn of 1961 , he took over as commanding officer of the Naval Command South , based in Kungshuset in Karlskrona , which was his wife , Marianne 's home town . However , it did not take long in his new position before he contracted ill health , which meant that from 1963 until his retirement in 1967 he had to devote himself to special assignments . Berthelsson retired and was promoted to vice admiral in 1967 .
Personal life
In 1931 , Berthelsson married Marianne Quiding ( 1905–1989 ) , the daughter of Uno Quiding , a harbor master , and Thyra Uhrström . He was the father of Ulla ( born 1933 ) , Ulf ( born 1937 ) and Kang ( born 1945 ) .
Death
Berthelsson died on 11 February 1977 in Västerhaninge , Stockholm County . He was interred at Västerhaninge Cemetery on 12 March 1977 .

Highland Park Presbyterian Church ( HP Pres ) is a Presbyterian church in University Park , Texas , with a Dallas post office address . In 2013 , HP Pres voted to change its affiliation from Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) to ECO : A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians .
History
HP Pres was first established in 1926 , with 290 members . By January 1927 , Dr. W.A . Alexander of Mobile , Alabama became the first pastor . A year later , in 1928 , the church building designed by architect Mark Lemmon ( 1889–1975 ) was erected . From 1932 to 1937 , Dr. Thomas W. Currie , Sr. served as the new pastor ; he would later serve as President of Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary . The next pastor , Dr. Henry Wade DuBose of Spartanburg , South Carolina , served from 1938 to 1944 . Dr. William M. Elliott , Jr. , who came from Druid Hills Presbyterian Church in Druid Hills , Georgia , served as pastor from 1944 to 1973 . Moreover , Peter Marshall ( 1902-1949 ) occasionally preached in the church . Additionally , Dr. Arthur V. Boand became the first associate minister in 1950 and Dr. Edward A. Mohns became the second associate pastor in 1954 .
In 1973 , Dr. B. Clayton Bell Sr. , who came from the First Presbyterian Church in Rome , Georgia , became the new pastor . Further associate pastors were Dr. Sherwood M. Strodel , Dr. Thomas Tyndall , Dr. Harry S. Hassall , Thomas Foley , Thomas Cook , Gareth Icenogle , Dr . Ace L. Tubbs , Peter Barnes , Paul Peterson , William A. Watson , Jean Marie Thorndike , Russell Jonas , Robert H.Thompson , Andrew Adair , Ellen Schulz , Jeffrey Schulz , Martha Thorson , Murray Gossett , Joseph Parker , Chris Robinson , Don Riley , Max Reddick and Marshall Zieman . In 2000 , Rev . Dr. Ronald W. Scates of Baltimore , Maryland became the new pastor until stepping down in 2013 . The congregation was then served by Rev . Joe Rightmyer , interim Senior Pastor , until the Rev . Bryan Dunagan was called in 2014 .
Disputes with and Withdrawal from PC ( USA )
In May 1991 HP Pres held a vote to withdraw from PC ( USA ) . Although a simple majority voted in favor of withdrawal ( 2,563 voting to withdraw and 2,001 voting against ) , a 2/3 majority was required to withdraw , and thus ( at that time ) HP Pres remained within PC ( USA ) . ( A dissident group left HPPC and ultimately formed what is now Park Cities Presbyterian Church . )
The issue of withdrawal came up again in 2013 ; this time , the withdrawal motion passed with 89 percent approval , with a similar majority voting to affiliate with ECO . As of 2014 , however , HP Pres has sought and obtained a temporary injunction against Grace Presbytery ( the presbytery having oversight for all PC ( USA ) churches in Dallas County ) , prohibiting them from establishing an `` administrative commission '' over HP Pres .
Settlement and Dismissal from PC ( USA )
On September 9 , 2014 , an announcement was made that Highland Park Presbyterian Church will pay $ 7.8 million to Grace Presbytery in order to obtain both a release of its obligations under the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) 's trust clause and ecclesiastical dismissal from the denomination .
The settlement agreement – which also includes an agreement between Highland Park and Grace Presbytery to send a joint letter to the members of Highland Park allowing them the opportunity to choose whether they wish to remain affiliated with the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) – will resolve the pending lawsuit between Grace Presbytery and Highland Park .
The lawsuit involved a dispute between Highland Park and Grace Presbytery over whether the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) 's trust clause , which Highland Park agreed to abide by , is legally enforceable under Texas law . Ultimately , three experts in Texas trust law retained by Grace Presbytery agreed that Highland Park 's agreement to hold its property in trust for the use and benefit of the denomination was enforceable under neutral principles of Texas law .
In an attempt to privately resolve their disagreement before trial , Highland Park and Grace Presbytery entered into a mediation process presided over by former federal Judge Jeff Kaplan on February 21 and August 25 , 2014 . Judge Kaplan worked to bring the parties to an agreement to resolve the case . The parties reached an agreement in principle at mediation , which obtained final approval of the parties on September 8 , 2014 . The $ 7.8 million settlement figure represents 26 % of Highland Park 's “ approximately thirty million dollars ” of property , as alleged in Paragraph 18 of Highland Park 's amended petition filed in the lawsuit .
Family of Churches

Stanley Jennings Carpenter ( 9 December 1904 – 28 August 1984 ) , Colonel , U.S. Army , retired , deceased , a noted medical entomologist , was born December 9 , 1904 in West Liberty , Morgan County , Kentucky , and died on August 28 , 1984 at Santa Rosa , California at age 79 . This biographical sketch is based on the text of a memorial lecture ( edited for this venue ) presented by a colleague on March 24 , 1997 .
Early life
The son of a tobacco farmer , Stanley Jennings Carpenter grew up helping his father but soon developed a strong interest in nature . He was fascinated by birds and insects and at an early age decided he wanted to be a Naturalist . After graduating in 1926 from Hazel Green Academy , a Christian high school , as the Valedictorian , he decided to go to college to pursue his interest in nature . Against his father 's wishes ( his father wanted him to remain working the farm ) , he attended Milligan College in Johnson City , Tennessee , and again graduated valedictorian of his class in 1930 with a major in biology .
He then attended the University of Tennessee , where he obtained a master 's degree in zoology in 1931 . He worked his way through college and did so by washing dishes and waiting tables . He returned to Milligan College , where he taught as an instructor for year . Determined to obtain a Ph.D. , he gained a fellowship in ichthyology at Ohio State University , but soon changed to graduate work in entomology , in which he did his studies in 1932 and 1933 . Though he finished many of the requirements for his doctorate , he did not complete his thesis .
Early career
With good intentions of returning to complete the degree , he accepted a position on the faculty of Harding College in Searcy , Arkansas . He advanced quickly and became head of the Department of Biology , a position he held from 1934-1937 . His doctoral studies were never completed . In 1937 he became the entomologist for the Arkansas State Health Department at Little Rock , and he served in that capacity until 1941 . His first publication was an 87-page illustrated treatise on the mosquitoes of Arkansas in 1941 . The same year he published two papers on the habits and health importance , including malaria , of Arkansas mosquitoes .
Military service
In 1941 he received a commission as an officer in the U.S. Army Sanitary Corps . He was immediately called to active duty as the entomologist at Camp Robinson , Arkansas . Early in 1942 he was sent to the Middle East , where he was assigned to mosquito control work in Kuwait , Iraq , and Iran . Late in 1942 he returned to the United States as head of entomology for the 4th Service Command at Fort McPherson , Georgia . While there he taught mosquito identification to classes of commissioned Army entomologists from various installations in the 4th Service Command . Most of these officers were sent overseas , where they served assignments during World War II in both the European and Pacific theaters .
He left the service in 1942 and worked for 2 years as an entomologist for the National Biscuit Company . This turned out to be the low point in his career . He was , as his wife said , `` a fish out of water . '' He disliked the work and the lack of a major challenge . Controlling the roaches that invaded the kitchen where Fig Newtons were made was an example of one of his assignments .
He returned to the service in 1947 and accepted a regular Army commission as Major , first serving as entomologist at the 2nd Army Medical Laboratory at Fort Meade , Maryland . In 1948 he was ordered to the Panama Canal as entomologist in charge of malaria control for the Caribbean Command . Here he served as the commanding officer of a malaria survey unit in charge of more than 100 mosquito control workers in the Canal Zone . He had arrived in Panama as a Lieutenant Colonel but was soon promoted to full Colonel . It was not long until a small outbreak of yellow fever occurred near the Canal Zone . This resulted in a detailed study of forest mosquitoes in Panama and Costa Rica . He was joined in this effort by Dr. Pedro Galindo , Pan-American entomologist , and Dr. Harold Trapido of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory ( named for the Surgeon General of the United States Army Major General William C. Gorgas ) . One of the recruits Colonel Carpenter selected to aid in the survey was an 18-year-old soldier named E L Peyton , who had joined up before finishing his high school degree . Colonel Carpenter was impressed with this young man 's intelligence and initiative . He encouraged him to complete his degree while in Panama ; Peyton credits Colonel Carpenter with his entry into a career in systematics . Peyton became a productive scientist with the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit . His contributions were recognized by the American Mosquito Control Association , which presented him with the Belkin Award in 1993 .
In 1951 , Colonel Carpenter returned to the United States and was sent to the 9th Service Command Medical Laboratory at Fort Baker , California , where he served a 3-year tour of duty . At the completion of this duty he was sent to Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington , D.C. , an assignment that lasted 2 & 1/2 years . In January 1957 he was transferred to the Pentagon , where he served on a board of field-grade officers who reviewed and selected regular Army officers from lists of applicants of reserve officers .
He was transferred back to the Fort Baker Medical Laboratory in July 1957 , where he remained until his retirement in 1960 . It was while here that Colonel Carpenter completed work on his landmark book , `` The Mosquitoes of North America '' , by Carpenter and La Casse . The publication of this book was entirely the work of Stanley Carpenter and his illustrators . The second author did not contribute to the preparation of the manuscript , other than providing illustrations for some of the plates . This handbook remains an indispensable guide because of the general details it provides for each species .
Later career
He immediately began part-time work for the California State Health Department , now the California Department of Health Services , where for the next 12 years he was engaged in studies of snow pool Aedes mosquitoes . Most of the work was accomplished in the Sierra Nevada of California , and it resulted in a series of more than 20 publications on the biology , ecology , and distribution of these species , all of which appeared in the California Vector Views , published by the California Department of Public Health . After his employment with the California Department of Health , he took up a hobby that had interested him since childhood . He joined the Audubon Society and spent his remaining years birdwatching and compiling a life list .
During his long and distinguished career , Colonel Carpenter authored 80 scientific publications on the systematics , biology , and control of tropical and temperate species of mosquitoes , many of which are of medical importance . Included were two important monographs , The Mosquitoes of North America , previously noted , and The Mosquitoes of the Southern United States , East of Oklahoma and Texas , in 1946 , a 292-page book that he coauthored with W. W. Middlekauff and R. W. Chamberlain . In 1981 Colonel Carpenter received the AMCA Medal of Honor . This , the highest award of the AMCA , was given in recognition of his long and distinguished career . In 1984 he was honored by the California Mosquito and Vector Control Association with a resolution recognizing his many accomplishments . Also in 1984 , he was honored in an issue of the AMCA journal , Mosquito Systematics . The Panamanian species of biting midge Culicoides carpenteri Wirth & Blanton , 1953 and sand fly Psathyromyia carpenteri ( Fairchild & Hertig , 1953 ) are named in his honor .

Tatiana Cordero Velázquez ( February 23 , 1961 - April 13 , 2021 ) was an Ecuadorian feminist , considered one of the forerunners in the fight for women 's rights and for LGBT rights in the country . At the time of her death , she was the director of the Urgent Action Fund for Latin American and the Caribbean , an association that she had founded .
In 1989 , together with the activist Nela Meriguet , she created the Women 's Communication Workshop , a feminist organization that focused its efforts on developing maps about femicide cases in Ecuador and on promoting educational projects that questioned heteronormativity . Cordero Velázquez was also notable for denouncing the existence of so-called `` de-homosexualization clinics '' , both in Ecuador and abroad .
In 1991 , Cordero Velázquez co-wrote the book ( literally `` We , the happy women '' ) with Ecuadorian feminists Rosa Manzo Rodas and Marena Briones Velasteguí . The book focused on prostitution in Ecuador , referencing the personal experiences of Ecuadorian sex workers in Asociacion de Mujeres Autonomas `` 22nd de Junio '' ( June 22nd Association of Autonomous Women ) , a labor union for female sex workers .
She died of cancer on April 13 , 2021 in Quito . Among the people who publicly lamented her death were the Vice President of the Quito Board of Rights , Sybel Martínez , and the municipal health secretary , Ximena Abarca .
Cordero Velázquez was a lesbian .

Nicolai Jacob Marstrand ( 5 August 1770 – 12 July 1829 ) was a Danish mechanician and inventor . He was the father of painter Wilhelm Marstrand .
Early life and education
Marstrand was born on 5 August 1776 in Østerdalen , Norway , the son of manager ( bergskriver ) of Inset Copperworks Even Nicolai Marstrand ( 1723–85 ) and Magdalene Elisabeth Schnitler ( 1730–1802 ) . The family moved to Trondheim when his father died in 1785 . He graduated from Trondheim Cathedral School in 1789 .
Career
Aged 20 , Marstrand came to Denmark , where he initially worked odd jobs , for instance as a private tutor and a road assistant , before being employed as an assistant under colonel Eilert Tscherning at Frederick 's Works . He was later promoted to mechanical consultant to the government , settling in Copenhagen in 1806 . He was the following year sent to England but when the war broke out shortly thereafter he came under suspicion of being a spy and had to flee the country .
Back in Copenhagen , he was granted a royal privilege as a baker after inventing a kneading machine , opening a bakery in Silkegade in 1810 . He also established a mechanical workshop , constructing spinning machines and various musical instruments , especially harps . He invented an oil press in 1812 and in 1813 was granted a monopoly on a horse mill . In 1827 , he invented a machine for copying of sculptures .
Marstrand was from 1808 also inspector of the workshops at the Royal Institute for the Deaf and Mute . In 1813 , he was appointed as manager of the workshops at Forbedringshuset .
Personal life
Marstrand married Petra Ottilia Smith ( 28 February 1778 – 15 November 1847 ) , a daughter of provost Troels S. ( 1744–1823 ) and Anna Agnete Plum ( 1752–1805 ) , on 26 September 1804 in Holbæk . Five of their seven children survived childhood : Naval officer Osvald J. Marstrand , plantation owner Otto Marstrand , baker and politician Troels Marstrand , painter Wilhelm Marstrand and toolmaker Tgeodor Marstrand .
Marstrand 's home was a meeting place for many notable artists and writers of the time . Once a week , he hosted a quartet in which he played the violin and the painter C. W. Eckersberg played cello .
In 1809 , he was awarded Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn . In 1811 he was appointed as Kommerceråd . He died on 12 July 1829 and is buried in Assistens Cemetery .

WBYA ( 105.5 FM ; `` The Wolf '' ) is a radio station licensed to Islesboro , Maine , United States . The station serves the Mid Coast area with a country music format . The station is owned by Binnie Media , and broadcasts from a transmitter on U.S. 1 south of Northport . The station 's competitor is WMCM in Rockland .
History
The station went on the air as WAYD in February 1999 , programming an adult standards format branded as `` The Bay . '' It was owned by Gopher Hill Communications , who also owned WQSS in Camden and WABI and WWBX in Bangor ; the station was based out of the WQSS studios in Camden . On April 16 , 2001 , the station changed its call sign to the current WBYA , which had just been dropped by WFZX in Searsport . Gopher Hill sold WBYA to Mariner Broadcasting in 2003 ; this came after the other three Gopher Hill stations were sold to Clear Channel Communications . Mariner kept the standards format , but dropped locally-produced programming in favor of the Music of Your Life service .
Nassau Broadcasting Partners acquired Mariner in 2004 ; under Nassau , the station switched to the `` Frank FM '' classic hits format on April 1 , 2005 . WBYA simulcast the morning show of Portland sister WFNK , and in addition to the classic hits format broadcast local high school basketball games and Boston Red Sox baseball .
WBYA , along with 16 other Nassau stations in northern New England , was purchased at bankruptcy auction by WBIN Media Company , a company controlled by Bill Binnie , on May 22 , 2012 . Binnie already owned WBIN-TV in Derry , New Hampshire . The deal was completed on November 30 , 2012 .
On February 18 , 2017 , Binnie Media moved the classic hits format to WBQX ( 106.9 FM ) , replacing the classical music programming of WBACH ; WBYA then began stunting with a loop directing listeners to WBQX . On February 24 , 2017 , WBYA changed to a country music format , branded as `` 105.5 The Wolf '' ; the new format includes a simulcast of Portland sister station WTHT 's morning show . Following the format changes , WBYA retained Boston Red Sox broadcasts , while its high school basketball coverage was transferred to WBQX .

Reception
The movie debuted on United States television on the ABC network on Friday , September 17 , 1982 , and was the 28th most watched show in America in that week . It was beaten by CBS 's The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana , which became the most watched prime-time television show of the next week , with a 24.0 Nielsen rating and 37 share .
Production
The movie was filmed in Kensington and Westminster .
That the ABC and CBS films debuted three days apart was not a coincidence . CBS had planned to show Royal Romance in December as a Hallmark-sponsored pre-Christmas film , but then moved the air date back to September , even before the official start of the new ratings season . ABC then jumped their movie ahead of CBS , so late in the game that TV Guide did not list it . When one reviewer asked to get a preview of either movie , he was told in one case `` Are you kidding ? They 're still gluing the tape together . ''

Casting
In October 2017 , Peyton List was cast as a new iteration of Ivy Pepper . According to Bryan Wynbrandt , `` The change was all based on the idea that she 's continuing to evolve to become more of the Ivy from the comic books and what we really enjoyed . In this third evolution you 're going to see a really self possessed , really scary and driven version of the Ivy character , who is intent on kind of making the world in the image she sees it should be , which is the green world . The world where the plants rule and people are an afterthought . ''

Critical reviews
`` A Dark Knight : Pieces of a Broken Mirror '' received mostly positive reviews from critics . Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a `` good '' 7.1 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict , `` While Gotham has n't been away all that long , 'Pieces of a Broken Mirror ' still felt like an underwhelming adventure for a return episode . It was also very busy and semi-scattered , juggling a Jim/Lee story , a new Ivy transformation , and a sort of off-putting Alfred arc . The best part was Edward realizing that he himself had tried to kill Lee ( oh , and the Siren 's Club commercial - duh ) . ''
Kyle Fowle of The A.V . Club gave the episode an `` A '' rating and wrote `` I 'll admit to being hesitant heading into this week 's spring premiere . After all , the winter finale aired all the way back in the beginning of December , and that kind of lengthy break had me questioning whether the show making its return would be as good as I remembered . Perhaps the first 11 episodes worked only as a contained arc , and the show would struggle to keep that momentum going . Luckily , ' A Dark Knight : Pieces Of A Broken Mirror ' is a strong premiere , one that follows through on the storylines from last fall in interesting ways while also pushing the story , and the characters , in a new direction . ''
Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4.5-star rating out of 5 , writing `` Gotham has plenty of compelling elements in the back half of this season , but it desperately needs a few course corrections . But , Gotham is at its absolute best when it steps on the gas , so the upcoming villain team up has me hopeful as ever that the show will erase some of the lagging bits in favor of some crazy action . ''
Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a 4.5-star rating out of 5 , writing `` A number of stories unfolded on Gotham , as we caught up with almost everyone including someone we have n't seen in a long , long time . Some of it made sense , some of it not , but considering how much was actually unpacked , Gotham did a good job of not making the hour a cramped mess . '' Marc Buxton of Den of Geek gave wrote , `` As with the rest of the developing dynamics in this episode , I hope Gotham chooses the slow burn rather than the immediate plot twist with this one . There was a measuredness to this episode in general that really worked . I 'd like to see it continue . ''

Unitarian College Manchester is one of two Unitarian seminaries in England . It is based at Luther King House in the Brighton Grove area of Manchester , and its degrees are validated by the University of Manchester .
It has been preparing students for ministry and lay leadership positions in the Unitarian and Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Churches since 1854 , when it was established by the Unitarian Home Mission Board . The College has a tradition of providing occasional overseas scholarships for students from kindred churches , particularly from Hungary and Romania ( see Unitarian Church of Transylvania ) . It is now part of the Partnership for Theological Education .
It is to be distinguished from the only other Unitarian college in the country , which confusingly shares a similar name . What is now Harris Manchester College , Oxford started off as a dissenting academy based on the famous one in Warrington . `` The Manchester Academy '' or `` Manchester College '' , named after its birthplace in 1786 , kept the name when it moved to York ( 1804-1840 ) , and back to Manchester ( 1840-1853 ) . It then moved to the capital as `` Manchester New College , London '' , in University Hall , Gordon Square ( i.e . Dr Williams 's Library ) 1853–1889 . Its final move was to Oxford , where it has remained , becoming in 1996 a full constituent college of Oxford University , and adding `` Harris '' after a donor . It was the move of the original academy to London in 1854 which occasioned the need for a separate establishment in Manchester .

The Cimarron class was a class of five replenishment oilers which served in the United States Navy between 1981 and 1999 . These ships were sized to provide two complete refuelings of a fossil-fueled aircraft carrier and six to eight accompanying destroyers . All five of the class were jumboized in 1990-92 by being cut in two and a 108-foot ( 35.7 m ) section inserted , increasing their capacities from 120,000 bbls to 180,000 bbls , adding capacity for 300 tons of munitions and improving underway replenishment capabilities . The class was retired in 1998-99 after less than 20 years of service as a result of post-Cold War force reductions , and the advent of the more economical diesel-powered s .

The Église du Bon-Pasteur is a Roman Catholic church located at rue Neyret on the slopes of La Croix-Rousse , near the montée de la Grande Côte , in the 1st arrondissement of Lyon . Cardinal Barbarin described the church as `` highly symbolic for Lyon Christians '' .
History
The parish was founded by Cardinal de Bonald in 1855 . Then the priest Callot opened a little church on this place on 16 March 1856 as Napoleon III and his wife had said they will adopt as godparents all children born that day . Thus , Callot wrote them a letter asking them to adopt his church . On 29 March 1856 , an imperial decree legally recognized the Parish of the Bon Pasteur .
In 1869 , Emperor Napoleon III came to Lyon to start to build the church . The work , performed by Clair Tisseur , began on 25 August 1869 , but the war interrupted his work .
The current church was built between 1875-1883 by Lyon architect Clair Tisseur . The City Council provided 400,000 francs for the construction . However , his plans were not fully respected , because the Father Durant , who presided over the church then , wanted a higher tower . The church was open to the faithful on 15 June 1879 and was completed and consecrated by Archbishop Caverot on 11 June 1883 .
When the church was constructed , Roman tiles laid flat over a pile of animal bones were discovered .
Architecture
The architecture of the church is an imitation of Poitevin Romanesque style .
The church is characterized by its inaccessibility : there is not parvise , the door leading to the rue Neyret , more than three meters above the ground . The staircase scheduled was never built because it would have required the demolition of the barracks on the other side of the street , what anticlericalism of the 3rd Republic could not tolerate .
The stained glasses were made by Bégule and the paintings by Tony Trollet .
Today
In 1984 , the church was no longer assigned to the Catholic church . It was used as a showroom by the École nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon established in the vicinity until 2008 , and students did not clean the church when they moved . Then the building has been regularly squatted , much degraded and desecrated . Priest Michel Durand , who served in the church , said it needs a deep renovation and wanted the Lyon mayor participated in the works .
In 2010 , the church was the subject of a dispute between residents and the mayor about the installation of antennas unwanted by local residents , who decided to protest .

Alexander Cameron S.J . ( 1701 – 19 October 1746 ) was a Scottish nobleman , servant to Prince Charles Edward Stuart , and Roman Catholic priest in the Society of Jesus . After travelling in Catholic Europe and the Caribbean , Cameron converted from the Non-Juring Anglican Communion to Roman Catholicism and was ordained as a priest . Fr . Cameron ran a highly successful vicariate for the still illegal and underground Catholic Church in Scotland in Lochaber and Strathglass before joining the as a military chaplain to the regiment of the Jacobite Army commanded by his brother , Donald Cameron of Lochiel , during the Uprising of 1745 .
After the Battle of Culloden , Fr . Cameron was captured by the British Army and died of the hardships of his imprisonment while being held without trial aboard a prison hulk anchored in the Thames River . He is currently being promoted by the Knights of St Columba for Canonization by the Roman Catholic Church .
Early life
Alexander Cameron was born in September 1701 to John Cameron of Lochiel in Achnagarry , Scotland . He was the brother of Donald Cameron of Lochiel , who would later become the Chief of Clan Cameron and lead a regiment in the Jacobite Uprising of 1745 . Alexander Cameron was raised as a Non-Juring Episcopalian , and was educated in Achnagarry . He also attended a boarding school in St. Ninian 's near Stirling .
As a young man , Cameron travelled to the West Indies on family business , but did not enjoy it . He then joined the French Army , after which he travelled throughout Europe . After arriving in the Papal States , Cameron became a servant in the household of Prince Charles Edward Stuart , heir apparent to Prince James Francis Edward Stuart , the eldest son of King James II and pretender to the English throne .
Conversion to Catholicism
During his time in Rome , where he was `` one of the Bedchamber to the Pretender in Rome '' , Cameron converted to Catholicism . It is noted that he was heavily influenced by Fr . John Farqhuarson S.J . and his uncle Alan Cameron , who had played a great part in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715 .
During this period , Alexander Cameron wrote his brother Donald to explain his reasons for converting : ″I doubt not that a piece of extraordinary news , as that of my being converted to the Catholick Faith , and quitting of the religion in which I was bred up , and educat , will at first surprise you and my Relations . I should be sorrie ever to do anything wherby I would run the risque of incurring the displeasure of a Brother whome I so much love and esteeme ; but in an affaire of so great Consequence as this is , and wherupon alone my eetemall Salvation depends , my first duty is to God . `` Cameron 's letters indicate that he understood his family would be upset with his religious conversion . He only asked that they would still remain in contact with him . `` I have seen most of the splendoure and riches of this World , and have had occasion to be in some of its most beautifull Countreys but never could find out real happiness or contentment in it : and I thank God for it , I only now can say that , I have founde reall riches in possessing nothing . I have no check of conscience and if I could with all this flatter myselfe that my Brothers and Relations had the same regard for me as formerly , my happiness would be compleate ; if they have not God forgive them , I do . If I can not have the pleasure of seeing you and liveing in the same Countrey with you , let me have the satisfaction , at a distance , of being loved by you as one Brother ought to be by an other ; if we never are to meet let me at least have the pleasure of corresponding with you , and heareing from you . I have no other favoure nowe to aske of you and my Relations but the continuance of your love and affections to me as formerly ; for money I neither want any at present , nor ever will put you to any trouble upon that account . `` In another letter , Alexander Cameron tells Donald why he thinks that the Cameron clan should convert to Catholicism . Cameron laments that their clan had broken ties with the Catholic Church . He reminded Donald that the penitent clan chief , Young Ewen Cameron of Lochiel , had built seven churches in Lochaber centuries before . Cameron also condemned what he called the tendency in the protestant faiths to leave religion to the ministers , rather than encouraging people to seek God themselves and seek the truth in the world around them .
Priestly Ministry
Alexander Cameron travelled to Douai in 1730 . He entered the Society of Jesus at Tournai on 30 September 1734 and took his first vows on 1 October 1736 . He was ordained a Priest in 1740 , and returned to Scotland in June 1741 .
Reports indicated that Cameron was very successful in his mission to the highland vicariate . In a report to their General Assembly , the local Presbyterian ministers noted that Cameron , who `` hath lately setled in the part of Strathglass that pertains to Lord Lovet , and is employed as a Poppish Missionary in that neighbourhood and Glenstrathfarrar , and trafficks with great success ; and he hath great advantage by his connection with the inhabitants of Lochaber . ''
Cameron lived in the vicariate with two other Jesuits : Fr . John Farqhuarson , who had influenced his conversion , and Fr . Charles Farqhuarson , John 's brother . Dom . Odo Blundell of Fort Augustus Abbey stated that the priests ' residence was located under the cliff of a big boulder at Brae of Craskie in Glenannich . This dwelling was the very centre of the Catholic mission in Lochaber at the time , where Cameron secretly ministered to the local Catholics .
Cameron almost died at this residence due to its coldness . Cameron refused to retreat to Beaufort Castle because he wanted to minister to the people of Glenannich throughout the winter . Lord Lovat , himself a Catholic , wrote to Donald Cameron , begging him to order his brother to the castle , where Lovat would `` furnish him with all the conveniences of Life '' . Cameron refused to go .
Lovat frequently provided supplies for Cameron and the other local priests at Mass-houses that Lovat provided in Crochail and Strathfarrar . However , the Presbytery of Inverness eventually forced Lovat had to close them .
Capture and death
In 1745 , Cameron enlisted as a chaplain to Donald Cameron of Lochiel 's Regiment . The regiment had three chaplains ( a Presbyterian minister , a Non-juring Episcopalian clergyman , and a Catholic ) . On the evening before the Battle of Culloden , Fr . Cameron offered the Tridentine Mass on the battlefield for his regiment , wearing a tartan chasuble – a fragment of which is preserved today .
After the Jacobite defeat at Culloden , Cameron fled to escape the British Army . However , he was captured at Morar , taken in captivity by Captain Ferguson , and later transferred with Fr . James Grant and other priests to HMS Furnace , a prison hulk . Reports are that Ferguson `` brutalised '' Cameron , placing him in iron chains among the ropes and cables of the Furnace .
Cameron became seriously ill as a result of his imprisonment . After seeing a doctor 's report , Lord Albemarle ordered Fr . Cameron taken ashore . Captain Ferguson ignored his command . Some others tried to prepared proper bedding for Fr . Cameron , to which Ferguson replied that he would sink this boat and theirs if anyone dared to aid Fr . Cameron .
After the Furnace had anchored in the Thames , Fr . Cameron died , with Fr . John Farquharson by his side . Fr . Cameron was buried in the nearest cemetery to the ship .
Devotion and canonisation
The Knights of St. Columba at the University of Glasgow have launched a campaign to canonize Fr . Cameron , `` with the hope that he will become a great saint for Scotland and that our nation will merit from his intercession . '' They erected a small petition book at their altar of St. Joseph in the University Catholic Chapel , Turnbull Hall . It is one of the necessary prerequisites for Canonisation in the Roman Catholic Church that there is a Cult of Devotion to the saint .
The Knights distributed prayer cards for Cameron that were written by Jamie McGowan KSC . It reads : O God , who will that every nation and people be converted unto you , you gave us Father Alexander Cameron as a preacher of the gospel , so that Scotland may once again love the Faith entire and true .
May his example of humble ministry in the midst of greater danger stir up in us a zeal for the Gospel . May his capturing , enduring of torture , suffering and death be an example witness to the one true faith , so that by imitating his courage we might surrender to the Divine Will .
Through his intercession , hear our petitions for the conversion of Scotland and for the conversion of our own hearts , so that brought to closer unity with you , we may more faithfully contemplate the truth and show forth the fruits of that contemplation .
Father Alexander , please pray for this particular intention .
Heavenly Father , grant that Father Alexander may be deemed worthy of canonisation , so that we may merit from his intercession , for the glory of your Church , the praise of the Blessed Virgin Mary , and the evangelisation of our nation . Amen.The image of Cameron is from a tapestry commissioned by the Lord Marquess of Bute entitled `` The Prayer for Victory '' by William Skeoch Cummings . The tapestry depicts the Jacobite army kneeling in prayer before the Battle of Prestonpans . Cameron is shown genuflecting in the foreground .

The “ New Capitalists ” is a term used by Stephen Davis , Jon Lukomnik and David Pitt-Watson in a book of the same title . It describes the increasing ownership of companies by collective investment schemes representing millions of savers . The millions of savers are defined as the “ New Capitalists. ” They include individuals with retirement savings , life insurance and other direct and indirect equity investments . Currently they represent between one half and one third of the adult population of most developed countries , and own between 40 % and 80 % of the outstanding shares on the stock markets of the developed world .
The Book
The book describes how the existence of millions of beneficial owners changes the nature of company goals , and the meaning of shareholder value . Though companies may avoid the influence of these new owners , the book argues that a series of forces , collectively known as the civil economy are strengthening markedly the influence of the New Capitalists . The Wall Street Journal , Financial Times , and The Australian Financial Review named The New Capitalists as one of the best business books of 2006 . Fast Company 's review said : `` Combine Adam Smith 's capitalist self-interest in The Wealth of Nations with Peter Drucker , who predicted the rise of institutional investors repping everyday people , to get The New Capitalists , which says , listen to your investors—or pay the consequences '' .

The New Capitalists was preceded by Louis Kelso 's book The New Capitalists in 1961 .

In kinematics , Chasles ' theorem , or Mozzi–Chasles ' theorem , says that the most general rigid body displacement can be produced by a translation along a line ( called its screw axis or Mozzi axis ) followed ( or preceded ) by a rotation about an axis parallel to that line .
History
The proof that a spatial displacement can be decomposed into a rotation and slide around and along a line is attributed to the astronomer and mathematician Giulio Mozzi ( 1763 ) , in fact the screw axis is traditionally called asse di Mozzi in Italy . However , most textbooks refer to a subsequent similar work by Michel Chasles dating from 1830 . Several other contemporaries of M. Chasles obtained the same or similar results around that time , including G. Giorgini , Cauchy , Poinsot , Poisson and Rodrigues . An account of the 1763 proof by Giulio Mozzi and some of its history can be found here .
Proof
Mozzi considers a rigid body undergoing first a rotation about an axis passing through the center of mass and then a translation of displacement D in an arbitrary direction . Any rigid motion can be accomplished in this way due to a theorem by Euler on the existence of an axis of rotation .
The displacement D of the center of mass can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the axis . The perpendicular ( and parallel ) component acts on all points of the rigid body but Mozzi shows that for some points the previous rotation acted exactly with an opposite displacement , so those points are translated parallel to the axis of rotation . These points lie on the Mozzi axis through which the rigid motion can be accomplished through a screw motion .
Another elementary proof of Mozzi–Chasles ' theorem was given by E. T. Whittaker in 1904 . Suppose A is to be transformed into B. Whittaker suggests that line AK be selected parallel to the axis of the given rotation , with K the foot of a perpendicular from B . The appropriate screw displacement is about an axis parallel to AK such that K is moved to B . The method corresponds to Euclidean plane isometry where a composition of rotation and translation can be replaced by rotation about an appropriate center . In Whittaker 's terms , `` A rotation about any axis is equivalent to a rotation through the same angle about any axis parallel to it , together with a simple translation in a direction perpendicular to the axis . ''
Calculation
The calculation of the commuting translation and rotation from a screw motion can be performed using 3DPGA ( ) , the geometric algebra of 3D Euclidean space . It has three Euclidean basis vectors satisfying representing orthogonal planes through the origin , and one Grassmanian basis vector satisfying to represent the plane at infinity . Any plane a distance from the origin can then be formed as a linear combination which is normalized such that . Because reflections can be represented by the plane in which the reflection occurs , the product of two planes and is the bireflection . The result is a rotation around their intersection line , which could also lie on the plane at infinity when the two reflections are parallel , in which case the bireflection is a translation .
A screw motion is the product of four non-collinear reflections , and thus . But according to the Mozzi-Chasles ' theorem a screw motion can be decomposed into a commuting translation where is the axis of translation satisfying , and rotationwhere is the axis of rotation satisfying . The two bivector lines and are orthogonal and commuting . To find and from , we simply write out and consider the result grade-by-grade : Because the quadvector part and , is directly found to beand thusThus , for a given screw motion the commuting translation and rotation can be found using the two formulae above , after which the lines and are found to be proportional to and respectively .

The Krasnodar Trial was a war crimes trial held in front of a Soviet military tribunal in July 1943 in Krasnodar , Soviet Union . All of the defendants Soviet collaborators . The 11 defendants were each accused of treason for collaborating with the German military , police , and SS forces responsible for implementing the occupational policies during the German–Soviet War of 1941–45 . The trial was the first war crimes trial of World War II .
Proceedings
Units of the German Wehrmacht occupied Krasnodar between August 12 , 1942 , and February 12 , 1943 . German forces , including the Einsatzgruppen ( mobile death squads ) , killed approximately 7,000 civilians , including Jews and Communists . Shooting , hanging , burning , and gas vans were used .
The tribunal heard the case against 11 defendants , all Russian and Ukrainian collaborators with the German military , police , and SS forces , who were accused in participating in the murder of 7,000 people . All but one of the defendants had joined Sonderkommando 10a , a subunit of the death squad Einsatzgruppe D. The sole exception was Mikhail Lastovina , a Kulak who had managed to avoid capture during the Dekulakization in the 1930s .
Richard Ruoff , commander of the German 17th Army ; , head of the local Gestapo ; and 13 other SS officials were charged in absentia . The prosecutors emphasized the collective responsibility of the Nazi regime for the crimes , not just the local commanders . All of the accused pleaded guilty and begged the court to spare their lives so they could have a chance to atone . They were each officially pronounced guilty and sentenced on 17 July 1943 .
Eight of the defendants were sentenced to death . The other three were deemed to have had relatively minor roles and were instead ordered to serve 20 years of hard labor in gulags .
The following morning , the condemned defendants were all publicly hanged together in the Krasnodar town square . Approximately 30,000 people , including children , witnessed the executions . Many of them started applauding .
The Soviet press gave wide publicity to the trials . Foreign observers considered the trial to be `` stage-managed '' . British journalist Alexander Werth called the trial `` first-rate hate propaganda '' intended to emphasize the suffering of Soviet civilians under the German occupation . However , nobody doubted the severity or the extent of the crimes themselves , nor the guilt of the defendants . Even in the Soviet Union , some noted that the massacre of the 7,000 civilians in Krasnodar was actually a relatively minor incident in comparison what the Germans and collaborators were doing elsewhere in the country . One major objective of the trial was to deter future collaboration .

In Jewish law , a chazakah ( Hebrew חזקה , `` presumption '' ) is a legal presumption ; it establishes burden of proof . There exist many such presumptions , for example regarding the ownership of property , a person 's personal status ( e.g . whether they are a kohen or Levite ) , and presumptions about human behavior .
Etymology
The Hebrew word is a noun form of the verb , meaning ( in this context ) `` take possession '' .
Overview
The conceptional terminology is `` default status '' , `` agreed properties '' or status quo of an object , land or person − usually when sufficient proof is missing or unavailable . The concept is relevant to many aspects of Talmudic law and Halakha .
There are various ways how something can get the certain state of chazakah :
The previous known state , which may include but is not restricted to :
In a disputed ownership of articles , they would be left in the hands which holds them .
By disputed ownership of land , it would be left in the hands of the last certain owner ( ) . The one who argues that he bought off that piece of land , he must prove it , unless he is already in possession of that land for three years , in which case he is assumed to have the right of possession , by virtue of chazakah .
In Kashruth , every article is in its previous state ( ) , before proven different .
The automatic acquisition of certain usage rights following three years of undisturbed usage ( equivalent to usucaption in Roman law ) . After retaining a property for more than three years , without protest from the previous owner , the party that is retaining the property is assumed to be the owner and the previous known owner assumes the burden of proof if he claims lawful title to the property , that is that he losses the chazaka that a previous known owner has on the property . This is because the fact that he did not protest against the party retaining the property for three years is construed as proof that he relinquished his ownership .
Rules which are based on common belief , since it is true in most cases ( Rov ) . A common example is the belief that most people would n't pay their loans until it is due , so one can not argue before that he already paid without further proof .
A real-estate transfer could be achieved by chazakah , which in this form means that the new owner shows ownership , by doing some kind of construction on the property .
The various kinds of presumptions found scattered throughout the Talmud may be divided as follows : ( 1 ) presumptions of physical conditions ( chazakah di-gufa ) ; ( 2 ) presumptions arising from the fact of possession ( chazakah di-mamona ) ; ( 3 ) presumptions arising from the nature of man or from certain actions and circumstances ( chazakah mi-koach sebara ) .
A presumption was often established through the repetition of an incident a number of times . The most notable instance of this kind is that of the Goring Ox , which was regarded as a vicious animal ( `` mu'ad '' ) after it had committed the offense three times . It was not permitted to marry a woman who had been twice divorced on account of barrenness , for she was presumed to be a barren woman , nor a woman whose two husbands died a natural death , for she was presumed to be a murderous ( `` katlanit '' ) woman . Parents , two of whose children died at circumcision , need not circumcise their other children , for the presumption was established that their children could not stand the pain of circumcision . R. Shimon ben Gamaliel is of the opinion that a presumption may be established only after an incident has occurred three times .
No definite rule was laid down by the Rabbis for guidance in cases where presumptions collide , that is , where each party has some presumption in his favor . For example : A bought an object from B , but had not paid the money ; A desired to return the object to B on the ground that he had found a defect in it which , he claimed , was in it before it was delivered to him . A had the presumption of possession ( of the money ) , B the presumption that the defect was created while the object was in the possession of him on whose premises it was found : the decision was in favor of B . In all such cases , the court had to decide as to which of the presumptions was stronger , and render its decision accordingly .
Even capital punishment could be inflicted on the basis of a chazakah . Man and wife and children living together and treating one another as such are legally considered as one family , and illicit relationships between them would be punished with death on the strength of the presumption , even though the kinship could not be proved by legal evidence .
In regard to the presumption that a man would not offer a false argument when , if he were willing to lie , he could produce a better one , see Migo .
Presumptions are principles formed on a vast amount of judicial experience , by which the court is guided not only in settling the question as to which of the contending parties incurs the burden or responsibility of bringing proof of the assertions made in pleading , but also in rendering a decision in doubtful cases . Although inferior to actual evidence and entirely disregarded when refuted by it , presumption was still a potent factor in Jewish law , and exerted a great influence in the decision of civil as well as capital cases .
Source
According to one opinion in the Talmud , the principle of chazakah has a Biblical source in , which discusses the case of tzaraat in a house . After the priest had examined the plague-sore and found it to be of a certain size , he locked the house for seven days , at the conclusion of which time another examination was made . `` Is it not possible that while he was locking the door the plague-sore diminished in size ? Since , however , Scripture takes no notice of this , it must be because it presumes that the plague remained in the state in which it was first found by the priest ; Scripture teaches us here the principle of presumption '' . However , some of the amoraim rejected this derivation , and instead held that chazakah is a Law given to Moses at Sinai .
Examples
Possession of land
The Talmud counts as a demonstration of ownership of land , a chazakah of uncontested usage of property for three years .
Mere possession was not sufficient to establish a title to real property . The presumption was that `` real property is always in the possession of its owner '' until evidence showed that he had sold it or had given it away . Since , however , people are not careful in preserving documentary evidence for more than three years , the Rabbis ordained that undisturbed possession for three consecutive years was sufficient to establish a claim to real estate . In the case of houses or of other buildings the possessor was required to produce evidence of continuous occupancy , either by himself or by a tenant holding a lease from him , for three full years `` from day to day '' . In the case of fields or gardens , the prevailing opinion was that possession for three successive harvests of the same kind was sufficient , even when the last harvest had been gathered before the expiration of the three years .
`` Possession not based on a valid claim is not regarded '' . If the possessor claimed that he had bought the land of its owner , or that it had been given to him , or that he had inherited it , possession for three years was sufficient . But if he said that he took possession of the property because there was no other claimant , possession even for many years was of no value . And if at any time during the three years the owner protested ( meha'ah ) , either in the presence of the holder or before two witnesses , against the unlawful holding of his property , the fact of possession was of no value in establishing title to the property .
The following persons could not acquire property by usucaption : ( 1 ) a building contractor ; ( 2 ) a partner ; ( 3 ) a steward ; ( 4 ) a husband his wife 's in which he had the right of usufruct ; ( 5 ) a father his son 's , or ( 6 ) a son his father 's ; ( 7 ) a guardian his ward 's ; ( 8 ) a minor ; ( 9 ) an idiot ; ( 10 ) a deaf-mute ( whose property , in turn , could not be acquired by others ) ; ( 11 ) a robber . No argument of possession could be advanced to establish a title to the property of a fugitive who had fled in fear of his life , or to property belonging to a synagogue , or to communal charitable institutions .
Possession of movable property
With regard to movable property , the presumption was that it belonged to the possessor unless it was conclusively proved that he held it under false pretenses . Even if the owner brought evidence that the object belonged to him , the possessor was believed if he claimed that he had bought it or that he had received it as a gift , and he needed only to take the rabbinical oath ( hesset ) to establish his claim . Talmudic law distinguished , however , between objects that people are accustomed to lending or hire and objects that people are not accustomed to lend or hire ; the mere claim of possession , even for many years , was not sufficient to establish a title to objects of the former class , and the owner could at any time establish a claim by producing witnesses to testify that they belonged to him ; but the latter class of objects could be acquired by mere possession .
The maxim that anything that is in a man 's possession is his did not apply to a mechanic whose occupation it was to repair the objects in question . Even if he had had an object in his possession for a long time , the owner could claim it on the ground that he had given it to him for repair .
Small cattle of the kind that are left in the open and allowed to move from place to place were excluded from the principle governing title by possession in movable property , for the supposition was that they had wandered onto other premises without the knowledge of their owner . There is a difference of opinion among the later authorities as to whether three years ' possession was sufficient to establish the right of property in them . Large cattle of the kind that are delivered to a shepherd and are always under his control , or infant slaves that are unable to walk , were treated like other movable property , while adult slaves were considered in the same category as immovable property , and a continuous possession of three years was sufficient to establish title to them .
Easements
The Talmudic law applies the principle of chazakah also to easements or servitudes consisting in the right or privilege of using another 's land without compensation . For example , if one causes one of the beams of his house to protrude into the premises of his neighbor , and the neighbor does not object immediately , the owner is regarded as having a chazakah in the servitude of his neighbor 's premises as regards the beam . There are three distinct opinions among the later authorities regarding the nature of this ḥazaḳah . Some ( the Geonim and Maimonides ) are of the opinion that the chazakah of easement need not be accompanied by a real claim , nor need it last for three successive years as is required with movable property . Others ( Rabbeinu Tam , Rabbeinu Yonah , Shlomo ibn Aderet ) hold that this case is in all respects similar to the case of immovable property , needing both a real claim and three years ' possession . Others , again , adopt the compromise of Rashbam , who regards easements as immovable property in so far as they require a real claim to title , but with the difference that they do not require three years ' possession to establish the right .
Personal status
The `` status quo kohen '' ( ) is a rabbinic title which legitimates Kohen status to a Jewish Kohen who—amongst multiple criteria—exhibits conduct exemplary of and is recognized by his peers and community as such .
The tannaic rabbi Jose ben Halafta praised the soundness of this Chazakah by labeling it a basis for the entire Halachic concept of chazakah . It is based on this chazakah that all poskim agree—unanimously—to forbid the status quo Kohen from marrying a divorcee .
Once a Kohen is established as a Kohein Muchzak it is a mitzvah to sanctify him and assist him in abstaining from the restriction that apply to a Kohen ( for example , Prohibition of Kohen defilement by the dead ) .
The chazakah of the Kohen is deemed valid and in good standing unless a valid objection to his lineage is made before a Beit-Din .
Various other presumptions
Other presumptions in halacha include :
All flesh is presumed to have been cut from a living animal ( `` ever min ha-ḥay '' ) and hence to be forbidden food until it has been determined that proper shechita was performed on the animal ; hence an examination of the organs to be severed at slaughtering is necessary . After it is slaughtered it is presumed to be kosher until it is demonstrated how it became forbidden ; hence no examination of the animal is necessary , except of those organs ( such as the lungs ) which contract a disease most readily .
In cases involving money , the prevailing principle is אוקי ממונא בחזקת מריה ( `` leave the money in the possession of its master '' ) . Hence the general principle in Jewish law , that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff . This principle has far-reaching results . It is followed not only where there is insufficient evidence to establish the truth , but also where there is contradictory evidence . If after a case has been decided in accordance with a presumption the plaintiff violently takes the object of contention from the defendant so that the presumption shall favor him , it is doubtful whether the former presumption becomes thus annihilated ; and the later authorities differ as to which presumption to follow in such a case .
Many Talmudic presumptions are based on analysis of human nature . These include :
No woman would have the audacity to declare in her husband 's presence that she was divorced from him , if she were not .
No man is presumed to have paid his debt before it was due .
No one would be so shameless as to deny a debt in the presence of his creditor .
A shaliah is presumed to fulfill his commission .
The master is presumed to have paid the day-laborer at the end of his day 's work .
No man permits himself to be robbed without a struggle .
A scholar would not issue any deed unless it had been correctly executed .
A house is presumed to have been examined for chametz on the fourteenth of Nisan , and one hiring a house on that day need not examine it again .

William Aloysius Brady ( June 19 , 1863 – January 6 , 1950 ) was an American theater actor , producer , and sports promoter .
Biography
Brady was born to a newspaperman in 1863 . His father kidnapped him from San Francisco and brought him to New York City , where his father worked as a writer while William was forced to sell newspapers on street corners . Upon his father 's death when William was 15 , he hitchhiked his way back to San Francisco .
He made his start onstage in San Francisco with a company headed by Joseph R. Grismer and Phoebe Davies shortly after his return . As a callboy in The White Slave by Bartley Campbell , he filled in a role for an ill actor , and started his career .
After a failed attempt to produce a version of She by H. Rider Haggard , he was able to secure the rights to After Dark , successfully bringing the play to New York . While Brady was sued for his efforts , as Augustin Daly claimed plagiarism , Brady was able to make enough money to continue with his theater ventures .
He inadvertently became a boxing promoter during this time . He cast James J. Jeffries in After Dark , and later introduced the man into the boxing circuit , where Jeffries would eventually become the undisputed heavyweight champion . Brady would be the only person to manage two undisputed heavyweight champions , in Jeffries and James J. Corbett .
Brady produced The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight in 1897 . Although Corbett ultimately lost , the match ran for over an hour and a half , and the documentary lasted that long , the longest film ever released at the time . In 1898 , Brady and Grismer produced the hugely successful Charlotte Blair Parker play , Way Down East . The two remained partners until Grismer 's retirement sometime around 1909 .
Other clients
In late 1896 Brady watched as young bicycle racer Major Taylor won his first professional races , a half-mile exhibition and a six-day race at Madison Square Garden . Brady arranged to promote Taylor , who was a Black athlete facing serious obstacles in a racist time . Brady was known for using his tenacity and innovation to secure races for Taylor . For example , when southern cycling officials sought to ban Taylor from national competition , Brady built his own racetrack and started his own cycle race series for Taylor .
Another Brady client was Black polar explorer Matthew Henson . Henson , denied the credit given to white Commander Peary , was financially destitute and physically unable to work , when Brady arranged a national lecture tour for him . In a 1930 interview , a grateful Henson credited Brady for `` taking care of '' objections by Commander Peary ; he said that Brady accepted no promoter 's fee for the tour beyond `` twenty-five dollars for cigar money . ''
Theater
Brady ran a successful theatre operation for thirty years , having met actresses like Grace George ( whom he later married ) and having , at one point , hired famous humorist Robert Benchley to complete ad copy for him . Brady 's success continued until the Stock Market Crash of 1929 , which wiped out his entire savings . He was able to secure the funds to produce Street Scene , which was written by Elmer Rice , won the Pulitzer Prize , and netted Brady roughly a half a million dollars . His total theatrical output included over 260 plays , including a version of Uncle Tom 's Cabin that was later used as images for a book in 1904 , and a number of movies before his death .
Personal life
His first wife was Rose Marie Rene ( died 1896 ) . Their daughter was actress Mary Rose Brady , who used stage name of Alice Brady .
His second wife was the well known Broadway actress Grace George . They were married from 1899 until his death in 1950 . They had a son , William A. Brady , Jr. ( 1900–1935 ) who married the actress Katherine Alexander .
Death
William A. Brady died at age 86 of a heart ailment . He is interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow , New York .
Legacy
He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998 .

Mathon ( Romansh : Maton ) is a former municipality in the Viamala Region in the Swiss canton of Graubünden . On 1 January 2021 the former municipalities of Casti-Wergenstein , Donat , Lohn and Mathon merged to form the new municipality of Muntogna da Schons .
History
Mathon is first mentioned about 840 as in Mentaune .
Geography
Mathon had an area , , of . Of this area , 66.3 % is used for agricultural purposes , while 10 % is forested . Of the rest of the land , 1.4 % is settled ( buildings or roads ) and the remainder ( 22.3 % ) is non-productive ( rivers , glaciers or mountains ) .
Before 2017 , the former municipality was located in the Schams sub-district , of the Hinterrhein district , after 2017 it was part of the Viamala Region . The village is a haufendorf ( an irregular , unplanned and quite closely packed village , built around a central square ) at an elevation of in the center of the upper Schamserberg region .
Demographics
Mathon had a population ( as of 2019 ) of 53 . Over the last 10 years the population has decreased at a rate of 14.1 % .
, the gender distribution of the population was 56.4 % male and 43.6 % female . The age distribution , , in Mathon is ; 12 people or 23.1 % of the population are between 0 and 9 years old . 6 people or 11.5 % are 10 to 14 , and 1 person or 1.9 % is 15 to 19 .

BabelCon was a science fiction and multigenre convention , held in Baton Rouge , Louisiana . Established in 2006 , the convention took place at the Cook Hotel and Lod & Carole Cook Alumni Center on the campus of Louisiana State University . Formerly a project of the non-profit Science & Engineering Education Foundation ( SEEF ) , it was last managed by Babelcon LLC . After a split between the organizers in late 2010 , the upcoming convention was postponed then ultimately cancelled .
This convention was typically a three-day event comprising panels , seminars , demonstrations , and workshops . Guests sometimes include science fiction and fantasy authors , artists , and celebrities from genre television series and movies . BabelCon was named for the site of a diplomatic conference in the classic Star Trek episode `` Journey to Babel '' .
History
BabelCon was launched in 2006 , as a project of a local science fiction and gaming group , Star One Delta ( SOD ) . The organizers were inspired to create BabelCon after Crescent City Con in New Orleans ended a 20-year run in 2005 and , in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , efforts to launch a new convention in New Orleans were stalled . In 2008 , BabelCon was legally separated from Star One Delta , and a new non-profit organization , the Science & Engineering Education Foundation ( SEEF ) , was created to run the convention .
Conventions

BabelCon 4.5 was held on March 19–21 , 2010 , at the Cook Hotel in Baton Rouge , Louisiana . Originally listed as `` BabelCon 2010 - the Year We Make Contact '' it was changed to a `` mini-con '' and given the designation of `` 4.5 '' . The convention aimed at `` a cozy con atmosphere '' relying on panels rather than celebrity guests for entertainment . Scaled back due to economic pressures from the late-2000s recession , the event featured Sal Lizard , the president of Starfleet International , as its headline guest . As in previous conventions local authors also gave talks and spoke with guests .
Cancelled events
The next BabelCon event was originally scheduled to be held March 25–27 , 2011 , but was postponed . After a split in convention management in late 2010 , many of the original BabelCon staff and organizers planned their own event after the BabelCon name was registered with the Louisiana Secretary of State by another individual . This event , the Louisiana Science Fiction and Costuming Festival , was first held March 25–27 , 2011 .
In April 2012 , new management acquired the assets of Babelcon LLC to settle existing debts and allow the event to move forward . Due to funding issues and another change in management , Babelcon was tentatively rescheduled for mid-October 2012 . The convention was eventually cancelled and the organization dispersed .

History
Before the Second World War a copra plantation was built at Suavanau Point by Burns , Philp & Company Limited , known as the Suavanau Plantation .

It was also used as an emergency landing and ditching area for aircraft damaged during the Battle of Guadalcanal . The base was defended by 3,100 troops of the 7th Combined Special Naval Landing Force and III Battalion , 23rd Infantry Regiment , 6th Division . The base was bombed by U.S. forces from August 1942 to August 1943 . In the following month , the Japanese evacuated the base . Large bomb craters are still visible .

The Somali Region ( , , ) , also known as Soomaali Galbeed ( Western Somalia ) and officially the Somali Regional State , is a regional state in eastern Ethiopia . Its territory is the largest after Oromia Region . The regional state borders the Ethiopian regions of Afar and Oromia and the chartered city Dire Dawa ( Dire Dhawa ) to the west , as well as Djibouti to the north , Somaliland to the northeast , Somalia to the south ; and Kenya to the southwest .
Jijiga is the capital of the Somali Region . The capital was formerly Gode , until Jijiga became the capital in 1995 on account of political considerations .
The Somali regional government is composed of the executive branch , led by the President ; the legislative branch , which comprises the State Council ; and the judicial branch , which is led by the State Supreme Court .
Overview
The Somali Region formed a large part of the pre-1995 province of Hararghe . The population is predominantly Somali , and there have been attempts to incorporate the area into a Greater Somalia . In the 1970s , Somalia , supported by the United States , invaded Ethiopia , igniting the Ogaden War , which Somalia lost due to timely military intervention from the Soviet Union and its ally Cuba . Despite this defeat , local groups still tried either to become part of Somalia or independent .
The 2007 Abole oil field raid , in which 72 Chinese and Ethiopian oilfield workers were killed , has led to a series of military reprisals against the rebel group ONLF Ogaden National Liberation Front .
Until its first-ever district elections in February 2004 , Zonal and woreda administrators and village chairmen were appointed by the Regional government . Senior politicians at the Regional level nominated their clients to the local government positions . In the 2004 local elections , each woreda elected a council including a spokesman , vice-spokesman , administrator , and vice-administrator . These councils have the responsibility of managing budgets and development activities within their respective districts .

Temsirolimus , sold under the brand name Torisel , is an intravenous drug for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , developed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in May 2007 , and was also approved by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) in November 2007 . It is a derivative and prodrug of sirolimus .
Mechanism of action
Temsirolimus is a specific inhibitor of mTOR and interferes with the synthesis of proteins that regulate proliferation , growth , and survival of tumor cells . Though temsirolimus shows activity on its own , it is also known to be converted to sirolimus ( rapamycin ) in vivo ; therefore , its activity may be more attributed to its metabolite rather than the prodrug itself ( despite claims to the contrary by the manufacturer ) . Treatment with temsirolimus leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase , and also inhibits tumor angiogenesis by reducing synthesis of VEGF .
mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) is a kinase enzyme inside the cell that collects and interprets the numerous and varied growth and survival signals received by tumor cells . When the kinase activity of mTOR is activated , its downstream effectors , the synthesis of cell cycle proteins such as cyclin D and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a ( HIF-1a ) are increased . HIF-1a then stimulates VEGF . Whether or not mTOR kinase is activated , determines whether the tumor cell produces key proteins needed for proliferation , growth , survival , and angiogenesis .
mTOR is activated in tumor cells by various mechanisms including growth factor surface receptor tyrosine kinases , oncogenes , and loss of tumor suppressor genes . These activating factors are known to be important for malignant transformation and progression . mTOR is particularly important in the biology of renal cancer ( RCC ) owing to its function in regulating HIF-1a levels . Mutation or loss of the von Hippel Lindau tumor-suppressor gene is common in RCC and is manifested by reduced degradation of HIF-1a . In RCC tumors , activated mTOR further exacerbates accumulation of HIF-1a by increasing synthesis of this transcription factor and its angiogenic target gene products .
Efficacy
In an international three-arm phase III study with 626 previously untreated , poor-prognosis patients , temsirolimus , interferon-α and the combination of both agents was compared . Median overall survival improved significantly in the temsirolimus group ( 10.9 months ) compared with interferon-α group ( 7.3 months ) and the combination group ( 8.4 months ) . Further studies are needed to determine the role of temsirolimus in the first-line treatment of patients with a more favorable prognosis , how it can be combined with other targeted agents and as sequential therapy with sunitinib or sorafenib .
Adverse reactions
The toxicity profile is based on what was found in the phase III trial .
adverse reaction
fatigue
skin rash
mucositis
hematologic abnormalities
hemoglobin decreased
lymphocytes decreased
laboratory abnormalities
triglycerides increased
glucose increased
phosphorus decreased
Temsirolimus has been generally well tolerated in clinical settings by patients with advanced RCC .
In patients with RCC , the adverse effect profile of temsirolimus is primarily metabolic in nature , with minimal impact on QoL compared with the commonly seen side-effects with oral multikinase inhibitors . Temsirolimus ' high level of specificity for mTOR likely contributes to the tolerability of temsirolimus . However , temsirolimus increases mortality in cancer patients .
Lung toxicity
Temsirolimus is associated with lung toxicity , and the risk of developing this complication may be increased among subjects with abnormal pre-treatment pulmonary functions or history of lung disease . The risk of interstitial lung disease is increased with temsirolimus doses greater than 25 mg , symptoms of which may include dry cough , fever , eosinophilia , chest pain , and dyspnea on exertion . Toxicity usually occurred early ( within days to weeks ) or late ( months to years ) after treatment .
Dosing
Although infusion reactions can occur while temsirolimus is being administered , most hypersensitivity reactions occurring on the same day as temsirolimus administration were not severe . Antihistamine pretreatment ( e.g . 25–50 mg diphenhydramine , 30 minutes prior to administration ) is recommended to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction .

Salvatore Greco ( 1927–1999 ) was a prominent member of the Greco clan of the Sicilian Mafia , brother of well known Mafia boss Michele Greco . He was nicknamed Il Senatore ( The Senator ) for his ability to hold political connections .
Biography
Salvatore Greco 's nickname was `` The Senator '' for his political connections . He was the kingmaker of Christian Democrat politicians such as Giovanni Gioia , Vito Ciancimino and Giuseppe Insalaco . Many of those notables were invited by `` The Pope '' and `` The Senator '' to wine and dine and take part in hunting parties at his estate La Favarella . The estate was also used as a refuge for mafiosi on the run , and to set up a heroin laboratory . The Senator was among those who put pressure on Salvo Lima and other politicians to nullify the Maxi Trial , and eventually informed the rest of the Mafiosi that the state was not going to withdraw the Trial .
Revelations by pentiti and police investigations soon made it clear that Salvatore Greco was one of the key figures in Cosa Nostra 's administration and an arrest warrant against him was issued in 1982 , but he managed to remain a fugitive until his capture almost ten years later in 1991 . He was arrested when he entered a hospital because he feared he was dying of a heart attack , although this was not the case .
By the time he was captured he was no longer an important figure within Cosa Nostra as the Greco family had been in decline for several years . He did not become a pentito and eventually died in a prison 's hospital because of cancer .

Wilmer López Arguedas ( born 3 August 1971 ) is a retired Costa Rican footballer .
He played for Alajuelense and is one of the club 's biggest idols of all time .
Club career
López made his debut in the Costa Rican Primera División on 5 January 1992 playing with Carmelita against ASODELI also scoring his first league goal in that match . The following next season , he was bought by Alajuelense , becoming one of the most beloved players and a crowd favorite , playing 13 seasons and winning 7 Costa Rican Championships , 3 Copa Interclubes UNCAF championships and 1 CONCACAF Champions ' Cup , being part of the team that won 4 national championships in a row ( 1999–2000–2002–2003 ) . He was named the best player of the national tournament for two seasons in a row before moving to Deportes Tolima in Colombia , whom he left very soon due to contractual problems , and again during another season , when he returned to Costa Rica . He also played the Copa Merconorte and the Copa Sudamericana .
Nicknamed El Pato ( The Duck ) , the midfielder also played for Pérez Zeledón . He is also known as El Ingeniero ( The Engineer ) due to his amazing ability to create plays with short and long passes and also for his fast thinking that made him one of the best midfielders in the region during the '90s and the early 2000s . After 2003 , he suffered multiple injuries that made him lose a lot of games and he never regained his earlier abilities as a player , although he was still loved by the crowd and gave a few good games along the road to the end of the 2007 season when his contract expired and the team decided not to hire him again . It was a very sad day for all the Alajuelense 's fans . Every time Pérez Zeledón played at the Alejandro Morera Soto stadium , his former fans waited for him singing and clapping every time he touched the ball , letting him know he still was in their hearts . López totalled 478 league matches and 80 goals for Liga . He also played 92 international club games for them . He played 550 league games in total .
International career

Village of the Giants is a 1965 American teensploitation comedy science fiction film produced , directed and written by Bert I. Gordon . Based loosely on H. G. Wells 's 1904 book The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth , it contains elements of the beach party film genre . The story concerns a gang of rebellious youngsters who gain access to a chemical substance called `` Goo '' , which causes living things to grow to gigantic proportions . The cast is composed almost entirely of teenaged actors and young adults portraying teenagers . Also making musical guest appearances are The Beau Brummels , Freddy Cannon , and Mike Clifford .
Plot
Village of the Giants takes place in fictional Hainesville , California . After crashing their car into a roadblock during a rainstorm , a group of partying , big-city teenagers ( Fred , Pete , Rick , Harry , and their girlfriends Merrie , Elsa , Georgette and Jean ) first indulge in a vigorous , playful mud-wrestling fight , then hike their way into town . Fred remembers meeting a girl from Hainesville named Nancy , and they decide to look her up .
Nancy , meanwhile , is with her boyfriend Mike , while her younger brother `` Genius '' plays with his chemistry set in the basement . Genius accidentally creates a substance he names `` Goo '' , that , when consumed , causes animals , including a dog and a pair of ducks , to grow to gigantic size .
The out-of-town teens break into the local theater and clean up from the rain , then go to a nearby club where The Beau Brummels are performing . Shortly , the giant ducks turn up , followed by Mike and Nancy . Everyone is astounded by the size of the ducks , wondering how they got so big . Mike explains that it 's a secret , but following a suggestion made by their friends Horsey and Red , they host a picnic in the town square the next day , roasting the ducks and feeding everybody . Freddy Cannon is featured singing a song in this scene .
Fred and his friends also see potential in whatever made the ducks grow , but their minds are purely on profit . They scheme to learn the secret , and are ultimately successful , escaping with a sample . Back at the theater , the gang argues over what to do with the Goo , now that they have it . Feeling peer pressure , Fred slices up the Goo , giving everyone a piece each , which they consume a moment later . As the Goo takes effect , they each grow to over thirty feet ( 9 m ) tall , ripping right out of their clothes . At first everyone is shocked and regretful , but realizing their newfound power at their new size , the gang decide to take over the town .
Overnight , the giants decide to isolate Hainesville from the rest of the world . They rip out the telephone lines , overturn broadcasting antennas , and block the remaining roads out of town . When the sheriff and Mike arrive to deal with them , they discover that the giants have no plans to leave – and are literally holding the sheriff 's daughter , as `` insurance '' that they wo n't have any trouble . While the town 's adults seem paralyzed , the teens decide to fight back . An attempt to capture Fred results in Nancy being taken hostage .
Meanwhile , Genius continues to work , trying to produce more Goo . Mike asks Genius to forget the Goo for a while and make them a supply of ether – having noticed the giants only leave one guard on the hostages . Mike and Horsey plot to subdue that guard , recover the guns , and free Nancy and the sheriff 's daughter .
Having led the giants outside the theater , Mike plays David to Fred 's Goliath , to distract them while Horsey and the others effect the rescue . Genius ' newest attempt at Goo results in an antidote . He rides over to the square on a bicycle with a pail full of the fuming antidote . As the giants breathe in the fumes , they all return to normal . Mike cold-cocks the surprised Fred , and promptly runs him and his friends , looking silly in their now-oversized clothes , out of town .
However , as Fred and the others reach their car , they meet a travelling band of little people who have ( the torn-out telephone lines , overturned broadcasting antennas , and blocked roads notwithstanding ) heard about the `` goo '' and its effects , and are heading into the town to investigate the substance .

Music
The film 's instrumental theme song , by composer and arranger Jack Nitzsche , was originally released as `` The Last Race '' on Reprise Records , months before the movie appeared , and which would later be used as the main title music for Death Proof , Quentin Tarantino 's portion of the film Grindhouse , in 2007 .
The Beau Brummels , singers Freddy Cannon and Mike Clifford all make appearances . Cannon enjoyed a string of hits during the 1960s , including `` Palisades Park '' and `` Tallahassee Lassie '' , and performs `` Little Bitty Corrine '' in his signature style ( wearing a cardigan sweater in the summertime ) , while Mike Clifford ( veteran of The Ed Sullivan Show , and later an actor ) croons the movie 's obligatory slow song , `` Marianne '' . Clifford is also credited with another song , `` Nothing can Stand in my Way '' , but this does not appear in the film . There was no official soundtrack release for this movie .
Production notes
Director
The film 's director , Bert I. Gordon , was involved with many size-themed movies in his career ( perhaps coincidentally , his initials are `` BIG '' ) . Besides Village , these include : King Dinosaur ( 1955 ) , Beginning of the End ( 1957 ) , The Cyclops ( 1957 ) , The Amazing Colossal Man ( 1957 ) , Attack of the Puppet People ( 1958 ) , War of the Colossal Beast ( 1958 ) , Earth vs. the Spider ( 1958 ) , and The Food of the Gods ( 1976 ) .
The film was made by Gordon 's newly formed Berkeley Productions . It was to be the first of a three-year 12-picture deal between Berkeley and Joseph E. Levine 's Embassy Productions . Some of these were to be for TV , others for theaters . The next two planned films were titled The Creatures of Dr. Freak and Horror House , but neither of these were made .
Casting
The cast features a number of children of established Hollywood actors : Beau Bridges ( son of Lloyd Bridges ) , Ron Howard ( son of Rance Howard ) , Tisha Sterling ( daughter of Robert Sterling and Ann Sothern ) , Toni Basil ( daughter of Louis Basil ) and Tim Rooney ( son of Mickey Rooney ) .
Debi Storm completed her role as the sheriff 's daughter in just three days . Vicki London , who played Georgette , is absent from the screen for most of the giant scenes in the film . Robert Random and Joy Harmon each also appeared in episodes of Gidget , which debuted in the fall of 1965 .
The cat appearing in this film was named Orangey ( later renamed Minerva ) , and Village of the Giants was the second time he played the role of a cat larger than a human , the first being Scott Carey 's ( actor Grant Williams ) pet in The Incredible Shrinking Man ( 1957 ) . His most famous roles were as `` Rhubarb '' in the film Rhubarb ( 1951 ) and the cat in Breakfast at Tiffany 's ( 1961 ) .
Tommy Kirk made the film after his arrest for drug possession . He later said he was n't `` too embarrassed '' about the film . `` It 's kind of a crazy movie but the production values are pretty good and it sort of holds together . I could have done without the dancing ducks , though . ''
Beau Bridges has one of his earliest roles as the unofficial leader of the teenagers who turn into giants . He later recalled :
When I did it , I was about 18 or 19 , and I took it all quite seriously . I thought it was my chance to really be a spokesperson for my generation , you know ? I had that long speech when I 'm in the theater , and I 've eaten this goo ... I address the police chief of the town about the young people , the teenagers , that he says are losing control , and I speak out about freedom and everything . I took it so seriously , and I think I even rewrote my lines . Now , though , it 's , uh , a little embarrassing .
Original script
Alan Caillou 's original script called for the sheriff 's deputy ( played by Rance Howard ) to be stepped on by the giants . If the scene was ever filmed , it did not make the final edit , and no known footage of it exists .
Locations and props
Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed on the Columbia Pictures backlot , where portions of I Dream of Jeannie and The Partridge Family were also made . The lot is now owned by Warner Brothers . The scene where the giants convene outside the Hainesville theater was shot at the Courthouse Square lot at Universal Studios , where Back to the Future and Gremlins were later made .
The film 's goo was a simple mixture of angel food cake mix with pink-colored dye . The beer the `` teenagers '' are drinking at the beginning of the film is Blatz , and the 'Teen magazine Joy Harmon reads during one part of the film is an actual issue , from the summer of 1965 . The tiny yellow custom hotrod ( with the surfboard ) that is used in the street scene to tie up Beau Bridges ' feet is The Surfite , designed by Ed `` Big Daddy '' Roth .
Release and reception
The low-budget film had limited commercial success at the time of its release , for it was distributed mainly to drive-in theaters as part of double features . In 1965 it did draw media attraction and audiences with some of its special effects and lightly provocative sex appeal , including scenes with implied nudity . Margaret Hartford of the Los Angeles Times , for example , alludes to those elements in her review at the time . The `` best things '' about the film , she writes , are the `` special effects and photographic trickery '' , along with `` those endless views of healthy young torsos gyrating to the rhythms of the Beau Brummells or Freddy Cannon '' . Hartford adds , `` Alan Caillou 's script keeps the action fast and the dancing swinging . ''
Mystery Science Theater 3000
On January 11 , 1994 , an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 ( episode 523 ) featuring Village of the Giants premiered on Comedy Central . The episode was dedicated in memoriam to the recently deceased Frank Zappa and featured `` Let Me Be Frank about Frank '' , an original song ostensibly about TV 's Frank , the sidekick to the show 's mad scientist , Dr. Clayton Forrester . TV 's Frank was fired during the episode , replaced with recurring character Torgo ( from Manos : The Hands of Fate ) , and rehired after he convinced Torgo to do something awful to Dr. Forrester off-camera .
The episode is not a favorite of fans ; it missed the Top 100 list of episodes voted upon by MST3K Season 11 Kickstarter backers . Writer Jim Vogel has a much more positive evaluation of the episode , rating Village of the Giants # 35 ( out of 191 total MST3K episodes ) . `` It 's a supremely cheesy , very watchable slice of '60s teen culture , crossed with some very light science fiction '' , Vogel claims .
The MST3K version of Village of the Giants was included as part of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 , Volume 27 DVD collection , released by Shout ! Factory on July 23 , 2013 . The other episodes in the four-disc set include The Slime People ( episode # 108 ) , Rocket Attack U.S.A. ( episode # 205 ) , and The Deadly Mantis ( episode # 804 ) .

Table I give an overview of the periods and dates ascribed to the various books of the Bible . Tables II , III and IV outline the conclusions of the majority of contemporary scholars on the composition of the Hebrew Bible and the Protestant Old Testament , the deuterocanonical works ( also called the Apocrypha ) , and the New Testament . Some books are considered pseudepigrapha - the person traditionally cited as the author is not the person who actually wrote the text ; for some books there appear to have been multiple authors .
Table I : Chronological overview ( Hebrew Bible / Old Testament )
This table summarises the chronology of the Hebrew Bible , which has the same books as the Protestant Old Testament ; these date from between the 8th and 2nd centuries BCE . The additional books in the Catholic and Orthodox bibles can be found in the table on the deuterocanonical works , and date from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE ( see Table III ) ; the New Testament writings from the 1st and 2nd centuries CE ( see Table IV ) . Dates are approximate , and represent the opinions of the majority of current biblical scholars .
Table II : Hebrew Bible / Protestant Old Testament
The Hebrew Bible , or Tanakh , is the collection of scriptures making up the Bible used by Judaism ; the same books , in a slightly different order , also make up the Protestant version of the Old Testament . The order used here follows the divisions used in Jewish Bibles .
Table III : Deuterocanonical Old Testament
The deuterocanonical books are works included in Catholic and Orthodox but not in Jewish and Protestant Bibles .

Riberalta is a town in the Beni Department in northern Bolivia , situated where the Madre de Dios River joins the Beni River . Riberalta is on the south ( south east ) bank of the Beni River .
As the capital of the province of Vaca Diez , the city has maintained its charm even after the Brazilian nut trade sparked recent development . Bolivia is the dominant producer of the nuts , in the period 2017/2018 , the country accounted for 78 % of production . Peru producers 16 % while Brazil produces a mere 2 % . City life in Riberalta Municipality is punctuated by nature thanks to its location on the banks of the Beni and Madre de Dios rivers and its proximity to the Amazon rainforest . Home to the Bolivian Navy flotilla and the 1st Naval District , the city is also called the Bolivian capital of the Amazon .
The population was 99,070 in 2018 .
History
Riberalta was originally inhabited by the Chácobo and Pacahuara natives who called it “ Pamahuayá ” , which means “ place of the fruits ” . Bolivian anthropologist Wigberto Rivero determined that the area was once populated by indigenous groups of the Pano family ; which belong to the native Pacahuara , Chacobos , Caripunas , Sinabos and Perintintin . These same people lived for thousands of years resisting attacks from the Incan Empire and western settlers .
Riberalta 's current name comes from the union of two words in Spanish : “ ribera alta ” ( “ high bank ” in English . ) The city was founded on February 3 , 1894 with approximately 2,500 inhabitants established in a red canyon in Northern Bolivia .
It is also known as the city of four names : Barranca Colorada ( Red Canyon ) , La Cruz ( The Cross ) , Ribera-Alta ( High Bank ) , and Riberalta . Starting in the middle of the 19th century , solo explorers and navigators of the Bolivian Northwest penetrated the solitary jungle ; They founded barracks more than thirty meters high , erected and blessed by the convergence of two colossal rivers , which turned the municipality into the economic center of the north of the country .
On October 8 , 1880 , Don Edwin Heath named the city Barranca Colorada . A few years later Frederico Bodo Claussen , manager of House Braillard de Reyes , was informed of the barracks and sent a German subject with resources to install a commercial factory there . Afterwards , it received the name La Cruz on May 3 , 1884 when Don Maximo Henicke surveyed a small home built two years earlier in 1882 by Placido Mendez . A little over a year later , on July 7 of 1885 , Bodo Claussen baptized the city under the name Ribera-Alta , which later was combined into Riberalta . Nine years later , on February 3 of 1894 , Riberalta was founded with an official act under the name Villa Riberalta , after having already existed for twelve years . It was founded by a National Delegate of the Colonies , Lysimachus Gutiérrez , who did so under the orders of President Mariano Baptista and in honor of the birth of the Mcal . Antonio Jose de Sucre .
Climate
Riberalta belongs to a transition zone between the tropical savanna climate of the Llanos de Moxos and the tropical monsoon climate of the southwestern amazon rainforest . Precipitation is moderately high , but divided starkly between seasons . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system , Riberalta has a tropical savanna climate , abbreviated `` Aw '' on climate maps , with a pronounced wet and dry season .
Transportation
Riberalta is connected to Cobija by bus and to the rest of Bolivia through the Capitán Av . Selin Zeitun Lopez Airport ( RIB ) , Northern Bolivia .

Woolsey 's Flat was a historic mining town located on the San Juan Ridge , located about 17 miles northeast of Nevada City and about 3 miles northeast of North Bloomfield . The town was about 1 mile south of the Middle Yuba at an elevation of about 4200 ft. To the east lay the mining towns of Moore 's Flat and Orleans Flat , each about I mile apart . All three were settled in 1851 and their histories frequently intertwine . Collectively , they are sometimes referred to as `` The Flats . All three were part of Eureka Township .
An early pioneer describes the physical relation of the three Flats as follows :
`` Moore 's Flat , Orleans Flat and Woolsey 's Flat are all similarly situated on different points of the mountain , on the north side of the ridge between the South and Middle Yuba River , and all at about the same altitude . A very deep canyon lies between each of them , but a good mountain road was built around the head of each canyon , connecting the towns . ''
EARLY HISTORY
Woolsey 's Flat was founded in 1851 , and named after its founder James Woolsey . It lies on a part of the auriferous ( gold bearing ) channel which runs the length of the San Juan Ridge .
Woolsey 's Flat flourished in the 1850s . It had hotels , saloons , stores and a stable . Advertisements for balls and other entertainments appear regularly . The town benefited from several toll roads . It was served daily first by Langton 's Pioneer Express and then by the Gregory & English Stage and Express Line , which ran between Nevada City and Eureka , now Graniteville . In 1856 , a resident reported a population of 500 and 100 houses . In the 1856 presidential election , a total of 214 votes were cast , of which 112 were for Buchanan , 104 for Fillmore and 4 for Fremont . By the 1860 election , the number of presidential votes had fallen to 108 , of which Lincoln received 27 and Douglas 41 .
MINING
Mining began with surface mining which soon played out . With the arrival of ditch water in 1853 , hydraulic mining took off . The first ditch , the Poorman 's Creek Ditch was commenced in 1853 by Berryman and others , running from Poorman 's Creek to Orleans Flat . The Miners ' Ditch , bringing water from the Middle Yuba , was constructed in 1855 . Eventually , these ditches hooked up with the Eureka Lake Water Co. ditch bringing water from the High Sierra . The mines were deemed to be very rich but difficult to mine . Principal mines included the Boston , X IX and the Blue Ravine .
Jim Woolsey , the town 's founder , was a successful miner . Contemporary accounts credit him with finding a gold nugget weighing 154 ounces valued then at $ 2000 , another weighing 103 ounces and a boulder containing 97 ounces of gold . Nevertheless , by 1857 , Woolsey advertised that `` having determined to remove to the Atlantic States , '' his mining claims were for sale .
In the 1860s , mining and the town experienced a period of decline . Part of the problem was a shortage of water on that part of the Ridge , presumably from drought , in 1864 . One newspaper reported that at Woolsey 's Flat `` there is not sufficient water to supply one fourth of the demand '' leaving the town `` nearly depopulated . '' When water reappeared , there arose a dispute between the miners and the water company over the price of water , the miners claiming that they were being overcharged compared to neighboring towns .
Mining was particularly dangerous at Woolsey 's Flat because the gold lay under very deep gravel ; at one place hydraulic mining cut a 200 foot bank . As one paper reported , at Woolsey 's Flat `` the banks are so high and steep , that there is constant danger of their caving in and burying the workmen . '' Reports of mining accidents , many fatal , were frequent .
DECLINE
In 1867 , one historian deemed Woolsey 's Flat `` an unimportant place , the most of the inhabitants having removed to the more prosperous neighboring town [ Moore 's Flat ] , or left for other sections . '' A scarlet fever outbreak in Woolsey 's Flat in 1869 did not help matters . Even as the town declined , hydraulic mining continued into the 70s with regular reports of profitable returns at such mines as the Blue Banks , the Oriental and the Boston .
In 1874 , it was reported that `` [ t ] he country about Woolsey 's Flat has been settling and sliding very fast the last three or four days and the inhabitants of that berg [ sic ] are tearing down and moving houses at a lively rate . '' Both hotels were torn down and some of the houses were moved closer to Moore 's Flat .
Soon the mines were becoming exhausted . By 1880 , another historian observed : `` One by one the hotels , stores and saloons closed out their business and departed until , in 1874 , the last attempt at business , a hotel , was closed , and Woolsey 's Flat gave up the ghost . ''

Wagon-bed riding is a practice performec with a covered carriage containing a canvas stretcher . It is a way to enable severely disabled people to move and so alleviate complaints such as constipation and spasms .
Wagon-bed riding may be considered a special kind of hippotherapy .
The wagon is a steel construction pulled by two trained horses . Canvas is stretched over the backs of the horses . The patient is placed in supine position on the canvas in the slight hollow between the horses . The rhythm , the warmth of the horses and the ambience has a relaxing and massaging effect on the patient .
Wagon-bed riding is suitable for people who do not get enough physical exercise because of a handicap . During wagon-bed riding the blood circulation and vital functions , such as metabolism and digestion are stimulated . It has a beneficial effect on people who find it difficult to walk .
Complaints such as constipation , epileptic seizures and lung obstruction ( e.g . cystic fibrosis ) , may be reduced by wagon-bed riding . It has also been shown that wagon-bed riding has a stimulating effect on coma patients .
Wagon-bed riding was started in Bennekom ( Netherlands ) , where the `` Riding school without thresholds '' was established in 1985 upon the initiatives of the Wageningen milkman Johan Roelofsen ( 1933–2011 ) . As of 2015 there are around twenty locations providing wagon-bed riding , and training for carers is given at the CDB ( cursuscentrum Dieropleidingen Barneveld ) in nearby Barneveld . As of 2012 there is a new location in Italy . Close to Rome , in Palidoro .
The horses
The horses used are usually Tinkers , Fjords and Haflingers . A shoulder height between 1.40 and 1.45m is ideal . The horses should be of equal shoulder height , preferably have a long back and an even , calm tread . Training a team of horses usually takes a year .
Smaller ponies are used for small wagons , but these are not suitable for bigger children or adults and the ponies do not have such a calm tread .
The canvas fabric beds
There are generally 3 types of wagons :
The three-wheeled `` standard '' type with one swivel wheel at the front and an axle at the rear , above which the driver 's frame is located .
The four-wheeled type with two swivel wheels at the front and an axle at the rear , above which the driver 's frame is located
The three-wheeled balance type with two wheels beside the middle of the horses and one swivel wheel at the rear , behind the driver 's frame .
The four-wheeled wagon and three-wheeled balance wagon can be provided with a lifting platform to lift the patient onto the canvas fabric bed .
With the three-wheeled `` standard '' type , the patient is lifted onto the canvas with a separate lifting aid .
Some wagons are provided with a cushion against which the horses can push , so that they do n't require a chest harness and ropes and can be taken in and out of harness quicker .
The frame to which the canvas is fixed should be adjustable for height appropriate to the horses .
In order to intensify the transfer of the motion of the horses to the participant , the canvas on which the participants lie is provided with straps around it or at both sides .
The riding school
The space within the riding school should be as generous as possible ( at least 40x20m ) and have a firm smooth surface . Depending on the patient , additional ( medical ) provisions may be necessary .
Wagon riding is also combined with care farms and general care institutions .

Plot
Like many women , Regina struggles every day for the welfare of her family , having to cope from the worn relationship with her husband to the rebellion of her young son ... but in her case everything is in sight , because she is the wife of Head of Government of the city and , as if that were not enough , an honorable senator , who always tries to do what is best for her fellow men .
In the world of politics , a world where men build power at any cost , is Regina , who strives to improve the reality of people and impose ideals over power .
When Alonso , her husband , decides to run for the presidential candidacy , he shows his true face : ferocious , violent and perverse . He is capable of destroying any political adversary without measuring the consequences , without realizing that he is transforming his best ally , the companion that took him to the most important place of his career , is his main adversary . When Regina is forced to confront her husband , Gerardo , with whom she had a relationship in college , reappears in her life . He is not only the main political rival of Alonso and the man who disputed the presidential chair , but also the one that will try to regain her love . Regina , realizing that her perfect life alongside Alonso , whom she always believed she was in love with and had a child with , is now full of lies and betrayals ; and she decides to leave him .
The publication of all the secrets , deceptions , and corrupt actions of Alonso confirm to Regina that her decision was the correct one . She knows that in order to avoid disaster , she must destroy Alonso 's whole world and transform his own reality to impose himself in a world full of corruption .
Fate will then lead her to discover that her way is related to politics , but next to an honest man , who supports her unconditionally , even leaving aside his own political ambitions , a man who is there to push and support her ... even when she becomes the candidate .

On July 13 , 2016 , Susana González was cast as the sister of the protagonist . Two days later , Rafael Sánchez Navarro was cast as the husband of the protagonist . Blanca Guerra was cast as the titular role , but was replaced by Silvia Navarro because of tight schedule . For the role of the main male protagonist , Mark Tacher , Víctor González and Juan Pablo Medina were nominees , but ultimately the role went to Víctor González .
Reception
Following the premiere , television critic Álvaro Cueva said La Candidata represented a fundamental change for the best of the national television industry . Besides its theme ( which he contrasted with previous political telenovelas ) , Cueva also praised the cinematography , hair and makeup , wardrobe , and music . After the finale , Cueva lauded the creators for the original script and for their depiction of a gritty situation in Mexico , rather than making another remake or Cinderella story .
In November 2016 , certain media outlets that support MORENA leader Andrés Manuel López Obrador , a likely presidential candidate , expressed their belief that this television program was created in order to favor former First Lady Margarita Zavala , possible PAN candidate , in the 2018 Presidential Election . In an overview after the show 's finale , Milenio commentator Fernando Mejía Barquera mentioned these assertions saying that those `` who held this position must have abandoned it during the course of the telenovela because nothing of the main character was reminiscent of the former first lady . '' With the main character being described as a populist .

The Blue Lamps ( also Blue Lanterns ) is a novel written by the Syrian writer Hanna Mina .
The Novel
The Blue Lamps is a story about a group of simple people in the days of World War II , the community in Latakia City , Syria in general , and how the lamps are painted blue to simulate the view of distant beacons covered by fog during the war time . We observe this through the eyes of the protagonist ‘ faris ' and his character 's evolution from a youngster to an adult man . The novelist went beyond the concept of `` The Impact of War on People , '' depicting a full life in which the war crisis plays a major role , but the group of people who disturb the book 's Deuteronomy 's , their daily lives , how they treat each other , how they struggle to live , how their own interests relate to their nation 's issues , and how they understand the struggle , plays a larger role . Despite the fact that the narrative begins and finishes with ‘ faris ' , he is not the sole hero in the story . A variety of destitute families ' dwell in the Grand Home , including “ Um sqr ” , the old woman who serves in the house and her young unemployed son and the Black-Mariam and her husband , Nayef , who 's nicknamed stallion , which they have their own narrative .
The novel was shown on a Syrian television series , and translated into Russian and Chinese .

Anna Fox ( born 1961 ) is a British documentary photographer , known for a `` combative , highly charged use of flash and colour '' . In 2019 she was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society .
Career and work
Fox completed her degree in Photography at West Surrey College of Art and Design in Farnham , Surrey in 1986 under tutors Martin Parr , Paul Graham and Karen Knorr .
Fox first came to attention with her 1988 documentary study of London office life on the mid-1980s , Work Stations : Office Life in London . She is perhaps best known for her Zwarte Piet series made between 1993 and 1998 , published as the book Zwarte Piet , which documents 'black face ' folk culture traditions in the Netherlands . Between 2001 and 2003 she published four monographs in her `` Made in '' series : Made in Milton Keynes , Made in Kansas , Made in Gothenburg and Made in Florence . From 2009 , Fox photographed for two years at Butlins in Bognor Regis for her book Resort 1 - Butlin 's Bognor Regis .
She currently works as head of photography at University for the Creative Arts in Farnham .

In November 2009 Fox was shortlisted for the 2010 Deutsche Börse Photography Prize , held at the Photographers Gallery , London , and the 2012 Pilar Citoler Prize . In 2019 , Fox was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society .
The critic Sean O'Hagan , reviewing Resort 1 - Butlin 's Bognor Regis in The Guardian , said `` Her work often hones in on the particular to suggest the universal , such as her series The Village ( 1991–1993 ) , in which rural England becomes a pastiche of itself even as the individual lives glimpsed therein seem vividly real . ''
David Chandler , in his essay Vile Boodies , in the book Anna Fox Photographs 1983-2007 , said Fox is `` widely regarded as an important part of what might be called the 'second wave ' of British colour documentary photography '' and that she `` helped form its particular style of combative , highly charged use of flash and colour '' .

Angkor Borei ( , ) is a district located in Takéo Province , in southern Cambodia . According to the 1998 census of Cambodia , it had a population of 44,980 .
Administration
The district has 6 communes , 34 villages ( as of 2019 ) .
History
This ancient city was an important settlement of the Kingdom of Funan and may have been its capital . It may have been the Thinae , or Sinae Metropolis located by Claudius Ptolemy as the farthest known city to the east in his Geography .
The site was first excavated in 1996 and was again excavated in 1999 as part of the Lower Mekong Archaeological Project . During the 1996 excavation , the University of Hawaii and the Royal University of Fine Arts initiated the excavation and focused on the sociopolitical complexity from 500 BC to 500 AD . This first excavation , however , was just preliminary research . The first objectives were :
1 ) Documentation of the site 's layout and the range of its archaeological features
2 ) Evaluation of the integrity of subsurface materials and description of the site 's stratigraphy
3 ) Collection of samples for dating portions of the archaeological site
4 ) Reconstructing the hydrology and natural environment of the early historic period in this region
In this site various archaeological methods were used such as surface survey and mapping , test excavations , auger sampling and coring , and trenching with a backhoe .
Unfortunately , the archeological project was disturbed by looting and illicit trafficking of Khmer antiquities , which continues as a serious problem into the 21st century .
It is the birthplace of Norodom , King of Cambodia from 1860 to 1904 .

The Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy , also known as project Ingeniería 2030 , is a joint initiative between two Chilean universities , the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Federico Santa María Technical University This joint project was started in 2013 , in order to transform engineering education by developing a new , shorter curricular design , funding relevant research , and by establishing a student-centered education that emphasizes multidisciplinarity , user-centered design and social responsibility as well as student flexibility and choice . This initiative thus expects to provide a platform to work on societal grand challenges , to orchestrate effective I+E networks , and to build a world-class engineering community .
This consortium expects to transform these universities into world-class institutions , positioning them as the best engineering schools in Latinamerica by 2020 and among the best 50 engineering schools in the world by 2030 .
Background
In 2013 , the Chilean National Agency for Innovation and Development ( CORFO ) launched the `` New Engineering 2030 '' initiative , as a bid to transform the economy . In sync with international trends in engineering education , CORFO decided to motivate the renewal of engineering training so as to be more prepared to address significant challenges of the society . The New Engineering 2030 set out to co-finance strategic plans that would serve as a 6-year roadmap to create engineering education that meets global requirements by means of applied research , technology transfer , innovation and technology-based entrepreneurship . By motivating universities to prepare more engineers towards international competitiveness and productivity , CORFO intended to propel Chile from a developing to a developed knowledge-based economy .
In 2014 , the joint proposal by School of Engineering at the Universidad Catóica , in alliance with the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María , obtained the highest ranking in this national competition of 8 projects presented by different university consortia in the country .

Tonbridge railway station is on the South Eastern Main Line in England , serving the town of Tonbridge , Kent . It is from London Charing Cross via . Trains calling at the station are operated by Southeastern and Southern .
Tonbridge forms a junction between the South Eastern Main Line , the Hastings Line and the Redhill–Tonbridge line . There are four platforms . Platform 4 is a terminating platform .
History
The South Eastern Railway ( SER ) first reached Tonbridge ( then known as Tunbridge ) in May 1842 . The site of the original station was on the east side of the road bridge over the railway , opposite its current location to the west of the bridge . The building of the station obliterated the last remains of Tonbridge Priory . At the time , the line ran to London Bridge via Redhill and Croydon , using the Brighton Main Line . It served as a temporary terminus until December 1842 , when the line reached Ashford . A couple of years later the through line to Dover opened . A small engine shed was built ; the date of opening is uncertain but it is presumed to date from the opening of the line . On 20 September 1845 , a branch to opened . The station was later renamed Tunbridge Junction . Over the next seven years the branch was extended to Hastings . Access to the line to Hastings was via an indirect link which required a reverse . This arrangement lasted until 1857 when a steeply climbing direct route was opened .
However , being forced to share tracks with its rival , the London , Brighton & South Coast Railway , as well as competition from the London , Chatham & Dover Railway meant that the SER decided to build a new route from London Bridge , which ran via and . The cut-off joined the main line at Tonbridge . This prompted a rebuild of the station , and in 1864 it was rebuilt on its current site with four platforms . The original station was demolished in 1865 after closure , but the entrance gateways are still in situ . The downside entrance is in Vale Road opposite Sainsbury 's , and the upside entrance is in Priory Road , forming the entrance to the car park .
The cut-off opened in 1868 . Soon afterwards , a larger engine shed was built , but still on the opposite side of the bridge to the main part of the station . In May 1893 , the station changed its name to Tonbridge Junction , following the change in the town 's name to avoid confusion with the larger Tunbridge Wells . At that time , there were two through platforms , two through roads , and two bay platforms at the west end of the station . These bay platforms served the lines to Redhill and . The indirect line to Tunbridge Wells remained in use until about 1913 , after which it was closed and the track dismantled . By November 1919 , the up platform station roof bore the name TONBRIDGE in white letters . This feature was a navigational aid for aircraft .
Under the Southern Railway , the station was renamed Tonbridge in July 1929 . It was rebuilt in 1935 , with the bay on the south side of the station converted to a through platform . This entailed the construction of a new section of bridge under the road outside the station .
By May 1958 , the brick station building fronting the main road had been rebuilt with a tiled facade . The Sevenoaks to Dover line via Tonbridge was electrified in 1961 when the Southern Region improved train frequencies and faster journey times were introduced under British Railways as part of the Kent Coast Electrification . The line south to Tunbridge Wells and Hastings was electrified in 1986 by British Rail , and finally the line to Redhill was electrified in 1993 also by British Rail as part of the Eurostar/Channel Tunnel route improvement works .
Eurostar trains ran through Tonbridge station until the first section of the High Speed line was built through Kent , to cut down journey times from London to the Channel Tunnel . The transfer happened on 28 September 2003 . The station was refurbished in 2011–12 .
In 2015 , the station gained a resident cat , Saffie . The 8-year-old animal needed a new home when her owners moved house . Staff at the station adopted her . Saffie died in March 2018 .
Platforms
Platforms 1 and 2 are an island platform .
Platform 1 for Southern trains to/from Redhill ( which terminate here from the west ) and to/from Maidstone West and Strood ( which terminate here from the east ) .
Platform 2 for trains from Dover , Ramsgate and Hastings to London via Sevenoaks .
Platform 3 is an island platform , and Platform 4 is a west-facing bay .
Platform 3 for all trains to Dover and Ramsgate via Ashford International and to Hastings via Tunbridge Wells .
Platform 4 for trains to/from London ( which terminate here from the west )
Services
Services at Tonbridge are operated by Southeastern and Southern using , , and EMUs .
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is :
4 tph to London Charing Cross ( semi-fast )
2 tph to via ( 1 semi-fast , 1 stopping )
2 tph to of which 1 continues to
1 tph to
1 tph to via
During the peak hours , the station is served by additional services between London Charing Cross and Tunbridge Wells . There are also peak hour direct services to London Cannon Street and .
Tonbridge yard and sidings
There are extensive yards and storage sidings ( tracks ) on both the east and west sides of the station .
To the east of the station are Tonbridge East Sidings , four sidings and a two-track shed used by Network Rail for maintenance equipment storage and materials delivery . These occupy part of the site of the former engine shed .
Further down the line towards Paddock Wood , there is the now disused Tonbridge Postal Siding . This was opened in 1995 with a new down `` slow '' line to handle mail and parcels traffic for the nearby Royal Mail sorting office . Its use was short-lived owing to the loss of most mail traffic to road haulage .
To the west , between the Redhill line and the West Yard , the four electrified 'Jubilee ' sidings are used to stable trains . The adjacent West Yard , operated by GB Railfreight , has sixteen non-electrified tracks and is now mainly used for stabling engineers ' trains . The West Yard was built in 1941 as part of the improvements needed for freight train traffic during World War Two , and is spanned by a long footbridge carrying a public footpath between Douglas Road and Clare Avenue .
Tonbridge Power ( signal ) Box stands at the eastern entrance to the Jubilee sidings and West Yard . Built in 1962 , it is still in limited operational use .
Adjacent to the main London line there are two short electrified sidings ( Tonbridge Down Main sidings ) .
Accidents
On 1 January 1846 , a bridge over the River Medway collapsed in a flood . A train driver was killed when he tried to jump clear of the train .
On 30 September 1866 , four carriages which had been slipped from a Dover bound train to be worked to ran through the station and collided with some empty carriages in a siding . Eleven people were injured .
On 23 October 1899 , a passenger train from Redhill collided with the buffer stop in the bay platform . Sixteen people were injured .
On 23 January 1903 , a passenger train from London collided with the buffer stop in the bay platform . Five people were injured .
On 5 March 1909 , a train travelling towards Redhill overran a signal and collided with the boat train from Charing Cross to Dover . Two railway staff were killed and eleven passengers injured . A third train was prevented from crashing into the wreckage by the prompt actions of two travelling ticket inspectors . As a consequence of the accident , the Royal Train carrying King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra was diverted at Chislehurst Junction to take a different route to Dover .
On 23 August 2020 , Class 377 electric multiple unit 377317 was derailed at the exit of the Jubilee Sidings .

San Antonio de los Cobres is a small town of population 5,482 ( per the 2001 INDEC census ) in northwestern Argentina . It is the capital of the Los Andes Department of the Salta Province .
Geography
The town is known for its high elevation of approximately above sea level , being one of the highest elevations of any city or town in Argentina . It is located approximately from the city of Salta and from the capital , Buenos Aires .
It is part of the Andes desert and described to be an arid region with few trees and scarce drinking water .
History
In a 2015 podcast from The Naked Scientists , research has shown that people in the San Antonio de los Cobres area have remarkably developed a mutation in their genes to cope with the high levels of arsenic in the area . Having concentrations about ten times higher that those deemed safe by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , naturally occurring arsenic has created a very toxic environment in this region contaminating the water supplies . Evolutionary processes resulting from long term exposure have caused a specific mutation within the DNA of this population allowing them to process arsenic more quickly throughout their systems and preventing the formation of poisonous byproducts that would normally form within the body with exposure to the element . This is the first adaptation in humans regarding a toxic chemical to ever be documented .
Economy
San Antonio de las Cobres takes its name from the nearby Sierra de Cobre , or Copper Mountain , which is rich in that mineral . Economic activity in the town is based on mining of the mineral-rich surrounding mountains , and weaving using local llama wool .
The town is also a stop along the Tren a las Nubes ( Train of the Clouds ) , on the Salta-Antofagasta rail line .
Climate
San Antonio de los Cobres has a cool arid climate ( Köppen BWk ) characterised by mild summers , cold , bone-dry winters , and very large diurnal temperature variation due to the extreme altitude . Rainfall is essentially nil except from January to March , when of an annual total of falls from thunderstorms .

Kelly Round Barn is a historic round barn located near Halcottsville in Delaware County , New York , United States . It was built in 1899 and is a two-story structure with a low conical roof , approximately 90 feet in diameter . It features a central silo .
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 .
History
The Kelly Round Barn was built in 1899 by the Kelly brothers , Hiram , David , Norman and George as a milking barn . In 1915 , it was sold to the Meade family who operated it until the 1960s . In 1981 , it was donated to the Erpf Catskill Cultural Center by Alta Industries , which reconstructed the deteriorated barn in 1988 . The barn has been the site of the Pakatakan Farmers Market since 1996 .
The 90-foot diameter barn was built with oak timber and set on a stone foundation constructed by local mason Henry Sanford . It is one of the first and only existing round barns to have a fully operational silo located in the center . Gravity was used to push the hay to the bottom after being loaded from the top . As many as 51 cows were lined around the perimeter on the bottom so they could graze while they were milked . This represented the technological advance of efficiency .

Emmanuel Menzie Yere ( born 24 October 1983 ) is a Papua New Guinean professional rugby league footballer who plays for the Sheffield Eagles whom he played with in the 2000s and 2010s . He was a Papua New Guinea international . He is also Sheffield Eagles ' all-time leading try scorer with 195 tries in 292 games .
Club career
Yere was signed by Sheffield Eagles in 2008 following some impressive performances for Papua New Guinea at the Rugby League World Cup .
Yere is often known as `` The Jukebox '' because he has so many hits , referring to the large number of heavy tackles he made .
In 2013 , he scored a club record 46 tries in one season , comfortably beating the previous record of 35 tries to set by Quentin Laulu-Togagae a year earlier . He also surpassed Daryl Powell 's career total of 114 tries , making him the club 's highest all-time try scorer . In April 2017 Menzie became one of few players to have played 250 games for the Eagles , by taking to the field in an 18-42 League victory over Rochdale Hornets .
At the beginning of 2018 , it became apparent Yere would have trouble starting the season for the Eagles . 'Visa issues ' meant he could not be part of the playing squad until Gameweek 14 . Subsequently , he missed the first half of the regular season . However , Yere 's visa was finally cleared in May 2018 thus ending his longest spell without playing in his career .
On 2019 he re-signed for Sheffield and was immediately loaned out to Doncaster where he scored a debut try in their victory over Batley Bulldogs in the Challenge Cup on April 14 , 2019 .
Personal life
Yere has three sons with his wife Sandy .
In 2010 , his club discovered that Yere had been buying kit ( particularly boots ) and taking unwanted kit to send back to his home country , where kit shortage is a problem . With Yere 's support they set up Kits2Kids , a charity that collects kit from companies , clubs , schools and individuals and ships it to PNG .
After his final season with the Eagles it became apparent that Yere was going to struggle to gain British citizenship based on the cost of application . Therefore , the Sheffield Eagles ' Supporters Trust began a campaign to raise the sufficient funds for the Yere 's to stay in the country . They managed to raise £5,000 in five days .
In April 2019 he was granted permission to reside in the UK and re-signed for the Sheffield Eagles .
Representative career
Yere played for PNG in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup , where he scored one try against Australia .
Yere was named as part of the Papua New Guinea squad for the 2009 Pacific Cup . Papua New Guinea won the tournament with Yere scoring two tries in each the semi-final and the final .
He played for Papua New Guinea in the 2010 Four Nations tournament scoring two tries , taking his total representative tries to 9 , the most for any PNG player .
Yere was selected by coach Adrian Lam as part of the train-on squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup .

Little Pine Mountain is a mountain in Santa Barbara County , California , in the Los Padres National Forest at the southern edge of the San Rafael Mountains . It separates the drainages of Oso Creek , which flows into the upper Santa Ynez River , from the drainage of Santa Cruz Creek , which flows into the middle section of the river via Lake Cachuma . The mountain is named for a thin grove of Coulter pines located on the summit .
The mountain is reached by the Santa Cruz National Recreation Trail , and is a popular day hike and mountain biking route for residents of Santa Barbara during the winter months . There is a camp at Happy Hollow Spring near the summit .
The rocks of the lower slopes of the mountain comes from the Franciscan Assemblage , which creates serpentine soils that support a unique chaparral ecosystem . Large deposits of dark-red cinnabar are exposed above ground . The middle slopes of the mountain are dominated by the Espada Formation . The summit largely consists of Matilija Sandstone . There is a small band of Temblor Formation , a Great Valley Sequence unit usually found much farther north , encircling the high ridge of the mountain . North slope outcrops consist largely of Espada Formation rocks , with a band of serpentinite splitting the Espada section in half .

Juan de Agramonte ( fl . 1511 ) ( in Catalan , Joan d'Agramunt ) was a sailor from Catalonia thought to have possibly travelled to Newfoundland , Canada in 1511 .
Because of England 's ever increasing voyages to the New World , Spain became concerned by English intrusions into her territories , and planned to explore the north Atlantic coast in order to take possession of it . Juan de Dornelos was placed in command of an expedition in 1500 which never did happen as the expedition was never put to sea .
After the failed attempt in 1500 , Agramonte , a sailor and native of Lleida , signed a contract with the daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon on October 29 , 1511 to lead an expedition of discovery and exploration to Terra Nova in the years following the voyages of John Cabot . The expedition , which was to comprise two ships , had orders not to land on soil under the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Portugal .
It has been speculated that this expedition also did not take place . The fact that these expeditions were contemplated furthers the notion that the shores of Newfoundland had previously been visited by the Bretons and that a part of the Newfoundland territory had been discovered by Portugal .

Chirnside is a hillside village in Berwickshire in Scotland , west of Berwick-upon-Tweed and east of Duns .
Church
The parish church at Chirnside dates from the 12th century . It was substantially rebuilt in 1878 and extensively restored and altered in 1907 . The rebuildings now incorporate all of the original church ( es ) , however the original chevron-patterned Norman doorway at the west end remains .
Dovecot aviaries
The Ninewells Doocot , in a garden adjacent to the church , is a 16th-century circular beehive type doocot ( dovecot ) . Not far from the manor , stands the Whitehall Doocot , rectangular-planned , and two-chamber , with stone skews defining its mono-pitched roof .
Whitehall
Below Chirnside stands the estate of Whitehall , with a Georgian manor house containing Palladian windows , which is a Listed Building . It contains a first floor music room richly decorated in Italian plasterwork . Once owned by the Hall of Dunglass family , William Hall of Whitehall ( died circa 1749 ) was one of the Principal Clerks of the Court of Session . It passed early in the 19th century to Mitchell-Innes of Ayton Castle family who held it until the 1980s .
Since then the house and its park have passed through the hands of developers , and since 2007 the manor has been derelict and seriously at risk . The partial demolition of the back quarters of the house have left Whitehall completely open and dangerous to the public . The Georgian manor was demolished in 2015
Ninewells House
Ninewells , named for the springs that flow from the hillside into the Whiteadder Water .
It was home to several generations of Homes ( later Humes ) and was the childhood home , and later the summer home , of David Hume ( 1711-1776 ) philosopher , economist and writer .
The original Ninewells house was entirely rebuilt by William Burn in 1839-1841 for Elizabeth Hume in a Tudor style , but was demolished in 1954 .
In the 19th Century it was described as ' a handsome Tudor edifice of 1840–41 , successor to an older mansion , which was the boyish home , though not the birthplace , of the historian and philosopher , David Hume ( 1711–76 ) , and his occasional residence after his fame was won . It was the seat , too , of his nephew and namesake , Baron Hume ( 1756-1838 ) , the eminent writer on criminal jurisprudence . The present proprietor , James Alexander Ross-Hume , Esq . ( b . 1851 ; suc . 1864 ) , holds in the shire , valued at £2162 per annum '
During World War Two it was designated as a hostel for Polish and Eastern European displaced persons . Some Polish army personnel were billeted there and some also lodged with Chirnside families . Around 1942-1943 it was designated as prisoner of war camp ( 236 ) .
The Ninewells Walled Garden stands on the A6437 south of the village ( early 19th century ) .
Billie Castle
Sited 3 kilometres north of Chirnside on the Billie Burn , is the remains of Billie Castle . A castle of the Rentons , it was attacked several times in the 16th century .
It was destroyed , along with Bonkle and Blanerne Castle during Hereford 's Raid of 1544 , part of The Rough Wooing of Scotland . It was restored prior to being abandoned in the 18th Century . It was a ruin by 1834 .
It appears to have consisted of an oblong tower house , with walls and a moat . There are also the remains of lime kilns .
School
Chirnside Primary School , 1937 , by architects Messrs Reid & Forbes , is set into a hillside , and being white , can be seen for miles around .
Paper Mill
The Chirnside Bridge Paper Mill , now a large manufacturer , is a survivor from an earlier era . Originally constructed in 1842 and 1857 by David Cousin ( also responsible for Dean Cemetery ) , with additions in 1897 , and reductions in 1971–1973 . The Italianate administrative block was built as a house for the owner of the mill . There was an earlier mill and house on the site , and the porter 's lodge , now a store , is a Gothic octagonal single–storey–and–basement building which probably dates from this period .
Berwickshire Railway
Chirnside had a railway station on the North British Railway 's Berwickshire Railway ( opened 1863 ) , in the hamlet of Chirnsidebridge . The railway line ran from Reston to Earlston , joining the East Coast Main Line to the Waverley Line .
A five span rounded arch railway bridge was built over the Whiteadder Water in 1863 to carry the railway .
Chirnside Railway Station was closed to passenger traffic 10 September 1951 . Freight continued until 19 July 1965 . The station building still stands , currently used for storing agricultural supplies .
Dialect of Chirnside
The distinctive traditional dialect of the Scots language that is spoken in Chirnside was the subject of a study by Swiss dialectologist Paul Wettstein , published in 1942 . In the dialect Chirnside is pronounced `` Churn-side '' .
Sport
The local football team Chirnside F.C . plays in the Border Amateur league and appeared nine times in the Scottish Cup between 1935 and 1966 .
Notable people
David Hume , the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher , lived in Ninewells House , just south of the village ( see below ) . His nephew , the noted Scottish jurist David , later Baron Hume , was baptised at Chirnside in 1757 .
Chirnside is also the final resting place of Jim Clark , former world champion Formula One racing-car driver . Close to the churchyard in which Clark is buried , there is a memorial plaque and clock at the side of the main road through the village . The Jim Clark Motorsport Museum can be found in Duns .
Joelle Murray , Scottish internationalist and Hibs footballer , is from the village .
Liam Craig , the former footballer , is from the village .
Near the kirk once stood a tower house ( demolished in the 18th century ) , built by the Earl of Dunbar , once the superior here .

WWGR , commonly called Gator Country 101.9 Music , is a country music radio station based in the Fort Myers , FL area . The station , which is owned by Renda Broadcasting , operates at 101.9 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW . This power gives it one of the best radio signals in all of Southwest Florida . Its transmitter is located off Corkscrew Road in Estero . This incredible signal also has its disadvantages , having exceptional interference with 101.9 `` FM 101.9 '' WQMP , an Alternative Rock station licensed to Daytona Beach , but serves Orlando . The Sebring , Tampa , St. Petersburg , and Avon Park areas are the most affected by this interference with powerful radios receiving those two stations almost as one .
History
WWGR signed on in 1969 as WHEW-FM , and was a station that targeted the greater Fort Myers area as a Country station during the 1970s and 1980s . During that time , the station struggled to find a strong hold on the market 's country music listeners . That coupled with the increased competition from WCKT made it a very tough course for the station to sustain .
In the 1990s , WHEW-FM transformed to what is currently WWGR when the station was bought by Renda Broadcasting . Immediately following the sale of the station , the station took over the name Gator Country 101.9 Music , `` Southwest Florida 's Country Station '' .
In April 2013 , two presenters at WWGR told listeners dihydrogen monoxide , a scientific description of water , was coming out of their water taps as part of an April Fool 's Day hoax and were suspended for a few days by the station 's general manager , Tony Renda . Renda later told NewsPress : `` It is one thing when radio stations change their format or other crazy things they do . But you are messing with one of the big three , food , water or shelter . They just went too far ; I just knew I did n't like that . '' The prank resulted in several calls by consumers to the local utility company , which sent out a release stating that the water was safe .
WWGR today
In 2005 , WWGR moved from its home in Fort Myers to Bonita Springs just across the street from the Naples-Fort Myers Greyhound Track . This new building houses WWGR and sister stations WSGL , WJGO , and WGUF .

Jordan competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , from 7 September to 18 September 2016 .
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories ; amputation , the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness ; cerebral palsy ; wheelchair athletes , there is often overlap between this and other categories ; visual impairment , including blindness ; Les autres , any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories , for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis . Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications , dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition . Events are given a code , made of numbers and letters , describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing . Some sports , such as athletics , divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities , other sports , for example swimming , group competitors from different categories together , the only separation being based on the severity of the disability .

In addition , the Lynch Expedition departed from the port with the aim of destroying the sugar estates that contributed financially to Peru and demanding war contributions from the Peruvian landowners .
U.S. intervention was carried out through Secretary of State William M. Evarts , who promoted the Arica Conferences in order to stop the conflict , since , as a result of Chilean attacks , civilian properties had been involuntarily affected , both of Europeans and Americans . The peace negotiations were unsuccessful , however .
The Government of Chile demanded the transfer of some territories already occupied in various ways , which was promoted in the Chilean Congress by the deputy José Manuel Balmaceda , and the new Minister of War and Navy , José Francisco Vergara , pressured by public opinion . Chilean tax revenues began to improve with the taxes collected by the exports of minerals from the regions that were occupied , thereby paying for the war . The tax charged by Chile was $ 1.60 .
Nicolás de Piérola , dictator of Peru , thought that the Chilean landing in the capital would take place in Ancón and Barranco , north of Lima . Against this opinion was Colonel Andrés Avelino Cáceres and other military leaders who were of the opinion that the Chilean landing would take place in the south . De Piérola allocated a large part of the defense to the north and south in Pisco , leaving a force of 3,000 men under the command of Colonel Anselmo Zamudio . Chile sent an expedition under the command of Rear Admiral Patricio Lynch to stop the production of the haciendas on the Peruvian coast . In it , Lynch committed looting and burning , as well as collecting war quotas .
In this expedition , buildings and public services , sugar and cotton farms were affected , where their owners refused to pay the war quotas . Chinese workers worked in the haciendas in conditions of semi-slavery , who were freed as the Chilean troops passed by and joined as porters .
On the coast of Lima , the Chilean ships `` Loa '' and `` Covadonga '' were sunk by torpedoes prepared by Peruvian engineers . Faced with these sinkings , the ship `` Cochrane '' bombed the towns of Chorrillos , Ancón and Chancay .
Landing in Pisco
The port of Chilca , which is located 70 km south of the city of Lima , obtained the preference of the Chilean General Staff . The presence of major Peruvian forces was thought unlikely .
On November 20 , 1880 , the 1st Division of the Chilean Army , with 8,800 men , embarked on 15 transports and the corvettes Chacabuco and O'Higgins , arrived in Pisco , coming from Arica , under the command of General José Antonio Villagrán . The Division was reinforced with 3,500 soldiers who arrived on December 2 in the corvettes Abtao and Magellan under the command of Colonel Francisco Gana .
Contrary to Andrés Avelino Cáceres ' belief that the landing would take place in the south , president de Piérola arranged his troops between Ancón and Barranco , north of Lima ; to the south , in the city of Pisco , he left a force of 3,000 soldiers under the command of Colonel Anselmo Zamudio , who , seeing the Chilean numerical superiority , withdrew .
On December 14 , the Chilean 1st Division arrived at Tambo de Mora and from there two brigades marched under the command of captain Patricio Lynch . Colonel José Domingo Amunátegui 's brigade followed later . On their way through the desert towards the Cañete river 's valley , the brigade was forced to return to Pisco due to time constraints caused by a lack of water wells . The delay meant the replacement of General Villagrán by Patricio Lynch , whom Manuel Baquedano appointed the new head of the 1st Division .
Landing in Curayacu
On December 22 , 1880 , 15,000 soldiers under General Baquedano 's command landed in 29 transports , along with the Blanco Encalada and Cochrane armored vehicles , the O'Higgins corvette and the Angamos transport ship .
The Peruvian military command ordered troops under the command of Andrés Avelino Cáceres to march south from Lima in order to occupy Lurín , but the desert and the lack of means of transportation ended up forcing these forces to return to Lima .
The Chilean landing in the ports of Chilca , Curayacu and Pisco was finally carried out without Peruvian opposition . Chilean troops established their camp in the Lurín Valley .
First encounters
On December 25 and 26 , after eight days of marching , the two halves of Lynch 's Chilean brigade arrive successively , which followed each other 24 hours apart to facilitate the use of food and water . This 180 km journey was made meeting very little Peruvian resistance , which consisted mainly of attacks by local Montoneras .
The Peruvian command sent Colonel Pedro José Sevilla and the Cazadores del Rímac , with 200 cavalry horsemen armed with carbines , to monitor the advance of the Chileans , confronting them in Yerba Buena and then in Bujama . The Chilean command sent Colonel Orozimbo Barbosa 's brigade to confront the Peruvian troops , fighting in Manzano on December 27 , 1880 , where Sevilla was taken prisoner .
Chilean troops confiscated money and livestock from the wealthy owners of the Cañete valley , setting fire to and looting the towns of San Antonio and Mala . A thousand Chinese workers , who had come to put themselves at the disposal of the Chilean regiments , hoping in this way to be freed from their commitments to their owners , helped the Chilean troops as porters . From the confiscated estates , more than six hundred donkeys were seized , which were loaded with sacks , weapons , and kitchen utensils , with the mules loading the food and the barrels of water .
Since January 4 , 1881 , Peruvian Colonel Mariano Vargas had been in Rinconada de Ate with a force of 340 soldiers , made up of landowners and residents of the area armed with Minié rifles and artillery pieces . Vargas organized his artillery on the Vásquez hill . On January 9 , 1881 , the Chilean division of Barbosa reached Pampa Grande after a march through Pachacamac . Barboza 's division faced Vargas 's men in the battle of La Rinconada de Ate , achieving Vargas 's withdrawal to Vásquez hill , where the Peruvian artillery came into action but without causing significant losses to the Chilean division , which later After inspecting the area , retired to Pampa Grande .
Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos
At 4 A.M. on January 13 , the battle began with Patricio Lynch 's 1st Division facing the 1st Army Corps of Colonel Miguel Iglesias in Villa . Emilio Sotomayor 's 2nd division is delayed in entering the combat . Baquedano then ordered Colonel Martínez 's reserve to reinforce the First Division , which was overrun by Iglesias ' troops . The Chilean reserve then manages to isolate the units of Iglesias from the rest of the Peruvian troops .
The Sotomayor division enters into action by attacking first in Villa , and then turning and heading to the position of San Juan , defended by Colonel Cáceres ' IV Army Corps . General Silva sent troops from the III Corps of Dávila to reinforce Cáceres , meanwhile the III Chilean Division of Colonel Pedro Lagos began the attack on the left flank of the III and IV Corps of Dávila and Cáceres . Sotomayor 's troops evicted Cáceres from his positions on Cerro San Juan , separating the Peruvian lines at a second point .
Colonel Miguel Iglesias , head of the First Army Corps , brought together the Peruvian Guard No . 1 and Callao No . 9 battalions that had fought in Villa , which combined with the Cajamarca No . 5 , Tarma No . 7 and Trujillo No . 11 battalions added 4,500 soldiers in address of Marcavilca .
After the actions of San Juan , part of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Division , made up of the 4th in line and Chacabuco regiments , plus the navy 's artillery advanced towards Marcavilca . Colonel Arnaldo Panizo observed from Morro Solar the withdrawal of Iglesias 's forces and supported his withdrawal with the `` Provisional '' battery , resulting in his offensive . Iglesias organizes the attack with the First Corps and in this way the Chilean advance is stopped near the La Calavera hill . At that point a part of the troops of the Chacabuco Regiment was killed or wounded , with 19 officers and 350 soldiers falling , with their commander Toro Herrera wounded and the second major commander Belisario Zañartu killed in action , with Major Quintavalla taking charge . The same happened in the 4th in Line regiment .
Patricio Lynch sent for reinforcements , which could not arrive , and Baquedano did not learn of his difficulties because he was in the town of Chorrillos . At that time the ammunition began to lack and the infantry had to retreat . Reinforcements were requested from Commander Pedro Lagos who was in the houses of San Juan . The first officer to enlist the help of Lynch 's division was , of his own free will , Diego Dublé Almeyda , commander of the Atacama Regiment , who brought with him some ammunition . This allowed the Chilean retreat to be halted and the offensive to continue .
Iglesias carried out a counterattack led by Colonel Justiniano Borgoño 's Libres de Trujillo Battalion and Suárez 's Zepita No . 29 Battalion , attacking and pushing back the Chilean troops and recovering the positions they had left behind .
At 12:00 , the Peruvian I Corps forces left their positions in Marcavilca and withdrew in the direction of Chorrillos and others towards Morro Solar , attacked by the Chileans from Marcavilca . Miguel Iglesias is captured by Chilean forces in the direction of Chorrillos at 12:45 pm after descending from Cerro Panteón . Zepita No . 29 manages to enter Lima Street and fight in Chorrillos .
At 1:45 p.m. at the top of Morro Solar are the last 100 soldiers , among soldiers from different battalions of the 1st Corps and Artilleros del Morro , all under the command of Colonel Arnaldo Panizo , who , surrounded , defend their positions . The machine gun operated by Major Manuel Hurtado y Haza was rendered useless and a 12-piece piece continued to operate . Finally , the Chilean troops occupied the Morro Solar plain . After occupying Chorrillos , the Chileans looted the city and reduced it to ashes .
Battle of Miraflores
The Peruvian defense line participating in the battle was made up of the civilian population of the city of Lima united with the battalions that had fought in San Juan . At approximately 2:00 p.m. on January 15 , 1881 , a surprise firefight between groups of both armies began to escalate until combat became general throughout the battle front .
The brigades of the II Chilean Division were in Chorrillos and Barranco advancing towards Miraflores , and Patricio Lynch 's division were not in position The III Lagos Division was the closest to the front , and for that reason it was the first to engage in combat with the Peruvian forces . The troops of Andrés Avelino Cáceres , who were defending the right flank in Redoubts 1 and 2 , faced off with Francisco Barceló 's 2nd Brigade , while Martiniano Urriola 's 1st Brigade was deployed in disorder . The Chilean artillery retreats about 1500 meters , since it was thought that an imminent retreat from the Lagos division was expected .
On the left flank , Suárez 's troops face the 2nd Brigade of the II Division , while the Division fights in the center of the line . After two hours of battle the attack is reinforced by two regiments and the bombardment of the ships Blanco Encalada , Cochrane and Huascar to the town of Miraflores . Barceló 's brigade attacks the Cáceres line , who retreats from Miraflores . Upon being overwhelmed by this flank and attacked from the rear , the defenses of Redoubts 1 , 2 and 3 withdrew from the line .
At 18:30 the Santiago Regiment arrives in Miraflores . Piérola withdraws the rest of the troops who do not fight . Of the 10 strongholds , only the forces of 3 strongholds enter into combat . The mayor of Lima Rufino Torrico hands over the government of the city to Manuel Baquedano , who seizes him to avoid ambushes to the Chilean army at the entrance to Lima . The town of Miraflores was looted and burned .
In the battle of Miraflores , the Chilean army suffered 2,124 casualties , while the Peruvian army had about 3,000 .
Occupation of Lima
The occupation began on January 1881 , with Chilean troops occupying the capital and establishing a military administration headquartered in the Government Palace .
Reports of Chilean destruction and looting resulted in a meeting between the different observing powers , concluding that such an event would not be allowed in Lima proper . Had the Chilean army destroyed and looted the city as it had done in Barranco , Chorrillos and Miraflores , the observing powers would have used their military power in the form of a bombardment of the city against the occupying army .
In absence of a Peruvian President who was willing to accept their peace terms , on 22 February 1881 , the Chileans allowed an open cabildo of notables outside of Lima to elect Francisco García Calderón as President , also allowing him to raise and arm two infantry battalions composed of 400 men each , as well as two small cavalry squadrons in order to give more consistency to the provisional government .
At that time , the U.S. Secretary of State , James G. Blaine , who saw the war as an inadmissible intervention of British capital in the United States ' sphere of influence , outlined a new policy in June 1881 reversing the U.S. ' previous neutrality for a denial of any territorial annexation of territories . On 26 June 1881 , the United States recognized President Calderón as President of Peru . Because of Calderón 's refusal to accept the Chilean peace conditions , which involved the cession of Tarapacá and Arica to Chile , he was placed under arrest by the Chileans , with Lizardo Montero Flores succeeding him as provisional president of Peru .
Despite a relatively peaceful administration in comparison to the destruction in Barranco , Chorrillos and Miraflores , the city of Lima was looted by Chilean forces , such as in the case of the National Library of Peru . After the occupation , Chile diverted part of its war efforts to crush Mapuche resistance in the south , with some of its equipment captured from Peruvian troops , as well as civilians . Chilean troops coming from Peru entered Araucanía where they in 1881 defeated the last major Mapuche uprising .

The 1982 Aloha Bowl was an American college football bowl game played on December 25 , 1982 at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu , Hawaii . The inaugural Aloha Bowl game pitted the Washington Huskies and the Maryland Terrapins . This was the first bowl game played in Hawaii since the Pineapple Bowl in 1952 .
Background
After a Rose Bowl championship the year prior , the Huskies began the season ranked # 2 in the nation . They responded by winning their first seven games of the season while rising to # 1 in the polls after the first week , though they slipped to # 2 before a matchup with Stanford . A 43-31 loss to the Cardinal ( who finished 5-6 that year ) dropped them to # 10 , but they responded with wins over # 9 UCLA and # 3 Arizona State to get back to # 5 heading into the final game of the year against Washington State in the Apple Cup , with a chance to win the conference title . However , they fell 24-20 to the Cougars ( who finished 3-7-1 ) , which dropped them to second in the Pacific-10 Conference behind UCLA ( who had a 5-1-1 conference record ) . Despite this , the Huskies were invited to the Aloha Bowl , their fourth straight bowl game and fifth bowl game in six seasons . Maryland , in its first season with Bobby Ross as coach , rebounded from a 4-6-1 record the previous year to win eight games . Maryland began the season with two losses to ranked opponents ( # 7 Penn State and # 17 West Virginia ) by a combined total of nine points . They did not lose another game for two months , winning seven straight games ( including a 31-24 win over # 10 North Carolina ) , while rising to # 19 in the polls . They lost to # 11 Clemson two weeks later , though they did rebound with a win over Virginia in the regular season finale to rise to # 16 in the polls while finishing 2nd in the Atlantic Coast Conference . This was their eighth bowl game in 10 seasons .

Thor was an American manufacturer of motorcycles and motorcycle parts especially engines , founded in 1901 in Aurora , Illinois . From 1901 to about 1907 it made engines under license for Indian Motocycles ( note spelling ) of Springfield , Massachusetts , , which Thor was also allowed to sell on the open market . Thor also sold a large variety of parts especially cylinder heads .
and when the agreement finally ended , entered the motorcycle market on its own selling complete bikes until about 1920 . Some of its success were supplying engines to many motorcycle manufactures of the period , some record setting bikes in the early 1910s , and V-Twin engine with automatic valves .
Although Thor motorcycles ceased production , it continued as a brand of household appliances by the parent Aurora Automatic Machinery Company which survived . Aurora Automatic Machinery Company had previously made cast metal parts in the late 1800s .
Summary
Thor made engines for Indian from 1901 to 1907 when they introduced their own cycle ; before then they only made engines and parts for other makers . In 1910 Thor introduced a V-Twin engine , and mounted one cylinder straight up unlike in the more V shape that became common later in the century . By 1913 they had developed a more advanced larger displacement engine and it was mounted with both cylinders at angles , in the typical V-shape .
Thor stopped making motorcycle engines in 1916 , and production dwindled in the late 1910s .
History
Thor was the motorcycle marque of Aurora Automatic Machinery Company , which produced motorcycle engines for Indian motorcycles and went on to produce its own line of motorized bicycles in the early 1900s . Aurora holds a special place in transportation history , employing Oscar Hedstrom , Al Crocker , and Bill Ottoway , famous for Indian motorcycles , Crocker Motorcycles , and Harley-Davidson respectively at one time or another . Aurora started in 1886 as a machine shop and is known for making parts for bicycles in its early period .
In 1901 Oscar Hedstrom worked with Aurora to make engines for Indian motorcycles , and by 1902 they had made 150 motors for Indian . As part of their agreement Aurora was allowed to sell the motors to other parties and pay Indian a royalty . Aurora also continued to make other bike parts but not a complete bike . Finally Indian started producing their own parts and Aurora then went on to produce their own complete motorcycle known as Thor motorcycles . The agreement between the two companies expired in 1907 . Before that time , Thor did not make complete bikes and Indian used the Thor manufactured engines of Hedstrom 's design . After the split Thor began to innovate new features and this included the F-head engine , a V-twin engine , and automatic ( aka mechanical ) valves on the engine .
In 1908 Thor achieved automatic intake valves on their engine and offered many typical options for the day . During this time there were options like battery ignition and belt drive . In 1913 Thor offered a Schebler carburetor on its 1200 cc twin . Thor also used updraft carburetors on their engines . In 1916 they offered a 3-speed transmission on their cycle . Another option was an acetylene lamp for light .
A Thor motorcycle was used in the 1913 Charlie Chaplin film ( 18 minutes long ) Mabel at the Wheel .
Thor stopped making motorcycle engines in 1916 , and production dwindled in the late 1910s . In the early 1910s sales began to decline , and one of the factors may have been the rise of the Ford Model T .
An example of a Thor product was the Model 13U , which had an overall blue color scheme with white tires and a 7-horsepower twin cylinder internal combustion engine . One of the four surviving Thor Model 13U is at the National Motorcycle Museum in Iowa , USA .
Racing
Thor hired William Ottaway in 1909 , and he led Thor to success in motorcycle racing during his tenure until he left the company in 1913 . Ottaway was noted for his ability to tune engines and Thor set national records with Thor bikes . At this time much of the racing was on dirt tracks or tracks of wooden boards , and racing was noted as important for of recognition on the motorcycle market . ( see also Board track racing )
An example of a Thor racing bike was the 1912 Thor Board Track Racer , which shipped in special Thor box . They were called board track racers because in this day , the racing courses were made of planks of wood to make the race track , hence a 'board track ' . The wooden tracks were called motordromes and were quite dangerous to drivers and the crowds . Most of the sport 's stars died racing and its popularity had diminished by the 1920s according to the Smithsonian Institution .
Engines
Thor supplied engines to many manufacturers including :
Sears ( Sears Roebuck sold via mail-order motorcycles from 1913 to 1916 )
Chicago
Reading Standard
Indian ( Hendee co )
Torpedo motorcycles
Thor also made parts and castings for Flying Merkel , Reading Standard , Henderson Motorcycle , and Harley-Davidson .
Henderson sold motorbikes from 1912 to the end of 1931 .
Flying Merkel sold motorbikes from 1911 to 1915 .
Sears sold from 1913 to 1916 .
Models
Here are some examples of models offered :
Model 13-M ( 4 hp single )
Model 13-W ( 5 hp single )
Model 13-U ( 7 hp twin )
A two-speed was offered as an option on each of the motorcycles for an extra fee .
Additional examples :
Thor Model 7
Thor Model 14A
Thor Model O ( had a V-twin with mechanical inlet valves )
Thor Model U ( this had a re-designed V-twin )
Thor Model V
Thor Model M
Thor Model W ( came with a 5 hp single cylinder engine in 1911 )
Aurora also supplied Sears for a short time before they switched to a different company in the early 1910s . ( see also Sears Dreadnought )

ARAYA is a 2016 first person adventure/horror game , developed by MAD Virtual Reality Studio for Microsoft Windows .
Plot
The story is told from the perspective of 3 different characters : Marisa , Araya 's best friend who enters the hospital after receiving a mysterious text from Araya ; Rama , the hospital 's security guard , and Boon who enters the hospital to fulfill a gambling debt . The story 's perspective shifts between the three characters as players explore different areas of a derelict Bangkok hospital , in order to piece together the mysterious circumstances and solve the murder case of Araya .
Araya was a bipolar and misanthropic young woman who found friendship and comfort with Marisa . Despite Marisa 's warning against it , Araya enters a relationship with a playboy named Sorn . The relationship results in an unwanted pregnancy and causes conflict between the couple . For an unknown reason , Sorn procures a `` sleeping '' pill and gives it to Araya ; the pill turns out to be lethal and kills Araya . Not wanting to be blamed for her death , Sorn takes Araya 's body to the hospital 's parking garage , where he hangs her by a noose and later dies by accident .
A year after Araya 's death , Marisa gets a text from her and goes to the now-desolate hospital to investigate . During her exploration , Marisa is chased by a man named Jit , who previously worked there and now stays for an unknown reason , and is knocked unconscious by him .
Rama wakes up after having fallen asleep in the guardhouse and patrols the hospital grounds . Rama spots Jit , who he previously knew , and the unconscious Marisa , and is chased by Jit . Rama later calls for help and meets up with his boss at a different area within the hospital . However , Rama 's boss is ambushed and seemingly killed by Jit . Jit chases Rama again , but is knocked out by a falling shelf .
Boon , enters the hospital to complete a task for a gang in order to fulfill his gambling debt . He is encountering the hospital 's many ghosts , including a gigantic `` Preta , '' a spirit believed to be children that have sinned against their parents and are punished after death . Later , Boon finally crosses paths with Rama , who tells him to escape while he goes to help Marisa .
After reawakening , Marisa explores the hospital once again , following Araya 's spirit . She is once again chased by Jit and falls down an elevator shaft , but is unharmed . Marisa enters a room that has been turned into a ritual chamber where she finds the corpse of Araya , causing her to faint . She wakes up and walks through a nightmarish labyrinth . Towards the end of the maze she hears Sorn and Araya 's argument over her pregnancy . Marisa then finds Araya 's spirit hanging in the spot where Sorn had left her , whereupon Araya transforms into a vengeful ghost , believing that there is no one left who truly cares for her .
Rama arrives at the ritual chamber and sees Marisa and Araya 's corpse . Rama examines Araya 's corpse and removes the ritual nail from her forehead , freeing her spirit . After trying to awake Marisa , Jit enters the room and attacks him . Rama overpowers him and the player is given the option to either kill or spare Jit . Rama 's boss reappears and knocks him out , blaming Rama for ruining their plan , which involved he and Jit using Araya 's spirit for financial gain . Araya 's ghost appears behind Rama 's boss and attacks him , causing him to knock over an altar of candles , causing a fire that rapidly engulfs the hospital .
Marisa wakes up and runs for the exit , avoiding the fire and Araya . At the exit , the ghost blocks her path . Two endings can occur depending on whether or not Jit was spared . If spared , Jit arrives and stabs the spirit with his sacred dagger . If Jit is killed , it is Rama who attacks Araya instead . Either way , all three main characters escape the now burning hospital .
Marisa wakes up outside the hospital , under care of the police that have arrived on the scene . Rama stares at the burning building , and Boon frantically explains what happened to a policeman . If Jit is spared , he is seen sitting on the ground outside holding his head in his hands . As Marisa looks up at the blaze , an unknown person reaches for her hand .
Characters
Marisa : A brave , confident girl and the only friend Araya ever had . She came to the hospital because she got a message from her who mysteriously disappeared a year ago .
Rama : A security guard at the hospital , he witnessed a strange event while he was on patrol .
Boon : A young guy scared of his own shadow . He is crazy about collecting amulets and is on a mission at the hospital to wipe out his gambling debts once and for all .

In pre-Christian Fijian mythology , Murimuria is part of the underworld . According to Fijian religion , after a man dies , his soul is brought over a stretch of water by a ferryman , and has to face many dangers on the other side by going through the Path of the Souls ( Sala Ni Yalo ) . For unmarried men , there seems to be no chance of surviving this path , because even if they escape the Great Woman , they would be killed by the monster Nangganangga , since no one ever got away from it , while married men could survive , if they withstand the Pandanus tree and the armed giant Killer of Souls . The survivors are judged by the god called Degei . Those who had the favor of Degei ( chiefs with great wealth and many wives , who were destroyers of many towns , killers of many enemies and rulers over a powerful people ) are instructed not to try to cross the lake . These go to Burotu . The rest inevitably try to cross the lake by a boat that always capsizes . They eventually sink to the bottom , Murimuria , and are rewarded and punished appropriately .
Murimuria is considered a place neither of happiness , nor of unhappiness . As such , residence in Murimuria is characterized by both punishment and peace . Some of the souls in Murimuria are punished for sins committed while alive . However , these sins do not necessarily correspond to Christian notions of sin . Those who did not kill an enemy in life are forced to pound muck with clubs , which is regarded as the most degrading punishment . Those who did not have their ears pierced are forced to carry upon their shoulders for ever logs of wood upon which tapa cloth is beaten out , jeered by all who see them . Women who were not tattooed are chased by ghosts who use sharp shells to tear at their skin or turn them into bread . Anyone who has done an act which displeases the gods are laid in rows on their faces and turned into taro beds .

Floyd County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky . As of the 2020 census , the population was 35,942 . Its county seat is Prestonsburg . The county , founded in 1800 , is named for Colonel John Floyd ( 1750–1783 ) .
History
On December 13 , 1799 , the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation to form Floyd County as the 40th county of Kentucky . The county was made from parts of Fleming , Montgomery , and Mason County , Kentucky . The legislation became effective on June 1 , 1800 . The county was named for James John Floyd , a pioneer surveyor who helped lay out the city of Louisville . The county seat was Preston 's Station , later renamed Prestonsburg . The first court house burned down on April 8 , 1808 , destroying all the early records , so the earliest records of government activity do not date prior to 1808 . Prestonsburg was used as a Confederate stronghold during the Civil War and two battles took place nearby , the Battle of Ivy Mountain on November 8 , 1861 , and the Battle of Middle Creek on January 10 , 1862 . Both were Union victories .
On February 28 , 1958 , the county was the site of one of the deadliest bus accidents in U.S. history , leaving 27 people dead .
On June 30 , 2022 , a mass shooting targeting police officers occurred in Allen , a city in Floyd County . Three police officers and a police dog were killed , and four other people were injured . The alleged shooter , 49-year-old Lance Storz , was arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder of a police officer .
Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau , the county has a total area of , of which is land and ( 0.6 % ) is water .

However , most of these Melungeon families have now spread out or moved away , and so they can not be defined by one valley , ridge , hollow , watershed , area , etc . However , some of their known historic residences were : The upper waters of both the Right and Left Forks of Beaver Creek , as well as its smaller streams , branches , and forks ; extending into Knott County as well .

Politics
Floyd County is traditionally a Democratic county . The county gave Bill Clinton over 65 % in both 1992 and 1996 while George W. Bush never received more than 38 % of the county 's vote . Like the rest of the state outside of Jefferson County ( Louisville ) and Fayette County ( Lexington ) , the county eventually shifted to the Republican Party , but became one of the last counties in Kentucky to make that transition . In 2008 its votes went to the Republican Party 's presidential candidate for the first time in the county 's history . The county has trended strongly Republican in the past two Presidential elections , giving Donald Trump 72.5 % of its vote in 2016 , only slightly less than traditional totals in long-standing rock-ribbed Republican Kentucky counties like Jackson County and Clay County .
Floyd County is part of Kentucky 's 5th congressional district , which has been represented by Republican Hal Rogers since 1981 .

Carole LaBonne is a Developmental and Stem Cell Biologist at Northwestern University . She is the Erastus O . Haven Professor of Life Sciences , and Chair of the Department of Molecular Biosciences .
Education and early career
LaBonne received her bachelor 's degree from the University of Rochester , doing research with Sayeeda Zain on the molecular basis of Alzheimer 's disease . Inspired by the work of famed embryologist and Rochester emeritus professor Johannes Holtfreter , LaBonne pursued doctoral work at Harvard University studying germ layer formation using Xenopus as a model . As a National Science Foundation pre-doctoral Fellow working with Malcolm Whitman , LaBonne characterized the role of FGF signaling in formation of the mesendoderm . During her doctoral study , LaBonne discovered that activin-mediated mesoderm induction required FGF signaling and elucidated the role of RAS-Map Kinase signaling in this process .
Following her graduate work , LaBonne pursued post-doctoral work at the California Institute of Technology as an American Cancer Society Fellow working with Marianne Bronner on the molecular mechanisms underlying the early development of neural crest cells . She showed that formation of neural crest cells , a stem cell population unique to vertebrates , required both attenuation of endogenous BMP signaling and active Wnt signaling , and further showed that up regulation of the zinc-finger transcriptional repressor SNAI2 could bypass the need for BMP inhibition . In subsequent work she demonstrated that Snail-family proteins are required for both establishing the neural crest stem cell state and for the migratory and invasive behavior of neural crest cells , a role these factors also play in metastasizing tumor cells .
Research and career
LaBonne started her independent laboratory at Northwestern University in 2001 in the department of Molecular Biosciences ( formerly Biochemistry , Molecular Biology and Cell Biology ) . She became a tenured associate professor in 2007 , and a full professor in 2012 . She was appointed the Erastus O . Haven Professor of Life Sciences in 2017 . LaBonne has served as co-leader of the Tumor Environment and Metastasis Program in Northwestern 's Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center since 2005 . She served as director of Northwestern 's Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences PhD program from 2009-2017 . She currently serves as co-director of the NCI funded Oncogenesis and Developmental Biology Training Program , and as Director of Northwestern 's training cluster in Developmental , Systems and Stem Cell Biology . She was appointed Chair of the Department of Molecular Biosciences in 2017 .
Research in the LaBonne laboratory was the first to link Myc to the acquisition of stem cell attributes , and demonstrated that Myc plays a central role in neural crest ontogeny , several years prior to the initial report of the Yamanaka factors . This work proposed that Myc plays this key role in many stem cell populations , and more recent work by others has shown this to be the case . LaBonne 's group subsequently demonstrated that Id3 was a key Myc target in maintaining neural crest potency . The growing realization of the commonalities between pluripotent blastula inner cell mass cells/embryonic stem cells and neural crest cells led LaBonne 's group to proposed a new model in which neural crest cells arose via retention of the regulatory network controlling pluripotency in blastula cells and showed that neural crest cells possess a previously unrecognized capacity to form endoderm . This pioneering work created a new framework for studying these developmentally and clinically important cells . The LaBonne lab also demonstrated a role for FGF signaling in the retention of pluripotency underling neural crest genesis , and discovered that a novel switching of effector pathways , from Map Kinase to PI3 Kinase , controls the transit from pluripotency to lineage restriction . Recent work in the LaBonne lab has focused on the epigenetic control of pluripotency in naïve blastula cells , including a central role for HDAC activity in both maintaining blastula pluripotentcy and establishment of the neural crest stem cell population .

National Digital Inclusion Alliance ( NDIA ) is a US nonprofit organization that brings together over 600 non-profit organizations , policy-makers , and academics to advocate for national access to broadband and to put an end to the multiple digital divides .
NDIA has provided community-vetted definitions of digital equity and digital inclusion , puts on an annual conference called Net Inclusion , and sponsors an annual Digital Inclusion Week .
NDIA argues that the US government needs `` an organized federal strategy '' to get broadband to rural and other underserved areas and have worked to support the expansion of the Federal Communications Commission 's Lifeline program to expand to include broadband subsidies .
NDIA was founded in May 2015 under the auspices of the PAST Foundation in order to be `` a unified voice for local technology training , home broadband access , and public broadband access programs . '' NDIA is a membership-based organization , and is an independent 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) as of 2021 . As of October 2021 , NDIA had 604 affiliated organizations .
Impact
NDIA uses data from the American Community Survey to highlight how many households in the U.S. lack `` fixed broadband internet subscriptions '' to create a list of America 's worst connected cities .
Using FCC broadband availability data , NDIA did a six-month mapping analysis of Cleveland neighborhoods showing the distribution of its highest and lowest internet speeds . Using this data , they accused AT & T of `` digital redlining '' via a formal complaint with the FCC claiming AT & T did not make upgrades in low-income neighborhoods while deploying fiber in wealthier neighborhoods . Former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai used this report to encourage the creation of `` Gigabit Opportunity Zones '' in low-income areas in the U.S .

VAX ( an acronym for Virtual Address eXtension ) is a series of computers featuring a 32-bit instruction set architecture ( ISA ) and virtual memory that was developed and sold by Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) in the late 20th century . The VAX-11/780 , introduced October 25 , 1977 , was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing the VAX ISA . The VAX family was a huge success for DEC - over 100 models were introduced over the lifetime of the design , with the last members arriving in the early 1990s . The VAX was succeeded by the DEC Alpha , which included several features from VAX machines to make porting from the VAX easier .
VAX was designed as a successor to the 16-bit PDP-11 , one of the most successful minicomputers in history with approximately 600,000 examples sold . The system was designed to offer backward compatibility with the PDP-11 while extending the memory to a full 32-bit implementation and adding demand paged virtual memory . The name VAX refers to its Virtual Address eXtension concept that allowed programs to make use of this newly available memory while still being compatible with unmodified user mode PDP-11 code . The name `` VAX-11 '' , used on early models , was chosen to highlight this capability . The VAX ISA is considered a complex instruction set computer ( CISC ) design .
Later models in the series dropped the -11 branding as PDP-11 compatibility was no longer a major concern . The line expanded to both high-end machines like the VAX 9000 and to the workstation-scale systems like the VAXstation series . The VAX family ultimately contained ten distinct designs and over 100 individual models in total . All of these were compatible with each other and normally ran the VAX/VMS operating system .
VAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA , with its very large number of assembly language programmer-friendly addressing modes and machine instructions , highly orthogonal instruction set architecture , and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion , number formatting , and polynomial evaluation .
Name
The name `` VAX '' originated as an acronym for Virtual Address eXtension , both because the VAX was seen as a 32-bit extension of the older 16-bit PDP-11 and because it was ( after Prime Computer ) an early adopter of virtual memory to manage this larger address space .
Early versions of the VAX processor implement a `` compatibility mode '' that emulates many of the PDP-11 's instructions , giving it the 11 in VAX-11 to highlight this compatibility . Later versions offloaded the compatibility mode and some of the less used CISC instructions to emulation in the operating system software .
Instruction set
The VAX instruction set was designed to be powerful and orthogonal . When it was introduced , many programs were written in assembly language , so having a `` programmer-friendly '' instruction set was important . In time , as more programs were written in high-level programming languages , the instruction set became less visible , and the only ones much concerned about it were compiler writers .
One unusual aspect of the VAX instruction set is the presence of register masks at the start of each subprogram . These are arbitrary bit patterns that specify , when control is passed to the subprogram , which registers are to be preserved . Since register masks are a form of data embedded within the executable code , they can make linear parsing of the machine code difficult . This can complicate optimization techniques that are applied on machine code .
Operating systems
The native VAX operating system is Digital 's VAX/VMS ( renamed to OpenVMS in 1991 or early 1992 when it was ported to Alpha , modified to comply with POSIX standards , and branded as compliant with XPG4 by the X/Open consortium ) . The VAX architecture and VMS operating system were `` engineered concurrently '' to take maximum advantage of each other , as was the initial implementation of the VAXcluster facility .
During the 1980s , a hypervisor for the VAX architecture named VMM ( Virtual Machine Monitor ) , also known as the VAX Security Kernel , was developed at Digital with the aim of allowing multiple isolated instances of VMS and ULTRIX to be run on the same hardware . VMM was intended to achieve TCSEC A1 compliance . By the late 1980s , it was operational on VAX 8000 series hardware , but was abandoned before release to customers .
Other VAX operating systems have included various releases of Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) UNIX up to 4.3BSD , Ultrix-32 , VAXELN , and Xinu . More recently , NetBSD and OpenBSD have supported various VAX models and some work has been done on porting Linux to the VAX architecture . OpenBSD discontinued support for the architecture in September 2016 .
History
The first VAX model sold was the VAX-11/780 , which was introduced on October 25 , 1977 , at the Digital Equipment Corporation 's Annual Meeting of Shareholders . Bill Strecker , C. Gordon Bell 's doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University , was responsible for the architecture . Many different models with different prices , performance levels , and capacities were subsequently created . VAX superminicomputers were very popular in the early 1980s .
For a while the VAX-11/780 was used as a standard in CPU benchmarks . It was initially described as a one-MIPS machine , because its performance was equivalent to an IBM System/360 that ran at one MIPS , and the System/360 implementations had previously been de facto performance standards . The actual number of instructions executed in 1 second was about 500,000 , which led to complaints of marketing exaggeration . The result was the definition of a `` VAX MIPS , '' the speed of a VAX-11/780 ; a computer performing at 27 VAX MIPS would run the same program roughly 27 times faster than the VAX-11/780 .
Within the Digital community the term VUP ( VAX Unit of Performance ) was the more common term , because MIPS do not compare well across different architectures . The related term cluster VUPs was informally used to describe the aggregate performance of a VAXcluster . ( The performance of the VAX-11/780 still serves as the baseline metric in the BRL-CAD Benchmark , a performance analysis suite included in the BRL-CAD solid modeling software distribution . ) The VAX-11/780 included a subordinate stand-alone LSI-11 computer that performed microcode load , booting , and diagnostic functions for the parent computer . This was dropped from subsequent VAX models . Enterprising VAX-11/780 users could therefore run three different Digital Equipment Corporations operating systems : VMS on the VAX processor ( from the hard drives ) , and either RSX-11S or RT-11 on the LSI-11 ( from the single density single drive floppy disk ) .
The VAX went through many different implementations . The original VAX 11/780 was implemented in TTL and filled a four-by-five-foot cabinet with a single CPU . Through the 1980s , the high-end of the family was continually improved using ever-faster discrete components , an evolution that ended with the introduction of the VAX 9000 in October 1989 . This design proved too complex and expensive and was ultimately abandoned not long after introduction . CPU implementations that consisted of multiple emitter-coupled logic ( ECL ) gate array or macrocell array chips included the VAX 8600 and 8800 superminis and finally the VAX 9000 mainframe class machines . CPU implementations that consisted of multiple MOSFET custom chips included the 8100 and 8200 class machines . The VAX 11-730 and 725 low-end machines were built using AMD Am2901 bit-slice components for the ALU .
The MicroVAX I represented a major transition within the VAX family . At the time of its design , it was not yet possible to implement the full VAX architecture as a single VLSI chip ( or even a few VLSI chips as was later done with the V-11 CPU of the VAX 8200/8300 ) . Instead , the MicroVAX I was the first VAX implementation to move some of the more complex VAX instructions ( such as the packed decimal and related opcodes ) into emulation software . This partitioning substantially reduced the amount of microcode required and was referred to as the `` MicroVAX '' architecture . In the MicroVAX I , the ALU and registers were implemented as a single gate-array chip while the rest of the machine control was conventional logic .
A full VLSI ( microprocessor ) implementation of the MicroVAX architecture arrived with the MicroVAX II 's 78032 ( or DC333 ) CPU and 78132 ( DC335 ) FPU . The 78032 was the first microprocessor with an on-board memory management unit The MicroVAX II was based on a single , quad-sized processor board which carried the processor chips and ran the MicroVMS or Ultrix-32 operating systems . The machine featured 1 MB of on-board memory and a Q22-bus interface with DMA transfers . The MicroVAX II was succeeded by many further MicroVAX models with much improved performance and memory .
Further VLSI VAX processors followed in the form of the V-11 , CVAX , CVAX SOC ( `` System On Chip '' , a single-chip CVAX ) , Rigel , Mariah and NVAX implementations . The VAX microprocessors extended the architecture to inexpensive workstations and later also supplanted the high-end VAX models . This wide range of platforms ( mainframe to workstation ) using one architecture was unique in the computer industry at that time . Sundry graphics were etched onto the CVAX microprocessor die . The phrase CVAX ... when you care enough to steal the very best was etched in broken Russian as a play on a Hallmark Cards slogan , intended as a message to Soviet engineers who were known to be both purloining DEC computers for military applications and reverse engineering their chip design. < ref > The Computer History Simulation Project : CVAX ( 1987 ) , retrieved January 30 , 2008 < /ref > By the late 1980s , the VAX microprocessors had grown in power to be competitive with discrete designs . This led to the abandonment of the 8000 and 9000 series and their replacement by Rigel-powered models of the VAX 6000 , and later by NVAX-powered VAX 7000 systems .
In DEC 's product offerings , the VAX architecture was eventually superseded by RISC technology . In 1989 DEC introduced a range of workstations and servers that ran Ultrix , the DECstation and DECsystem respectively , based on processors that implemented the MIPS architecture . In 1992 DEC introduced their own RISC instruction set architecture , the Alpha AXP ( later renamed Alpha ) , and their own Alpha-based microprocessor , the DECchip 21064 , a high performance 64-bit design capable of running OpenVMS .
In August 2000 , Compaq announced that the remaining VAX models would be discontinued by the end of the year , but old systems remain in widespread use . The Stromasys CHARON-VAX and SIMH software-based VAX emulators remain available . VMS is now developed by VMS Software Incorporated , albeit only for the Alpha , HPE Integrity , and x86-64 platforms .
Processor architecture
Virtual memory map
The VAX virtual memory is divided into four sections . Each is one gigabyte ( in the context of addressing , 230 bytes ) in size :
For VMS , P0 was used for user process space , P1 for process stack , S0 for the operating system , and S1 was reserved .
Privilege modes
The VAX has four hardware implemented privilege modes :

VAX-based systems
The first VAX-based system was the VAX-11/780 , a member of the VAX-11 family . The high-end VAX 8600 replaced the VAX-11/780 in October 1984 and was joined by the entry-level MicroVAX minicomputers and the VAXstation workstations in the mid-1980s . The MicroVAX was superseded by the VAX 4000 , the VAX 8000 was superseded by the VAX 6000 in the late 1980s and the mainframe-class VAX 9000 was introduced . In the early 1990s , the fault-tolerant VAXft was introduced , as were the Alpha compatible VAX 7000/10000 . A variant of various VAX-based systems were sold as the VAXserver .
SImultaneous Machine ACceSs ( SIMACS ) System Industries developed an ability to give more than one DEC CPU , but not at the same time , write access to a shared disk . They implemented an enhancement named SImultaneous Machine ACceSs ( SIMACS ) , which allowed their special disk controller to set a semaphore flag for disk access , allowing multiple WRITES to the same files ; the disk is shared by multiple DEC systems . SIMACS also existed on PDP-11 RSTS systems .
Canceled systems
Canceled systems include the BVAX , a high-end emitter-coupled logic ( ECL ) based VAX , and two other ECL-based VAX models : Argonaut and Raven . Raven was canceled in 1990 . A VAX named Gemini was also canceled , which was a fall-back in case the LSI-based Scorpio failed . It never shipped .
Clones
A number of VAX clones , both authorized and unauthorized , were produced . Examples include :
Systime Computers Ltd of the United Kingdom produced clones of early VAX models such as the Systime 8750 ( equivalent to the VAX 11/750 ) .
Norden Systems produced the ruggedized , Military-specification MIL VAX series .
The Hungarian Central Research Institute for Physics ( KFKI ) produced a series of clones of early VAX models , the TPA-11/540 , 560 and 580 .
The SM 52/12 from Czechoslovakia , developed at VUVT Žilina ( today Slovakia ) and produced from 1986 at ZVT Banská Bystrica ( today Slovakia ) .
The East German VEB Robotron K 1840 ( SM 1710 ) is a clone of the VAX-11/780 and Robotron K 1820 ( SM 1720 ) is a copy of the MicroVAX II .
The SM-1700 is a Soviet clone of the VAX-11/730 , SM-1702 was a clone of MicroVAX II and SM-1705 '' was a clone of VAX-11/785 . These systems ran a variety of clone operating systems - DEMOS ( based on BSD Unix ) , MOS VP ( based on VAX/VMS ) or MOS VP RV ( based on VAXELN ) .
The NCI-2780 Super-mini , also sold as Taiji-2780 , is a clone of the VAX-11/780 developed by North China Institute of Computing Technology in Beijing .

Crystal Reports is a business intelligence application marketed to small- and medium-sized businesses by SAP .
History
Terry Cunningham and the Cunningham Group originated the software in 1984 . Crystal Services Inc. marketed the product ( originally called `` Quik Reports '' ) when they could not find a suitable commercial report writer for an accounting software they developed add-on products for , which was ACCPAC Plus for DOS ( later acquired by SAGE ) . After producing versions 1.0 through 3.0 , Crystal Services was acquired by Seagate Technology in 1994 . Crystal Services was combined with Holistic Systems to form the Information Management Group of Seagate Software , which later rebranded as Crystal Decisions and produced versions 4.0 through 9.0 . Crystal Decisions was acquired in December 2003 by BusinessObjects , which produced versions 10 , 11 ( XI ) and version 12 ( 2008 ) .
SAP acquired BusinessObjects on October 8 , 2007 , and released Crystal Reports 2011 ( version 14 ) on May 3 , 2011 . The latest version released is Crystal Reports 2020 ( 14.3.x ) on June 13 , 2020 .
The file extension for Crystal Reports ' proprietary file format is .rpt . The design file can be saved without data , or with data for later viewing or sharing . Introduced with the release of Crystal Reports 2011 ( version 14.0 ) , the read-only .rptr file extension option allows for viewing , but can not be modified once exported .
Several other applications , including Microsoft Visual Studio versions 2003 through 2008 , and Borland Delphi , at one time bundled an OEM version of Crystal Reports as a general purpose reporting tool . Microsoft discontinued this practice and later released their own competing reporting tool , SQL Server Reporting Services ( SSRS ) .

Rejowiec ( ; or ) is a town in Chełm County , Lublin Voivodeship , in eastern Poland . It is the seat of the gmina ( administrative district ) called Gmina Rejowiec . It lies approximately south-west of Chełm and east of the regional capital Lublin .
The town has a population of 2,114 .
Rejowiec is located about 40 km south of Lublin , close to an intersection of railroads and roads .
History
The village was established in the 16th century by a family of noblemen named Rej , who were active in spreading the Calvinist religion , and established a religious college in the village .
In 1547 , Rejowiec received acknowledgement ( and privileges ) as a town , from King Sigismund I the Old , including the right to hold two annual fairs , and an exemption from taxes for 10 years . In the 17th century the owners of Rejowiec changed a number of times , and the Calvinist College was closed . In the 18th century , when the number Catholics started to grow , the remaining Calvinist population dwindled and by the end of this century there were no more Calvinists in the town .
It was annexed by Austria in the late-18th-century Partitions of Poland . It was regained by Poles in the Austro-Polish War of 1809 and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw . After its dissolution in 1815 , it fell to the Russian Partition of Poland . In the second half of the 19th century , a copper casting factory and two tanneries were established in Rejowiec . Rejowiec was one of many towns deprived of its town rights around 1870 as punishment for the Polish January Uprising . The biggest industrial factory in Rejowiec ( until 1939 ) was the glass factory that employed 180 workers .
After World War I , in 1918 , Poland regained independence and control of Rejowiec . On 1 January 2017 , Rejowiec was granted again its town status .
World War II
During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland , which started World War II in September 1939 , the town was invaded by Germany and then occupied until 1944 . Before the invasion , the Jewish population of the town was between 2,500 and 3,500 . The director of the local sugar factory , Jan Sztaba , was among more than 115 prominent Poles from the region murdered by the Germans in Kumowa Dolina in 1940 during the AB-Aktion . Rejowiec became the location of a transit ghetto where Jews from Europe were sent . More than 5,000 Jews from Slovakia were sent to the ghetto , as well as Jews from Germany , Hungary , Czechoslovakia and other parts of occupied Poland . In April and October 1942 , there were transports to Sobibor gas chambers . In May 1942 , there was transport to the Belzec extermination camp . Additionally , small groups of Jews were transported to local labor camps such located in Krychów , Sawin , Sajczyce and Chełm . In the spring of 1943 , a group of 200 to 400 remaining Jews in the city were sent to Majdanek gas chambers . The Jewish community ceased to exist .
Sports
The local football club is Unia Rejowiec . It competes in the lower leagues .

John M. Noel ( born February 26 , 1948 ) is an American entrepreneur and philanthropist best known for founding Travel Guard International , the world 's largest travel insurer and a division of the American International Group subsidiary , Chartis .
Noel was the President of Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection until he stepped down in 2015 , and former Chairman and CEO of the Noel Group , a family of worldwide companies and investments located in Stevens Point , Wisconsin , that operate under the credo , “ Our direction is led by our values. ” John Noel and his wife , Patty , support numerous charitable efforts domestically and internationally .
Business career
In 1982 , Noel developed the travel-insurance concept while working at Sentry Insurance . Noel purchased the rights to the product concept , worked with travel agents on its development , and by 1985 Travel Guard was operating out of the basement of Noel 's home . When the company was sold to AIG in 2006 , Travel Guard was producing nearly $ 250M in annual gross premium . Noel remained as Travel Guard 's CEO until 2009 , exceeding revenue and profitability goals over the three years from the sale of the company to his departure . During that time , Noel also helped create an errors-and-omissions insurance product for the travel industry . After selling Travel Guard , Noel collected the other companies he had founded or purchased and gathered them under the Noel Group umbrella . Noel Group companies have included the travel agency Marathon Travel ; MultiNational Underwriters , a medical-insurance carrier for travelers and expatriates ; My Assist , a personal-assistance , mobile-telematics , and data-collection service ; Compass Properties , a property-management firm ; and Insure America , an insurance company serving travel agents . Noel Group sold MultiNational Underwriters to HCC Insurance Holdings in 2009 . In 2016 , Noel was inducted into the Wisconsin Business Hall of Fame .
Sale of Noel Group assets to Berkshire Hathaway
On Jan. 27 , 2014 , it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance had signed an agreement with Noel Group to purchase the assets of MyAssist and Insure America .
The purchase allows BHSI to offer its customers 24-hour global personal assistance , virtual-concierge and connected vehicle service as well as travel-industry liability insurance .
All operations of the company remain in Stevens Point .
Philanthropic efforts
In 1993 , John and his wife , Patty , established the Make A Mark Foundation . Partners donate time , abilities , and finances to build clinics , schools , and orphanages in developing countries worldwide , with a focus on AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa . Make A Mark created Nyumbani Village in Kitui , Kenya , in 1993 , making it the largest orphanage of its kind in the world . The village houses almost 1,000 AIDS orphans along with grandparents who also lost children to AIDS . Noel worked with the Kenyan government to create Nyumbani using a self-sustaining model that employs the melia tree to produce lumber and generate revenue and food forests to provide fruits and vegetables to eat and sell . The food-forest effort is a project of Trees 4 Children , a Make A Mark initiative that applies business solutions to problems of sustainability and subsistence . Make A Mark is expanding the Trees 4 Children model to villages around the world .
In Wisconsin , the Noels co-founded the local Boys and Girls Club , are major benefactors of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and have helped launch seed schools in Milwaukee and other urban areas . In recognition of their philanthropic endeavors , the Noels were awarded the Franklin Covey Humanitarian Service Award , given to “ outstanding individuals who reach out to improve the quality of life for individuals , groups or humankind. ” They have also received the Stevens Point Area Public School District Community Service Recognition Award and the William C. Hansen Distinguished Service Award , and been recognized for their contributions to Nyumbani Village .
In October , 2009 at the State of Wisconsin Area Council Conference in Milwaukee , John Noel was awarded the prestigious `` President 's Volunteer Service Award '' for his volunteer work associated with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Portage County . An initiative of the President 's Council on Service and Civic Participation , the President 's Volunteer Service Award is issued on behalf of the President of the United States to recognize the best in American spirit , and to encourage all Americans to improve their communities through volunteer service and civic participation . Established in 2003 , this award was created by President George W.

University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point
Noel received a bachelor 's degree from University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point ( UWSP ) in 1971 . He was named UWSP `` Alumni of the Year ” in 1999 , and the university 's new performing-arts center was dedicated as the Noel Fine Arts Center in 2006 .

The 3110 is a GSM mobile phone handset manufactured by Nokia in Hungary , introduced at CEBIT in March 1997 . The 3110 is notable as the first Nokia handset to feature the 'Navi-Key ' ( a.k.a . D-Pad ) menu navigation system . The Navi-Key was featured heavily on Nokia handsets , especially the entry-level models such as the Nokia 1100 in the following years . Unlike its successor , the 3210 , and subsequent handsets of similar design , the 3110 had an external antenna . The phone was available with a slim , standard or vibrating battery . It could only be used on a GSM-900 network .
The 3110 shared the platform and accessories of the Nokia 8110 `` banana phone '' .
The model number was reused by Nokia in 2007 when the company launched the Nokia 3110 classic . The 3110 Classic sports a candybar form factor similar to that of the 3110 , but adds modern features such as Bluetooth , camera functionality , audio and video playback and recording , and packet data over EDGE , in addition to tri-band functionality .
Unlike subsequent 3000 series mobile phones , its display is not PCD8544 based .
Features and specification
The 3110 was clearly aimed at business users , with notable features including PC synchronisation , good battery life and conservative black styling .
Network : GSM 900
Dimensions : 136 x 45 x 21 mm , 139 cc
Weight : 187 g
Screen : Monochromatic with green backlight
Contacts : 250
SMS
Standby Time : 40–95 hours

A hack watch is a mechanical watch whose movement offers a mechanism for stopping and setting the second hand of the watch , then restarting the watch the instant the time setting matches the time displayed by a reference timepiece .
Hack watches are used on ships for astronomical sights for navigation and to synchronize the actions of personnel who may not be in direct communication ( for example , personnel engaged in a military mission ) .
For navigational purposes , the hack watch is synchronized with the ship 's marine chronometer . The use of a hack watch makes it easier to take sights , as the chronometer is normally in a fixed position in a ship – below decks and suspended in gimbals to keep it level and protect it from the elements , while the hack watch is portable and can be carried on deck . Though not as accurate as the chronometer , the hack watch is accurate enough to be satisfactory over the relatively short time period between setting it from the chronometer and taking the sight .
For mission synchronization , several hack watches can be set alike , then set going at the same moment .

The Midwest MU-1 was an American single-seat , high-wing , strut-braced utility glider that was designed by Arthur B. Schultz in the 1930s .
Design and development
The MU-1 was designed by Schultz prior to the Second World War and was used by the United States Army Air Corps for glider training and designated as the Midwest TG-18 .
The MU-1 was constructed with a welded steel tube fuselage and a wooden-framed wings , all covered in doped aircraft fabric covering . The wing was of span , employed a NACA 4412 airfoil and was supported by two parallel struts with jury struts . Landing gear was a fixed monowheel .
The aircraft was type certified on 13 October 1944 and about six were completed by Midwest Sailplane and possibly also by the Motorless Flight Institute of Chicago , Illinois .
Operational history
In 1983 Soaring Magazine reported that two MU-1s were still in existence , but in October 2015 only one was on the Federal Aviation Administration registry .
Variants

Phengaris is a genus of gossamer-winged butterflies in the subfamily Polyommatinae . Commonly , these butterflies are called large blues , which if referring to a particular species is P. arion , a species resident in Europe and some parts of Asia .
Phengaris is currently defined to include the genus Maculinea . The type species of the latter was the Alcon blue ( `` M. '' alcon ) . This species was found to be less closely related to most other supposed members of Maculinea than the traditional Phengaris species , and hence the two genera were merged to form a monophyletic group . Alternatively , Maculinea could be restricted to the one or two species of `` Alcon '' blues , and the rest of it be separated as a new genus . But this would create two very small genera , which is generally avoided by modern taxonomists . As Phengaris is the older name , it thus replaces Maculinea .
Maculinea was alternatively considered to be a subgenus of Glaucopsyche . But while Glaucopsyche and Phengaris ( including Maculinea ) are certainly close relatives , they are unlikely to be that close .
The most recently discovered species in the genus is P. xiushani , first reported in 2010 and found in undisturbed forested mountains , unlike all the other members which live in grasslands over their entire range of distribution .
Species
The species , listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence from the most ancestral to the most apomorphic , are :

Migu or miggo ( translation : `` since '' ) ( Hebrew : מיגו ) is a Talmudic law concept relating to civil law disputes . A migu is a reason that a claim that would otherwise be rejected by a Jewish civil court should be accepted based on the fact that the litigant could have prevailed in the case based on a different claim were he disposed to lie . To be effective , the logic underlying the migu must be impeccable and there are a variety of cases in which the Migu argument is invalid .
Example of an effective Migu
One classic example of where a Migu does work is in the area of a loan repayment dispute . Where the lender accuses an alleged borrower of defaulting on an oral loan made without witnesses , the borrower may prevail in the case by claiming that the loan did occur , but that it had already been repaid . Normally , when one makes a claim that a loan has been repaid , he would be expected to produce evidence that it had been repaid , such as a receipt . However , in this scenario the borrower would prevail under the theory that he must be telling the truth , as if he were interested in lying to the court , he could have simply said that the loan never happened . Since the lender can not prove the existence of the loan , that claim would have prevailed . Therefore , the claim that the loan was repaid is believed as well . This is a classic Migu , although many cases of Migu exist to support a position in court .
Other cases in which Migu is invoked are cases in which witnesses might have a personal gain in testifying , which would normally disqualify the testimony . If another option can be found for the witnesses to achieve the same personal gain , some authorities rule that the testimony can be accepted .
Exceptions to the rule
There are exceptions to the rule of Migu , perhaps the most common one is known as `` Migu in the place of witnesses '' ( Hebrew מיגו במקום עדים ) . This takes on two meanings . The first is that in a case in which the claimant has irrefutable proof - such as valid witnesses - supporting his claim , the litigant can not use Migu as a defense . The reasoning is that the witnesses are `` stronger '' than the Migu . ( This means that in the order of acceptance of proofs and logic the court of law will rule based on the stronger proof/logic . ) A second meaning to `` Migu in the place of witnesses '' is similar yet very different from the first . That is , when witnesses support the alternative claim , thereby destroying the litigant 's position , as the litigant can no longer claim that if he was looking to win dishonestly he/she would have claimed the alternative . Because the alternative is no longer possible . This exception is true even if the witnesses bear testimony after the litigant made his/her claim . ( see Rabbi Busel On Migu )
Another exception would be if the proposed alternative claim is considered to be an embarrassment to the defendant . Cases that would qualify are , if the story being told is embarrassing by its very nature , it is a highly unlikely story and a person would not be so brazen as to make the alternative claim ( Hebrew , מיגו דהעזה לא אמרינן ) or it is well known that the particular proposed fact is untrue , even if the claimant ca n't prove it . The logic behind this exception is elementary . The Migu lends credibility to the defendant by asking the question : `` if he is lying in an effort to exempt himself from paying his dues , he should have told more believable lie '' . If the court can find a probable reason why he would avoid telling the harder-to-disprove story , then the entire logic falls apart .
A third rule in the non acception of Migu 's is that `` a Migu to extract is not said '' ( Hebrew מיגו להוציא לא אמרינן ) . This means that the logic of Migu will not be accepted on the claimants side . ( `` Why did he claim that the item used to belong to the possessing party and that he had bought it from him , he could have said that the item never belonged to the possessing party ? '' ) . The predominant reason for this is that the burden of proof is on the claimant ( Hebrew המוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה ) and therefore even though a defendant can avoid payment using the Migu as a defense , it is not sufficient proof for the claimant . Another point is that this would open endless opportunities for con men ( Many Jewish laws are designed to make con games more difficult ) This is the opinion of the Tosafists . The Ramban among other Rishonim disagree with this rule and contend that it is a valid reasoning . Some explain that the root of the question lies in understanding Migu 's properties as a tool in court . The Tosafists felt that a Migu is a leverage tool ( Hebrew , כח הטענה ) , meaning that if a person chose to make a less favorable claim over a more favorable one , he is given the benefit of the doubt , although he is not necessarily believed based on his Migu , therefore his Migu can only deflect charges but not charge others . The Ramban on the other hand felt that Migu provides proof of the legitimacy of the claim , it can therefore be used as an attack tool .

Edwin M. Carfrey ( July 1863 – October 2 , 1921 ) was an American baseball player . Carfrey had a career that spanned nearly 20 years in organized baseball . He played Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1890 . He also played minor league baseball for several teams from 1882 to 1899 . He also participated in a December 1891 exhibition of indoor , winter baseball played with a hair-filled ball measuring 19 inches in diameter and with bats reportedly resembling cut-off broomsticks .
Carfrey 's minor league and semi-pro assignments include the Houston team ( 1882-1883 , 1888 ) , the Haymaker club ( 1884 ) , the Athletic Cub of Schuylkill Navy ( 1891-1892 ) , Philadelphia Colts ( 1894 ) , Hazleton Quay-kers ( 1895 ) , Salem ( 1895 ) , Ansonia ( 1896 ) , York ( 1896 ) , Media ( 1897 ) , and Mount Holly ( 1899 ) .
Early years
Carfrey was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania in July 1863 , the same month that the Battle of Gettysburg was fought 139 miles to the west of Philadelphia . At the time of the 1870 United States Census , Carfrey was living in Philadelphia 's 20th Ward with his father , Edwin Carfrey , mother Jane , older brother William , and younger brother James . His father was employed at that time as a shoemaker .
By 1880 , the 17-year-old Carfrey was still living with his parents in Philadelphia . He and his older brother William were both employed at that time in a rolling mill , while their father continued to work as a shoemaker .
Professional baseball
Philadelphia Athletics
In 1890 , Carfrey played Major League Baseball as a shortstop for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association . He made his major league debut on April 19 , 1890 at age 26 . He appeared in only one game for the Athletics and had one hit in four at-bats for a .250 batting average .
Prior to 2005 , Carfrey 's record had been omitted from the records of Major League Baseball . In 2005 , Carfrey 's record was added to the ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia . His prior omission from official records resulted from the fact that his 1890 appearance for the Athletics `` was erroneously credited to another player when the official stats were computerized . ''
Minor league baseball
Carfrey also played minor league baseball for several teams from 1882 to 1899 .
Houston and Haymaker clubs
In 1882 , Carfrey played as the catcher for the Houston baseball team from South Chester , Pennsylvania . The team played its home games at Houston Park . In the 1882 league championship game on September 30 , 1882 , Carfrey drove in the winning run with a hit to right field for Houston . In the spring of 1883 , a newspaper account noted his contributions to the 1882 team : `` Carfrey played behind the bat with scarcely an error to his credit and succeeded in putting a number of men out . '' He played at third base and catcher for the Houston team in 1883 . In September 1883 , he scored three runs and `` received a terrible blow in the eye '' —one of several incidents that a newspaper report characterized as `` little incivilities '' that `` were constantly exchanged '' during the game .
In 1884 , he played at second and third base and at shortstop for the newly formed Haymaker baseball club from Chester , Pennsylvania .
During the 1888 season , Carfrey appeared in 28 games as a third baseman for Houston in the Philadelphia Region League .
Schuylkill Navy
In 1891 and 1892 , he played for Philadelphia 's Athletic Club of Schuylkill Navy ( A.C.S.N . ) baseball team as a third baseman . After a September 1891 game at Bristol , Pennsylvania , the crowd rushed onto the field and attacked the A.C.S.N . team . Carfrey attempted to play the role of a peace-maker amid a scene described as `` a pushing , swearing , fighting mob '' which would have injured the Philadelphia men had the Bristol players and police not come to their assistance . As the team left the field , `` a howling crowd of young boys '' threw stones , `` smooth and jagged , '' at the Navy 's bus .
In December 1891 , he played in an exhibition of indoor baseball at the Philadelphia Industrial Hall . The game was played with a hair-filled ball measuring 19 inches in diameter and with bats reportedly resembling cut-off broomsticks . Carfrey played third base for A.C.S.N . team in the indoor exhibition . The Sporting Life reported on the game as follows : `` The game was to the players themselves , perhaps , very amusing , but it would take a crank of the deepest dye to see anything laudable in the game . In simple words , it is a travesty on the noblest of games and can not be considered in any other light than a catch-penny affair . ''
1895 to 1899 seasons
In 1894 , Carfrey appeared in 14 games for the Philadelphia Colts of the Pennsylvania State League . He compiled a .200 batting average in 55 at-bats for the Colts .
In 1895 , Carfrey played for two minor league teams . He appeared in 49 games for the Hazleton Quay-kers in the Pennsylvania State League , compiling a .263 batting average in 209 at-bats . An account in The Sporting Life from May 1895 noted that Carfrey began the season at second base but was transferred to first base `` and is doing well at that position . '' He also played for Salem in the South New Jersey League in 1895 .
In 1896 , Carfrey played with the Ansonia Blues from Ansonia , Connecticut in the Naugatuck Valley League . Newspaper accounts in the Sporting Life indicate that he also played second base for a `` York '' baseball team ( presumably York , Pennsylvania ) in 1896 .
In November 1897 , The Sporting Life reported that Carfrey was the captain of the Media Base Ball Club in Media , Pennsylvania , located 12 miles west of Philadelphia .
In 1899 , Carfrey , at age 35 , played at second base for the Mount Holly ( a suburb of Philadelphia in New Jersey ) team in the Burlington County League .
Later years
In 1884 , Carfrey was married to Emma Chapman . They had one child , Edwin Carfrey , born in February 1885 and died in May of that same year . In the 1892 Philadelphia City Directory , Carfrey was listed as a `` rougher '' residing at 306 York . He was also listed as a `` rougher '' in the 1899 Philadelphia directory . At the time of the 1900 United States Census , Carfrey was living in Philadelphia 's 19th Ward with his wife , Emma , at the home of his in-laws , Howard and Mary Chapman . He was employed at the time in the iron business . Carfrey was employed as an ironmaker in 1908 , an ironworker in 1912 , a `` roller '' in 1913 , and a `` molder '' in 1917 .
Carfrey died in Philadelphia in 1921 at age 58 . He was buried at the New Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia .

The Comox Land District is one of the 59 land districts of British Columbia , Canada , which are part of the cadastral divisions of British Columbia , created with rest of those on Vancouver Island via the Lands Act of the Colony of Vancouver Island . The British Columbia government 's BC Names system , a subdivision of GeoBC , defines a land district as `` a territorial division with legally defined boundaries for administrative purposes '' . All land titles and surveys use the Land District system as the primary point of reference , and entries in BC Names for placenames and geographical objects are so listed .
Description
The Comox Land District lies between the Nelson Land District to the south , the Sayward Land District to the north , and the Nootka Land District to the west . There is a maritime boundary in the Strait of Georgia with the New Westminster Land District on the southeast , and with the Sayward Land District on the northwest .
Boundary
Beginning at a point in Discovery Passage offshore from the southern part of the City of Campbell River , and the southern end of Quadra Island , at roughly 50 degrees 0 minutes north latitude and 125 degrees 12 minutes 51 seconds west longitude , then along that latitude west , with some minor variances around land parcels to 50 degrees 0 minutes north latitude at 125 degrees 41 minutes 8 seconds west longitude , then south along that longitude to 49 degrees 54 minutes 29 seconds north latitude , then west along that latitude to 125 degrees 45 minutes 58 seconds west longitude , then via a straight diagonal line southeast to 49 degrees 37 minutes 31 seconds north latitude at 125 degrees 24 minutes 17 seconds west longitude , then east to 125 degrees 0 minutes 9 seconds west longitude , just west of the town of Cumberland and north along that longitude to 49 degrees 39 minutes 15 seconds north latitude . From there , a short distance east to 124 degrees 59 minutes 51 seconds west longitude , and south along that longitude to 49 degrees 39 minutes north latitude , and 124 degrees 58 minutes 31 seconds west longitude , north along that longitude to 49 degrees 39 minutes 10 seconds north latitude at 124 degrees and east along that latitude to 124 degrees 57 minutes 45 seconds west longitude , following that longitude south to 49 degrees 38 minutes 50 seconds north longitude to 124 west 57 minutes 5 seconds west longitude to the shoreline of Vancouver Island at 49 degrees 39 minutes 3 seconds north latitude and 124 west 57 minutes 5 seconds west longitude , then via maritime boundaries in the Strait of Georgia back to Discovery Passage .

Ultra-long-haul ( also known as `` ultra-long-range operations '' ) refers to the duration of a flight ( flight duration ) being `` ultra long . '' IATA , ICAO , and IFALPA jointly define any flight scheduled to last over 16 hours as `` Ultra Long '' .
These flights usually follow a great circle route , often passing over a polar region . In some cases , non-stop ultra-long-haul routes could be less preferable to stopover flights as passengers on ultra-long-haul nonstop flights must sit in the aircraft for those long hours . A low-oil-price environment favors the establishment and operation of ultra-long-haul flights .
The longest ultra-long-haul commercial flight in the world currently is Singapore Airlines Flight SQ 23/24 , which flies from Singapore Changi Airport to New York JFK Airport .
History
Ultra-long-haul flights lasting over 16 hours in duration have been around since the 1930s . While modern jet aircraft travel at faster speeds and cover longer distances , the record for the longest scheduled commercial ultra-long-haul flight route remains set in 1943 . Some of the historical ultra-long-haul routes include :
October 21 , 1936 the first scheduled commercial transpacific flight was operated by Pan American Airways on a Martin M-130 Flying Boat with 7 paying passengers on board . Flying from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor , Hawaii non-stop , a distance of 3,871 kilometres ( 2,405 mi ; 2,090 nmi ) in 19 hours , 36 minutes .
From 1943 to 1945 , Qantas operated `` The Double Sunrise '' , a weekly flight between Perth , Australia and Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) , with average flight times of 28 ( maximum of 33 ) hours using a Consolidated PBY Catalina .
October 1–2 , 1957 , a Trans World Airlines Lockheed L-1649 Starliner , the ultimate piston-engine airliner in terms of range and endurance , flew the inaugural London–San Francisco polar route in 23 hours , 19 minutes .
February 1963 , Aeroflot started a Moscow-Havana flight via Murmansk with its Tu-114D . It was around 16 hours from Havana to Murmansk , the longest for a scheduled turboprop flight .
1 March 2001 , following the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the airspace over Russia was opened for overflight purposes , allowing new circumpolar routes to come into use for commercial airlines.Continental Airlines launched a nonstop service from Newark to Hong Kong with a flying duration exceeding 16 hours . A few days later , United Airlines started its own JFK–Hong Kong service , adding 10 kilometers to the distance .
3 February 2004 , Singapore Airlines introduced a flight from Singapore to Los Angeles , scheduled for 16 hours , 30 minutes in the summer , 15 hours , 35 minutes in the winter . It took 17 hours , 20 minutes in summer and 18 hours , 5 minutes in winter on the return trip .
28 June 2004 , Singapore Airlines introduced Flight SQ 21 , using the Airbus A340-500 ( now an Airbus A350-900 ULR since October 2018 ) on a great circle route from Newark to Singapore , passing within of the North Pole , taking a little over 18 hours . This was immediately surpassed by return Flight SQ 22 , which flew a new record of back to Newark . Despite the greater distance , Flight SQ 22 averaged a slightly shorter 17 hours , 45 minutes because of prevailing high-altitude winds .
In the late 2000s/early 2010s , rapidly rising fuel prices , coupled with an economic crisis , resulted in cancellation of many ultra-long-haul non-stop flights . This included the services provided by Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Newark and Los Angeles that were ended in late 2013 as well as similar lengthy flights from New York to both Mumbai and Bangkok . As fuel prices later decreased and more fuel efficient aircraft were introduced to the market , the economics of ultra-long-haul flights improved and more distant markets became served by new and reinstated services .
On 2 December 2015 , Air India launched a nonstop flight from Delhi to San Francisco .
In 2016 and 2017 , similar lengthy flights were launched from Dubai and Doha to Auckland respectively .
October 18 , 2018 , Singapore Airlines relaunched Flight SQ 21/22 using the fuel efficient Airbus A350-900ULR . It remained the world 's longest scheduled ultra-long-haul commercial flight until its indefinite suspension due to the global drop in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 24 , 2020 .
In March 2020 , due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impossibility of transit in the USA through Los Angeles International Airport , Air Tahiti Nui scheduled and operated Flight TN64 in March and April 2020 as a non-stop flight between Papeete and Paris Charles de Gaulle , using a Boeing 787-9 and covering 15,715 km ( 8,485 nmi ; 9,765 mi ) . , setting a new record for the world 's longest scheduled commercial passenger flight .
On November 9 , 2020 , Singapore Airlines launched the current world 's longest ultra-long-haul commercial flight of SQ 23/24 between Singapore and JFK Airport New York City , USA . at 15,349 kilometres ( 8,288 nmi ; 9,537 mi ) operated by an Airbus A350-900ULR .
Airliners
The longest range jetliner in service is the Airbus A350 XWB Ultra Long Range , capable of flying up to . The A380 is capable of flying with 544 passengers . The A350-900 can fly with 325 passengers .
The longest range Boeing airliner in service is the 777-200LR , which can cover 17,446 kilometres ( 9,420 nmi ; 10,840 mi ) with 317 passengers . The Boeing 777-8X will be capable of flying 16,170 kilometres ( 8,730 nmi ; 10,050 mi ) with 350 to 375 passengers . The Boeing 787-9 can fly 14,800 km ( 7,991 nmi ) with 290 passengers .
New airliners like the A330neo , A350 and B787 enable economically sustainable nonstop ultra-long-haul operations on thinner routes with fewer demands , because all the previous planes capable of providing nonstop ultra-long-haul services are larger and thus more expensive to operate compared to these planes , which in turn require more tickets to be sold and more demands between both destinations to maintain the profitability of those services .
On 25 August 2018 , Air India challenged Airbus and Boeing to extend the range of their long haul aircraft to enable flights from India to Santiago or Lima by 2022 .
The Maharaja Route between New Delhi and Santiago Airport is long , a 20 hour flight at Mach 0.8 .
Both airframers want to avoid a specific design and Airbus sees a market for 50-100 airliners as other operators could join Air India , for which those could reach the whole world nonstop instead of 70 % of its population .
Aimed at business travelers , such ultra-long-haul flights can charge a 20 % premium over one-stop direct flights .
Planned long flights
In 2016 , Emirates was contemplating a direct Dubai-San Juan flight . It would have been the longest nonstop flight to and from the Caribbean with and taking just over 16 hours .
Qantas introduced a nonstop flight from Perth , Australia to London Heathrow , England with a flight time of 17 hours to travel 14,492 kilometres with Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2018 . This was the first regular nonstop flight connection between the continents of Europe and Oceania . In 2019 , Qantas also used the same aircraft fleet to debut its first experimental nonstop flights between New York and Sydney ( with a distance of more than 16,000 km ) , and London and Sydney ( with a distance of more than 17,000 km ) , making both routes the two longest flights ever attempted by any modern aircraft in history .

Charlie Jade is a science fiction television series filmed mainly in Cape Town , South Africa . It stars Jeffrey Pierce in the title role , as a detective from a parallel universe who finds himself trapped in our universe . This is a Canadian and South African co-production filmed in conjunction with CHUM Television and the South African Industrial Development Corporation ( IDC ) . The special effects were produced by the Montreal-based company Cinegroupe led by Michel Lemire .
The show started in 2004 and was aired on the Canadian Space Channel . It premiered on the Space Channel April 16 , 2005 and aired in Eastern Europe , France , Italy , on SABC 3 in South Africa , on Fox Japan , and on AXN in Hong Kong . The show began airing in the United Kingdom in October 2007 , on FX . The Sci Fi Channel in the United States premiered the show on June 6 , 2008 , but after 2 episodes on Friday prime-time , was moved to overnight Mon/Tue .
Summary of plot
The show uses the idea of parallel universes , or a multiverse . There are several universes that coexist — each somewhat different from the others . As of the first season , these are the universes that have been explored in the TV series :
The Alphaverse , a dystopian view of what our future could be like . It is the home universe of the main character Charlie Jade . The Alphaverse 's inhabitants are segregated into `` classes '' of different levels ( e.g. , C-1 , or Class 1 — which stands for Upper Class ) . It is dominated by five gigantic multinational firms . Prime among This is a corporation called Vexcor . Despite the Alphaverse 's dystopian society , it does contain some futuristic technology that is within the level of our capability .
The Betaverse , which corresponds to our present day actual reality .
The Gammaverse , a rather idyllic version of our world , what it would be like if the planet 's inhabitants made careful use of its resources .
An 'unknown ' universe , inhabited with primitive people living in huts .
A universe that is home to 'men in grey suits ' .
During the pilot episode , scientists from Vexcor attempt to open a wormhole from the Alphaverse to the Gammaverse in a bid to drain water from the latter to the former . In Gammaverse , terrorists Bern and Reena — aware of Vexcor 's intent — prepare to sabotage the facility . Before the stable wormhole can be completed , a massive explosion at the site of the portal ( a large open-air water reservoir ) leads to a chain reaction explosion that moves through all three universes . This results in Charlie being thrown from Alphaverse into the Betaverse , into a different Cape Town that he is unfamiliar with . Reena is also thrown into the Betaverse .
The explosion renders the `` link '' between universes impassable , which leaves Vexcor employees in Beta and Gamma cut off from their head office in Alpha .
Vexcor attempts to rebuild the link , and re-establish contact . At the same time , they must deal with the P.R . fallout from the explosion , and must try to conceal the true purpose of the facility and what the company was up to . Suspicion initially falls on a Vexcor scientist named Elliot Krogg — but eventually , they discover Reena is in Cape Town , and target her as the terrorist behind the explosion .
Vexcor 's attempts to cover their tracks are complicated by Charlie Jade 's presence in Beta — and the fact that he soon hooks up with Karl Lubinsky , an expatriate American who runs a conspiracy website devoted to tracking all things Vexcor .
Together , Charlie and Karl gradually divine Vexcor 's true intentions — and also uncover a terrible secret promoted by Vexcor 's doomed scientist , Elliot Krogg . Krogg wrote a memo to Vexcor HQ detailing a possible catastrophic effect to establishing a long-term link from Alpha to Gamma . If the link is made permanent , it will collapse all matter in the Betaverse , destroying everyone and everything in 'our ' world . Karl and Charlie are the only things that stand between our world and annihilation .
Meanwhile , with travel between the universes cut off , Vexcor Alpha must turn to a person who can travel between the universes without a link : 01 Boxer , the son of company founder Brion Boxer .
01 Boxer is made company courier by Essa Rompkin , CEO of Vexcor . He travels by an unknown method that involves dousing himself with water and `` slipping '' between universes . The method of travel is mysterious , but it results in changes to body chemistry . In later episodes , 01 Boxers blood is used to transfuse and revitalize his father , who is sick from some genetic malady — perhaps as a result of too much travel between universes .
01 seems to manifest a different personality in each universe . In Alpha he acts like a spoiled child , in Beta he is a hedonistic adolescent , and in Gamma he is a loving husband and father to two children . 01 's motivations are mysterious — he can seem like a villain , but he is definitely following his own agenda .
The series concludes season one 's arc , but does have a cliffhanger ending pertaining to Charlie 's fate .
Cast
Creators
Chris Roland and Robert Wertheimer are the creators of Charlie Jade ; the original series bible was written by Robert J. Sawyer and the pilot script was written by Stephen Zoller and Robert Wertheimer . The official website has a few podcasts where the creators discuss the production of the show and the possible second season .
Episodes
DVD releases
Background
Though viewers may recognize a similarity to Blade Runner and the episode `` Double Cross '' of the series Sliders , especially in the scenes set in the Alphaverse , Wertheimer has said in interviews that much of the ethos of the series is primarily influenced by Derrick Jensen 's book The Culture of Make Believe .
Charlie Jade had two teams of writers . The pilot and first eight episodes were overseen by executive producer Guy Mullally , Stephen Zoller and David Cole . Mutual creative differences led to an amicable parting of the ways , paving the way for the second team , consisting of head writer Alex Epstein , and story editors Denis McGrath and Sean Carley .
In addition to its Canadian writing staff , the show also featured the work of several South African television writers , including Dennis Venter and Collin Oliphant .
The majority of the directors who worked on the show were from Quebec , including Pierre Gill and Érik Canuel . The pilot was directed by T.J. Scott . Other directors included George Mihalka , Jimmy Kaufman , Anton Beebe , and South Africans Neal Sundstrom , David Hickson and Daryl Roodt .
Each universe has a remarkably different look :
The color palette of the Alphaverse is dominated by green
Betaverse is very blue in tint
Gammaverse is dominated by reds and warm earth tones
The 'unknown universe ' is mostly gray .
The universe in which the Men in Grey Suit inhabit has white and yellow hues . Additionally , the Men in Grey Suits have a subtle yellow aura to them .
Charlie Jade was considered one of the hot tickets at the MIP show when it was shown there in 2004 . However , the series has yet to be picked up in some major territories , though the first three episodes did premier at Cascadia Con on September 2 , 2006 in SeaTac , WA . In these areas , the show seems to enjoy a somewhat `` underground '' appeal , and the entire series has been widely distributed over Internet file sharing networks .
In June 2005 , Canadian broadcaster CHUM took an unusual step . Admitting that the show required a great level of attention , CHUM commissioned a special catch-up episode , `` Can of Worms '' . Despite the fact that principal photography had been wrapped nine months before , a small crew gathered in Montreal to film a wraparound story designed to bring new viewers up to speed . `` Can of Worms '' runs between episodes 16 and 17 of Charlie Jade . Including this episode , there are 21 episodes in Charlie Jade 's first season .
Awards and nominations
On August 29 , 2006 , the show was nominated for 5 Canadian Gemini Awards — Patricia McKenzie and Michael Filipowich received Best Supporting Actress and Actor Nominations . The show was also nominated for Best Sound , Best Editing , and Best Visual Effects .
At the 2006 Gemini Awards in Toronto , Charlie Jade won the Gemini for Best Sound .

Dreamloper ( foaled 26 April 2017 ) is an Irish-bred , British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse . She did not race until she was three-years-old when she won two minor races from five starts . In the following year she made steady improvement , winning the Group 3 Valiant Stakes and running third in the Group 1 Sun Chariot Stakes . She progressed again in 2022 , taking the Dahlia Stakes , the Prix d'Ispahan and Prix du Moulin de Longchamp .
Background
Dreamloper is a bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by Olivia Hoare . She originally raced in the ownership of Hoare in partnership with Paola Hewins but from her third race she carried the colours of Jason Fill . She was sent into training with Ed Walker at Kingsdown Stables in Upper Lambourn , Berkshire .
She was from the fifth crop of foals sired by the Prix du Jockey Club winner Lope de Vega . His other foals have included Newspaperofrecord , Belardo , Lucky Vega , Zabeel Prince , Gytrash and Phoenix of Spain . Dreamloper 's dam Livia 's Dream showed good racing ability , winning four of her twenty-six races including the Listed Wild Flower Stakes . She was a female-line descendant of the Epsom Oaks winner Bireme .
Racing career
2020 : three-year-old season
Dreamloper did not race as a juvenile , and the early part of the 2020 season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic . She made a belated track debut on 5 June at Newmarket Racecourse when she finished fourth in a seven furlong maiden race on good to firm ground . She was back on the course three weeks later when she ran third in a novice race ( for horses with no more than two previous wins ) at Doncaster Racecourse . William Buick took the ride on 27 July at Redcar Racecourse when the filly started 5/6 favourite for a novice race and recorded her first success as she went clear of her opponents in the closing stages to win by seven and a half lengths .
For the next phase of her career Dreamloper was campaigned in handicap races starting in August when she ran third on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park . On 5 September the filly was assigned a weight of 120 pounds and started at odds of 9/2 for a contest over one mile at Ascot Racecourse . Ridden by Luke Morris she ended her season with a victory as she went to the front a furlong out and won by a neck from Perfect Inch .
2021 : four-year-old season
Dreamloper began her second season by finishing fourth over seven furlongs at Haydock Park in April and then ran second over one mile at Ascot in May . At Royal Ascot in June she started favourite for the Kensington Palace Stakes ( a straight one-mile handicap for fillies and mares ) but came home tenth of the seventeen finishers after being repeatedly obstructed when attempting to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile . A month later at the same track the filly was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Valiant Stakes over one mile on the round course and went off the 13/2 fourth choice in the betting behind Indigo Girl ( May Hill Stakes ) , Light Out ( Pipalong Stakes ) and Declared Interest . Ridden by Oisin Murphy she tracked the leaders before taking the lead a furlong out and went clear of her rivals to win `` readily '' by four and a half lengths . After the race Ed Walker said `` We were so confident going into Royal Ascot and I still have n't found any reason why she ran so flat that day . It 's great she 's been able to show her true ability and I thought Oisin was excellent . A huge shout to Molly Stratton who rides her every day and has done a great job as she 's not an easy filly '' while Murphy commented `` It was a huge step up on what she 's done and why not step up a bit higher ? ''
At Newbury Racecourse in August Dreamloper was matched against male opposition in the Hungerford Stakes and came home fourth behind Sacred . On 11 September she was sent to Ireland and stepped up to Group 1 class for the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse . She started the 8/1 third choice in the betting but never looked likely to win and came home tenth of the thirteen runners behind No Speak Alexander . On her final appearance of the season Dreamloper was ridden by Kieran Shoemark when she started a 25/1 outsider for the Group 1 Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket . After racing towards the rear of the twelve-runner field she stayed on strongly in the closing stages to finish third behind the three-year-olds Saffron Beach and Mother Earth .
2022 : five-year-old season
On her first appearance as a five-year-old Dreamloper , with Shoemark in the saddle , contested the Group 2 Dahlia Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket on 1 May and went off the 4/1 third choice behind Ebaiyra ( Prix Corrida ) and Ville de Grace ( Pride Stakes ) in a six-runner field which also included Lilac Road ( Upavon Fillies ' Stakes ) . She tracked the leaders as the 66/1 outsider Romantic Rival set the pace and then made good progress in the last quarter mile . In a closely contested finish she ran down the leader Ville de Grace in the final strides to win by a nose with Ebaiyra a short head away in third place . Ed Walker commented `` I thought we were definitely beaten . I 've always thought plenty of her , but she 's been quite difficult to train ... she 's getting more and more relaxed now . In the Sun Chariot all she was doing was closing so I was confident she 'd stay further , but she 'd been so keen in the past . Kieran gets on really well with her . ''
Four weeks after her win at Newmarket , Dreamloper was sent to France to contest the Group 1 Prix d'Ispahan over 1800 metres on good to soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse and started at odds of 5.2/1 in a six-runner field . Pretty Tiger ( Prix Eugene Adam ) started favourite while the other contenders were Sealiway , Dilawar ( Prix Quincey ) , Wally ( Gran Premio di Milano ) and Dawn Intello ( La Coupe de Maisons-Laffitte ) . Shoemark settled the mare in second place behind Sealiway before taking the lead 500 metres from the finish and Dreamloper stayed on well to win by a length from Wally . After the race Walker said `` Kieran was brilliant on her today . She 's never relaxed like that in a race before and he got her beautifully switched off then pressed the button at exactly the right time . There are lots of options now she 's beaten the boys ... she 's beaten some very good horses there .... When she performs like that you 'd give her a chance against most . ''
Pedigree
Through her sire , Dreamloper was inbred 4 × 4 to Machiavellian , meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree .

Human 2.0 is an album by the Swedish grindcore band Nasum . The band came up with the title during 1999 as a reference to some of the panic over issues such as the Y2K bug .
The band decided that they wanted the cover to be white in order to stand out from the many dark album covers that other bands used .
Although the album Inhale/Exhale was never released in Japan , Relapse had made a deal with Ritual Records/Howling Bull for Human 2.0 . The band had already had the idea of updating the title for the Japanese release and make it Human 2.01 , with additional bonus tracks .
The album contains a number of references to popular culture . `` Resistance '' uses a quote from the movie The Matrix : `` I hate this place . This zoo . This prison . This reality , whatever you want to call it , I ca n't stand it any longer . '' The song `` Sometimes Dead is Better '' uses the quote `` Welcome to the desert of the real '' . In `` Parting Is Such Sweet Sorrow '' , the beginning quote is from the movie The Shawshank Redemption .
In 2020 , it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by Metal Hammer magazine .

Monis v The Queen , is a High Court of Australia case that dealt with the implied freedom of political communication in relation to whether or not the government may criminalise sending offensive messages through the postal system .
Background
Man Haron Monis was alleged to have sent letters ( and in one case , a recording on a CD ) to parents , spouses and other relatives of Australian soldiers killed while on active service in Afghanistan ( and in one case , to the mother of an Austrade official killed in a bombing in Indonesia ) . The letters contained expressions of sympathy to the relatives of the deceased , but also contained criticisms of the deceased : assertions that they were murderers of innocent civilians , comparisons of the body of one deceased soldier to the “ dirty body of a pig ” , and comparisons to Adolf Hitler . Copies of the letters were also sent to Australian politicians .
Section 471.12 of the Code makes it an offence for a person to use a postal or similar service `` in a way ... that reasonable persons would regard as being , in all the circumstances ... offensive '' .
Monis was charged with 12 counts under s 471.12 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code . In addition , Amirah Droudis was charged with eight counts of aiding and abetting Monis in the commission of those offences .
Mr Monis and Ms Droudis claimed that s 417.12 violated the implied constitutional freedom of political communication . The New South Wales Court of Appeal rejected this argument and found the section was valid . The case was appealed to the High Court .
The decision
On appeal , the High Court divided evenly on the question ( 3–3 ) . As a result , the decision of the Court of Appeal was affirmed .
The Court was not obliged to determine whether the communications in the present case were `` offensive '' for the purposes of s 417.12 . The sole question before the Court was whether s 417.12 infringed the implied freedom and was so invalid .
The Court reiterated that the implied freedom of political communication does not operate as an individual right ; rather , it is an implied restriction on the legislative competence of Australian parliaments and executives .
In determining whether s 417.12 infringed the implied freedom , the Court applied the test expounded in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation , as modified in Coleman v Power .
There are two limbs to that test :
Does the law effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters ?
If so :
All members of the Court construed the word `` offensive '' in s 417.12 narrowly . They found the true operation of the provision is only to make illegal use of postal services that are `` very '' , `` seriously '' or `` significantly '' offensive , or that are `` calculated or likely to arouse significant anger , significant outrage , disgust or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person in all the circumstances . '' There were a number of reasons for adopting this interpretation including : the provision is a criminal provision , and carries a significant penalty ; the provision restricts a common law freedom ; the prohibition on “ offensive ” uses of postal services sits together with prohibitions on “ menacing ” and “ harassing ” uses , suggesting the provision intends to target more serious conduct ; and legislation should be interpreted , if possible , so as to avoid constitutional invalidity .
Despite this narrow construction , all members of the Court found that s 417.12 does effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters . That is because even construed narrowly , the provision would criminalise some political communications . The first limb of the Lange test was therefore satisfied .
Crennan , Kiefel , and Bell JJ held that the purpose of the law was to protect people from “ intrusive ” , seriously offensive communications . The nature of postal communications is that they are delivered into people 's private homes and workplaces . Seriously offensive communications are likely to be unsolicited .
They held that this purpose is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of government . Further , the law is reasonably and appropriately adapted to achieving that legitimate purpose . The freedom of political communication is not absolute . Section 417.12 is not directed at political communications – it only incidentally affects them . It is unlikely to impose an extensive burden them . The law is therefore valid .
In contrast , French CJ ( with whom Heydon J agreed ) and Hayne J held that the purpose of s 417.12 is simply to prevent the use of postal services in an offensive way . For slightly different reasons , they held that this is not a legitimate purpose with respect to the Lange test . Notably , they both appeared to consider that the restrictions imposed on political communications were greater than did Crennan , Kiefel , and Bell JJ . Both French CJ and Hayne J attached a greater degree of importance to the role that offensive communications play in political discourse .
French CJ , Hayne , and Heydon JJ also held that s 417.12 is invalid as it should not be read down to avoid infringement of the implied freedom .

Ganarew ( from Welsh : Genau ' r Rhiw ; 'Gana-rhiw ' , and 'Gan y rew ' ) is a village and small civil parish in south Herefordshire , England near the River Wye and the border with Wales . The village is located southwest of the village of Whitchurch on the main A40 road , and lies within the electoral ward of Kerne Bridge . The village is about from Monmouth and from Ross-on-Wye . It contains the Church of St Swithin and Ganarew Manor .
History
The name Gana-rhiw , now Ganarew , may derive from the Briton `` Gan '' , from genau , meaning `` a mouth or opening of a pass '' ; `` Rhiw '' is the Welsh word for `` hill '' .
The Imperial Gazetteer of 1855 recorded Ganarew 's population as 147 , and that it was in size . In 1868 , the National Gazetteer noted that there was an observatory , high , on the summit of nearby Little Doward Hill ( or Ganarew Hill ) , from the top of which a view could be obtained of the Bristol Channel . By 1904 , The Survey Gazetteer recorded the population as 132 , and that there were .
Legend
King Vortigern is said to have made his last stand against Aurelius at Ganarew . Lawman calls it a castle on Cloard Hill in the district of Hergin , and has Vortigern dying after the castle was besieged and fired by Aurelius and Uther .
A cave , at nearby Little Doward , known as `` King Arthur 's Cave '' can be explored , making it unique amongst candidates for the Arthurian cave legend . Helen Hill Miller in her 1969 The Realms of Arthur , suggests a military use for the cave , arguing that the cave 's `` recesses penetrate very far into the hill , and could hide a substantial force '' . The cave has a parallel with Cadbury Castle in that it is a cave within a hillfort . It was first inhabited in the Old Stone Age and is thus older than any other Arthurian site .
Geography
Ganarew is located in the far south of Herefordshire , just across the border from Wales . Ganarew is located about from Monmouth and from Ross-on-Wye . The River Wye flows to the southeast of the village . Little Doward and Great Doward lie to the east . Woods in the area include Sanger Wood , Millennium Wood , Hazel Wood and Goldsmith 's Wood to the south .
Notable landmarks
Church of St Swithin
The parish church , which is within the Church of England Diocese of Hereford , is dedicated to St Swithin . A Grade II listed building , it was rebuilt in about 1850 by John Prichard . The graveyard contains a Gothic pinnacle memorial to the Bannerman family who lived nearby at Wyastone Leys .
Ganarew Manor
The manor dates from the 17th century , with mid 19th and early 20th century alterations . The house is of stone with a slate roof , the 20th century extensions including a two-storey block with a bay window and a gabled porch . The manor is the home of Sir Colin Sheperd , former Member of Parliament for Hereford and is a Grade II listed building . The gate to the manor , with accompanying piers , is also a Grade II listed structure .
Ancient monuments
The Church of St Swithin churchyard contains a standing stone cross , of stepped form , which is a scheduled historical monument . It is principally medieval with some later additions and includes the foundation , the base of two steps and a socket stone . The shaft , knop and head are modern .
Other ancient monuments are noted by English Heritage at Ganarew Cross , and at Little Doward camp , the remains of an Iron Age hillfort . The Wye Valley Walk passes close to the south of the camp .
Transport
In 1755 a road was constructed from Monnow Bridge to Gan y rew . In the late 18th century , the turnpike route to Ross in the area of Ganarew Hill was described as being in such bad condition that it was a travel danger . The Hereford Trust took over road work for the section between Old Forge and Ganarew in 1819 . Plans in the early 19th century to build a connecting road between St. Weonards and Ganarew were not carried out .

Biography
Gideon Ruffer ( later Rafael ) was born as Georg Ruffer in Berlin Germany to a Jewish family , the son of a prosperous furrier . He studied law at the University of Berlin .

An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific `` All-America '' and typically referred to as `` All-American athletes '' , or simply `` All-Americans '' . Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit , the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media . Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889 .
From 1947 to 1980 , the American Baseball Coaches Association was the only All-American selector recognized by the NCAA .

At first , Gales was the Senate 's sole reporter , and Seaton reported on the House of Representatives . The Intelligencer supported the Jefferson , Madison , and Monroe administrations , and Gales and Seaton were selected as the official printers of Congress from 1819 to 1829 . In addition to printing government documents , they began compiling their reports of floor debates and publishing them in the Register of Debates , a forerunner of the Congressional Record . Gales and Seaton flourished during the `` Era of Good Feelings , '' a period of relative political complacency , but after Congress was split between the Whigs and Democrats , the partners lost their official patronage . From the 1830s to the 1850s , the National Intelligencer was one of the nation 's leading Whig newspapers , and continued to hold conservative , unionist principles down to the Civil War , supporting John Bell and the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 presidential election . Gales died in 1860 and Seaton retired in 1864 .
James Clarke Welling , who became President of Columbian University , served on the editorial staff during the Civil War .
In 1865 , the National Intelligencer was taken over by Snow , Coyle & Co. John F. Coyle had been an employee at the paper 's offices , and continued to publish the paper despite a half million dollars ' worth of debts . On November 30 , 1869 , the statistician and economist Alexander del Mar bought the paper for cash and merged it with the Washington Express . The short-lived Daily National Intelligencer and Washington Express 's last daily publication in Washington was January 10 , 1870 . Thereafter it was published weekly in New York until at least April 1871 . It later became the New York daily City and National Intelligencer with del Mar as editor and publisher , and a circulation of about 2,000 in 1872 .

A spotter is a person used in vehicle maneuvers to assist a driver who may not have a clear view in their direction of travel . They are most commonly used in :
Off-road rock crawling
Reversing truck and trailer combinations , such as semitrailers , b-trains and road trains
Placing oversized freight using a forklift
Lifting loads using a vehicle-mounted crane ( loads lifted using a fixed crane are supervised by a banksman )
Guiding military vehicles ( also called ground guiding )
Dumping materials , such as from a dump truck
Guiding oversized loads .
The spotter 's advantage is the ability to move around the load or vehicle to determine the best trajectory .
A spotter will either use a set of standard hand signals , or will agree hand signals before the maneuver with the driver or operator .
Technological solutions such as reversing cameras and proximity sensors have reduced drivers ' reliance on spotters in some circumstances .

Acacia arrecta , commonly known as Yarnda Nyirra wattle or Fortescue wattle , is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Plurinerves that is endemic to arid areas in north western Australia .
Description
The low dense spreading shrub typically grows to a height of and to a width of about . It usually has multiple stems and can have few branches a ground level and has smooth , grey bark that can be fissured at the very base of the main stems . The branchlets have resinous ribbing . Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves . The grey-green , resinous and terete phyllodes narrow to a hard non-spiny point . The phyllodes are in length and have a diameter of around and have eight obscure nerves . It blooms from January to December and produces yellow flowers .
Taxonomy
The species was first formally described by the botanist Bruce Maslin in 1982 as part of the work Studies in the genus Acacia ( Leguminosae : Mimosoideae ) - 11 . Acacia species of the Hamersley Range area , Western Australia as published in the journal Nuytsia . It was reclassified in 2003 by Leslie Pedley as Racosperma arrectum then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006 .
Distribution
It is native to an area in the Pilbara region of Western Australia where it is commonly situated on stony flats and low rocky hills growing in shallow rocky soils . The range of the plant is from around Millstream Chichester National Park in the west to around Nullagine in the east and as far south as the Hamersley Range near Wittenoom . It is quite common in areas where it is found but has an overall scattered distribution . It is usually a part of shrubland communities that is dominated spinifex .

Cotula turbinata ( common name ganskos in South Africa , funnel weed in Western Australia ) is a herb in the Asteraceae family native to the Cape Province , but found in India and in Australia
Cotula turbinata is an annual herb , growing to heights of 5 cm to 40 cm , and has hairy stems . In Western Australia , it grows on sandy soils , in lawns and on road verges , where its white and yellow flowers may be seen from July to October .
It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 . The genus name , Cotula , comes from the Greek kotule meaning `` small cup '' and refers to the cupped area at the base of the leaves , while the specific epithet , turbinata , is a botanical Latin adjective , which describes the flower as having the shape of a top .

The Seychelles Microcontinent is a microcontinent underlying Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean made of Late Precambrian rock .
The granite outcrops of the Seychelles Islands in the central Indian Ocean were amongst the earliest examples cited by Alfred Wegener as evidence for his continental drift theory . Ridge–plume interactions have been responsible for separating a thinned continental sliver from a large continent ( i.e . India ) .
The granites of the Seychelles Microcontinent were emplaced 750 Ma , during the late Precambrian . Thermally-induced rifting in the Somali Basin and transform rifting along the Davie Fracture Zone began in the late Permian 225 million years ago , with Gondwana supercontinent beginning to break up in the Middle Jurassic ( about 167 million years ago ) when East Gondwana , comprising Antarctica , Madagascar , India , and Australia , began to separate from Africa ; East Gondwana then began to separate about 115–120 million years ago when India began to move northward .
The Seychelles Islands then underwent two more stages of rifting to isolate it from Madagascar and India . Between 84–95 million years ago rifting separated Seychelles/India from Madagascar . An initial period of transform rifting moved the Seychelles/India block northward . At 84 million years ago oceanic crust started to form in the Mascarene Basin , causing a rotation of the Seychelles/India land mass . This continued until 66 million years ago when new rifting severed the Seychelles from India forming the currently active Carlsberg Ridge . The rift jump coincided with the maximum output of the Deccan Traps , and volcanics found on the Seychelles Plateau have also been linked with this event . This has led to suggestions that the initiation of the Reunion plume caused rifting to jump to its current location .

Sun Belt Tournament
After locking in the second seed in the Sun Belt Tournament , the Panthers ' performance dipped in the last part of their regular season– dropping four of their final six games . Able to shake free of that trend , Georgia State would beat Troy handily in the second round , 73–51 , after losing to them twice in the regular season .
In their semifinal game , the Panthers were once again pitted against in-state foe , Georgia Southern . The teams split their regular season contests– each winning at home . On this neutral court , GSU would defeat the Eagles 73–67 and eliminate their rival from the SBC Tournament for the second time in four years . This rivalry game would n't end without some theatrics– with less than a minute to play , Georgia Southern cut State 's lead to just three points . The Panthers held the ball while the shot clock ran down to two seconds , at which point the Eagles were called for a kicked ball off of an attempted Georgia State pass . As a result , the shot clock would reset to 20 seconds– with just 23 seconds left on the game clock . The Panthers called a time out , where Coach Hunter said he reminded his team of the new shot clock differential and instructed them to hold the ball until fouled should they successfully inbound the ball . Once play resumed , the inbound pass was received by junior Devin Mitchell , who would later claim he thought Coach Hunter was talking about the game clock , and therefore still thought only two seconds remained on the shot clock , leading him to immediately turn around and shoot the ball from outside of the three-point arc and sink an unnecessary three-pointer . This mishap would ice the game , sending the Panthers to the SBC Tournament finals . Meanwhile , top-seeded ( and regular season champions ) Louisiana dropped their semifinal game to 5th seed UT-Arlington , sending the Mavericks , a team Georgia State lost to just five games earlier , to face the Panthers in the finals .
The Panthers would handle UT-Arlington in the finals with relative ease , beating them 74–61 , with the help of D'Marcus Simonds ' game-high 27 points . Their SBC Tournament victory would give the Panthers the Sun Belt Conferences ' automatic bid to the NCAA tournament . Selected as a 15-seed , Georgia State was matched with the 2nd-seeded Cincinnati Bearcats for their opening game in Nashville , TN .

Aldershot Garrison , also known as Aldershot Military Town , is a major garrison in South East England , between Aldershot and Farnborough in Hampshire . The garrison was established when the War Department bought a large area of land near the village of Aldershot , with the objective of establishing a permanent training camp for the Army . Over time , this camp grew into a military town and continues to be used by the Army to the present day . It is home to the headquarters of the Army 's Regional Command , and it is also the administrative base for the 101st Logistic Brigade . The garrison plays host to around 70 military units and organisations .
In 1972 , the garrison was the site of one of the worst UK mainland IRA attacks of the time when a car bomb was detonated outside the headquarters mess of 16 Parachute Brigades , killing seven and injuring nineteen . The Official IRA claimed responsibility , stating that the attack was in revenge for the shootings in Derry that came to be known as Bloody Sunday . Following the attack the Army took steps to secure the garrison by erecting security fences around most of the barracks and lines , as well as introducing armed security patrols .
The garrison area covers approximately 500 acres and its population is about 10,500 . Adjacent to the military town is some 2,700 hectares of open military training area .
History
Established in 1854 , Aldershot has long been seen as the home of the British Army . The garrison was established when the War Department bought a large area of land near to the village of Aldershot , with the objective of establishing a permanent training camp for the British Army . Over time , this camp grew into a military town and continues to be used by the Army to the present day .

Before the establishment of the 'Camp at Aldershot ' , the British Army did not have any single permanent camp for training troops on a large scale . Historically , troops had been stationed in long established garrisons , many of which could trace their histories back as mediaeval , or earlier , defensive positions . In 1852 , following the death of The Iron Duke , a group of reformers , which included Prince Albert , forged an alliance that would seek to improve the training of the Army . In 1853 , a summer camp was established at Chobham Common and two divisional size military exercises were conducted . Following the success of these manoeuvres , it was decided that a permanent camp was needed where such exercises could be regularly conducted . Initially , Reigate was selected as a location that was strategically sound , and close enough to London , to defend against invasion from across the English Channel . Despite its obvious advantages , Reigate was situated in prime agricultural land that would prove too expensive to purchase . Lord Hardinge suggested Aldershot Heath as the location for the new training area , as land was less expensive , but still close enough to the South Coast to defend London . In January 1854 , the British Government 's War Department purchased areas of heathland around the small village of Aldershot at £12 an acre . By 1861 , around 8,000 acres had been purchased .
It was originally only envisaged to set up a tented camp for summer use ; however , following the outbreak of the Crimean War , it was necessary to accommodate a large number of troops , over a longer period of time and so two hutted camps , one north and one south of the Basingstoke Canal , were constructed . Between 1854 and 1859 , around 1,200 wooden huts were constructed by a local civilian contractor , at a cost of £100,263 .
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert showed a keen interest in the establishment and the development of Aldershot as a garrison town . In 1855 , they had a wooden Royal Pavilion built , in which they would often stay when attending reviews of the Army . In 1860 , Prince Albert established and endowed the Prince Consort 's Library .
After the Crimean War , a division of regular troops was permanently based at Aldershot , and 'the Division at Aldershot ' ( including artillery at Christchurch , Hampshire , and cavalry at Hounslow , Middlesex ) became one of the most important home commands of the British Army . In January 1876 a Mobilization Scheme for the forces in Great Britain and Ireland was published , with the Active Army divided into eight army corps based on the major Commands and Districts . The 2nd Corps was headquartered at Aldershot . This scheme disappeared in 1881 , when the districts were retitled 'District Commands ' , with Aldershot usually listed as IX or X . In 1898 , ( when Queen Victoria 's son , the Duke of Connaught , was General Officer Commanding ) Aldershot Command was ranked I on the list . From 1901 to 1908 Aldershot Command was given the additional title of I Army Corps .
The garrison subsequently became seen as home to the British Army . This status has been reflected in the use of Aldershot as a headquarters for a variety of regional commands over the last 100 years . HQ Aldershot Command continued in existence until c. February 1941 , when it was replaced by HQ Aldershot Area .
Later 19th century
In the late 1870s , it was decided that the original hutted camp needed to be replaced with some more permanent structures . When the wooden huts had been built in the 1850s , the contractor had guaranteed the huts for 13 years ; in practice , many of those huts were still serving their purpose some 30 years later . In November 1881 , the first steps were taken to convert the hutted camp into permanent barracks . At this time , the first two brick buildings were constructed in North Camp ; this was quickly followed by the construction of a number of larger brick-built bungalows to replace the previous wooden designs . Government House was built as the garrison commander 's house in 1883 . Between 1889 and 1893 , the remaining wooden buildings , in both North Camp and South Camp , were replaced by brick buildings . Major-General Sir Evelyn Wood had recently been appointed General Officer Commanding at Aldershot and was keen to push forward the building of the new accommodation . It was also , at his request , that a convention for naming the barracks was formulated . Wood advocated that the new barracks should all be named to commemorate famous British victories ; initially this proposal met with some resistance , but was eventually adopted . The barracks in Stanhope Lines took names from the famous battles of the Napoleonic Wars and those in Marlborough Lines took names from Marlborough 's campaigns . The Military Headquarters Building in Steeles Road was completed in 1895 .
In the 20th century
Smith-Dorrien House , the local social facility for soldiers , was completed in 1909 . The garrison used to be the corps headquarters for the Royal Corps of Transport and the Army Catering Corps ; when these were merged into the Royal Logistic Corps in 1993 , the corps headquarters moved to Deepcut Barracks . Today , the garrison is home to the headquarters of the Support Command of the British Army , and is also the administrative base for 101 Logistic Brigades . The garrison plays host to around 70 military units and organisations .
1972 IRA bombing
On 22 February 1972 , Aldershot experienced one of the worst UK mainland IRA attacks of the time . Seven people , all civilian support staff , including cooks , cleaners , and a Catholic priest , were killed and 19 people were injured , in a car bomb attack on the 16th Parachute Brigade headquarters mess at Aldershot garrison . This blast was later claimed , by the Official IRA , as revenge for the shootings in Derry that came to be known as Bloody Sunday . Until then , the military town had been open-plan , but the attack led to immediate action to secure military property . A memorial stone was placed on the site of the bombing .

Historical military town
Following Aldershot 's establishment as a large permanent training camp in the 1850s , the military presence continued to grow . The garrison was divided into the North Camp and the South Camp , either side of the Basingstoke Canal . As more soldiers arrived , they were first housed in bell tents due to a shortage or permanent accommodation . Later , wooden huts were built , which were in turn replaced by brick built barracks in the 1890s . Much of the Victorian camp was demolished in the 1960s .
North Camp
Prior to 1890 , Aldershot garrison lacked permanent accommodation to house the growing military presence . Following the Barracks Act of 1890 , North Camp was rebuilt with brick barracks named : Blenheim , Lille , Malplaquet , Oudenarde , Ramillies and Tournay . The new barracks were built by Henry Wells , a locally based building contractor . This group of barracks then became known as the Marlborough Lines . Today , the only surviving barracks of the Marlborough Lines group is Lille barracks . The Victorian buildings were largely demolished in 1958 , and then rebuilt with more modern facilities , although the original officers ' mess survives . North Camp station is the garrison 's original railway station .
South Camp
The area known as South Camp was rebuilt at much the same time as North Camp . Construction was completed by the same local company responsible for Marlborough Lines . This phase of construction saw nine barracks built , namely : Albuhera , Barossa , Corunna , Gibraltar , Maida , Buller , Mandora and McGrigor barracks . This group of barracks became known as Stanhope Lines . Many of these brick-build Victorian barracks were demolished in the late 1960s , to make way for what is now Montgomery Lines . One of the Victorian barracks did survive . Montgomery Lines was completed in the 1970s and was built on the site of several barracks that formerly made up Stanhope Lines . Much of South Camp has now been redeveloped as part of the Aldershot Urban Extension .
Modern military town
Today , the military town has a population of around 10,500 . This consists of around 3,900 resident soldiers , some 1,000 transient military personnel on courses or sport , 770 MoD Civil Servants and some 5,000 service dependents . The garrison contains 2,145 Service Family Accommodation quarters . The rest of the garrison comprises barracks , the Aldershot Military Stadium , Queen 's Parade playing fields , Garrison Sports Centre and the Aldershot Centre For Health , which is a joint MoD and local authority venture . The garrison is mostly centred around the crossroads that join Queen 's Avenue and Alison 's Road . The military town includes local landmarks such as the Aldershot Observatory , Wellington Statue , the RAMC Memorial , Aldershot Military Cemetery , the Royal Garrison Church and other churches . Adjacent to the military town is some 2,700 hectares of open military training area , which is open to the public when not in use for military purposes .

Deputy Leader Paul Davies was appointed as an Interim Leader , and announced that he would stand for the permanent leadership .
In July , Suzy Davies announced she would stand , saying that she thought it was important for the Welsh Conservatives to have a contested election . She said she would be willing to work with Plaid Cymru to get rid of the Labour government in Wales . She supported reducing taxes , as well as giving some business rates proceeds to councils to use them for private sector-led local development strategies . Suzy Davies also argued for giving the private sector a `` real stake in the communities in which they develop '' and giving workers an `` emotional stake '' in their employers .
Paul Davies launched his campaign in Gwent , pledging to give Welsh Conservative Party members a vote on any potential coalition in the Welsh Assembly . He said he would consider cutting taxes in Wales , as well as supporting high street businesses and redesign the business rates system .

Admiral Kenelm Somerville , 17th Lord Somerville ( 14 November 1787 – 19 October 1864 ) was a Royal Navy officer and Scottish hereditary peer . He joined the navy in 1801 and served throughout the Napoleonic Wars , fighting at the invasion of Isle de France , Battle of Tamatave , and invasion of Java . He was promoted to commander in 1811 and in 1813 took command of the troopship HMS Thames which he sailed to North America to fight in the War of 1812 . Promoted to post-captain in 1814 , he commanded a flotilla in the expedition that burned Washington . Somerville retired from the navy in 1846 and continued to be promoted on the retired list , becoming an admiral in 1862 . He inherited the title of Lord Somerville from his brother in 1842 and died at Newbold Comyn in 1864 at the age of 76 .
Early life
Kenelm Somerville was born the third son of Lieutenant-Colonel the Honourable Hugh Somerville , the son of James Somerville , 13th Lord Somerville , and Mary , the daughter of the Honourable Wriothesley Digby , at Bath on 14 November 1787 . Somerville 's maternal great-grandfather was William Digby , 5th Baron Digby . He was educated at Rugby School and joined the Royal Navy in May 1801 as a volunteer on board the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Mars .
Naval career
Mars was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Edward Thornbrough and in her Somerville served in the English Channel until September . At this point he transferred to the brand new 32-gun frigate HMS Narcissus , serving in her in the North and Mediterranean seas . By July 1803 Somerville had been promoted to midshipman , and in this month he participated in Narcissuss capture of the French 16-gun corvette Alcyon and then served on the blockade of Toulon . He left Narcissus in December 1804 and after spending a brief period of time on half pay he joined the 32-gun frigate HMS Medusa in February 1805 . Medusa then sailed with the new Governor-General of India , Lord Cornwallis , to India . They returned on 26 January 1806 , having completed a journey of 13,831 miles in 82 days . Medusa was commanded by Captain Sir John Gore who was then appointed to command the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Revenge , and when Gore transferred to that ship he took Somerville with him . Serving on the blockade of Rochefort in a squadron under the command of Commodore Sir Samuel Hood , Somerville and Revenge were present at the action of 25 September 1806 where the squadron captured four French frigates .
Somerville was promoted to lieutenant on 11 November 1807 and sent to join the 16-gun sloop HMS Falcon , in which he served until 16 November 1808 when he removed into the 44-gun frigate HMS Phoebe . In Phoebe Somerville fought at the successful invasion of Isle de France in November–December 1810 . After this he took part in the Battle of Tamatave on 20 May 1811 where Phoebe and two frigates and a brig engaged three French frigates , capturing the 40-gun Renommée . On 25 May the squadron sailed to Tamatave where they secured the capture of another of the frigates they had engaged on 20 May , the 40-gun Néréide . Phoebe then sailed to take part in the invasion of Java between August and September ; upon the surrender of that settlement a 14-gun ship was captured ; she was commissioned as HMS Sourabaya and Somerville was promoted to acting commander and sent to command her . His rank was confirmed on 1 February 1812 .
On 11 October 1813 Somerville was given command of the 32-gun frigate HMS Thames which was in service as a troopship for the War of 1812 . He conveyed the 44th Regiment of Foot from Bordeaux to North America soon after . While in command of Thames Somerville was promoted to post-captain on 7 June 1814 . He was subsequently given command of a flotilla of small boats in August , with which he sailed up the Patuxent River and assisted in the attack on Commodore Joshua Barney 's squadron of gunboats on 22 August , and in the burning of Washington two days later . For his services while in command of his flotilla Somerville was praised by his commanding officer , Rear-Admiral George Cockburn , who in turn mentioned Somerville in his dispatches to Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane . This was Somerville 's last active service in the Royal Navy . He succeeded his elder brother Mark Somerville as Lord Somerville on 3 June 1842 and was made a retired captain on 1 October 1846 .
Somerville continued to be promoted on the retired list of the navy , becoming a rear-admiral on 1 September 1846 . In 1849 he received the Naval General Service Medal with two clasps . He was subsequently promoted to vice-admiral on 19 March 1857 and admiral on 20 May 1862 . He died at Newbold Comyn on 19 October 1864 and was buried at Aston Somerville .
Family
Somerville married Frances Louisa ( d. 18 November 1885 ) , the only daughter of John Hayman , on 3 September 1833 . Together they had two sons and five daughters :
Lieutenant Hugh Somerville , 18th Lord Somerville ( 11 October 1839 – 17 November 1868 ) , Warwickshire Yeomanry officer , killed in a hunting accident
Lieutenant Frederick Noel Somerville ( 8 October 1840 – 8 January 1867 ) , Rifle Brigade officer

The Thunderbird Country Club is an 18-hole golf course designed by Lawrence Hughes in Rancho Mirage in California 's Coachella Valley . It has hosted the Ryder Cup and the Palm Springs Golf Classic ( now known as the CareerBuilder Challenge ) . Opened in 1951 , the country club has been a favorite of many celebrities including Bing Crosby and Bob Hope as well as US Presidents Gerald Ford and Barack Obama First known as the Thunderbird Ranch , it was purchased by Johnny Dawson who established Coachella Valley 's first 18-hole golf course here in 1951 .
The golf cart is rumored to have been invented at Thunderbird Country Club . Ford Thunderbird is named for the club .
Lawrence Hughes also designed the Tomahawk Lake Country Club in South Dakota , which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
Membership discrimination
In 1957 , Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz bought a nearby home and hoped to join the elite Thunderbird Country Club , but the club prohibited minorities and Jewish people . Arnaz was denied admission to the Thunderbird Country Club because he was Cuban . In response to this prejudice , Arnaz bought property in nearby Indian Wells , California and opened the Indian Wells Resort Hotel , which did not discriminate against minorities and Jewish people . At one point , Jewish comedian Jack Benny was not permitted to join the club .
In 1977 , Gerald Ford 's purchase or property at nearby Thunderbird Heights reawakened local interest in discrimination . TA Jewish community leader reported that there was no evidence of discriminatory practices in Palms Springs , but `` that does not mean that Jewish people are welcome everywhere . ''

Thomas Fairchild ( ? 166710 October 1729 ) was an English gardener , `` the leading nurseryman of his day '' , working in London . He corresponded with Carl Linnæus , and helped by experiments to establish the existence of sex in plants , then still denied by most botanists . In 1716-17 he was the first person to scientifically produce an artificial hybrid , Dianthus Caryophyllus barbatus , known as `` Fairchild 's Mule '' , a cross between a Sweet William ( Dianthus barbatus ) and a Carnation pink . He did this by taking pollen from the Sweet William with a feather , and brushing it onto the stigma of the Carnation pink . The cross was made in summer 1716 , the new plant appearing the next spring .
Fairchild was somewhat disturbed by his success , as like others at the time , he regarded all plant species as created by God at the Creation , and feared the consequences of disturbing this natural order . When asked to show his dried plant to the Royal Society in 1720 , he fudged the story of its creation , claiming it was an accident .
He introduced Pavia rubra or red buckeye , Cornus florida , an American flowering dogwood , and other plants . He imported some plants from the Dutch growers , but was an early participant in the wave of introductions from the eastern seaboard of British America . Eventually he `` could boast that more than twenty species blossomed in his garden each December '' , then regarded as remarkable for England .
As a leading member of the community of scienticially-minded gardeners that was forming in London , he wrote The City Gardener ( 1722 ) , contributed to A Catalogue of Trees and Shrubs both Exotic and Domestic which are propagated for Sale in the Gardens near London , and may have written the anonymous A Treatise on the Manner of Fallowing Ground , Raising of Grass Seeds , and Training Lint and Hemp . He also read a paper to the Royal Society . He was sufficiently well known that his portrait by an unknown artist has been owned by what is now the Department of Plant Sciences , University of Oxford since the 18th century .
Life
Fairchild established himself about 1690 as a nurseryman and florist at Hoxton , Shoreditch , London , , where his nursery was only half an acre , but close to the City of London . Richard Bradley mentions the variety of his fruits ; Richard Pulteney classed him with Thomas Knowlton , Gordon , and Miller , as one of the leading gardeners of his time .
Fairchild died on 10 October 1729 . He had taken up the freedom of the Clothworkers ' Company in 1704 , and in his will he is described as citizen and clothworker . In accordance with his direction he was buried in a churchyard belonging to the parish of St. Leonard , Shoreditch ; on his monument he was said to have died in his sixty-third year . He left the bulk of his property to his nephew , John Bacon of Hoxton , who was a member of the Society of Gardeners , and died on 20 February 1737 , aged 25 . He also bequeathed £25 for an annual sermon on `` the wonderfull works of God in the Creation '' , which is still delivered , now at St Giles , Cripplegate , attended by the Worshipful Company of Gardeners .
Works
In 1722 he published the small book The City Gardener , devoted to a description of the trees , plants , shrubs , and flowers which would thrive best in London . Pear trees still bore excellent fruit about Barbican , Aldersgate , and Bishopsgate , that in 'Leicester Fields ' there was a vine producing good grapes every year , and that figs and mulberries throve very well in the city . The highest whitethorn in England , Fairchild wrote , was growing in an alley leading from Whitecross Street towards Bunhill Fields .
In 1724 Fairchild added to his reputation by a paper read before the Royal Society and afterwards printed in Philosophical Transactions ( xxxiii . 127 ) on 'Some new Experiments relating to the different and sometimes contrary Motion of the Sap in Plants and Trees . ' Besides these publications and letters which appeared in Bradley 's works , George William Johnson , in his History of English Gardening ( 1829 ) , ascribed to him A Treatise on the Manner of Fallowing Ground , Raising of Grass Seeds , and Training Lint and Hemp , which was printed anonymously .
About 1725 , a society of gardeners residing in London was established , and Fairchild joined it . Meeting every month at Newhall 's coffee-house in Chelsea or some similar place , they showed to each other plants of their own growing , which were examined and compared , the names and descriptions being afterwards entered in a register . After a time they decided to make known the results of their labours , and a volume was produced called A Catalogue of Trees and Shrubs both Exotic and Domestic which are propagated for Sale in the Gardens near London . It was illustrated by Jacob Van Huysum . The 'Catalogue ' has been attributed to Philip Miller , who was at one time secretary of the society ; but was indexed under Fairchild 's name at the British Museum .
Legacy
Apart from the annual `` Fairchild Sermon '' ( see above ) , Fairchild 's Garden remains as a public park near Columbia Road Market in Hoxton . Fairchild is honoured in the name of the Thomas Fairchild Community School , Shoreditch .

History
The Sumner Field Homes , constructed by the WPA in 1938 , were the first federally subsidized homes in Minnesota . The homes were demolished in 1998 , along with high-rise project housing buildings constructed in the 1960s and 1970s . According to the US Census ( 1 ) , the area experienced a 95.7 % population loss from 3,336 in 1990 to 144 in 2000 . Plans are in place to rebuild the area , re-incorporating it into surrounding street grids . Buildings following the `` New Urbanism '' style will mix affordable and market-rate units , and will replace the old project housing .
The new community , developed by McCormack Baron Salazar , was funded with HOPE VI grants . The community has been renamed Heritage Park , and includes mixed-income rental and owned units . One of the new streets in this development , Van White Memorial Boulevard , is named for Van Freeman White , the first African-American to serve on the Minneapolis City Council .
In addition to mixed-income rentals , the Heritage Park Master Association represents the owners of single-family houses , townhouses , and condominiums in the neighborhood .

George J. Hill is a Canadian retired ice hockey Center and coach who was an All-American for Michigan Tech .
Career
Hill burst onto the junior hockey scene in 1960 when he led the Brandon Wheat Kings to a first-place finish in the MJHL , winning the league scoring title , Rookie of the Year and MVP . Brandon won the league tournament and advanced all the way to the Abbott Cup final where they fell to the Edmonton Oil Kings 3–4 . Hill 's team had a near repeat performance the following year , this time losing to Edmonton 1–4 .
After two stellar junior seasons , Hill was recruited to Michigan Tech by John MacInnes . He played on the freshman team in 1962 and watched the varsity club win the program 's first National Championship . When his turn came , Hill performed just like he had as a junior player , leading the team in scoring and being named both the WCHA Sophomore of the Year and an All-American . The Huskies were unable to overcome North Dakota in the Conference semifinal and missed out on the national tournament . Despite only being a junior , Hill was named team captain the following year . While he produced nearly identical numbers , the team was n't as strong and limped into the conference tournament where they almost pulled off a sunning upset of Michigan , losing their two-game series 8–9 on aggregate .
Hill left after his second season and pursued a professional career , playing in several senior and minor leagues over the next eight years . He ended his career in Austria , helping Wiener EV to a runner-up finish in 1972 . He was inducted into the Michigan Tech Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 .

Harold Sanford `` Hal '' Kant ( July 29 , 1931 – October 19 , 2008 ) was an entertainment industry attorney who specialized in representing musical groups . He was best known for his 35 years as principal lawyer and general counsel for the Grateful Dead , a position in the group that was so strong that his business cards with the band identified his role as `` Czar '' .
Early life
Hal Kant was born in the Bronx . He earned his law degree at the Harvard Law School . After graduation , he was hired as a clerk in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco , California .
Music business
After starting to practice law on his own , he came to the realization that `` the only attorneys in the music business were the attorneys for the record companies , and their job was to get as much money as they could for their company and leave as little as possible for the artists '' . Kant decided that `` the other guys should have an attorney , too '' and proceeded to help represent a series of artists including The Association , Captain Beefheart , Hot Tuna , Janis Joplin , New Riders of the Purple Sage , Sonny & Cher and Stevie Ray Vaughan . He turned down an opportunity to represent The Doors after the group demanded that he only represent them .
Grateful Dead
Kant became best known for his representation of the Grateful Dead , bringing the band millions of dollars in revenue , through his management of the band 's intellectual property and merchandising rights . At Kant 's recommendation , the group was one of the few rock 'n roll pioneers to retain ownership of their music masters and publishing rights . Kant 's role with the band was so significant that his business cards with the band identified himself as `` Czar '' .
Kant had plans to donate his legal business records to a proposed Grateful Dead museum to be built in San Francisco . This venture did n't come into fruition so that his experience in the historical development of contracts and business practices could be used as a resource by visitors .
Poker
Kant won the $ 2,500 Pot Limit Omaha tournament at the 1987 World Series of Poker , earning a gold WSOP bracelet and $ 174,000 . He was the runner-up in the $ 2,500 Limit Hold'em tournament at the 1990 World Series of Poker . Kant would often have members of the Grateful Dead cheering for him at poker tournaments .
During his poker career , Kant had total live tournament winnings exceeding $ 1,100,000 . His 12 cashes as the WSOP account for $ 524,514 of those winnings .
Death
He died at age 77 in Reno , Nevada on October 19 , 2008 from pancreatic cancer . He was survived by his wife , Jesse , and his three sons , two stepchildren and five grandchildren .

Kennedy , with variant forms O'Kennedy and Kennedie , is a surname of Irish and Scottish origin that has also been used as a given name .
Origins
There have been several different etymologies given for the surname . One is that the name is an Anglicisation of Ó Cinnéide , meaning `` grandson of Cinnédidh '' or `` grandson of Cinnéidigh '' , with both of these personal names meaning `` helmet headed . '' Ceanéidigh could be related to the old Gaelic name Cennétig , which is known from Cennétig mac Lorcáin , the father of the Irish high king Brian mac Cennétig , who himself was also known as Brian Bóruma or Brian Boru . There are also an Irish Kennedy family and a Scottish Kennedy clan of Carrick in Ayrshire , which are unrelated to one another . Another possibility is that Kennedy is an Anglicisation of the Gaelic Ó Ceannéidigh meaning `` grandson of Ceannéidigh '' . Ceannéidigh is a given name derived from the Gaelic words ceann , meaning `` head '' , and éidigh , meaning `` ugly '' or `` fierce '' . In some etymologies , the element ceann is given as `` chief '' or `` leader '' .

USA-128 , also known as GPS IIA-18 , GPS II-27 and GPS SVN-30 , is an American navigation satellite which forms part of the Global Positioning System . It was the eighteenth of nineteen Block IIA GPS satellites to be launched .
Background
Global Positioning System ( GPS ) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to provide all-weather round-the-clock navigation capabilities for military ground , sea , and air forces . Since its implementation , GPS has also become an integral asset in numerous civilian applications and industries around the globe , including recreational used ( e.g. , boating , aircraft , hiking ) , corporate vehicle fleet tracking , and surveying . GPS employs 24 spacecraft in 20,200 km circular orbits inclined at 55.0° . These vehicles are placed in 6 orbit planes with four operational satellites in each plane .
GPS Block 2 was the operational system , following the demonstration system composed of Block 1 ( Navstar 1 - 11 ) spacecraft . These spacecraft were 3-axis stabilized , nadir pointing using reaction wheels . Dual solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power . They used S-band ( SGLS ) communications for control and telemetry and Ultra high frequency ( UHF ) cross-link between spacecraft . The payload consisted of two L-band navigation signals at 1575.42 MHz ( L1 ) and 1227.60 MHz ( L2 ) . Each spacecraft carried 2 rubidium and 2 Cesium clocks and nuclear detonation detection sensors . Built by Rockwell Space Systems for the U.S. Air force , the spacecraft measured 5.3 m across with solar panels deployed and had a design life of 7.5 years .
Launch
USA-128 was launched at 08:49:00 UTC on 12 September 1996 , atop a Delta II launch vehicle , flight number D238 , flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration . The launch took place from Launch Complex 17A ( LC-17A ) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ( CCAFS ) , and placed USA-128 into a transfer orbit . The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37XFP apogee motor .
Mission
On 17 October 1996 , USA-128 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 717.94 minutes , and 54.7° of inclination to the equator . It broadcasts the PRN 30 signal , and operates in slot 2 of plane B of the GPS constellation . The satellite has a mass of . It had a design life of 7.5 years , and was decommissioned on 20 July 2011 .

The Tahiti monarch ( Pomarea nigra ) , or Tahiti flycatcher , is a rare species of bird in the monarch flycatcher family . It is endemic to Tahiti in French Polynesia . There are between 25 and 100 individuals remaining with an increasing population trend .
Taxonomy and systematics
The Tahiti monarch was originally described in the genus Muscicapa . Formerly , the Maupiti monarch was considered as a subspecies of the Tahiti monarch until re-classified as separate species in 2012 .
Description
This bird is 15 centimeters long and black in color with a pale blue bill . The juvenile is reddish brown . The call sounds like tick-tick-tick and the song is `` flute-like '' .
Distribution and habitat
This bird is found in only four valleys in Tahiti . It lives in the canopy and understory in forests among mara trees ( Neonauclea forsteri ) .
Threats
Threats to the species include the degradation of its forest habitat by the invasion of exotic plant species , including Miconia calvescens and Spathodea campanulata . The forest is also degraded by goat activity . Predation by rats and cats is a threat . The Tahiti kingfisher ( Todiramphus veneratus ) is a competitor .

During the mid-1980s , Huaman earned a special denomination after an active cooperation at Universitäts Frauenklinik , Kiel , Germany , on pioneer work with laparoscopic appendectomy . Huaman devoted his life to research on health issues related to social and ethical issues in tropical environments , while he was most deeply concerned with the study of the development and proliferation of tropical diseases related to conditions of extreme poverty .
Huaman advised governments in health strategies to prevent epidemics in Europe and Latin America . From 1968 to 1975 he was involved in policy development and general strategy for social development programs . He was a key player in the creation of social programs for community health systems in Ecuador , Peru and Chile in the late 1960s . Huaman lectured in several Peruvian , Andean and European socialist universities , including Universidad Federico Villarreal , Universidad de Compostela , Universidad de San Marcos and Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg .

Mulligan Stew is an American children 's educational television series , produced and sponsored by the USDA Extension Service and its youth outreach program , 4-H .
Taking its name from the hobo dish , Mulligan Stew aired in syndication beginning in the fall of 1972 and continued in reruns on public television into the early 80s .
The six-episode series follows the adventures of a group of five school-age musicians and their mentor , all dedicated to teaching others about good nutrition and developing healthier eating habits . The series , along with various educational materials including a companion comic book with additional adventures of the characters , was developed by the Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Service .
Overview
The series centers on the humorous adventures of a group of five school-aged kids who are all members of a rock band called `` Mulligan Stew '' ( also referred to as the `` Stews '' or the `` Mulligan Stew Force '' ) .
The band members are :
Mulligan ( Larry Friedman ) , the leader ; occasionally plays guitar
Maggie ( Sherry Wright ) , identified by her long blond pigtailed hair ; keyboards
Mike ( Steven Einbender ) , an Italian ; drums
Manny ( Benjamin Sands ) , a Black preteen ; bass
Micki ( Mi-On Hahm ) , a young Asian girl ; guitar
( Mulligan , Maggie and Micki all sing lead vocals on most of the band 's songs while Mike and Manny usually handle backing vocals . ) The group 's clubhouse is a basement in a brownstone apartment , fully furnished with a kitchen , shortwave radio , home gym , laboratory , and even a small stage where they rehearse their music .
Their grownup advisor and mentor is Wilbur Dooright ( Barry Michlin ) , a bespectacled , bumbling accountant who , in some episodes , gives the kids their assignments `` from upstairs '' , assumed to be a secret governmental organization ( paying homage to the spy films and TV shows of the day ) . Wilbur provides much of the comic relief throughout the series .
`` 4-4-3-2 '' balanced diet message
An integral and ubiquitous part of the program 's message was the `` 4-4-3-2 '' balanced diet program , part of the standard USDA nutrition guidelines/recommendations promoted during the 1960s and 1970s . The use of dietary supplements was strongly discouraged ; it was taught that all nutritional needs , including the proper intake of vitamins , minerals , fats and carbohydrates , could be adequately obtained solely by adhering to a balanced diet , with appropriate servings from the `` basic four '' food groups . This message was enthusiastically repeated by the children several times per episode . ( The `` basic four '' food groups were updated by USDA in subsequent decades by the 1990s-era `` Food Guide Pyramid '' and the current `` MyPlate '' nutritional guidelines program . )
Production and development
Mulligan Stew was developed in early 1971 by the USDA Extension Service , and filmed by the USDA Motion Picture Service ( which for many years prior produced educational cinematic films and TV programs for public viewing ) . Mulligan Stew was developed based on plan and design proposals by Developmental Committees , Iowa State University Extension Service 4-H Nutrition Television Programs . The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program ( EFNEP ) provided a grant to produce the series . ( 4-H is the official youth outreach and development program of the land-grant universities ' Cooperative Extension Services and USDA . )
The target audience of the program was older elementary school students , fourth through sixth grade .
Eleanor Wilson , the national 4-H TV coordinator at the time , was tapped to be the series ' technical advisor . Wilson subcontracted with Iowa State University to develop an outline of educational concepts for the series . USDA Extension then hired Ira Klugerman to direct the series . Klugerman , who came from a background of children 's television at WQED in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , came up with the title and general treatment for the series . V. `` Buddy '' Renfro was the credited producer .
Production began on location in southeast Washington , DC in 1971 ( the opening sequence was filmed at RFK Stadium ) . Other filming locations included major production partner Michigan State University 's home base of Lansing , Michigan , and on location for one episode at Johnson Space Center in Houston . The low budget of the project proved to be a significant challenge , as well as the unique challenges of working with child actors .
The producers wanted the style of the series to reflect trends begun in other popular and innovative TV shows such as Sesame Street and Laugh-In . Puppetry and animation were frequently used . Sometimes one or two of the kids would conduct `` man-on-the-street '' interviews , asking ordinary citizens about nutrition-related topics . All of the music , including the theme song and the various songs sung by the kids during an episode ( many times in musical `` romps '' reminiscent of the ones seen on The Monkees TV series ) , were composed and arranged by Washington , DC musician and recording engineer Paul Brier , and performed by a rock combo credited on screen as `` The Eye '' .
Mulligan Stew premiered on October 4 , 1972 , during the National 4-H Week at the National 4-H Center in Washington , DC . The program was considered a success , especially by previous standards for television outreach sponsored by 4-H . The series had a moderate impact on kids making better choices in what they ate , and provided 4-H with a sizable marketing , promotional and public relations boost . Thanks in part to the popularity of Mulligan Stew , 4-H membership was boosted to an all-time high in 1974 , and continued to air in reruns on public television until 1981 .
Episode list
Guest appearances
Several celebrities or future celebrities made uncredited appearances , either as part of the main storyline or in brief segments ; among these were Richard Sanders who later gained fame playing Les Nessman on WKRP in Cincinnati . Ordinary citizens were interviewed by the kids in selected segments of some episodes in a `` man on the street '' format .
Larry Friedman ( Mulligan ) performed in the musical Rasputin with Ted Neeley and John Hurt .
Mion Hahm ( Micki ) is a realtor in Florida .
Steve Einbender ( Mike ) is Senior Manager of Customer Analytics for The Home Depot , in Atlanta , Georgia . He still plays drums .
Benjamin Sands ( Manny ) is a music teacher in the Washington , D.C. area .
Sherry Wright ( Maggie ) pursued an acting and singing career while living in Alexandria , Virginia ; she died in July 2009 .
Barry Michlin ( Wilbur ) had a number of minor roles throughout the 1970s and 1980s , and also made recurring appearances in several TV commercials including for Arm & Hammer Baking Soda with actress Beverly Sanders . He is a photographer based in Los Angeles .

Burgos Airport ( )
, also known as Villafría , is an airport located east of the historic center of Burgos , a city in Spain . The company Aeronova has its maintenance headquarters in Villafría .
History
The origins of Villafría aerodrome date back to the 1920s , when a small aeronautical detachment was established in Gamonal , which served its purpose until it became too small to cope with the progress in aeronautics . After this , the government of King Alfonso XIII created the national Villafría Burgos airport by Royal Decree on 19 July 1927 . On 3 January 1928 , the Cabinet approved the construction of Burgos airport and , on the 15th of the same month , Villafría Town Hall agreed to cede the field called Gorreñal to the Superior Council of Military Aeronautics for the airport to be built there . As from 1936 , the fields of Gamonal and Villafría joined their facilities , which went on to form a single aeronautical infrastructure .
On 8 August 1941 , Burgos City Hall agreed to purchase a country estate of almost that formed part of the old Monte de Gamonal . On 10 November , the mayor offered this land to the Air Ministry . On 6 December , a decree granted the urgent installation of services and work to be carried out on the fields that it was trying to link .
In fact , the Air Ministry was founded in Burgos after the civil war , when the Military Aeronautical Service forces created by King Alfonso XIII in 1910 were modernised . These , in turn , were inherited from the Military Service Air Station , that belonged at the time to the Military Engineering Corp , established by the same monarch .
On 21 July 1949 , the University Air Militia began its activities , after which 22 classes would form in its facilities , the offices of the latter being handed over in 1971 . Villafría airdrome was opened to civil traffic in the autumn of that year . In 1973 , what is now the Burgos Royal Flying Club was set up . Since then , and during the summer , the airport has hosted different teaching and training activities .
In August 1995 , the Ministry of Defence signed an agreement with Burgos City Council making the Villafría aerodrome facilities exclusively for civil use . On 20 October 2000 , the aerodrome was declared a site of general interest , directly managed by the central government , through Aena .
On 3 July 2008 , the airport opened its doors to commercial flight operations . In order to do this , Aena has undertaken a series of measures , including the construction of a new terminal building with parking facilities , a multi-service building , a new runway and an aircraft parking apron .
Airlines and destinations
As of April 2022 , Burgos Airport is not served by any scheduled flights .
Statistics
Ground transportation
Public transport
There is an urban bus that provides airport service to and from the center of Burgos . The route begins in Plaza de España and stops in the following streets : Belorado , Segovia , Avenida de Castilla y León , San Roque , Glorieta de Logroño , San Bruno , Pablo Ruiz Picasso , Real y Antigua , Vitoria 252 , Alcalde Martín Cobos and from here to the airport terminal . The route from the airport to the center will be on a reverse route with stops in the next points : Martín Cobos , Vitoria 259 , Real y Antigua , Vitoria 163 , San Bruno , Antigua Academia de Ingenieros , San Roque , Avenida de Castilla y León , Avenida de la Paz 51 , Antonio Machado and Plaza de España .
The route schedules depend on the time of the flight ; the bus will depart from Plaza España to the airport an hour and one-half before a flight and from the airport to the center one-half hour after the arrival of a flight .
Car and taxi
Burgos Airport is located to the north east of the province capital city , on a broad plain between the neighbourhoods of Gamonal and Villafría de Burgos , where the N-120 road and A-1 highway ( also called ring road BU-30 ) meet in a great roundabout . From here to the airport building , there is a long road that ends opposite the terminal building . It takes a 10 minutes ride by car or taxi to get to the city centre . A taxi ride costs approximately €10 or slightly more .
There is a parking garage with a capacity of 188 cars , some semi-underground , for passengers coming with their own car .

Gazeuse ! ( French for 'Sparkling ! ' , 'Fizzy ! ' or 'Effervescent ! ' ) is the seventh album released under the name Gong and the de facto debut album by Pierre Moerlen 's Gong . It was released in late 1976 . The title was changed to Expresso for the U.S. release .
The album features an all-instrumental jazz-driven sound , notable for the prominent use of vibraphone , and has little to do with the psychedelic space rock of Daevid Allen 's Gong , even though the two bands share a common history . Although the album was issued by Virgin Records under the `` Gong '' name for contractual reasons , and the name `` Pierre Moerlen 's Gong '' would not be adopted for a couple of years , the lineup involved and the nature of the music are that of the Moerlen-led band .
Writing credits are split between Moerlen and guitarist Allan Holdsworth , except for the final track , which is by early Magma and Flying Teapot bassist Francis Moze .

John Davies ( died 25 July 1918 ) was a Welsh politician and trade unionist , who served as Mayor of Merthyr .
Born in Hirwaun , Davies left at the age of eight to attend school in Newchurch . Four years later , he returned to live with his father in Hirwaun , and began working at a local coal mine . He became active in the local trade union , the Aberdare , Merthyr and Dowlais Miners ' Association , and when he was 27 he was elected to its executive committee . He was proposed at a workers ' meeting as a labour candidate in the October 1888 Merthyr by-election , but he refused the nomination .
In 1895 , Davies was elected to represent the Aberdare miners on the Sliding Scale Committee , which determined their wages . He became regarded at the deputy to local miners ' agent David Morgan , and during the Welsh coal strike of 1898 collected donations from miners in North Wales and South Staffordshire . At the end of the strike , he was one of four miners ' representatives who refused to sign an agreement .
After the strike , the South Wales Miners ' Federation ( SWMF ) was established , and the local union was split into three districts . Davies was elected to the first executive committee of the SWMF . Soon after , he won election as full-time miners ' agent for the Dowlais District , relocating to the area , and remained in the post until his death .
In the late 19th-century , Davies spent eighteen months on the Aberdare School Board . He was elected to represent Dowlais on the Glamorgan County Council in an 1899 by-election , as a Liberal-Labour candidate . He was made an alderman in 1905 , but stood down in 1908 , when Merthyr was made into a county borough . He was elected to Merthyr 's first council , again representing Dowlais , and in 1914/15 , he served as Mayor of Merthyr . He was the second worker to become Mayor of Merthyr , after Enoch Morrell .
Davies was a deacon at the Bethania Congregational Chapel , and advocated abstinence from alcohol .
In an obituary , the Merthyr Pioneer noted that Dowlais `` may have more brilliant leaders in future – it will never have courageous , straightforward , or simple leader ; a leader whose ideal of leadership was to be the spokesman of his class and kind , and not the exponent who marched ahead preaching the gospel as he conceived it should be spoken by the mob '' .

The McMinnville UFO photographs , also known as the Trent UFO photos , were taken by a farming couple , Paul and Evelyn Trent near McMinnville , Oregon , United States on May 11 , 1950 . The photos were reprinted in Life magazine and in newspapers across the nation , and are often considered to be among the most famous photographs ever taken of a UFO . UFO skeptics consider these photographs a hoax , although many ufologists continue to argue that the photos actually depict a genuine three dimensional unidentified flying objects in the sky .
Although these images have become known as the `` McMinnville UFO Photographs '' , the Trent farm was actually just outside Sheridan , Oregon , approximately nine miles ( 15 km ) southwest of McMinnville , which was the nearest larger town .
According to astronomer William K. Hartmann 's account , on 11 May 1950 at 7:30 p.m. , Evelyn Trent was walking back to her farmhouse after feeding her caged rabbits . Before reaching the house , she noticed a slow-moving , metallic disk-shaped object heading in her direction from the northeast . She yelled for her husband , Paul , who was inside the house ; he claimed that upon leaving the house , he also saw the object . After watching the object for a short time , he went back inside their home to obtain a camera ; he said he managed to take two photos of the object before it sped away to the west . Paul Trent 's father also claimed he briefly viewed the object before it flew away .
Hartmann 's version of the incident traces back to an interview the Trents gave to Lou Gillette , host of the radio station KMCM ( later KLYC ) , and quoted in The Oregonian newspaper on 10 June 1950 . However , the Trents had given a slightly different version of the incident to the local McMinnville newspaper , the Telephone Register , two days earlier on 8 June 1950 . In that version , Evelyn Trent stated `` We 'd been out in the back yard . Both of us saw the object at the same time . The camera ! Paul thought it was in the car but I was sure it was in the house . I was right—and the Kodak was loaded with film ... ''
Initial publicity
The roll of film in the Trent 's camera was not entirely used up , so the Trents did not have the film developed immediately . The film was not developed until the remaining frames were used in shooting family photographs for Mother 's Day , Sunday , 14 May 1950 .
In a 1997 interview , the Trents claimed that they initially thought the object they had photographed was a secret military aircraft , and feared the `` photos might bring them trouble . '' When he mentioned his sighting and photographs to his banker , Frank Wortmann , the banker was intrigued enough to display them from his bank window in McMinnville .
Shortly afterwards Bill Powell , a local newspaper reporter , convinced Mr. Trent to loan him the negatives . Powell examined the negatives and found no evidence that they were tampered with or faked . On June 8 , 1950 , Powell 's story of the incident—accompanied by the two photos—was published as a front-page story in the McMinnville Telephone-Register . The headline read : `` At Long Last—Authentic Photographs Of Flying Saucer [ ? ] ''
The story and photos were subsequently picked up by the International News Service ( INS ) and sent to other newspapers around the nation , thus giving them wide publicity . Life magazine published cropped versions of the photos on June 26 , 1950 , along with a photo of Trent and his camera . The Trents had been promised that the negatives would be returned to them ; however , they were not returned—Life magazine told the Trents that it had misplaced the negatives .
Condon Committee investigation
In 1967 , the negatives of the Trent photos were found in the files of the United Press International ( UPI ) , the news service which had merged with INS years earlier . The negatives were then loaned to Dr. William K. Hartmann , an astronomer who was working as an investigator for the Condon Committee , a government-funded UFO research project based at the University of Colorado Boulder . The Trents were not immediately informed that their `` lost '' negatives had been found . Hartmann interviewed the Trents and was impressed by their sincerity ; the Trents apparently never asked for any money for their photos , nor could he find any evidence that they had sought any notoriety from them .
In Hartmann 's analysis , he wrote to the Condon Committee that `` This is one of the few UFO reports in which all factors investigated , geometric , psychological , and physical , appear to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary flying object , silvery , metallic , disk-shaped , tens of meters in diameter , and evidently artificial , flew within sight of two witnesses . ''
One reason for this conclusion was due to the photometric analysis of the images . Hartmann noted that the brightness of the underside of the object appeared to be lighter than the underside of the oil tank seen in the images . This could be due to the effects of atmospheric extinction and scattering , the same effects that make distant mountains appear `` washed out '' and blue . This effect suggested the objects were further from the camera than the tank , not small , local objects . ''
Hartmann did , however , also point out the possibility that the images were manufactured . He noted that `` The object appears beneath a pair of wires , as is seen in Plates 23 and 24 . We may question , therefore , whether it could have been a model suspended from one of the wires . This possibility is strengthened by the observation that the object appears beneath roughly the same point in the two photos , in spite of their having been taken from two positions . '' and concludes `` These tests do not rule out the possibility that the object was a small model suspended from the nearby wire by an unresolved thread . ''
Hartmann also noticed a discrepancy that would later become the main point of objection for later skeptics . He noticed that the overall lighting of the image was consistent with the lighting that would be expected around sunset , but noted that `` There could be a possible discrepancy in view of the fact that the UFO , the telephone pole , possibly the garage at the left , and especially the distant house gables ( left of the distant barn ) are illuminated from the right , or east . The house , in particular , appears to have a shadow under its roof that would suggest a daylit photo , and combined with the eastward incidence , one could argue that the photos were taken on a dull , sunlit day at , say , 10 a.m . ''
After Hartmann concluded his investigation he returned the negatives to UPI , which then informed the Trents . In 1970 , the Trents asked Philip Bladine , the editor of the News-Register ( the successor of the Telephone-Register ) , for the negatives ; the Trents noted that they had never been paid for the negatives and thus wanted them back . Bladine asked UPI to return the negatives , which it did . However , for some reason , Bladine did not inform the Trents that the negatives had been returned .
Maccabee analysis
In 1975 , the negatives were found in the files of the News-Register by Bruce Maccabee , an optical physicist for the U.S. Navy and a ufologist . After completing his own study of the photos , Maccabee ensured that the original negatives were finally returned to the Trents .
Maccabee analyzed the photos and concluded that the photographs were not hoaxed and showed a `` real , physical '' object in the sky above the Trent farm . Much of his analysis is based on densitometric measurements , similar to the photometric analysis done by Hartmann . Maccabee argued that the brightness of the object 's underside suggested it was at some distance from the camera , not a smaller object close to it .
Maccabee also analyzed the position of various objects in the image as well as an image prepared by Hartmann when he visited the site in June 1967 . Based on this , Maccabee argued that the line-of-sight of the two images intersected some distance behind the power lines seen in the photos , providing further evidence , in his opinion , that it was not a small model suspended from the lines . Maccabee stated that his analysis of the object did not find any evidence of a thread or string suspending it from the power lines .
In reply to the skeptical arguments that shadows on objects in the photos proved that they were taken in the morning rather than in the early evening , as the Trents had claimed , Maccabee argued that cloud conditions in the McMinnville area on the evening of the sighting could have caused the shadows on the garage . He also stated , in response to the 2013 IPACO photoanalysis that concluded the photos were a hoax , that `` regarding [ their ] photogrammetric analysis , I showed that the sighting lines did not cross under the wires and they did not refute this ... I still stand on my original work . ''
Suggested hoax explanation
In the 1980s , journalists and noted UFO skeptics Philip J. Klass and Robert Sheaffer , stated their opinions that the photos were faked , and that the entire event was a hoax .
Their primary argument stated that shadows on a garage on the left-hand side of the photos proved that the photos were taken in the morning rather than in the early evening , as the Trents had claimed . Klass and Sheaffer argued that since the Trents had apparently lied about the time of day the photos were taken , their entire story was thus suspect . They also claimed that the Trents had shown an interest in UFOs prior to their alleged sighting .
Additionally , their analysis of the photos suggested that the object photographed was small and likely a model hanging from power lines visible at the top of the photos . They also believed the object may have been the detached side-view mirror of a vehicle . The object has a shape that is very similar to the round mirrors that were used on Ford vehicles for decades , or similar models on almost all vehicles of the era .
Klass also claimed to have found a number of contradictions in the Trents ' story of the sighting , and noted that their version of the incident changed over the years . His conclusion was that the Trents had fabricated the event .
After Sheaffer sent his research and conclusions to William Hartmann , Hartmann withdrew his previous positive assessment of the case which had been forwarded to the Condon Committee .
In April 2013 , three researchers with IPACO posted two studies to their Web site titled `` Back to McMinnville pictures '' and `` Evidence of a suspension thread . '' They argued that the geometry of the photographs is most consistent with a small model with a hollow bottom hanging from a wire suspended from the power lines above , and they stated that they had detected the presence of a thread above the object . Their conclusion was that `` the clear result of this study was that the McMinnville UFO was a model hanging from a thread . ''
Aftermath
The McMinnville UFO photographs remain among the best-publicized in UFO history . Skeptics continue to explain the two photographs as being hoaxes and/or fakes . Ufologists continue to argue that the Trent photos are credible evidence that UFOs are a real , physical phenomenon . The Trents have consistently been described as honest , simple farm folk who never attempted to profit from their photographs , nor the notoriety they brought them . Evelyn Trent died in 1997 and Paul Trent in 1998 ; both insisted until the end of their lives that the sighting , and the photos , were genuine . The interest surrounding the Trent UFO photos led to an annual `` UFO Festival '' being established in McMinnville ; it is now the largest such gathering in the Pacific Northwest , and is the second-largest UFO festival in the nation after the one held in Roswell , New Mexico .

Ralph Arthur Warburton ( January 7 , 1924 − December 25 , 2021 ) was an American ice hockey right wing , and was a member of the United States national team at the 1948 Winter Olympics .
Playing career
College career
Warburton played right wing for Dartmouth College , he became part of a powerhouse line for Dartmouth with eventual Olympic teammates , Bruce Mather at center and Bruce Cunliffe on left wing . This line not only led Dartmouth in scoring for two seasons , but helped Dartmouth achieve a remarkable 46-game unbeaten streak ( 45-0-1 ) from 1941–42 to 1944–45 . Warburton set a career high for points in a single game on January 20 , 1945 , as he registered 7 points against Cornell University , with five goals and two assists . For the 1946–47 season Warburton was named co-captain of the team . During this season he added two more four-goal performances against Army and Boston College . The two high scoring games came in close succession , with the first occurring on February 8 , 1946 , and the second coming just three days later on February 11 , 1946 . Dartmouth ended the 1946–47 season as the number one ranked team in the nation . The number one ranking was more significant at the time , since it was prior to the advent of NCAA hockey championships .
1948 Olympics
In 1948 , Warburton headed to St. Moritz , Switzerland to take part in the Olympic Games with his fellow line mates . Unfortunately due to a conflict over what truly constituted an amateur athlete , two United States teams were sent . It was a situation that nearly caused the cancellation of the entire ice hockey tournament at the 1948 Olympics . Eventually a compromise was made and Warburton 's squad was allowed to compete , but were ineligible for medal contention .
Later career
He continued to play hockey after the Olympics first with the Milwaukee Clarks and later was reunited with Bruce Mather on the Boston Olympics . Warburton 's best post-college year came during the 1950–51 season while playing for the Olympics in the Eastern Hockey League . In that year Warburton finished in the top ten in all three major offensive statistical categories . He ranked second in goals ( 33 ) , tenth in assists ( 30 ) , and sixth in points ( 63 ) .
Personal life and death
Warburton was born in Cranston , Rhode Island , on January 7 , 1924 . He died on December 25 , 2021 , at the age of 97 . At age 94 , he was honored by the Rhode Island Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018 with the Malcolm Greene Chace Award for `` Lifetime contributions of a Rhode Islander to the game of ice hockey '' . He was inducted as an honored member of the Rhode Island Hockey Hall of Fame in 2022 .

The Santebal ( , ; meaning `` keeper of peace '' ) was the secret police of the Khmer Rouge 's Democratic Kampuchea ( DK ) regime in Cambodia .
The Santebal was in charge of internal security and running prison camps like Tuol Sleng ( S-21 ) where thousands of people were imprisoned , interrogated , tortured and executed . It was part of the Khmer Rouge organizational structure well before the Fall of Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975 . Its name is an amalgam of two words : sântĕsŏkh ( ) meaning `` security '' and nôkôrbal ( ) meaning `` police '' .
History
As early as 1971 , the Khmer Rouge or the Communist Party of Kampuchea established the Special Zone outside of Phnom Penh under the direction of Vorn Vet and Son Sen. Sen , later the Deputy Minister for Defense of Democratic Kampuchea , was also in charge of the Santebal , and in that capacity he appointed Comrade Duch to run its security apparatus . Most of the Santebal 's deputies , such as Comrade Chan and Comrade Pon ( Chan 's deputy ) , hailed from Kampong Thom , Duch 's home province .
When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975 , Duch moved his headquarters to Phnom Penh and reported directly to Sen. At that time , a small chapel in the capital was used to incarcerate the regime 's prisoners , who totaled fewer than two hundred . In May 1976 , Duch moved his headquarters to its final location , a former high school known as Tuol Sleng , which could hold up to 1,500 prisoners . It was at Tuol Sleng that the major purges of the Khmer Rouge cadres took place and thousands of prisoners were tortured and killed . Between 1976 and 1978 , 20,000 Cambodians were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng . Of this number only seven adults are known to have survived . However , Tuol Sleng was only one of at least 150 execution centres in the country .

Yaesu FT-7 is a rugged , solid state and modular built HF amateur-band radio transceiver , suitable for fixed and for mobile operation . The set was built by the Yaesu Corporation in Japan in the late 1970s and early 1980s . Its first Japanese release was in 1976 . This transceiver was very small for its time ; by current modern standards however it is a large mobile set . It is a low-power ( QRP ) SSB and CW transceiver of which transmitting power is adjustable up from 10 to about 20 W .
In 1979 its somewhat upgraded successor – the Yaesu FT-7B – was released and as of 1980 this rig was also sold on the European market . FT-7B has fully extended 10 m band coverage in four 500 kHz segments ( this was limited to a single 500 kHz segments in the original FT-7 version ) . The FT-7B also offers Amplitude Modulation ( AM ) mode . Its transmitting output is adjustable from 5 to 50 W maximum by an integrated 50 W power amplifier using two 2SC2099 final transistors . It is also equipped with a noise blanker and an RF attenuator .
In Europe the sets were imported by the Swiss firm Sommerkamp and sold as Sommerkamp FT-7 ( B ) .
Technical description
Solid state receive and transmit operating in single conversion configuration with premix heterodyne techniques reducing signal distortion in transmit and receive mode . The incoming signal goes via an antenna relay , tuning circuit , to a RF amplifier , passband tuning unit and mixer . The signal is filtered and fed to the audio amplifier and translated into a 3 W audio signal . The outgoing signal is going from the microphone via the modulator / demodulator unit to a filter . Then it is amplified and heterodyned , mixed and fed to the final amplifier .

Hypomesus pretiosus , or surf smelt , is a marine smelt with a range from Prince William Sound , Alaska to Long Beach , California , although its population declines south of San Francisco . The surf smelt grows to be about 10 inches in southern waters , and 8 inches in northern waters near Canada . On average , surf smelt weigh about 10 to the pound .
Spawning occurs in the nighttime , which is why it is sometimes called the night smelt , peaking in the months from May to October . With a maximum age of three to four years , some females will spawn at the age of one , and all will spawn at the age of two . Females lay from 1,500-30,000 sticky eggs in the surf zone per spawn , which they may do three to five or more times in a season .
H. pretiosus feed on polychaete worms , larval fish and jellyfish , but they primarily feed on small crustaceans . They can be important parts of salmon and halibut diets , and are the most economically important fish among California smelts . Around 225,000 kilograms are harvested there every year .

The diocese of Teurnia ( or Tiburnia ) was a Chalcedonian Christian church in the Roman province of Noricum during the 5th through 7th centuries . It is today a titular see in the Catholic Church .
Ancient diocese
There was a Christian population in Teurnia by the 4th century . Several Norican bishops—not identified by see—attended the council of Serdica in 343 . They were of the Chalcedonian persuasion and subject to the ecclesiastical province of Aquileia . The first identifiable church , the Friedhofskirche , was built shortly after 400 . Another church was built in the refuge castle , and the whole diocese of Teurnia was dotted with such castles .
A bishopric existed at Teurnia at least from the time of Severinus of Noricum ( active in Noricum in 460–482 ) , as attested in Eugippius 's Vita sancti Severini ( 511 ) . The cathedral was probably the church on the Holzerberg . There are numerous references to bishops of Teurnia from the 6th century . It is unclear if the bishop of Teurnia was the metropolitan archbishop of the province of Noricum Mediterraneum , of which Teurnia was the metropolis , or even if he was the metropolitan of both Noricums .
In 473 , Severinus warned the bishop of Teurnia , Paulinus , of a coming barbarian attack , allowing the bishop to organize the defence of his city . Around 540 , Teurnia was under Frankish control and a Frankish bishop was appointing priests there . The last mention of the city and diocese of Teurnia is from 591 in a letter of the Venetic and Rhaetic bishops .
